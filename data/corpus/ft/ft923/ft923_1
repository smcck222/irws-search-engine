FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Gota Bank parent seeks receiver

GOTA AB, the Swedish holding company which owns Gota Bank, the country's
fourth largest commercial bank, declared yesterday that it was bankrupt with
debts totalling SKr5bn. The group's board said that the whole of its share
capital had been exhausted and it was applying to the courts for a receiver.
It suspended all payments to creditors on September 16.
However, the board's decision will not affect Gota Bank which will continue
to operate normally after the Swedish government guaranteed on September 9
to meet the bank's obligations. Mr Bo Lundgren, the minister responsible for
financial institutions, emphasised that the bank's customers would not be
injured by the collapse of Gota AB. 'The government's earlier commitments to
meet Gota Bank's obligations remain in force.'
Mr Per Lundberg, Gota Bank's chief executive, said negotiations were going
on with the Finance Ministry to reach an agreement on the bank's future.
But the bankruptcy of the holding company will bring substantial losses of
SKr1.5bn (Dollars 275m) to its chief shareholder, Trygg-Hansa SPP, the
insurance conglomerate, while many large Swedish companies and other banks
risk losing about SKr1.5bn in loans and other financial support.
The group's fate was sealed over the past few days when it became clear that
the Swedish state would not extend its guarantee to cover the holding
company.
Yesterday, Gota Bank announced an operating deficit of SKr2.5bn for the
first eight months of the year compared with SKr966m loss for the same
period of last year - mainly due to a substantial growth of about SKr5bn in
its credit losses. The bank expects to make an operating loss in 1992 of
between SKr3bn and SKr4bn with credit losses totalling SKr8bn for the year.

RELIANCE Industries, India's second-largest company and the first to make an
international equity offering, yesterday announced an 11.2 per cent rise in
turnover to a record Rs23.4bn (Dollars 8.3bn) for the year to March, up from
Rs21.04bn a year earlier.
The textile and petrochemical company's operating profits advanced 18.7 per
cent to Rs3.55bn from Rs2.99bn a year earlier, and net profits rose 30 per
cent to Rs1.63bn from Rs1.25bn.
Reliance claimed it continued to be among India's six largest
manufacturer-exporters, with exports of Rs810m in total.
Reliance this summer became the first Indian company to tap international
equity capital markets with a Dollars 100m issue of global depository
receipts (GDRs) through Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank. The GDRs are
traded on over-the-counter markets in Hong Kong, London and New York.
The issue caused controversy when the share price fell sharply immediately
after the offering, caused by Bombay's stock market scandal.
Reliance, one of India's most aggressive companies, has set an ambitious
target of reaching turnover of Rs100bn in 1995 - a five-fold increase on
last year's result.
Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, the group's 60-year-old founder, has struck deals with
international partners including C. Itoh, the Japanese trading group, to set
up a 6m tonne oil refinery in western India at an estimated cost of Rs30bn.
Reliance Industries' net asset value at the year-end was Rs19.43bn and its
paid-up capital, Rs2.32bn.
In March, Reliance was expanded by the merger with Reliance Petrochemicals,
its associate. The move was intended to give Reliance more leverage to raise
funds from the capital markets ahead of its international equity offer.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daihatsu Motor forecasts Y5bn
pre-tax deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIHATSU Motor, the Japanese commercial vehicle and carmaker, yesterday
forecast a pre-tax loss of Y5bn (Dollars 41.8m) for the year to the end of
March. It would be the first loss reported by the Toyota Motor-affiliate
since it was listed in 1949.
The company's plight results from its confidence that the unusually strong
car sales growth of the late 1980s would continue into the 1990s. Like other
Japanese carmakers, it built a production facility that has been left
under-utilised by a downturn in the market.
Daihatsu, and the rest of the Japanese car industry, will be under extra
pressure because of the yen's recent sharp appreciation. About 23 per cent
of Daihatsu's sales come from exports, and the stronger yen is likely to
trim export margins and growth.
Having specialised in mini-vehicles, cars with engine displacement of a
maximum 660cc, Daihatsu has been hurt by a 6.2 per cent first-quarter fall
in these models, compared with the same period last year, and a 12.5 per
cent slide in the second quarter.
Last year, the carmaker reported pre-tax profits of Y4.6bn, down from Y13bn.
Yesterday, it said the first-half and full-year loss would be Y5bn. It
revised downwards its full-year sales forecast from Y820bn to Y800bn.
The company is fortunate to have the backing of Toyota, which has
commissioned it to produce compact cars, but Daihatsu still faces a
continuing fall in its main market. In August, sales of mini-cars were down
12.3 per cent on the same month last year.
Daihatsu has already re-duced executive salaries and transferred
administrative staff to the sales force. It announced yesterday that the
two-shift operation at its Ikeda plant will be reduced to one shift until
the market improves.
Japanese carmakers were forced by the turmoil in financial markets to tap
cash reserves to fund the construction of new facilities, and Daihatsu's
reserves fell by almost two-thirds last year, reducing its interest income
this year.
Makers of mini-cars say the market has been bruised by tougher parking
legislation introduced a year ago to reduce congestion in Tokyo and Osaka.
Until then, mini-cars were exempt from a requirement that a new car
purchaser have an off-street parking space.
The mini-car market was encouraged in 1990 by an expansion of the allowable
engine size from 550cc to 660cc, but even then Daihatsu missed a gear
change, as the company failed to pick a shift in demand towards luxury
mini-cars. Having prepared to cater to that market, the company found it
shrinking fast.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Venture capital becomes a scarce
resource - Emiko Terazono examines why Japan's investors are turning ever
more conservative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VENTURE capital in Japan, always a rare resource, is becoming even more
scarce following the downturn in the country's economy.
The slump in the equity market and gloom over the economy has made investors
more conservative. Many financial institutions - which were keen newcomers
to the Japanese venture capital market in the years of loose credit in the
late 1980s - have retreated to their core businesses.
Problems at Ascii, the computer and software company led by Mr Kazuhiko
Nishi, typify the troubles faced by small companies in raising venture
capital. The company's expansion was funded in 1990 by bonds convertible
into equities. However, the sharp fall in the Tokyo market has left the
bonds - which expire next March - unconverted, and the company does not have
the funds to repay investors.
Faced with mounting debts, Ascii turned to its banks for help, and managed
to persuade its six main creditors to come up with a rescue package.
'Small companies are under great pressure, especially with larger companies
cutting back on capital expenditure,' says Mr Alan Acosta, analyst at Baring
Securities.
The amount loaned by banks to small companies is likely to fall year-on-year
for the first time in 15 years. New public offerings have virtually come to
a halt since the over-the-counter (OTC) market plunged along with the first
section of the Tokyo stock market.
Mr Sadayoshi Hayashi, a director of Jafco, Japan's largest venture capital
company and an affiliate of Nomura Securities, admits that times are hard.
'The capital markets are in bad shape, but in the long run, the trend
towards increasing listings for smaller companies has not changed,' he says.
The downturn in the economy is working favourably for Jafco, since it makes
investment decisions easier. 'When things are good, everybody makes profits,
but in times like these, we can pick out the good ones,' Mr Hayashi says.
Venture capital in Japan has traditionally been different from that in the
US and Europe, where capital is invested in the start-up of high-risk
companies. In Japan, under a culture which values stable growth and the
credibility of an organisation rather than that of an individual
entrepreneur, there have been few small start-up ventures.
'Japan's venture capital market is not socially developed, and there is no
real grass roots growth,' says Mr Gary Chan, an analyst at James Capel, the
broking firm.
Venture capital companies in Japan focus on finding growing but mature
companies with potential to be listed publicly, rather than taking large
equity positions in companies. This is because they look for future profits
through flotations and underwriting.
In the past, smaller companies have relied on government financing, and
loans from small banks and loan co-operatives. The focus on stable growth
rather than high profits, and the unwillingness of investors to place funds
into start-up companies, has also mitigated against Japanese venture
capital.
Another characteristic among Japanese companies, resulting from the lack of
risk-taking by venture capitalists, is low profit growth. According to
Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the average annual growth rate of revenues
at the top 20 US companies, during the first four years of listing on
Nasdaq, was 132.5 per cent. However, the figure for the top 20 Japanese
companies listed on the over-the-counter market was 32.9 per cent.
Mr Shinichi Shibayama at NRI points out that the closed business structure
in Japan, where leading companies and small corporations are not regarded as
equals, and the lack of intake of qualified staff at small companies hamper
growth.
Mr Hayashi at Jafco said: 'We are not deliberately avoiding new companies
when we invest, it's just that there is no market for start-up companies
which nobody has heard of.'
Small companies face several years before they establish their credibility
and become ready for public listing. On the OTC market, companies have been
in business for an average 29 years before their initial offering. In the
US, it is 4.7 years on Nasdaq.
In addition, fast growth areas such as high technology and biotechnology,
usually targeted by venture capital companies in the US, are taken on by
larger companies in Japan. For example, leading pharmaceuticals and foods
corporations are active in research and development in biotechnology.
Recession or no recession, the venture capital business in Japan still faces
social and cultural barriers. 'One major hurdle is the reluctance among
investors to provide credit on the back of innovation and new technology,'
says Mr Takehiro Tsuda, analyst at Ichiyoshi Securities.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bic rises 11% despite loss at
fashion subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING first-half results have been reported by three French companies,
Bic, the producer of disposable pens and razors; Au Printemps, the
department store; and Poliet, the building materials group.
Bic produced an 11 per cent increase in net profits to FFr241m (Dollars
47.25m) in the first six months of the year, due chiefly to its French, US
and Brazilian operations.
This comes after a FFr49m loss from Guy Laroche, Bic's fashion arm, most of
which is due to restructuring and write-downs on assets.
Au Printemps, recently the subject of a takeover by Pinault, the
distribution group, reported more than doubled first-half net profits of
FFr206m, as against FFr87m in the same period of last year.
These figures do not include the FFr1.87bn gross profit which Au Printemps
made last year from selling Euromarche, the hypermarkets chain. Group sales
rose 33.5 per cent from FFr14.14bn to FFr18.85bn. Poliet, a subsidiary of
the Paribas banking and industrial holdings group, saw net profits rise by
9.8 per cent to FFr290m in the first half. Sales were almost stagnant at
FFr9.99bn, as against FFr9.02bn in the first six months of 1991.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK may build Eurofighter on its own
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WOULD consider producing the European Fighter Aircraft on its own if
Germany, Spain and Italy quit the project, Mr Jonathan Aitken, the defence
procurement minister, said yesterday.
His statement is the first firm indication from the government that it is
prepared to contemplate a solo programme.
Mr Aitken said Britain would first need to study the cost implications and
warned that a one-nation EFA would probably be more expensive. However, it
was wrong to assume that the UK Treasury would necessarily take a negative
or hostile view, he said. He expected the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Department of Employment to maintain strong backing for the project.
The Ministry of Defence did not accept the argument that a less capable
aircraft might suffice.
Mr Aitken said he remained 'reasonably, cautiously optimistic' there would
still be some collaboration on the programme even if Germany stuck to its
decision not to stay with the project into the production phase.
Neither Spain nor Italy had ruled out trinational production, he said. 'It
is simply that they are endeavouring to find a basis on which Germany might
remain in the programme,' he added.
Defence ministers from the four countries are due to decide the project's
future at a meeting in late November following the completion of studies
into cost reductions and a review of military requirements.
The confidential quotation that industrial partners submitted in April for
EFA's production phase was much higher than expected, Mr Aitken said. He
added: 'We simply have to get the costs back into line.'
Speaking at a defence industry conference in London organised by Westminster
and City Programmes, he warned that any delays in the timetable would
increase production costs.
The alternative, lighter aircraft proposed by Germany would be cheaper to
make, but would involve repeating much of the Pounds 5bn worth of
development work done on EFA.
'The eventual cost could well turn out to be higher, and entry into service
certainly later,' Mr Aitken said.
If Britain were left alone in the EFA project, he said, savings could be
made by rationalising facilities, and the cost per aircraft might not be
greatly increased.
Mr Aitken's comments followed notification from Germany reserving its right
to withdraw from development work on the EFA as early as next February.

FT  30 SEP 92 / BCCI auditors face Dollars 8bn suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE and Ernst &amp; Young, the leading accountancy firms, are to be
sued for an estimated Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.6bn) for alleged negligence and
breach of contract in their audit of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
BCCI's liquidators, led by Mr Brian Smouha, of the accounting firm Touche
Ross, will in the next few days serve their statement of claim in their case
against PW and Ernst &amp; Young.
The damages claim relates to writs against the two accounting firms issued
by the liquidators in the UK high court in March.
The writs allege negligence, breach of duty and breach of contract relating
to BCCI audits for 1985 and 1986. The damages claim, thought to be a record
for any claim in the UK, relates to losses suffered by BCCI since 1986.
Ernst &amp; Young and PW will contest the actions and are confident of their
legal position.
After serving the statement of claim on the two firms, the liquidators,
which are acting for the holding company and its Cayman Island and
Luxembourg subsidiaries, are not obliged to make the details public. They
have not decided whether to disclose the huge sum claimed, pending the start
of a trial. Last night Mr Smouha refused to comment.
Until 1987, PW and Ernst &amp; Young both acted as auditors to the BCCI group of
companies. PW then took sole responsibility for auditing BCCI's businesses.
BCCI was closed by the Bank of England in July 1991, after it discovered
evidence of a huge fraud in the bank.
Accountants have been facing a growing number of ever larger legal claims in
recent years in connection with their role as auditors to collapsed
companies.
As a result, the accountants have found it increasingly expensive to
purchase insurance to cover the risk of such action.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Bank warns on fall in pound: Leigh-Pemberton urges
government not to loosen fiscal policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday warned
the government against letting the pound slip too far and loosening fiscal
policy in an attempt to speed recovery.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton spoke as it became clear that the UK government was still
a long way from finalising its domestic and European economic policies,
including any plans it might have for the European exchange rate mechanism.
According to Treasury officials, the UK has yet to draw up detailed
proposals for reforming the ERM. A similar gap exists in the case of
monetary policy, where the government has given itself until Mr Norman
Lamont's Mansion House speech on October 29 to flesh out the details of the
British monetary policy which the chancellor outlined in Washington 10 days
ago.
Mr John Major yesterday insisted that there would be reform of the ERM,
despite the apparent rejection of the idea by European Community finance
ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Speaking in London, the prime minister underlined that the 'faultlines' in
the mechanism would have to be corrected before the UK would consider
re-joining the ERM. It was not simply the UK that had experienced the
problems of the ERM, but Spain, Italy, Ireland and France too.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's carefully veiled remarks came in a speech on
international monetary co-operation to the British-American Chamber of
Commerce in London. They helped lift the pound to DM2.52 at the London close
as financial markets interpreted his remarks as a warning against further
sharp interest rate cuts in the UK. Sterling had earlier threatened to slip
below DM2.50. In New York it fell back just below DM2.52 but against a weak
dollar it gained more than 2 1/2 cents to Dollars 1.7865.
More explicitly, Mr Leigh-Pemberton hinted that Germany should cut interest
rates to help growth in Europe. However, a council member of the Bundesbank,
Mr Lothar Muller, yesterday said Germany might be able to cut its interest
rates in about six months but there could be no immediate reduction.
Speaking in London, Mr Muller said German interest rates had to be kept high
for the time being because of wage and inflation pressures.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton's comments that the UK could not afford to ignore the
exchange rate highlighted the need for the government to clarify its
economic policies.
The need to find some way through the apparent impasse on ERM reform is
likely to dominate Mr Major's round of discussions with other EC heads of
government today and in the run up to the emergency summit of EC leaders on
October 16. Today he sees President Francois Mitterrand in Paris before
talks in London with Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister.
Yesterday Mr Major was still hopeful that Britain's EC partners would back
his call for ERM reform. 'Those faultlines need to be addressed,' he said.
'I know that, our European partners know that, and they will acknowledge
that and work will need to be done on that.'
But Treasury officials admitted Monday's meeting of EC finance ministers
'had not got down to specifics' and played down suggestions that the planned
Birmingham summit would be the occasion for significant decisions on the
future of the ERM.
Financial markets are still unclear about how Mr Lamont will set monetary
policy. In Washington, he promised a tight policy that would 'give weight to
a number of financial indicators', including narrow and broad money growth,
asset prices and the exchange rate.
Although sterling and the London stock market gained yesterday, foreign
exchange dealers and City analysts were reluctant to predict continuing
stability in the absence of more detailed statements from the government
before the end of October. The prime minister's priority yesterday was to
play down the split in the Tory party over Europe. He dismissed the
divisions as 'froth and bubble' which he would not allow to distract him.
But the split was given fresh impetus by Lord Tebbit, the former cabinet
minister, who in yesterday's Daily Mail said Mr Major had been wrongfooted
in his efforts to take Britain to the heart of Europe.
Tory Euro-sceptics also attacked Mr Lamont for what they called the
'humiliation' of his qualified apology to Germany over remarks in the UK
press about the Bundesbank's role in the recent sterling crisis.
The chancellor faces two potentially difficult days at the Tory party
conference next week. He is expected to explain his views about Europe at a
fringe meeting the evening before addressing the conference in the economic
debate on Thursday.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Recession claims 4,500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK recession claimed more than 4,500 jobs yesterday while new figures
confirmed that the number of company failures is still accelerating and
about to break all records.
With industry still awaiting significant signs of recovery, Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, the business information company, said that more than 46,000
companies collapsed in the first nine months of this year - almost equalling
the number of failures in 1991.
The company warned that the recession looked poised to 'devastate' small
businesses.
Reacting to the latest redundancies, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of
the GMB general workers' union, claimed that unemployment was now 'running
out of control', with Britain heading towards 'the worst winter for
unemployment in living memory'. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said there was 'a jobs avalanche on the
move'.
The biggest jobs blow yesterday was the announcement that about 2,000 jobs
will go at the government's Defence Research Agency, set up in April last
year to make the government's defence research activities more cost
effective. The job cuts, to achieve savings of Pounds 90m a year, will take
two years to complete.
In the private sector, up to 1,800 jobs are to be shed by Sears, the UK
retail and mail order group. In the latest reorganisation of its British
Shoe Corporation business, the group plans to close 350 shops - which trade
under high street names such as Dolcis and Saxone - over the next three
years.
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, is to cut 426
jobs, most of them in Northern Ireland. The company blamed the recession.
Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian tyre and cable company, is
to dismiss nearly 300 workers at plants in Hampshire and Newport, Wales. The
company blamed falling demand.
Independent Television News said it was shedding 112 technical support and
administration staff as part of a cost-cutting programme. The company will
ask for volunteers but said compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out.

FT  30 SEP 92 / From delusion to devaluation: Martin Wolf unravels the
events behind the collapse of UK economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF

<TEXT>
'The exchange rate mechanism will reinforce our counterinflationary
policies, help to provide the stability and certainty that industry needs,
and set the right framework for a resumption of soundly-based and
non-inflationary growth.'
John Major, House of Commons, October 15 1990.
'I do not see that we could readily return to the mechanism without dealing
with the problems that have been thrown up in the past fortnight. These need
careful examination and consideration before we can decide whether such a
mechanism can be made to work to the benefit of all its members.'
John Major, House of Commons, September 24 1992.
What a difference two years make. Hopes were high when Mr Major put sterling
into the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on October 5 1990. Hopes collapsed
when sterling was pushed out of the ERM on September 16 1992. The entry was
abrupt, the exit no less so.
The ERM has run like a black thread through the garment of British politics.
It precipitated the resignations from Margaret Thatcher's government of
Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson. It helped bring Mrs Thatcher down. Now it
has devastated Mr Major, the chancellor who took sterling in and the prime
minister who saw sterling forced out.
It is difficult now to recall the strength of the consensus in favour of ERM
entry. There was the odd malcontent: Sir Alan Walters, for example. The then
prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was undoubtedly among them. But she
was too enfeebled to resist a policy she had alway disliked.
Those involved in foreign policy supported ERM entry because it represented
a commitment to the UK's European future. People in business supported entry
because it would provide exchange rate stability. Those responsible for
economic policy supported the ERM because it would, they hoped, end a series
of policy disasters.
Several influential policymakers - Nigel Lawson among them - regarded the
targeting of broad money as the god that had failed. From the mid-1980s
onwards, they judged the exchange rate to be the best monetary indicator.
This judgment was largely determined by the experience of falling inflation
and a soaring exchange rate in the early 1980s, despite rapid growth of the
broad money aggregates. In the autumn of 1985, Mr Lawson made an effort,
then blocked by Mrs Thatcher, to obtain ERM entry at the exchange rate of
about DM 3.75.
Meanwhile, several senior officials in the Treasury and the Bank of England
viewed the ERM as no more than a second-best method of running monetary
policy. But Mr Lawson's erratic monetary policies convinced officials that a
first-rate monetary policy - one run by themselves - would never be allowed
to happen. Along with many others, they concluded that monetary policy was
far too important to be entrusted to politicians.
Just as there was an official view on why it was necessary to enter the ERM,
there is also a view in the Treasury and the Bank of England on why sterling
was forced out. The view is not identical to that of the prime minister and
chancellor, who have focused their excuses on the allegedly unexpected
events of recent weeks and their fervent complaints on the unhelpful
behaviour of the Germans. The official view is more subtle. Their story goes
roughly as follows.
The timing of entry was not ideal, nor was the 1 percentage point interest
rate cut that accompanied it. But both were dictated by political realities.
In particular, entry could only come after the prime minister and the
chancellor had both agreed to it. It also could come only when the
conditions set at the Madrid summit of June 1988, which had demanded prior
convergence of UK inflation on the EC average, could be plausibly reset in
terms of prospective inflation. Finally, it was judged imperative for entry
to come before the start of the EC's inter-governmental conferences on
monetary and political union.
Notwithstanding the long-delayed entry, the first year to 18 months of ERM
entry went well. Sterling remained close to its central rate. Interest rates
were brought down steadily, from a base rate of 15 per cent on the eve of
entry to 10 1/2 per cent in September 1991. The rate was cut still further,
to 10 per cent, in May 1992. Meanwhile, inflation - the lodestar of policy -
was falling more rapidly than forecast.
Unfortunately, the better-than-expected performance on inflation reflected
the worse-than-forecast performance of the economy. In the first half of
1992 it was becoming obvious, even to the government, that a severe conflict
was emerging between the monetary policy required by ERM membership and that
needed by the domestic economy. The 'green shoots' of recovery were
withering in the Bundesbank's monetary winter.
The unexpectedly weak performance of the UK economy was only one of three
things that went wrong. The other two were the high interest rates that were
the Bundesbank's response to the inflationary consequences of German
unification and the failure of the US economy to show its long-awaited
recovery.
It was not what the German and US economies were doing individually that
mattered so much. What mattered more was the combination of the two. By
autumn 1992, the UK was suffering from a Dollars 2 pound, even though the
rate against the D-Mark was near its floor, from short-term real interest
rates at near unprecedented levels for a recession, and from a weak world
economy.
With stagnation in the UK economy, the public sector borrowing requirement
rising towards 6 per cent of gross domestic product and bound to go higher,
and a current account deficit of 2 per cent of GDP in the midst of
recession, something had to give. In the end, it was sterling's place in the
ERM.
There were alternatives, at least in theory. The US authorities might have
promoted domestic recovery more successfully. The German government might
have taken more drastic action to put its fiscal house in order. The
Bundesbank might have been persuaded to ignore the German monetary data. The
French might have agreed to a realignment, one that might, in turn, have
persuaded the Bundesbank to lower German interest rates. But none of these
things happened.
Alternatively, sterling might have been realigned, either on its own or with
the lira. But since officials at the Treasury and Bank of England believed
neither that sterling was overvalued against European currencies nor that a
partial realignment of the ERM would lead to significantly lower German
interest rates, this option looked pointless to them. It seemed necessary to
soldier on, instead, at least until after the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty.
It was understood that the French referendum would make the more doubtful of
the ERM parities difficult to preserve. In the event, the failure of central
bank intervention to reverse the weakness of the dollar in late August,
followed not long after by the risky and ultimately unsuccessful 7 per cent
realignment of the lira on the weekend of September 12-13, set the stage for
sterling's humiliation.
Unguarded remarks from senior Bundesbank officials - notably those reported
on the morning of September 16 from Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's
president - simply put the match to the kerosene. Nonetheless, it did seem
as though the Bundesbank was unaware of the dangers for the ERM posed by the
French referendum.
In the event, the UK base rate increases were inadequate. What, after all,
is a 5 percentage point interest rate increase against the likelihood of a
10 per cent devaluation by tomorrow morning? The government simply ran out
of money and out of time. For some in the Bank of England, this disastrous
denouement even came as a relief.
Does this official view make sense? Only up to a point.
First of all, the government had no strategy for dealing with the aftermath
of the French referendum. It is now clear that France had no intention of
realigning the franc. Also, a sterling realignment on its own, while helpful
in dealing with the evident overvaluation against the dollar, would have
done nothing for the equally pressing problem of the interest rate.
Second, while the tactics probably made little difference to what became an
unsustainable policy, serious tactical errors were made. Among the most
important was the failure to deal sensibly with other ERM members. To enter
at a rate the Germans thought ambitious was risky; to hector them was
foolish; and to suggest that the UK's failure was reason for suspending the
ERM was at least cheeky.
Third, economic events were unfortunate, but not unforeseeable. The Treasury
failed to understand what had happened to the UK economy during the second
half of the 1980s. It failed to foresee the onset of recession at the time
of ERM entry. In both failures it was in the company of most analysts, but
not, in fact, of all. Furthermore, the Treasury has never accepted what
seems evident to many outside observers, that sterling's real exchange rate
was seriously overvalued from the beginning, as is clearly suggested by the
UK's trade performance, As for the supposedly unforeseen effects of German
unification, UK officials needed only ask Karl Otto Pohl, the former
Bundesbank president, for his view of the consequences of the errors his
government had committed before sterling's entry into the ERM.
More fundamentally still, these mishaps are not independent of the decision
to fix exchange rates. It was partly because of the attempt to keep sterling
down in 1987 and early 1988 that the UK entered the ERM with a huge debt
overhang. It was also ERM membership that made it impossible to respond to
unfolding economic circumstances. Inflexibility is, after all, the heart and
soul of the mechanism.
What then is the main lesson?
It is that there are no magic wands, certainly not entry into the ERM on its
own, probably not the ERM at all. The happy mishap of exit from the ERM
gives the government another chance to find the long-term policies and
institutions that will give the UK sustained, non-inflationary growth. But
for now at least, the government has lost its policy and the country has
lost its way.

FT  30 SEP 92 / India's dam-busters: Environmental concerns threaten the
future of a Dollars 3bn World Bank development project, writes Stefan
Wagstyl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manibeli, a village of thatched huts, muddy river banks and an ancient stone
temple, will tomorrow top the agenda at a World Bank meeting in Washington.
The bank's directors are due to debate the future of one of the bank's most
controversial large-scale development projects - the construction of a huge
dam across the Narmada River in north-western India.
The Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.73bn) project will supply drinking water to about
30m people through a 75,000km network of canals, the world's largest, and
generate torrents of electricity. However, it will also flood - partly or
completely - land belonging to some 240,000 of India's poorest people. They
include tribal villagers, such as the inhabitants of Manibeli, which is
located on the Narmada in Maharashtra state.
Most of the 230 families of Manibeli have already moved out to resettlement
sites purchased by the dam authorities. But most of the 30 or so who remain
say they are ready to drown rather than move from their land or the
surrounding forests which provide them with food, firewood and medicinal
herbs. Mr Narayan, the 45-year-old headman, says: 'We will not leave; our
parents are buried here.'
The villagers' stand has brought to a head the long-running battle over the
dam's construction. Critics, led by environmental lobbyists, want it stopped
on the grounds that too little consideration has been paid to the protection
of local communities or the environment. Supporters - including the World
Bank - say the benefits outweigh the costs and that displaced villagers are
being resettled on better terms than in previous schemes.
The project was first discussed as long ago as 1946 and the foundation stone
was laid by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, in 1961.
However, the scheme was delayed by protracted disputes between the three
states through which the Narmada flows - Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya
Pradesh. It was 1979 before they were resolved and 1985 before the World
Bank approved a Dollars 450m loan.
By then, environmental lobbyists, both in India and elsewhere, were winning
public support for their concerns about large-scale construction schemes. In
1986, Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the late prime minister, acknowledged that India's
big dams had failed to deliver the promised benefits. 'Perhaps we can safely
say that almost no benefit has come to the people from these projects.'
Mr Gandhi and the World Bank saw the Narmada scheme as a chance to learn
from past mistakes. They insisted the three states leading the scheme
compensate displaced villagers in ways which safeguarded their economic and
social well-being. They also demanded a detailed environmental master plan.
However, even though large-scale construction started in 1989, the three
states failed to meet the conditions imposed upon them. A trickle of
complaints from environmental activists became a flood, and last year the
World Bank ordered an unprecedented independent review by Mr Bradford Morse,
a US development aid administrator.
Mr Morse's report, delivered this summer, shocked the bank. He concluded
that most of the environmental lobbyists' complaints were justified. 'The
projects as they stand are flawed; resettlement and rehabilitation of all
those displaced by the projects is not possible under prevailing
circumstances, and the environmental impacts of the projects have not been
properly considered or adequately addressed,' Mr Morse wrote.
He expressed particular concern about compensation for those villagers whose
rights to land had never been recorded and about the continuing absence of
any environmental master plan. Mr Morse stopped just short of recommending
abandoning the project.
World Bank experts accept many of Mr Morse's criticisms, but argue there is
time to make improvements before the main dam's completion in 2000. The
three states make the same point, adding, belligerently, that the dam will
be built with or without the World Bank.
The bank's directors are unlikely to abandon the main dam and canals when
they met on Thursday. But they could well refrain from funding other dams
the states plan along the Narmada. And they could insist that Mr Morse's
objections are met before more bank money is spent on the scheme.
That will not entirely satisfy the Manibeli villagers. But they will have
the comfort of knowing they have secured better compensation than they might
have thought possible even a year ago. Moreover, they will have helped to
force a wholesale reappraisal of the project - and, by extension, of the
value of large-scale irrigation schemes everywhere. As a World Bank official
in India says: 'We have learnt some important lessons here.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The cost of peacekeeping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, should be feeling a good
deal happier this week than he was last July. Then his term of office seemed
to be turning sour. An Agenda for Peace, the report on conflict prevention
and peacekeeping he submitted in June at the Security Council's request, had
been either ignored or unofficially rubbished by the council's permanent
members. And he himself had got into an unseemly wrangle with the Europeans
over the management of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. He complained
that the EC had negotiated a handover of heavy weapons to the UN without
consulting the UN itself, and accused rich nations of starving the UN of
funds, yet expecting it to use a disproportionate share of its resources on
conflicts in their own part of the world - at the expense, for example, of
Somalia.
Since then, the EC and UN peace efforts in Bosnia have merged, under the
apparently harmonious co-chairmanship of Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance. The
UN force there has been increased, with EC member states providing troops at
their own expense. A force has also been sent to Somalia to protect the
distributors of food. And last week, in the new session of the General
Assembly, several of the permanent members had encouraging things to say
about Agenda for Peace.
Election gimmick
President George Bush suggested a special Security Council meeting to
discuss the report and 'develop concrete responses'. That was widely seen as
an election gimmick, but at least Mr Bush accepted the idea that member
states should train military units specially for peacekeeping and
humanitarian duties and keep them available on short notice for the
secretary-general's use. He also spoke of co-ordinated command and control,
multinational training exercises, logistical support, stockpiles of
resources, intelligence capabilities and 'adequate, equitable financing'.
The last point is a very sore one. Demand for UN peacekeeping operations
(PKOs) has been expanding rapidly, and the total cost will soon reach
Dollars 2.7bn a year. The five permanent members are supposed to pay most of
the cost, but the US is currently Dollars 209m in arrears and Russia - whose
foreign minister declared his support for Mr Bush's proposals - Dollars
282m. By 'equitable' Mr Bush no doubt meant that others should pay more,
though he did say the US would 'review how we fund peacekeeping and explore
new ways to ensure adequate American financial support'.
Think differently
'I do believe,' he added somewhat plaintively, 'that we must think
differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era.'
The remark may have been addressed partly to the US Congress. If so, not too
much should be expected, given Mr Bush's track record of reaching agreement
with that body.
Japan is already footing the bill for the Cambodia operation, in addition to
paying 12.5 per cent of the UN's regular budget - roughly equivalent to the
combined shares of three of the permanent members: Britain, France and
China. This fact was recalled yet again in his speech to the Assembly by Mr
Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, who suggested 'serious'
reform of the Security Council in time for the UN's 50th birthday in 1995.
He was joined by his German colleague, Mr Klaus Kinkel, who asserted that
debate on Security Council reform was already under way. 'Germany will not
take the initiative in this respect,' he said. But 'if a change in the
council's membership is actually considered we, too, shall seek a permanent
seat'.
Such remarks provoke irritation among the existing permanent members, ill
masked by an indulgent smile. They tend to respond complacently that it will
be very difficult to agree on any new composition of the Security Council,
and that Germany and Japan have yet to show themselves up to the
responsibility of permanent membership. But Japan has already amended its
constitution and begun to contribute to PKOs, while Germany is preparing to
do the same. It seems unlikely they will go on increasing their share in the
costs of the organisation indefinitely, unless their great power status is
recognised.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Rebuilding the Labour party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A healthy democracy a principal opposition party has two functions. Its
day-to-day duty is to harry the government, challenge its proposals, expose
its shortcomings, make parliamentary life difficult; in short, to oppose.
Its longer-term reason for existence is to stand ready as an alternative
government, thus providing the electorate with a choice when the term of the
administration currently in office expires.
Less than six months after its shattering defeat in the April election the
British Labour party is beginning to look as if, a summer of disappointment
behind it, it is ready to fulfil the first of these purposes. It is well
prepared to make a thumping nuisance of itself. Its new leader, Mr John
Smith, displayed his reknowned forensic skills in a blistering attack on the
prime minister in the House of Commons last week. Where Mrs Margaret
Thatcher towered over Mr Neil Kinnock, and the latter was at best evenly
matched with Mr John Major, it is the Labour leader who now commands the
House and the prime minister who must strive for its full attention. It is
Mr Smith who can proclaim, without qualification, that it has always been
his firm conviction that Britain's future lies in Europe; and Mr Major who
must twist and turn.
Open stage
A parliament in which the government's majority is slender and the governing
party divided presents a strongly led opposition with an open stage. It is
Labour's good fortune that in Mr Smith it has a leader whose ability to
perform upon such a platform is unquestioned. The degree to which victories
in the cut and thrust of Commons debate impinge upon the consciousness of
the general public is unpredictable, but it is reasonable to assume that a
long period in which the leader of the opposition shows up well in the House
will have a beneficial effect upon the standing of his party.
Mr Smith is also in a position to demonstrate that he leads a united force,
again in contrast to the hapless Mr Major. At the Labour conference this
week Mr Smith's closest colleagues won positions on the executive committee,
while his strongest opponents lost out. Unlike many previous Labour leaders,
he and his allies dominate both the party machine and the shadow cabinet.
Labour is Mr Smith's to take in a direction of his choice. In his first
conference speech as leader yesterday he proclaimed that the route he
favours is towards electoral victory.
Creditable passion
There is much for Labour to do if it is to have a hope of reaching that
destination. It must cut its formal links with the trade unions; Mr Smith
was equivocal about that. It must find a way of expressing itself that
allays the fears of those who believe that Labour will impoverish them. Then
a set of policies to improve people's lives must be selected and this must
look better than the government's. Mr Smith has hardly had time to commence
this large task so it is not surprising that yesterday's speech amounted to
an interim repackaging of the manifesto upon which the last election was
lost.
Its central feature was an affirmation of the party's belief in 'active
government', a phrase which, if it means anything different from
old-fashioned interventionism, was not explained. 'Active government', it
appears, would provide better housing, training, education and environmental
protection, an 'efficient and caring' health service, a fairer system of
industrial relations, a minimum wage, constitutional reform, positive
discrimination, help for working mothers and the rescue of the coal
industry. It would also, no doubt, implement such recommendations as emerge
from Mr Smith's 'special commission on social justice'. The latter reflects
his creditable passion for meeting the needs of the worse-off section of
society.
This not unfamiliar menu certainly presents voters with a choice. The
Conservative aim is to decrease the remit of government; Labour's
unashamedly to extend it. No one could pretend that the Tory endeavour has
been wholly successful, but that is not in itself an argument for the
'active' alternative. What Mr Smith needs to explain is why officials can do
better than private individuals - and, indeed, what guarantee there is that
more government will not merely make matters worse. It certainly did in the
1970s.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (10): Fighting
intensifies in the chip war - Martin Banks finds increased competition may
lead to superior processors but reduce suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING provided PC users with a 30-fold increase in performance coupled to a
near four-fold drop in system price, there can be no doubting the
significance of the semiconductor industry, and in particular its most
important product, the microprocessor.
Much of this development also came without the usual pressures of direct and
frantic competition. For the past 10 years, and more in the PC market, there
have been two main microprocessor 'camps' - Intel and Motorola - and while
there has been technological rivalry between the two, they rarely competed
for precisely the same markets. Intel had the IBM-compatible PC market to
itself, while Motorola supplied Apple and many of the early small Unix
systems.
Later came the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (Risc) processors from the
likes of Sun Microsystems, Mips Computers, Hewlett Packard, Motorola and
IBM. As they all are pitched at the same basic market - Unix systems of all
types - this has been an area of greater competition and in-fighting between
the manufacturers.
In the PC market, however, the past couple of years has seen competition
increase radically, particularly in Intel's prime marketplace of the
IBM-compatible PC. Until that time, Intel had managed to defend its
technological lead by judicious use of legal protection and licencing deals
for its x86 processor family.
The company would licence the low-end, high-volume products to other
manufacturers, while maintaining total control over the high-end products.
This was until one of the licensees, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) claimed
breech of an on-going licence agreement, the claimed breech preventing AMD
having any rights to Intel's 386 processor.
The judgement was sufficiently complex to allow both companies to claim
victory, but the clear result in the marketplace was to allow AMD to produce
its own version of the 386. The effect was to break Intel's stranglehold on
this market, which at the time was the dominant part of Intel's processor
business.
It also opened the floodgates for other manufacturers to move in and offer
PC producers other alternatives to Intel for supplies of 386 processors.
This is an important market, for the 32-bit, Complex Instruction Set
Computer (Cisc) 386 processor is, in its three prime versions, now at the
heart of nearly all entry-level PCs, systems which sell worldwide by the
million. It is the dominant processor type in a market where Intel alone
claims to have shipped 20m processors of all types past year, holding a 58
per cent share of the Dollars 5.2bn microprocessor business. With profits
last year of Dollars 818.6m, the stakes both for Intel and its rivals are
high.
The risks are also high. One of Intel's competitors has been a US company,
Chips and Technologies, which after a year of producing its own versions of
the 386 processor has decided to all but pull out of the business. It will
continue to market one version, modelled on the original Intel part (known
as the 386DX), but has withdrawn all bar its PC/CHIP, a single-chip
implementation of a complete low-performance PC, which is aimed at the
notebook and palmtop PC producers.
Intel still faces strong competition, however. AMD chief executive, Mr Jerry
Sanders, is claiming some 30 per cent of the 386 market, and has products in
all three versions of the processor; these the standard 386DX, the cheaper
386SX with reduced memory addressing capabilities and the 386SL, which uses
an internal design to effectively allow the processor to stop when not in
use. Called a 'static' design, it reduces power consumption, which is
advantageous in notebook and palmtop PCs.
Together with the other main competitors, Cyrix and IBM, AMD is pushing 386
processor technology aggressively, producing devices that are faster and
cheaper than Intel's. The latter, having already introduced the faster, more
powerful 486DX as the next processor in the family line, has responded to
the competition in a number of ways.
It started with the launched of the 486SX version, seen by some observers as
a somewhat crude marketing gambit. This is essentially a 486DX with the
on-board maths co-processor disabled. The additional maths co-processor is
essentially a 486DX designed not to work unless the 486SX is already
present.
It has subsequently launched the 486DX2, which runs internally at twice the
speed of the original device, and the Overdrive, essentially a 'retail'
version of the DX2 chip which can be fitted into the co-processor socket of
existing 486-based PCs.
This latter device has been heavily criticised by many PC makers, who
suggest that with it Intel is competing with its own customers - them. The
company is certainly starting to court the end user directly by trying to
establish the Intel brand name with them. It is also producing complete PC
motherboards and other sub-systems. It contends, however, that it will not
compete directly by making its own PCs.
Intel has also delayed the introduction of its next generation processor,
called the P5. This is at least in part to give more time for the DX2 and
Overdrive products to flourish, but when it finally appears next year, it
will bring Intel into direct competition with the makers of high performance
Risc processors.
Its 100 Mips will, for example, equal or beat the performance of devices
such as the SuperSPARC chipset at the heart of Sun Microsystems'
workstations, Mips Computers R4000 device which was to be at the heart of
the now defunct ACE workstation collaboration (the coming of the P5 was the
main reason companies such as Compaq pulled out of the Alliance), and the
PowerOpen processor due to roll out of the IBM/Apple/Motorola Alliance by
the end of this year.
The comparability in brute performance expected between the coming P5 and
the Risc chips will inevitably weaken the dividing line between PCs and
workstations, quite possibly creating a situation where the winners will be
those processors which run the operating systems which users decide are
best, rather than the best 'technical' design.
The one outsider in this at present is Digital Equipment, which has already
announced a Risc processor, called Alpha. This has a claimed performance,
200 Mips, that is far beyond anything else available. Digital aims to not
only use it in its own workstations, but also offer the processor on the
merchant market as direct competition to the likes of Intel.
Competition in the chip market is, therefore, on the verge of becoming
fierce, with the extending recession meeting rapidly advancing technology
head-on. The result is likely to be far superior processors, but far fewer
sources of supply.

COMPUTER distribution channels today are probably more confused than at any
point since they were set up in the early 1980s.
The sedate 'manufacturer to distributor to dealer to customer' tiered
distribution model has been modified and flattened as channels matured, but
in the past two years numerous spanners have been thrown into the works.
Where two years ago dealers and distributors could talk about channels
evolving in an orderly fashion, the developments of the past few months in
particular suggest that many parts of the channel have in fact been
shattered, and rather than evolving, are being rebuilt from the ground up.
Historically, the quests for economies of scale and critical mass have led
to a series of acquisitions and mergers, where, for example, British
distributors Frontline and Software were acquired by German company Computer
2000 and American combine Ingram respectively.
This in itself threatened the smaller distributors, as the larger companies
quite reasonably view their most effective route to market as being to
maximise volume and efficiency, and to win on margin.
The other historical trend has been towards dealer-distributor status, where
a dealer chain, such as Computacenter, grows large enough to be able to deal
direct with the manufacturer at more advantageous margins, while selling
direct to large corporate customers at prices that smaller dealers can't
match.
The view - widespread in the City two years ago - that distribution needed a
direct sales arm to survive, has now been more or less discredited.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the use of direct sales provide distributors
with access to price-sensitive sectors of the market that the traditional
distributors have trouble in addressing, and still pose some difficult
questions for trade-only distributors.
Mr Chip Lacey, president of Ingram, takes the view that in order to succeed
in distribution you have to be in the top one or two in the markets in which
you operate, but he qualifies this by broadening the area to cover
specialist sectors as well as geographical territories.
Ingram, as a broad-based distributor, needs to come first or second by
volume in each country, 'but for example you could be one of the top two
printer distributors in a given country'.
In the UK Northamber, which has historically been spoken of as both a target
for Ingram and - being trade-only - as one of the companies that will have
most difficulty surviving the rise of the dealer-distributor, but Mr Lacey
clearly thinks that its solid base in printers is enough to see it through.
In the view of Northamber chairman Mr David Phillips, the main problem for
the trade now is more finance than margin erosion. Computer dealers are
being hurt by banks tightening up on overdrafts, and he suspects that the
banks' motivation in providing credit ratings these days is all too often to
shift the debt from the bank to the computer distributor.
'Dealers need three distributors - one to love, one to hate and one to go to
when you're on credit hold,' he says, and in his view, given the parlous
state of European credit insurance, distributors are now largely on their
own when it comes to assessing the risks of doing business with particular
partners.
The most recent, and for the trade the most ominous, development in
distribution channels is the trend for the manufacturers themselves to take
control of the distribution channel.
This is partially a response to direct-sell specialists such as Dell, and
partially to the host of followers, small assembly operations which have
taken an estimated 20 per cent of the market by selling computers directly
off the page and over the phone.
Earlier this year the head of IBM's personal computer division (recently
floated off as the IBM Personal Computer Company) Mr Jim Cannavino said IBM
would be present in all channels, and this has culminated in a series of
initiatives that constitute varying degrees of threat to traditional
channels.
The company has used Europe as a test market for new approaches to channels
that have been, or shortly will be, applied to the rest of the world.
In the UK the first stage was the establishment of the PS/1 entry-level IBM
brand through mass-merchandisers such as Dixons, and more recently through
superstores, and this was followed up by the launch of the Ambra brand, an
IBM clone built by Singapore manufacturer Wearnes, and sold by a separate
company owned by IBM, ICPI, into the areas of the market that IBM had lost
to the clones.
The success of Ambra has been compared unfavourably to that of Compaq's
low-cost range (the theory for this was based on research of BMW's launch of
the 3-series), but IBM has plenty more shots in its locker.
It is expected later this month to launch a series of souped-up PS/1s and
another line of low-cost clones (this time built by the Korean company
Samsung), along with a full-blown telesales operation.
Mr Howard Ford, head of the company's UK personal systems division, stresses
that the indirect channel remains IBM's 'primary route to market', but IBM's
efforts to recoup business lost to the indirect channel will not in
themselves help shore up that channel.
The challenge for the indirect channel remains to 'get big, get niche, or
get out', and any company without either an area of specialisation or
sufficient mass to benefit from economies of scale is threatened.
'The guys who are in trouble', says Ingram's Mr Lacey, 'are the ones who
haven't yet picked a specialisation'. And interestingly enough, Mr Lacey
feels one of the areas most likely to see problems is the US, not Europe.
The US channels have historically seen 20 per cent annual growth, 'and
that's what's been keeping smaller distributors around,' he says.
'As soon as growth stops, we'll begin to see failures in the second tier'.
Adjusting to lack of growth is one of the few problems the UK market does
not face.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (10): Tribute from Major - Profile of
Nokia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOKIA may not enjoy instant recognition in Britain but at least it is
well-known in Mr John Major's Huntingdon constituency. Last spring Finland's
giant telecommunications and electronics group established a strong foothold
in the town when the UK prime minister opened its British headquarters
there.
'The speed with which the company has established itself both
internationally in the highly competitive and innovative telecommunications
market but also as a growing and important presence in this part of the
world is a great tribute to Nokia,' Mr Major said then.
The company has seized the opportunities provided by the emergence of the
UK's deregulated and liberalised telecommunications system with a five-fold
increase in its telecommunications sales to the country in the past two
years.
Last spring the Finnish company won an order to supply Windsor Cable
Television's cable telecom division with Nokia DX 200 digital cross-connect
systems to link its local service franchise to the national and
international network. Similar equipment has been ordered more recently by
Mid Downs Communications with the provision of 37,000 lines to cover
Crawley, Horley and Gatwick airport.
Today the company is the world's second largest mobile phone manufacturer
after Motorola. It also claims to be the third biggest European manufacturer
of colour television sets while it is the continent's sixth largest maker of
cable as well as a global leader in cable machinery production.
With 27,000 workers in 36 countries, Nokia has become a substantial European
technology group. While its corporate headquarters remain in Helsinki, its
consumer electronics division is run from Geneva.
Under Mr Jorma Ollila, the 41-year-old chief executive who became Nokia's
president last January and chief executive officer only in June, the company
looks set to thrive in its designated business areas - telecommunications,
mobile telephones, consumer electronics, cables and machinery.
'The worst is over,' he insists. 'We won't make a profit this year but the
result will be better than in 1991 when the company made a FM324m pre-tax
loss.'
A primary cause of last year's setback was the collapse of Nokia's
telecommunications business with the Soviet Union. 'From FM1.2bn sales in
1990 it fell to zero in 1991,' he explains. 'But over the past 10 months we
have filled the gap through acquisition of orders for our GSM and PCN
systems in Germany.'
An important advance was achieved by the company in June when it announced
it was forming a joint venture at Fort Worth in Texas for the production of
mobile telephones in collaboration with a subsidiary of the Tandy
corporation.
The newly formed TNC company is scheduled to start production of high
volumes of cellular phones early next year for the US market. Last year
North America accounted for around half the cellular phones sold worldwide.
Mr Ollila says: 'Two reasons have necessitated our US presence, the weakness
of the US dollar and the need to be closer to a market with a 30 per cent
annual volume growth.'
He is well equipped to develop the company's telecommunications and mobile
phone activities. In just two years - 1990 and 1991 - he turned the mobile
phones division from loss to profit through cost-cutting and rationalisation
which meant reducing the workforce and doubling production volume. 'I
brought research and development, manufacturing and the marketing work much
closer together and reduced the cycle time.' Mr Ollila's managerial
performance impressed Nokia's board and paved the way for his meteoric rise
to the top.
The company solved the problem of its loss-making data division, bought from
Ericsson, by selling it in 1991 to ICL for Pounds 230m. It also partially
divested itself from chemicals by merging them with the Finnish company
Kymmene in a 50-50 partnership.
Consumer electronics remains a headache. Production of colour TV sets has
been concentrated in the company's two plants at Turku in Finland and Bochum
in Germany.
The cables business is also suffering from a fall in European capital
investment and overcapacity in the industry. Nokia has carried out
cost-cutting and has benefited from orders for power and telephone cables,
with a 24 per cent increase in the order book in the first four months.
'We are not a conglomerate any more but a focused technology group,' says Mr
Ollila. The company appears to have a promising future in the
telecommunications industry.
In 1987, Nokia made a splash by hiring all the billboards in Sweden. The
company can hardly do the same in Britain. But across much of western Europe
it looks like one of Finland's corporate flagships, signalling the arrival
of the country's industry in the wider continental markets.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (9): Harmony restored - Bank governor and
the government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Sirkka Hamalainen, the 53-year-old governor of the Bank of Finland since
last April, has the toughest job in Finland at the moment. She - perhaps
more than anybody else in the country - recognises the fragility of its
economic position amid today's turbulent international money markets.
'No central bank alone can pursue a fixed exchange rate policy,' she argues.
Without the close support of the government, it lacks the authority to
maintain its commitment no matter how independent the central bank may be in
theory. The government and the central bank must work in harmony on the same
policy objectives to have any hope of success.
Over the past 15 months, however, differences have emerged between the two
institutions. Dr Hamalainen's predecessor, Mr Rolf Kullberg, fought a
rearguard action against the pressures that grew up in parts of industry and
government in support of devaluation.
He failed to hold the line last November when the markka was devalued but
his arguments lost none of their force early this year as it became clear
that the devaluation had not ended the problem but indeed may have actually
made it worse.
The public disagreement between Mr Aho and Mr Kullberg in April did much to
undermine what little faith remained in the markets about Finland's economic
strategy. Mr Kullberg's resignation suggested that the central bank could
not withstand political pressures.
For her part, Dr Hamalainen insists that 'floating the markka is not a good
solution'. She says: 'A fixed exchange rate is the best way to guarantee
stable economic decision-making'. The September 8 decision to float was the
result of what she calls 'a credibility problem'. The markets refused to
believe the Finnish government was serious about its intention to tackle its
budget deficit. 'The reason we floated the markka was because we did not see
any changes coming in the factors that had brought about the lack of
credibility,' Dr Hamalainen explains diplomatically.
She has in mind the absence of any national wage agreement between employers
and trade unions for 1993 as well as government decisions to reduce their
spending drastically. 'Markets in today's uncertainties do not believe in
words, they want to see deeds,' she explains.
The central bank has come under some criticism for its decision to float
without appearing to put up much of a struggle to maintain the markka's
fixed exchange rate. But she asserts that it was clear from the onset that
they would not be able to withstand the pressures from the market as
Finland's capital reserves shrank alarmingly through July and August.
In her opinion Finns are not going back to days of poverty but to the more
balanced economy that existed in the early 1980s before the huge growth in
the public sector. 'There must be structural cuts in spending,' Dr
Hamalainen insists. But this does not mean Finland will have to destroy its
welfare state to please the international markets.
Both the government and the central bank want to see the open industrial
sector grow again to around 30 per cent of Finland's gross domestic product
from its current level of 20 per cent. She also points out that it only
needs a 2 per cent real cut in spending programmes combined with an annual
growth rate of 2 per cent to ensure that Finland meets the criteria laid
down by the European Community at Maastricht last November for membership of
the European Monetary Union.
The floating of the markka displeased Brussels and it appeared to signal to
the outside world that Finland was too ready to break out of even its own
self-imposed constraints such as the linkage of the markka to the Ecu if it
believed it was necessary to do so in its own national interest. Dr
Hamalainen argues that floating was 'less aggressive' to the EC than a
straight devaluation.
She believes that her country needs an external discipline to pursue tighter
fiscal policies. It is hoped to return the markka to the Ecu basket as soon
as possible when the markets have settled down.
But as the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development argued in its annual survey on Finland at the end of August, the
loss of credibility suffered as a result of the November devaluation
'demonstrates the need for a consistent medium-term strategy designed, in
particular, to introduce further discipline in fiscal policy and wage
formation'. Until this has been achieved, the markka may well have to go on
floating. In the weeks ahead Dr Hamalainen may not only have to keep her
nerve but also adopt a stern and unbending attitude towards the government's
budgetary strategy.
She is anxious to make clear that no division of opinion exists any longer
between the central bank and the government on what needs to be done to
restore international confidence in the Finnish currency. But it is going to
need a consistent and perhaps even forceful reassertion by the governor of
the dangers of any more half-hearted or toothless efforts to please the
markets with limited cuts.
Not prone to the melodramatic, she is well aware of the gravity of Finland's
position. The central bank's austere message appears to have got through to
the politicians as well. As custodian of the country's vulnerable currency
Dr Hamalainen is in a strong position to put some backbone into the
government in the coming weeks. If she fails, the prospects for Finland are
grim.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (8): Warming the image of the country -
Trade and Investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of neglect and indifference Finland is promoting itself on
international markets. Several organisations have been established recently
to sell the image of the country abroad to potential buyers of Finnish
products or investors.
An 'Exclusively Finland' campaign was launched earlier this year in Britain
to try to dispel popular ignorance about the country among the UK business
community. A survey of executives carried out for the campaign last December
found that as many as 59 per cent of respondents knew of no manufactured
Finnish products at all while 79 per cent were unable to identify Finland's
main industries and manufacturers. Yet Finland exports over Pounds 2.5bn
worth of goods to the UK a year.
As Exclusively Finland concluded, the findings suggest that most executives
thought that Finland was 'cold and bleak, with an economy based almost
entirely on small traditional cottage industries and forestry'.
The myth of Finland as a Soviet satellite may have long been exposed but it
could need a big promotional effort to alter misconceptions about the
country's economy. As the campaign admitted: 'In contrast to Sweden, very
little is known about Finland, except for its cold climate, low population
and forestry.'
It intends to spend just under Pounds 2m over the next two years to try to
change the false picture business has of the country. In co-ordination with
the Finnish Foreign Trade Association in Helsinki and Finland Trade Centre
in London, the campaign wants in particular to 'raise the profile of Finnish
companies and brands operating in the UK, raise the profile of Finnish
industry and raise the profile of Finland itself'.
Eight Finnish companies have joined the campaign across the wide spectrum of
the country's export products. These are Abloy Locks, the security firm
which is part of the Metra group, Finlandia Vodka owned by Alko, the
state-owned alcohol company, Finlux, which makes audio-visual equipment,
Finnboard, the packaging company, Fiskars, the oldest industrial corporation
in Finland that makes high quality scissors, kitchen utensils and garden
tools and acquired in 1988 the Wilkinson Sword group of the UK; Kulta Beer
brewed by the Hartwall Beverages company, Panda Liqorice and Saab Valmet,
the top of the range Saab 9000 CS car maker.
At the same time there is an increasing interest in Finland in encouraging
inward investment. In August the government introduced legislation expected
to come into force from the beginning of 1993 which will lift most of the
controls and rules that have inhibited foreign companies from moving
production capacity and offices to Finland in the past.
The new laws will end the current division between restricted and free
shares by making all shares free and therefore acquirable by foreigners
without limitation. Finnish companies do not have to amend their own
articles of association for this change to come into effect.
The reform will also enable the transfer of a Finnish company into foreign
ownership without being subject to restriction. However, the transfer of the
largest 100 Finnish companies with over 1,000 workers on their payroll and a
turnover or year end assets totalling FM1bn or more into foreign hands will
be monitored until 1996. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will have to
approve if the buyer wants to acquire ownership or control of at least a
third of the voting rights in the company.
The state will continue to have the right to intervene if it believes the
acquisition by a foreign company of a large Finnish concern jeopardises the
national interest. But the government has made it clear it would use its
blocking powers against an individual deal 'only in very extreme
circumstances'. After 1996 the monitoring system will end except for
companies that manufacture defence equipment.
It is not just industrial companies that are to be covered by the new law.
Banks and insurance companies will also be included. Moreover, real estate
acquisition by non-residents of Finland will no longer be subject to
government permission though a permit will still be needed where the
transfer 'is intended for leisure-time dwelling or for recreational
purposes'.
Earlier in the year a new body called Invest in Finland was established at
the Finnish Foreign Trade Association with the specific aim of supplying
potential investors with detailed information on the country's business
environment. Mr Erkki Karmila is the first head of the new bureau.
He believes Finland's geographical position can be of real advantage in
attracting overseas investors as a 'superb gateway' to Russia and the newly
independent Baltic states with rapidly improving road and rail networks and
telecommunication links
'We are going through our most fundamental change since independence on our
way into an integrated western Europe,' explains Mr Karmila. 'This is a very
good time for foreigners to invest here with the low value of company shares
on the bourse.' Several foreign companies - Asea Brown-Boveri, ICL and the
Norwegian Kvaerner group - already operate in Finland. The Saab Valmet plant
is the pride of Saab Auto AB for the high level of its shopfloor
productivity.
But as Mr Karmila points out, before 1939 Finland's prosperity owed much to
the involvement of foreign capital. The industrialisation of the country in
paper, shipbuilding and engineering stemmed in part from British, French and
German investment. In other words, the integration of Finland into the
western economies over the next few years will bring the country back to
what it was even before its independence in 1917 from Russia, part of a
wider and open international trading system.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (11): Taking the sauna way of life - How
the Finns relax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND IS the homeland of the sauna. To most Finns it is neither a luxury
nor a status symbol but very much a way of life. There are an estimated 1.5m
saunas in a country with a population of only 5m. Indeed, no city apartment
seems to be complete without one. Most Finns take one to two saunas a week.
The sauna is traditionally made up of a hot room, washroom and a dressing
room, and its walls are constructed mainly out of either pine or spruce with
concrete floors. The stove or open fireplace of stones lies at the centre of
the sauna, heated by electricity in urban areas and by wood in the
countryside.
The technique of the sauna involves throwing the heated water onto the
stones to intensify the humidity. The air temperature around your head needs
to be 80-100 centigrade and ventilation should be regulated at 60kg an hour.
The sauna is nothing like a shower. The more time you spend in it, the more
relaxed you become as you sit naked on a small towel on wooden planks and
absorb the heat through your pores, hitting yourself from time to time with
bundles of birch leaves to intensify the sweating. Coming out, you should
take a cold swim and then drink some fresh juice or beer. Up in Lapland in
the winter, a sauna is generally followed by a run into the snow.
The sauna is not merely a washing place for Finns but also somewhere to
create a sense of well-being and relaxation. It has been recommended as a
useful antidote to modern stress, although many Finnish businessman tend to
carry their work troubles into the sauna where they can discuss them
together with their male colleagues, away from eavesdroppers.
There are plenty of don'ts about taking a sauna. Warnings are given that
there should not be a competition to see who can stand the highest
temperature. Big meals and alcohol need to be avoided beforehand. People
with high blood pressure or heart complaints should avoid swimming in cold
water after their sauna.
The Finns are annoyed at the way in which the sauna, like the massage
parlour, has degenerated abroad into a kind of sexual experience.
Traditionally, it has served in rural areas as not just a health centre for
all the family but also as a maternity clinic. There are no signs that the
sauna is in decay. On the contrary, it remains an important daily event for
most Finns.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (5): Taxpayer faces bill - Problems of the
banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINNISH banking system continues to face severe problems as it wrestles
with huge credit losses. Last year they amounted to 1.6 per cent of total
loans compared with only 0.5 per cent in 1990. The banks suffered a total
operating deficit of around FM5bn in 1991 and credit losses soared to
FM7.6bn while non-performing loans totalled FM40bn.
Earlier this year, there was a serious danger of a weakening in the capital
adequacy of the banks with a resulting restriction in the supply of credit
available to customers which would have deepened the recession. From 1993,
all banks involved in international operations must maintain an 8 per cent
capital ratio.
Many of the troubles facing Finland's banks were due to their own mistakes.
The picture is similar to that of the other Nordic regions with
over-extended use of credit at excessively low rates of interest and
inadequate collateral, a lax system of checking customer creditworthiness,
risky investments in real estate and a wasteful use of resources.
But the position was made worse by the last government's loose fiscal policy
at the end of the 1980s and the reckless atmosphere caused by sudden
financial deregulation. Finnish companies and households were swept up in a
free-wheeling spree.
The severity of the bank crisis has forced the Finnish public authorities to
intervene increasingly since the central bank rode to the rescue of
Skopbank, the country's fourth largest commercial bank in September 1991. It
was helped through a FM2bn capital injection and a radical restructuring of
the bank that involved creation of three separate holding companies to cover
industry, shareholdings and real estate. Outstanding loans valued at FM2bn
were written off.
In March this year an attempt was made by the government to try to restore
confidence in the financial system as a whole. This involved both a plan for
government investments totalling FM8bn in certificates issued by the banks
and the creation of a government bank guarantee fund on Norwegian lines with
maximum liabilities totalling FM20bn.
At the same time the government has been actively encouraging a substantial
consolidation of Finland's banking sector through mergers and amalgamations.
Forty-one of the country's regional savings banks were brought together in
one organisation to be called the Savings Bank of Finland. The future of
Skopbank is under discussion at the moment between the government guarantee
fund and the leading commercial banks, most notably the Union Bank of
Finland.
Ministers remain concerned about the further demands that are likely to be
made on the state by the ailing financial sector in the months ahead which
could add substantially to the budget deficit. The government has made it
clear that it will underpin the system. No bank is going to collapse. But
the total cost to the taxpayer of saving the financial sector from the
follies of the late 1980s remains uncertain.
Clearly, this vague further demand on budget resources will add to the
government's debt burden and make it even harder and more painful to make
the cuts designed to calm the uneasy markets.
'Additional resources will be needed,' admits Dr Sirkka Hamalainen, the
central bank governor. Mr Aho, the prime minister, also emphasises the
troubles of Finland's banking sector along with the cost of unemployment and
falling tax revenues to explain Finland's budget deficit.
It will take a long time for Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest
commercial bank, to recover from its financial troubles. Last month KOP had
to accept a FM1.73bn capital injection from the government to strengthen its
capital base and improve its capital requirement ratio by 1.5 per cent to
8.8 per cent.
'The bank's troubles are much worse than I expected when I arrived here,'
admits Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP's chief executive officer since last
February. Since he took over, Mr Voutilainen has halved the size of the
executive board and pushed through a 10 per cent cut in the number of staff
employed which will be completed this year.
Above all, he has launched a strategy designed to focus KOP's activities on
basic banking services through a relocation of its resources. There is less
concentration now on real estate management and the equity portfolio. KOP
has decided to concentrate its international activities on customers
directly involved with Scandinavia. 'We are going to do what we can do
best,' explains Mr Voutilainen.
But the troubles at KOP are deep-seated and they look like persisting for
the time being.
The Union Bank of Finland, the country's other leading commercial bank, also
has problems. In August it issued a maximum FM950m convertible bond loan to
strengthen its capital base by improving its lending ability to the tune of
FM10bn. With a capital adequacy of 10.7 per cent and a 7.4 per cent for its
tier one capital, the bank has a strong position by international standards.
But, like others, it has gone through substantial restructuring. This month
the group's new organisation came into force when Unitas became a holding
company with subsidiaries for commercial banking and strategic holdings.
In June it moved its investment banking operations to a separate company,
called Mandatum. All Union Bank's merchant banking activities were
transferred to the company, which does not form part of the Unitas Group but
became a partnership. 'This reorganisation will re-enforce the Chinese walls
between commercial and merchant banking operations,' says Mr Vesa Vainio,
Union Bank president.
Last year the bank suffered an operating deficit before extraordinary items,
appropriations and taxes of FM128m compared with a FM480m profit in 1990 and
this year the loss will be higher. The bank expects a further loss in 1993.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (6): Fifth reactor planned - Nuclear
Energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT decision is imminent on whether Finland is going to have a
fifth 1000MW nuclear power station to meet its future energy needs.
Most of the signs suggest that the politicians will bow to the demands of
the country's main energy intensive export industries, most notably
forestry, and recommend the go-ahead. A final decision will rest with
parliament, but Finland's anti-nuclear movement may find it difficult in
present circumstances to mount an effective campaign against a proposal to
build a fifth reactor.
The power companies submitted an application for a decision in principle for
a new nuclear facility in May 1991 and it has led to some serious divisions
inside the cabinet of the centre-right government. If the green light is
given, the new nuclear station could begin production by the end of the
century.
An added complication to the energy debate in Finland is the on-and-off
discussion over the proposed pipeline to bring natural gas from the Norway's
Haltenbanken field in the North Sea, with its known 300bn cubic metres of
reserves, across Sweden and under the Gulf of Bothnia to Finland. The
pipeline, which could be built by the Neste company by 1998, is seen by some
observers as an alternative to a fifth nuclear power plant but this looks
unlikely. For its part, Neste says it is complementary to the nuclear
decision.
For Finland's export industries the crucial factor in energy supply is
price. At present, they enjoy some of the cheapest industrial energy prices
in the world, due largely to the nuclear power component. If they became
more dependent on imported coal or natural gas - neither of which exists in
Finland - their energy costs would rise.
There is also talk of using biomass - organic waste products - as an
alternative fuel source. But few observers believe that this technology
could compete commercially with nuclear energy. Finland may have abundant
supplies of wood chips, bark and wastewood to burn, currently producing
about 15 to 16 per cent of total energy needs. But this appears to be the
commercial limit for this form of fuel, particularly if an upturn in the
forestry industry increased demand for wood.
Imatran Voima (IVO), the Finnish power generating company, makes no secret
of its own preference. It wants parliament to approve the fifth nuclear
reactor. Indeed, IVO has already drawn up a short list of six different
choices of reactor. The company has no wish to delay making its choice once
it has the opportunity to push ahead. It runs already the two Soviet built
445MW pressurised water reactors at Loviisa which were established in May
1977 and January 198I.
IVO is a state-owned company which is Finland's largest supplier and seller
of wholesale electricity. It is also the country's leading producer of
electricity as well as being the second largest producer of district heat.
Last year its power generation totalled 12.313bn GWh, with just over half
that coming from nuclear power followed by coal, peat, hydropower, natural
gas, oil and industrial waste and 0.16 GWh from wind power.
The company does not confine its business activities to Finland. It runs an
international subsidiary which was responsible for an estimated 660 projects
and assignments in 24 countries last year. IVO is involved in a number of
operations in the Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania as well as Abu Dhabi and Nepal.
It has recently constructed a factory to manufacture district heating pipes
in St Petersburg.
Earlier this year, IVO teamed up with Jaakko Poyry Oy, the Finnish forestry
consulting and engineering company, in the creation of an organisation
called the Energy Consultation Group with the objective of improving energy
efficiency in areas of Russia neighbouring the Finnish border.
The two companies, which together employ 3,000 engineers familiar with the
Russian energy sector, are in a good position to provide the necessary
know-how for a substantial improvement in heating and energy conservation
projects in Russia. The trouble, however, is the financing of such schemes
and private companies are looking to the Finnish government to back what
they want to do.
There is little doubting the concern among ministers about the safety of
Russia's nuclear power stations close to Finland's eastern border. Earlier
this year, the government earmarked FM6.4m for co-operation with Russia on
nuclear safety on the Kola peninsula, where there are four 440MW light-water
reactors of the VVER type, and at the Sosnovy Bor power station in St
Petersburg which includes 1,000MW graphite-moderated reactors of the RBMK
type, similar to the one at Chernobyl.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (7): Kvaerner to the rescue - Shipbuilding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY FINNS regard Mr Martin Saarikangas as the saviour of their country's
shipbuilding industry. President and chief executive officer of Kvaerner
Masa-Yards, he is a larger than life character with a lifetime in making
ships. When Wartsila Marine went bankrupt in October 1989, this huge man
came to the rescue.
After working at the yards for nearly 30 years, he had a strong disagreement
with the old Wartsila management in 1985 over its future strategy. He lost
the argument and went into virtual exile in the US, only to return when the
company fell into severe financial trouble.
At that time the company yards were run with the co-operation of the
original shareholders, including the Finnish government, the Union Bank of
Finland and a number of shipping companies which had placed orders with
Wartsila before it went bankrupt.
This could never have been more than a temporary solution. Mr Saarikangas
and others searched for a new, more permanent owner who would keep the yards
in Helsinki and Turku open. 'We needed a strong shareholder. We could not
exist alone,' he argues. A 'Finnish solution' was found to be impossible but
in autumn 1990 the Norwegian industrial company Kvaerner came to the rescue
with NKr700m, becoming owner on March 22 last year.
Some Finns questioned whether the fate of a large part of their country's
shipbuilding industry should depend on the attitude of a foreign concern
such as Kvaerner but their doubts appear to have been misplaced. In fact,
the Norwegian company has an interest in practically every segment of
shipping and there are obvious synergies to the benefit of the Masa yards.
As Mr Saarikangas explained in last year's annual report: 'Our strength
today within passenger shipbuilding and the Arctic segment will also
diversify into the field of oil and gas exploration and bring new orders to
our yards in Finland thus improving our competitiveness and labour
situation.'
In the last financial year the yards made a profit (after financial items)
of FM270.9m and achieved total net sales of FM1.910bn but this year the
performance is not expected to be as good.
The change of ownership at the yards has brought with it a clear change in
business attitudes. Mr Saarikangas has sought to transform shopfloor
attitudes with the introduction of teams into workplace organisation and a
considerable cut in overhead costs. The company has pushed through a
multi-million markka programme of retraining that was completed this summer.
He is very critical of the way in which the yards were managed during the
1980s. 'Many important basic values were forgotten,' he argues. In his
opinion there had to be a return to 'basics, such as appreciation of work,
high quality, honesty and reliability.' But this has not meant a return to a
macho style of management. Mr Saarikangas is keen to stress the need for
involvement in ship production at all levels of the workforce. 'We need good
human relations and a strong belief in our own skills,' he argues.
The transformation in the yards has begun but he accepts it will take time,
patience and a constant emphasis on efficiency before the company can reach
a position where it can survive.
The immediate outlook remains uncertain as long as the recession continues
in Europe and the US. This has inevitably brought postponement of new
projects and few new orders in shipping. But Mr Saarikangas says that the
mid-1990s will be 'a good time' for the industry and for the company.
At present the yards have an order book valued at FM6.5bn. There are enough
orders to ensure the Helsinki yard is kept fully employed until the second
half of 1995 but at Turku, where the yard is one of the largest and most
modern in Europe, the outlook is uncertain with the last order due for
completion by the third quarter of next year.
But a question mark hangs over the prospects of any revival in the
traditional export orders from the Finnish yards to Russia which collapsed
two years ago with the end of the old clearing house trade system.
At that time, it produced devastation at the yards as a quarter of the order
book in Helsinki and the whole order book in Turku was linked to the then
Soviet market. 'There is still turbulence in the restructuring process. One
must not expect any short-term solutions which would lead to opportunities
of new shipbuilding orders,' he says.
Though the yards are now part of a Norwegian company, 'we are very much one
big family,' says Mr Saarikangas. He sees their future in the construction
of high quality merchant and passenger vessels as well as specialised boats
such as ice-breakers, leaving the volume bulk ships to the low-cost parts of
the industry in south-east Asia.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Uncertainty reigns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE month money in the sterling cash market fell below the 9 per cent base
rate figure as dealers started to discount the possibility of another cut in
UK rates before next week's Conservative party conference.
The rate for three month money fell to 8 15/16 per cent on the offered side
as dealers speculated that the Chancellor would take the opportunity to cut
rates next week. That view was reinforced by sterling's slightly stronger
performance on the foreign exchanges, with the currency rising more than a
pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday to close at DM2.52.
However, there is continuing doubt about the direction of the UK
government's economic policy, and trading was thin. Sterling futures tracked
a different course from the cash market. The December contract fell one
basis point from its opening level of 91.81 to close at 91.80, reflecting a
slightly firmer view on rates. Strictly speaking, the closing price assumes
that 3-month money at the year's end will be at 8.2 per cent.
There was no clear indication from the German money market as to the
possible outcome of this Friday's Bundesbank council meeting. The German
central bank again drained liquidity from the money market in the morning by
sales of short-term Treasury bills. It is trying to combat the after effects
of the recent interventions to support sterling and the Italian lira.
The colossal scale of that intervention is becoming increasingly clear, with
the bank reporting that its gross currency reserves were boosted by DM44.3bn
in the week to September 23. This does not take into account the full cost
of intervening to support the French franc, and one London-analyst believe
that the final cost may be around DM90bn.
However, the Bundesbank later tempered the move by lending funds to banks at
a rate well above the market level. It injected funds into the market at a
rate of 9.20 per cent, slightly above call money which traded at 8.80-9.00
per cent.
In its money market operations, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of
Pounds 800m in the morning and, in early operations, purchased Pounds 450m
in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later
revised down to Pounds 500m and late assistance was provided of Pounds 55m.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses ground to DM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR lost nearly three pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as
traders took an increasingly gloomy view of the US economy, writes James
Blitz.
As tensions continue to unwind in the European exchange rate mechanism, the
dollar is losing its status as a safe haven currency and dealers have more
time to focus on the fundamental weakness in the US economy. This switch of
attention looks set to continue throughout this week, with Friday earmarked
as a decisive day for currencies in both Europe and the US in the medium
term.
On Friday morning, the Bundesbank council will meet for the first time since
the ERM crisis, with many dealers thinking that there will be another cut in
short term rates. At lunchtime on Friday, the non-farm payroll figure for
August will be released, giving dealers and the Federal Reserve the clearest
indication yet of whether another cut in interest rates is needed.
The view that a US rate cut was in the offing gathered momentum yesterday.
The US leading indicators fell 0.2 per cent in August, some way adrift from
market forecasts of a 0.1 per cent rise. The conference board measure of
consumer confidence for September dropped to 56.6, the weakest reading in
seven months.
According to Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice president at Bank of America in London,
these figures suggest that the non-farm payroll figure will be poor. 'The
dollar could well revisit the old lows on the assumption that there is every
chance of a cut in rates, compounded by uncertainty over the US election,'he
said. The dollar closed in London at DM1.4240, compared to a previous close
of DM1.4510.
How low the dollar goes depends on what the Bundesbank does this Friday.
When it cut its Lombard rate by 0.25 of a percentage point on September 14,
the Bundesbank gave the strong impression that this it could not relax
monetary policy by any greater amount. That view was reinforced by the
growth in gross currency reserves by DM44.3bn in the week to September 23 as
a result of intervention to support ERM currencies.
Fears that the German economy is weakening and that the ERM will not hold
together may bring a rate cut. The Bundesbank is committed to avoiding a
French franc devaluation, but yesterday the French currency lost some of the
ground made on Monday, closing nearly a centime down against the D-Mark at
FFr3.3810. That is nearly 5 centimes above the ERM floor against the D-Mark.
But overnight rates in the French cash market remained at the 26 per cent to
28 per cent level yesterday, suggesting that the French money markets are
taking a cautious view of the situation.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (8): Declining
prices create havoc for industry - Survival now depends on big sales volumes
and new software and services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN 1992 the computer industry's 'Big Myth'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that powerful computers are technical marvels which demand high prices - was
finally laid to rest.
A year ago, the cheapest notebook computer based on the best-selling Intel
80/386 microprocessor chip and manufactured by Compaq, the market leader in
high performance personal computers, cost Pounds 2,775 in the UK. Today,
Compaq's cheapest 80/386 based notebook, the Contura 3/20, costs only Pounds
995, one of the most dramatic examples of the way prices have collapsed over
the past few years.
PC prices have been falling by an average of between 25 and 40 per cent a
year and there is no reason to suppose they have reached the bottom.
In few industries have high priced, high technology products become
commodity items in such a short time. It is causing serious problems for
established manufacturers and creating havoc in the supplier channels, where
margins have been shaved unbearably thin.
Computer dealers can survive now only if they sell hardware in large volumes
or if they can add extra value in the form of software and services.
The recession apart, prices have fallen because of declining component
prices which have lowered entry barriers to the industry and helped to
stimulate intense competition.
A year ago, for example, a 20-megahertz Intel 386SX microprocessor, the
workhorse of the industry, cost Dollars 88 in 1,000-part lots; now the same
chip costs only Dollars 57.50 in the same quantity. Pressure on
microprocessor pricing is helped by competition from a number of
semiconductor manufacturers, notably AMD and Cyrix, which are developing
chips functionally identical to Intel's industry standard devices. Some
suppliers are also prepared to accept much smaller profit margins than is
customary in the computer industry.
Manufacturers traditionally expect a 60 per cent gross profit margin on
mainframes, 40 per cent on mid-range systems and 20 per cent on PCs.
Automated manufacturing techniques and more economic channels of
distribution are allowing some manufacturers to work on much tighter
margins.
Many are based in Asia and constitute the biggest chunk of a new market
segment - the so called 'no name' segment, which according to the
consultancy InfoCorp Europe may now be greater than 30 per cent of the
total. Growth in this segment of the market is greater than elsewhere in the
PC business which is why no manufacturer can afford to ignore it. Across
Europe it is expanding at 45 per cent a year as opposed to 21 per cent for
the whole PC market.
Dell Computer, a clone maker based in the US broke the mould by pioneering
direct sales in the West through mail order. Compaq was one of the first
victims. A year ago it reported its first ever loss after taking a Dollars
135m restructuring charge to pay for 1700 redundancies.
Under new chief executive Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, the company changed tack
decisively. It cut prices, sought manufacturing economies and announced a
new range of low cost products. Compaq's challenge was to maintain its
quality image with products cheap enough to compete in the lower regions of
the market.
It seems to be succeeding. In July it reported a 43 per cent jump in second
quarter income, the first year to year improvement in Compaq's earnings
since the beginning of 1991.
It also warned that it was suffering from a parts shortage because of the
popularity of its new machines. In some cases it has lost orders as a
result. Warned there would be a two month wait for Compaq Prolinea
computers, a customer bought extensive numbers of a 'no-name' brand.
Dell, meanwhile, is prospering. Its quarterly results, published last month,
show a year on year growth of 129 per cent and net profits up 77 per cent.
It has Dollars 122m in cash and operating costs of only 16 per cent of
sales.
International Business Machines (IBM), the world leader in PCs, is taking a
diversity of approaches. In Europe, for example, it has established a wholly
owned, subsidiary, Individual Computer Products International (ICPI) to take
on the no-name manufacturers directly.
The company will source products on the open market, selling them through a
variety of channels - dealers, retailers and direct sales. The name of the
products - Ambra - gives no clue to their parentage. IBM is clearly trying
to carve out a share of the low-end market for itself without compromising
its credibility as a quality manufacturer.
Earlier this month, the company announced it was splitting off its PC
operations as a separate business within the corporation. The new unit, the
IBM Personal Computer Company, will have responsibility for developing,
manufacturing, distributing and marketing the company's entire range of PCs.
The idea is to give the unit more freedom in setting budgets, sourcing
components and recruiting staff.
The first products from the new division, three models in IBM's entry level
PS/1 range, were launched earlier this month.
The rush for the lower ground has even enveloped Apple, which has ploughed
its own furrow through the computer industry since its early days. The
company, which traditionally charged premium prices for its easy-to-use
Macintosh technology, introduced cheaper versions last year and earlier this
month introduced a new line of low-cost machines that it will sell through
mass-market retailers.
Models in the new range, known as Performa, will sell for between Dollars
1,250 and Dollars 2,900 in the US. It seems likely, however, that selling
the new range through retailers will cause conflict with Apple's traditional
dealers who will have to compete against the new machines with more
expensive Macintosh products.
Price reductions and new low cost models continue to come thick and fast.
Digital Equipment, hitherto an also ran in the PC stakes, has launched a
386SX computer with colour screen for Pounds 850.
How much further can prices decline? Few would give hostages to fortune by
hazarding a guess in such a volatile industry, but at least 20 per cent
seems likely next year. The principal effect of the past year, according to
InfoCorp, however, is to narrow the average system, price differential
between a first tier vendor - Compaq or IBM, say, and the no-name third tier
suppliers from Pounds 600 to Pounds 100.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (9): Clicking on
Bogart - Multi-media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTI-MEDIA has been a buzzword in the personal computer industry for almost
five years, yet few mainstream PC applications have been produced using this
innovative technology - that is, until now.
There are good reasons for this - the computer hardware which provided the
power and function necessary to adequately run multi-media applications
(combining speech, music, graphics, animation and still pictures) was
expensive and multi-media development standards not firmly fixed.
But now that PCs are capable of producing digital sound - and use CD-ROMs
(Compact Disc - Read Only Memory) to read data and display high- resolution
colour images, animation, sound and speech - multi-media systems are
starting to become lower-cost commodities.
In fact, manufacturers in the US have made moves in recent weeks to make
multi-media computer hardware even less expensive. Zenith Data Systems and
Tandy Computer have both announced plans to produce 'multi-media players'
based around Tandy's new Video Information System standard - which allows
multi-media software based on Microsoft's Windows system to be played
through standard US television sets.
Meanwhile Apple Computer, one of the pioneers of the multi-media market, has
also announced new systems in the US that also make it cheaper to use
multi-media technology with its Apple Macintosh range. There are probably
more multi-media applications for the Macintosh than any other type of PC,
which has been capable of using CD-ROM-based software for more than four.
The CD-ROM systems at the heart of most multi-media designs are based on the
same technology as ordinary home CD audio players - and can actually play
audio CDs as well as those containing computer information.
But as CD-ROM compact discs can hold about 450 times as much information as
the average computer floppy disk - and cost little to produce - they are
becoming a popular add-on to PCs. Having this much space also means that far
less printed material clutters up the desk.
Using, for example, the multi-media edition of Microsoft's integrated Works
for Windows software, no longer means scrambling around to find one of
several bulky manuals - and then spending another 10 minutes wishing that
there was somebody around to actually demonstrate how to solve the problem.
Multi-media technology, allows users to lock up their program manuals in a
vault and means they should never have to look at them again. For almost any
function, the multi-media edition of products such as this have an animated
sequence, a tutorial section or a narrated 'short film' that will take the
user through any problems, step by step.
In all, there are 42 lessons in the Microsoft Works on-line tutorial - each
of which has associated overviews comprising multi-media movies and
animation. It is typical of the kind of work that is being done in the
multi-media sphere to make computer software easier to use.
Another method being employed is to imitate real-world technology for
controlling software. In most multi-media applications, for example, these
are standard VCR-like controls - so that users can fast forward, rewind,
pause and playback any audio or video sequences they want to see again. This
is all part of showing people how to use PCs in a non-threatening way.
The list of requirements to run an average multi-media application on an
IBM-compatible PC is somewhat longer than the average. MS-DOS version 3.1 is
needed or, later, Microsoft's CD-ROM extensions version 2.2 or later, a PC
with a 16Mhz 386SX processor (although some sound and animation sequences
will run on the kinds of less powerful 10Mhz 80286-based multi-media
machines sold by some manufacturers) and Version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows
(although most are still able to operate using Windows 3.0 with Multi-media
Extensions version 1).
In addition to all this, 2Mb or memory of system memory is needed (4Mb is
recommended), at least 30Mb of hard disk space, a CD-ROM with an access time
of less than one second and a 150K per second data transfer rate. Needless
to say, a VGA display adaptor is a requirement - as is an audio board with
speakers or headphones.
But once equipped with all this, the list of possible multi-media
applications seems endless.
It already includes animated 'talking books' for children, encyclopedias,
dictionaries, an atlas (which not only shows maps and flags of the world,
but also plays the anthems of most countries), 'biographies' of famous
people with on- screen examples of their work and super-realistic computer
games.
Microsoft chairman Mr Bill Gates offers an interesting insight into the
future of this technology. At a recent briefing to US financial analysts',
he talked about a multi-media product he hopes will help move Microsoft to
the centre stage of the consumer electronics market.
It is a CD-based film guide for cinema buffs. Entitled 'Cinemania', it is a
guide to anything and everything you might want to know about movies. It
includes a powerful database 'search engine' with text information on more
than 19,000 films - as well as lots of digitised pictures and sound clips
from films.
If, for example, someone wanted to know all the films that Humphrey Bogart
starred in during the Second World War that won an Academy award, he or she
would just enter that criteria on a form-screen that looks like a VCR remote
controller.
Cinemania then comes back with the answer 'Casablanca' and offers the user a
huge variety of other information. It is possible to see a review of the
film, an article about the making of it and obtain information on any of the
leading actors, the director or the studio which produced it.
By clicking on Bogart's name, for example, the user is offered a complete
biography of him, featuring pictures, sound samples of him taken from
various films and lists of all the films he has ever starred in. And that,
as the man says, could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (7): Products
taking time to materialise - Steven Sonsino finds the debate over the
viability of the pen computer market is continuing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN SONSINO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMAGINE a nightnurse coming to the last patient on his rounds. He checks his
notes for the correct prescription and dose, administers the drug and then
signs a chit for the store keeper in the morning.
This chit, however, is not a scrap of paper. It is a blank form held on disc
on the nurse's notebook computer. He fills it in, by ticking boxes on the
liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, and then he signs it - all with a
cordless electronic stylus.
The system recognises the electronic signature, prompts the nurse to fill in
all the necessary details and files the chit away in its memory.
The system also recognises the way in which the nurse signs his name - how
much pressure he uses on the screen and how fast he moves the stylus - as an
additional security check.
Back in the office, the off-duty nurse docks his notebook computer with the
office PC, which automatically transmits the night's data to the stores
computer over a mile away. This, in turn, updates the weekly purchase
requisition forms, for the pharmaceuticals suppliers, as well as the patient
records system, for the hospital consultants. Then it prepares the morning's
rounds lists, for the day nurses.
Much of the technology for achieving this high-tech healthcare exists today,
including the hardware and software behind the pen computer system at its
heart. The LCD screens are those used in laptops and portable PCs. The power
supplies and hard disc memory drives - up to 120Mbyte in one pen computer
system - are also the same. The only difference is the lack of the keyboard,
which has lead to the machines being christened 'sans clavier' in France:
systems without keyboards.
This name is perhaps more appropriate than the US-inspired 'pen computers',
as the tyranny of the keyboard is truly at an end, says Mr Carl Billson,
general manager of Tangent Associates. 'The thing that distinguishes these
machines from existing products is their ease of use,' he says.
'You've generally got a larger screen and you're not forcing people to enter
data in a specific sequential order. It's intuitive.'
Tangent, a software house and pen computer specialist, one of only a handful
in the pen computing arena, has been working on techniques for collecting
physical numerical data for four years, ever since it evolved as an
industrial consultancy from the Loughborough University of Technology.
But, like others in the data logging and collection sphere, Tangent sees its
work with rugged Husky portables and with Psion Organisers as little more
than history now.
Its work on the Freestyle pen computing projects, the exploratory
development of industrial pen computing, sponsored in part by the Department
of Trade and Industry, points the way forward.
'The total budget for Freestyle 2 is Pounds 0.5m. About a third will come
from the DTI and the rest from us and our business partners in industry,
says Mr Billson.'
Tangent's main target customers in industry include the public utilities and
local authorities, whose engineers and auditors may need to update maps of
street lighting and underground sewage channels, for instance. The company
is currently presenting pen computing to a range of potential clients.
But customers for the pen computer concept will also include business men
and women, more familiar perhaps with the Filofax or the laptop computer,
but hungry for the latest executive toy.
In spite of much hype from vendors, it has taken time for products to
materialise. The palm-sized GridPad-SL from Victor Technologies was for nine
months virtually the only pen-based system on the market. Now there are more
powerful 386-based machines available, Samsung's Pen Master 386L, for
instance.
Also available is a 640x200 screen system from Poqet, the Fujitsu
subsidiary, and the low resolution EH10 from ATS in Manchester. This rugged
industrial machine uses a 320x200 resolution touch screen from Hitachi.
Another pen computer manufacturer in the north of England is Eden, which has
licensed its 386-based VPi-386 machine to Trigem among others. The first
386-based pen system, however, was System 3125 from NCR, supporting 4Mbyte
of RAM and a 20Mbyte hard disc.
Reports from software developers which have signed non-disclosure agreements
with manufacturers suggest that there are other developments on the way.
Among developments worth watching are a 286-based system with digital voice
recording from one US company and a Risc-based machine from EO Europe of
Cambridge.
IBM is also interested in the technology, so watch for offerings from that
camp, too, and from Apple, whose Newton system is due to be launched in
Spring 1993 at less than Dollars 1,000. What Apple envisages is computers
from wristwatch to whiteboard-size, so it needs consumer electronics
know-how to crack those markets.
With this in mind, it becomes clear why Apple has licensed Newton technology
to both Sharp Electronics and Toshiba. It has also approached other Japanese
consumer electronics companies looking for buyers. Expect Sony to be on the
shortlist, for its strengths in screen technology and Walkman marketing.
With a band of hardware vendors of this calibre offering one-off systems
prices ranging from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 2,500 in the UK, buyers can soon
expect power performance enhancements, increasing disc size and rapid
improvements in screen technology. Colour screens and higher resolution
should also become widely available.
Software standards, too, will remain flexible for a while. Outside the
Newton environment two contenders exist for a standard operating system:
Microsoft's Windows for Pen Computing, with support from more than 120
software vendors including Borland and Corel, and PenPoint from GO
Corporation.
But the debate is not simple: IBM is working on a version of the OS/2
operating system for pen environ ments.
So the pen market is going to be vendor-driven for some time and it is here
that the biggest questions arise. Market research figures, for instance, and
vendor estimates of sales vary enormously, but they tend to be high. One
report suggests that 4m pen computers will have shipped by 1995. Compare
this with GridPad's sales in 1991-92, which were estimated at around 40,000
units by Dream IT, a US market research firm.
'The whole pen market has been bedevilled by hype and over-hype,' says Mr
Billson of Tangent. 'Excessive predictions were made on sales and these
haven't borne fruit.'
While Mr Billson attributes this in part to a lack of choice for developers
and buyers, there are other issues, he says. 'Apple, for example, has
announced Newton. They've announced release dates and so on, but who knows
whether they're doing that to create an element of FUD - fear, uncertainty
and doubt - in the market.' Fear in the market may restrain buyers and
developers from committing heavily to other products, he says.
Apple, however, stands by its position and the predictions for the market
that Mr John Sculley made earlier this year. The market will be worth
Dollars 3,000bnby the turn of the century, he said.
'This might seem a surprise,' says Mr Ajaz Ahmed for Apple UK, 'but the
figures are based on Apple surveys which show that computers and
communications products are going to merge. And the merger between them is
going to be the Personal Digital Assistant, or Newton.'
And the reasons Apple announced Newton in May of this year? 'Simply to help
developers generate products for the environment and to reduce the volume of
speculation about what we were doing,' he says.
So the debate about the viability of the market will continue. What is
clear, though, is that the technology for pen computing does exist. 'It's
not vapour-ware,' says Apple's Mr Ahmed. The only hurdle, therefore, seems
to be the application itself and whether sceptical buyers see a real use for
these systems in the workplace. Don't write off the keyboard yet.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (3): Allies needed
in fight for survival - Paul Taylor examines the European industry's
response to intense competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European personal computer industry remains in a state of turmoil with
new products such as lightweight notebook portables stealing the limelight,
old distribution channels under threat from direct sales and hardware prices
continuing to tumble.
Figures from Dataquest, the market research group, underline the dynamics of
the European PC marketplace. Spurred by growing sales of portables, overall
PC unit shipments rose by 5 per cent in the 1992 first half but, because of
fierce price competition and falling margins, the value of shipments fell by
8 per cent across Europe.
Hounded by the PC clone-makers who assemble commodity-priced components from
Far Eastern suppliers and savaged by the successful direct sellers from both
sides of the Atlantic - such as Dell and AST of the US and smaller UK-based
companies such as Elonex and Opus Technology - the established PC
manufacturers have had to respond.
Even International Business Machines (IBM) and Compaq, which still head the
European PC sales league table, were forced to slash prices and launch
cut-price clones of their own earlier this year in an effort to preserve
market shares.
Meanwhile, those established in the European computer industry - such as
Olivetti, Bull and Siemens Nixdorf - have also been under intense price and
product pressure, but know that PC's represent a critical source of revenues
they cannot afford to lose.
In their battle to survive they have been forming new alliances aimed at
securing access to the Risc (reduced instruction set computing)
micro-processors expected to power future generations of desktop PCs as well
as engineering and scientific workstations. In the process, Europe has
become a battleground for the US computer giants trying to tie up markets
for their new chip technologies.
Few, if any, of the European players can afford the heavy research and
development costs needed to stay ahead in the chip development race, while
US groups have the technology but need European partners to provide access
to Europe's fragmented markets. In July, one of the final pieces of puzzle
fell into place when Digital Equipment (DEC) of the US reached an agreement
to acquire up to a 10 per cent stake in Olivetti of Italy at a cost of
Dollars 370m, well over twice the market value.
Groupe Bull of France began the process in 1989 by paying Dollars 500m to
acquire Zenith Data Systems (ZDS) of the US. Zenith has since become central
to Bull's recovery plan and its aggressive push into the desktop PC and
fast-growing portable notebook market.
Bull is hoping ZDS will provide up to 40 per cent of overall revenues by
1994, compared with about 20 per cent of its Dollars 6bn revenues now.
According to Dataquest, ZDS lifted Bull into sixth position in the European
PC market in terms of value last year, behind IBM, Compaq, Apple, Olivetti
and Commodore.
IBM, which already takes portables from Zenith, spent Dollars 100m earlier
this year to take a small stake in Bull, a deal which will give the French
group access to IBM's PowerRISC chip technology and give IBM another
foothold in the European market.
Meanwhile Fujitsu of Japan acquired ICL of the UK two years ago and ICL in
turn acquired Finland's Nokia Data.
Among Europe's big computer groups, only Siemens of Germany now lacks a big
overseas IT partner. But the German group has more than enough problems
stemming from the losses at Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI), the
computer systems company formed after it acquired the ailing Nixdorf last
year.
Siemens admits it underestimated the difficulties of the merger and the
perilous state of the European PC market. It recently announced plans to
shed a further 6,500 jobs at SNI by September 1995, in addition to the 4,000
already lost as part of a rationalisation programe aimed at saving Dm600m
annually and halving SNI's DM781m 1991 loss.
Although Olivetti remains Europe's biggest indiginous PC maker, it too has
problems. Its share of the market has fallen from more than 11 per cent in
1987 to little more than 6 per cent last year.
Last year Olivetti lost Dollars 387m and although it has shed a quarter of
its workforce in the past two years, further cuts may be neccesary if it is
to return to profitability.
Although the Italian group has already launched the M700 work station built
around the Mips Risc chip it makes no secret of the fact that the driving
force behind the deal with DEC from its point of view was that it will
provide it with access to DEC's Risc chip, the Alpha microprocessor for use
in future products.
DEC's Alpha chip, launched earlier this year, is the most advanced of its
kind and the US group has set its sights on capturing a large slice of the
European market for Risc-based machines. However, until the deal with
Olivetti, DEC had no share of the fast-growing European Risc market, which
is dominated by Sun Microsystems with almost a 60 per cent share.
But staying in business as a PC manufacturer in Europe these days is about
more than having the right technology. As low-cost, high-volume clone makers
monopolise the bottom end of the market, established manufacturers are
having to differentiate their products, for example ICL with its emphasis on
ergonomics and integrated networking software.
They are also selectively expanding the variety of the distribution channels
they use, sometimes to include direct sales and PC superstores as well as
the established dealer networks. And they are taking a broader view of the
marketplace.
Even young companies such as Elonex, which has grown into the biggest direct
sales computer supplier in the UK in just six years, is now focusing on
wider horizons. The North London-based company has followed Dell, Opus and
other direct sellers and set up sales offices in Paris and Brussels and
production facilities in France. Ms Sue Davis, general manager of the Paris
Elonex office, says it is 'essential' for any company that wants to be taken
seriously as a European PC supplier 'to set up continental operations'.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (4): PCs battle
for shelf space - The US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US PERSONAL computer industry executives talk less about technology these
days. Instead of boasting about the 'speeds and feeds' of their latest
products, they are more ready to discuss issues such as 'brand
merchandising' and 'channel segmentation'.
With the advent of the 'commodity' PC market, in which there is little to
differentiate one machine from another, the US PC industry has begun to take
on many of the characteristics of consumer marketing.
Just as manufacturers of breakfast cereals tussle over supermarket shelf
space, PC makers are now vying with one another for positions in expanding
and increasingly diversified distribution channels.
Similarly, 'packaging' or 'bundling' PCs into products designed to appeal to
specific segments of the PC market has become an increasingly important
competitive tool, with several of the top PC makers recently announcing
revamped products.
Sophisticated merchandising is widely seen as the path that the industry
must take to escape the debilitating price wars of the past two years, which
have seen prices plummet by as much as 70 per cent.
Today, 386SX-based desktop PC systems, complete with a colour monitor, hard
and floppy disk drives, are widely available in the US for around Dollars
1,000. Similar systems sold for about Dollars 1,500 six months ago and cost
as much as Dollars 3,500 in early 1991.
The price wars were led initially by 'clone' manufacturers, but over the
past nine months industry stalwarts, including International Business
Machines (IBM), Compaq Computer and Apple Computer, have struck back with
drastic price cuts of their own, plunging the industry into a frantic battle
over market share.
With profit margins now razor thin, several smaller PC makers have given up
the ghost. However, it is traditional computer dealers who have paid the
highest price in the PC price wars. Their role in the industry is being
usurped by new PC sellers.
Computer 'superstores', offering discount prices and a wide selection of
equipment, have sprung up throughout the US. By year end there will be about
200 of these stores, according to industry estimates.
This year, computer superstores are expected to account for 12.3 per cent of
the Dollars 47bn-worth of PCs sold in the US, almost doubling their share of
the market in 1991, according to Merrin Information Services, a
California-based computer market research firm. By 1995 the researchers
predict that computer superstores will sell over 23 per cent of PCs, with
total US sales expected to reach Dollars 78bn.
Electronics retailers are also becoming a force in the PC market. Circuit
City, one of the leading consumer electronics chains, touts PCs along with
televisions, refrigerators and stereo equipment in its newspaper
advertisements.
Office equipment stores are also rejoining the ranks of PC resellers, aiming
to pick up sales to their small business customers. To reach home computer
buyers, leading PC manufacturers are also placing their products in
department stores.
'Direct fulfilment', via telephone orders, also represents a growing portion
of the PC market. Following the lead of Dell Computer, which established
itself as a serious contender in the PC market with telephone sales, most of
the large US PC manufacturers have, or are preparing to, side-step the
middle man and sell direct to end users.
IBM's struggle to set its PC business back on course demonstrate the radical
changes that are under way in the US PC market. The computer giant has
established the IBM Personal Computer company as an independent business
unit with the freedom to react as swiftly as necessary to rapidly changing
market demands.
IBM PC is in the process of establishing four distinct 'brands' of PCs. In
the US market these will be:
the Premium brand, comprising existing and new PS/2 models aimed at IBM's
traditional stronghold in the corporate computer sector. They will be sold
by IBM value added dealers, as well as by the company's own salesforce.
IBM's soon to be announced 'ValuePoint' brand, a set of PC products aimed at
the highly price sensitive segment of the PC market and sold through
computer superstores and office equipment shops. IBM's PS/1 product line is
being expanded and aimed more directly at consumers and small businesses.
These will be sold through mass merchant retailers including department
stores.
The fourth 'brand' group will be 'mobile computers', aimed at the fast
growing market for notebook and portable computers.
'Only a few years ago, we sold our PC products to what was largely a single
group of buyers. They bought mainly through one of two channels - dealers
and value added resellers.
'Today, there are multiple buyer types, or segments, all with distinct and
different wants and needs, in terms of both product and distribution
channel,' explains Mr Sam Inman III, head of US PC marketing.
'The days of 'one size fits all' are long gone,' in the US PC market, Mr
Inman says. 'To make it today, we must have products targeted to different
types of buyers who buy through sales channels like superstores, for
example, that didn't even exist a few years ago.'
IBM is not alone in recognising the increasing segmentation of the US PC
market. Compaq Computer recently launched a new product line called
Prolinea, aimed at price sensitive buyers, and Dell has split its product
range into three groups aimed at home buyers, small business buyers and
corporate customers.
Similarly, Apple Computer recently introduced three new models of its
Macintosh PCs, called Performa models, aimed at home computer and small
business users. The Performa products will be sold through department
stores, office suppliers and consumer electronics outlets.
'We need to be where the customers are,' said Mr Robert Puette, president of
Apple USA, the company's domestic sales and marketing division.
'Our goal with Performa is to reach new users and complement Apple's current
product and distribution strategy in the business arena,' added Mr Keith
Fox, Apple's vice-president of consumer markets.
'Experienced computer users, business users and those who require complex
solutions will continue to rely on Apple's authorised reseller network for
the largest selection of Macintosh solutions for a range of business needs,'
said Mr Fox.
Nonetheless, PC makers acknowledge that there is bound to be some overlap
among distribution channels. A small business proprietor, for example, might
choose to visit a computer superstore or browse through the shelves of a
consumer-oriented electronics retailer. Corporate buyers are increasingly
ordering PCs from superstores where prices are lower than those offered by
value added resellers.
One danger of the multi-brand, multi-channel approach is that customers will
become confused. Finding the best value for money when shopping for a PC is
an ever more complex challenge given the bewildering array of features and
performance criteria and now the different names attached to similar models
from the same manufacturers.
There is no doubt, however, that by expanding their distribution channels
and lowering prices US PC makers have created strong demand. In spite of
rapidly declining prices, US PC sales revenues are expected to rise slightly
this year, reflecting a substantial increase in unit shipments.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (2): Local
networks grow in number - Powerful PCs have enabled the shift of networking
away from the mainframe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of UK organisations with at least one local area network of
personal computers has almost doubled in the past three years. At the same
time the use of these networks has started to become more sophisticated,
with systems normally run on a central mainframe computer being moved out to
the users in their own departments.
But this growth in numbers and use is creating technical and human problems
which threaten the full exploitation of networked PCs at the very time when
advances in technology are opening new potential for users.
More than 85 per cent of organisations of all sizes in the UK now have at
least one local area network, according to market research specialist
Romtec. The average network has 46 computers connected, although 57 per cent
have fewer than 20.
This does not mean, however, that most of PCs are networked: in 85 per cent
of organisations, only 55 per cent of computers are connected. The users
expect this to increase to 65 per cent by the end of 1993, representing a
growth rate of 18 per cent.
This growth has been led by users rather than computing people and has taken
off with the emergence of increasingly powerful PCs, according to Mr Graeme
Allan, technical marketing manager at network market leader Novell.
'In the early days, users who had discovered PCs hit on the idea of
networking for greater efficiency,' Mr Allan says. 'People were wandering
around with a floppy disc looking for a spare printer or a piece of
applications software: networking enabled them to share printers and files.
'Since then network technology has become more mature and PCs have become
more powerful with the move to the Intel 386 processor and now 486, so
people have started looking beyond office automation applications to
business-critical systems.
'Meanwhile the computing department has recognised the growth of local
networks and has got involved in this movement, under pressure from the
users, and is even giving it some encouragement now.'
This last point is supported by the Romtec survey, which shows that in 80
per cent of organisations, local area networks are now specified centrally.
Romtec manager Mr Jon Whiteley says this reflects the fact that
organisations now see that network growth has corporate implications.
However, the more advanced users are now at a crossroads. The original
network applications software such as electronic mail packages are well
established and are evolving into so-called groupware products which help
people work together on documents or spreadsheets.
But moving traditional critical business systems from the central mainframe
to a PC network 'seems like a colossal leap in the dark', as Novell's Mr
Allan puts it. These systems have generally been developed by an
organisation's computing department or are based on mainframe software
packages.
'The idea of downsizing from the mainframe is still mostly just talk,' Mr
Allan says. 'The reality is that there is still a huge vested interest in
the traditional approach among IT departments, big computer manufacturers
and major consultancies. In addition there is a shortage of expertise to
carry it out.'
The skills shortage has been highlighted by several recent studies as one of
the biggest obstacles to the full exploitation of networked computers.
A survey by Andersen Consulting on the related issue of client-server
systems, in which applications are split across networks, concludes that
'the skills shortage is the key issue'. This was mentioned by over 90 per
cent of organisations planning to move in this direction.
A study by the West London Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) reveals an
urgent need to retrain traditional computing people to fill the skills gaps
in the fields of networking, user support and the Unix operating system.
Unix runs on computers of all sizes and is thus seen as having an important
role in the move from mainframes to PC networks.
'The definitions of analysts, programmers, operators and users are becoming
less clear cut,' says Mr Phil Blackburn, chief executive of the West London
TEC.
'Traditional IT staff are being made redundant, yet companies seeking the
new skills are already having recruitment problems.
'We have the classic scenario for another round of IT skills shortages once
the recession lifts.' The fact that network growth has been led by users
rather than computing departments has created the related problem of network
management.
The lack of central control was highlighted in a UK survey last year by
network specialist 3Com and Benchmark Research. It showed that 82 per cent
of companies used three or more data communication protocols, 59 per cent
used two or more types of wiring and 31 per cent used two or more network
designs.
A complementary study by The Networking Centre suggested that users were
being especially affected by breakdowns in devices for connecting networks
together.
'Recessionary pressures and skills shortages are restricting the levels of
support staff and as a result local area network managers are fire-fighting
problems every day,' says Mr Stuart Morrice, managing director of Peapod
Distribution, which recently launched a network management system.
Mr Morrice adds: 'The growth of local area networks is more limited by the
availability of staff to support them than by the suppliers' ability to
deliver the products.'
The staffing issue will be met by training or poaching, as every computing
specialist shortage has been dealt with in the past.
Meanwhile products will become more reliable. Already PC manufacturers are
building network facilities into their products, while the companies which
supply them with microprocessors are putting network links in at chip level.
As the problems are resolved, the future looks bright for organisations
which move business systems out to local networks.
Royal International, part of Royal Insurance, switched its accounting and
electronic mail from a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer to a PC network. It
moved from an accounting package costing Pounds 120,000 a year to one bought
for around Pounds 5,000 and from an electronic mail package costing Pounds
200,000 to a Pounds 2,000 package bought off the shelf.
EBC Amro Asset Management has saved over Pounds 250,000 a year by moving
from DEC Vax minicomputers to a company-wide PC network which now runs all
its systems.
'With networked PCs, the hardware is cheaper, the software is cheaper, the
maintenance is cheaper and as a result the financial risk is less,' says Mr
Allan at Novell. 'In addition, systems can go live more quickly, which can
mean extra benefits for the business.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (2): Perhaps the worst is over - After a
deep recession, there are signs that the economy is starting to recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finnish economy is going through its deepest and longest recession for
over 60 years. In 1991 the country's real gross domestic product plummeted
by 6.5 per cent, the sharpest drop Finland has known this century in
peacetime. There will be a negative growth rate - of at least a further
minus 1.5 per cent - this year.
Production in manufacturing sank by as much as 10.7 per cent last year while
there was a 12.1 per cent decline in production in the construction sector.
Unemployment, only 3.5 per cent in 1990, climbed to 7.6 per cent last year
and is now over 14 per cent. This winter the number of jobless is expected
to peak at about 350,000 or 15 per cent of the population.
Finland's current account deficit will total FM18bn in the current year, 3.3
per cent of GDP. The collapse of the country's trade with the former Soviet
Union has been particularly painful with a fall of no less than 65 per cent
last year alone. The textile sector suffered a 30 per cent contraction in
its exports as a result.
The squeeze on living standards has been severe. With a rise of only 2.2 per
cent in real earnings in 1991 and an expected zero increase this year,
household real disposable income rose by 0.7 per cent last year and fell by
5.5 per cent in 1992.
During this year, Finland has started to pull itself painfully out of its
slump. 'Today we have rather a schizophrenic economy,' observes Dr Pentti
Vartia, head of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (Etla). A
number of key indicators suggests that the worst could be over:
Last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the markka has helped the
competitiveness of Finland's main export industries - pulp and paper and
engineering. The volume of exports is likely to rise this year by 18 per
cent. Although Finland's overseas markets - Sweden and Britain - have been
sluggish, both Germany and France have provided good export opportunities.
Over the first six months of this year the country's metal and engineering
sector enjoyed a rise of more than 20 per cent in its export earnings to
FM25bn. The recovery has been particularly noticeable in the
electro-technical and electronic sector as well as transport equipment while
the export of steel and metals also improved.
The picture has been less satisfactory in mechanical engineering. Fimet,
Finland's engineering federation, believes the demand abroad for goods from
the country's metal and engineering sector will strengthen during 1993. This
may compensate to a certain extent for the decline in the domestic market
which looks like continuing into next year.
Finland is likely to improve its labour productivity this year by 5.5 per
cent and by a further 4 per cent in 1993, according to Ministry of Finance
forecasts. There is expected to be an actual 0.5 per cent decline in real
earnings next year with an 8 per cent fall in labour costs in manufacturing
measured by unit of output this year, with a further decline of 1.5 per cent
in 1993.
Inflation is going to be at historically low levels with a rise in next
year's consumer price index of 2.5 per cent, half of which will be caused by
increases in indirect taxes and public charges. The price competitiveness of
Finland looks impressive for once.
But there is also a darker side to Finland's present economic outlook.
Investment prospects remain bleak, according to the forecasts which suggest
it may be 1994 before any upturn can be expected. As Etla says in its latest
report: 'The commencement of investment activity is being hampered by the
low capacity utilisation rate, high indebtedness and financing difficulties.
The investment ratio will remain exceptionally low for several years and the
capital stock will be reduced.'
The biggest single economic headache for the Finnish government is the rapid
escalation of its own debt. At the end of 1991 it amounted to 18.3 per cent
of the country's gross domestic product. With local authority spending, the
debt amounted to 23 per cent of GDP, at FM117bn. This year it is expected to
have risen to FM160bn.
The projections for the next few years suggest that without a much tighter
government fiscal policy the budget deficit and the funding of it will
swallow up most of Finland's GDP by the middle of the decade.
Why has the government's debt risen so fast? Part of the trouble stems from
the decline in tax revenues as the recession has deepened. But Mr Aho, the
prime minister, also blames the cost of financing rising unemployment and
the banks' problems that have already forced the government to put aside
about FM28bn to assist those in trouble.
There is little doubt that the public sector grew too fast in the carefree
1980s. By Nordic standards, Finland has a relatively small public sector.
This year it accounts for 48 per cent of total output but the trend of
public consumption since 1970 has been ever upwards. Taxes have risen as a
proportion of GDP from 31.1 per cent in 1970 to 37.1 per cent today.
'Ordinary people understand we cannot go on the way we were doing,' says Mr
Iivo Viinanen, the country's finance minister.
Mr Jaakko Iloniemi, head of the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy
(Eva), agrees. 'There is a much greater national awareness of the need for
radical adjustments,' he says. 'It is up to us to clear up our own mess.'
Most policy-makers accept the country's public sector must be reduced but
the troubles centre over the precise detail on what has to be cut. The
government is working on a medium-term strategy to reduce its spending
programmes up to 1995. Next year the cuts already agreed by ministers amount
to FM18bn, 10 per cent less than in 1992 with further cuts proposed of
FM20bn-30bn for 1994 and 1995.
Mr Viinanen warns that this will mean slicing away at the state's large cash
support for agriculture as well as a contraction in the value of many social
benefits and financial support for local authorities. 'It is going to be
hard to do this but anybody else would have to do the same,' he adds.
'The chickens are coming home to roost,' declares Mr Jarl Kohler, head of
the forestry employers' association. 'There is now a good rapport between
government and industry. We are talking constructively together now.
Everybody accepts the reality.'
Although the pulp and paper sector benefited competitively from last
November's devaluation, Mr Kohler has no enthusiasm at all for the floating
markka. The weak dollar has hit the industry, as 20 per cent of its business
is invoiced in that currency. Forestry's foreign debts total an estimated
FM30bn. At present, Finnish paper mills operate at only 81 per cent of
capacity. Mr Kohler warns: 'We will only invest in new capacity when there
is a market for the product and it is profitable.'
Despite the turbulence of the markets and continuing anxieties over the
financial sector, the Finnish economy should ease gradually upwards next
year. Total output, according to government estimates, should improve by 3
per cent in 1993 with a continuing strong export performance. The current
account deficit looks set to fall to around FM10.5bn next year, or 2 per
cent of GDP. There is also expected to be a modest recovery in investment in
machinery and equipment of around 2.5 per cent.
Industrial production looks set to grow by 5.5 per cent next year with a
particularly sharp improvement in minerals of 12.5 per cent and a 6.5 per
cent increase in manufacturing. Inflation is set to rise slightly to 4 per
cent through a further 10 per cent depreciation of the markka when it is
eventually pegged again to the European Currency Unit.
But Finnish average living standards will stagnate at best, if not decline
further as unemployment stays high and domestic demand is squeezed. Wage
'flexibility' is expected to cut most real incomes despite a rise in labour
costs of around 4 to 5 per cent in engineering and forestry.
After the spread of financial chaos across the European money markets last
month, Finnish policy-makers feel less harassed and apologetic about their
decision to float the markka. They believe the European Commission in
particular recognises they faced no alternative but to take such unorthodox
action.
However, Finland's economy remains more sensitive than most to the vagaries
of the outside world. The size of the proposed government cuts package may
go some way to calm the markets. But Mr Viinanen and his cabinet colleagues
will need to show greater determination if they hope to convince the foreign
exchange dealers that Finland is serious about coming to terms with more
straitened times.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (3): Pace gets a bit quicker - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOWNESS of Finland's political system is exasperating the international
money markets. 'Our politicians are a lap behind in the race to keep up with
events,' observed one senior commentator. But Finnish ministers are unused
to having to make quick decisions on important issues. They like to take
their time, consulting and negotiating as widely as possible.
The building of consensus remains a vital ingredient of Finnish politics.
This is why it can often take weeks, even months, before agreement can be
reached on economic policy questions, rather than a matter of days. Such a
leisurely tempo of work may or may not ensure better decisions are
eventually reached, but what is becoming increasingly clear is that this is
failing to impress the outside world.
Earlier this year, Mr Aho's coalition appeared to recognise the need to
speed up the process of decision-making. It proposed, and parliament agreed,
that a sensible change had to be made to the constitution, which ensured in
future that a simple and not a two-thirds parliamentary majority was needed
for the passage of any measure to cut government spending.
Ideally, this should make it much easier for Mr Aho's centre-right coalition
government to secure the necessary parliamentary approval later this autumn
for whatever tough economic cuts are planned for 1994 and 1995.
But the ruptures and conflicts that may well break out both inside and
between the political parties in the government, particularly in the
aftermath of the October 18 local government elections, and these could
threaten its already fragile existence.
Some ex-ministers are already complaining that Finland is about to
Americanise its social welfare system to please the money markets with cuts
that will tear to pieces many cherished spending programmes. However, it
still seems unlikely that the painful but necessary cuts that ministers will
agree upon are going to polarise Finnish politics.
The main Social Democratic opposition has moved a long way since earlier in
the year to accept the need for cuts in public spending. Under its new
leader, Mr Ulf Sundqvist, an ex-banker, it takes a robust free-market view
of affairs nowadays. Although keen to see government action to keep down the
level of unemployment, the party accepts most of the government's key
economic arguments.
'We recognise we have a serious debt problem,' says Mr Sundqvist. 'We must
cut our foreign borrowing and we also have to stabilise the markets. We need
a broad agreement on balancing the budget over the next two to three years.'
The Social Democrats would like to see an immediate government
reconstruction and they favour their own early return to power in perhaps a
broader-based coalition of national unity.
Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, is not so enthusiastic about such an idea.
'The most important point is not who is in the government but what the
policy is,' he argues. 'There are still some serious questions to be asked
about what the Social Democrats want.' Still only 36, the Centre party
leader has come in for a barrage of widespread criticism, particularly in
the Finnish media. He is accused of being too weak, too accommodating to his
colleagues and not tough enough for the job.
Such attacks are unfair. His government inherited a miserable economic
legacy when it took office in April last year and it has tried belatedly to
come to terms with what is needed to rectify the underlying problems.
Moreover, it is often forgotten that Mr Aho led most of his Cabinet
colleagues and his own rural-based Centre party into accepting that Finland
should seek membership of the European Community. The conversion was slow
and deliberate but it appears to have convinced most of the country. When
the EC application was handed over in Brussels last April it was with wide
support in parliament and with the backing of public opinion.
More severe questions could be raised about the behaviour of President Mauno
Koivisto. Although he is now half way through his second seven-year term, Mr
Koivisto has seen his popularity fall away this autumn because of what is
seen as his Olympian treatment of the economic crisis.
Many outsiders might be forgiven for thinking that the Finnish president is
essentially an honorary post, judging by Mr Koivisto's behaviour. However,
under the constitution he has considerable powers, similar to those of
President Francois Mitterrand in France.
Mr Koivisto, a Social Democrat, however has kept his distance from events.
His sporadic interventions in support of Mr Aho's government have done
little to reassure the Finns.
Many would like to see him take much more vigorous action by giving a lead
in the flamboyant manner of Mr Urho Kekkonen, the famous post-war president
who intervened on a number of occasions to restructure governments.
Unhappily, Mr Koivisto appears to have taken a minimalist view of his
constitutional powers. Indeed, some observers believe he has devoted more
time at least in public to telling the newly independent Baltic states how
to conduct their own internal affairs than in expressing a considered and
distinctive view about the economic troubles of his own country.
But his attitude may well change in the coming weeks if the economy fails to
improve and the government parties suffer a severe setback in next month's
local government elections. There are clear signs of a growing sense of
national urgency in Finnish politics. The pace may not have quickened fast
enough to please the markets but the allegedly time-consuming process of
making decisions looks as if it is coming to an end.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (1): Carefree days are ended - Public
spending cuts are set to follow the floating of the markka earlier this
month. The country's affluent standard of life will decline and the fear is
that the 1990s will be a long hang-over. This survey has been written by
Robert Taylor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND this autumn is edging along a precipice. The floating of the markka
on September 8 to stem the dramatic outflow of the country's capital
reserves has brought a deep sense of national crisis.
To many Finns this autumn's turbulent events on the money markets have come
as an unwelcome shock. For most of their country's short history they have
weathered political and economic storms with a pugnacious finesse. Now they
must face what looks like being a harsh reality.
During the next few weeks the centre-right coalition government of Mr Esko
Aho must agree and push through parliament a range of cuts in spending
programmes as far ahead as 1995 that will mean a sharp contraction in
Finland's public service sector and lower living standards for everybody.
No social benefit or government funded project seems likely to be spared
critical scrutiny. Under the unseeing but merciless pressures of a turbulent
international money market, Finland's carefree days of semi-isolated,
regulated independence are over, probably for good.
'The people are ready to accept radical decisions,' Mr Aho told the
Financial Times. He and many other Finnish policy-makers believe the mood
has changed since last autumn when the country was forced to devalue the
markka by 12.3 per cent and opinion was divided on what to do.
But the prime minister and his coalition colleagues will have to show a much
greater willingness to use the knife on cherished spending programmes than
they displayed during the course of this year when Finland seemed to lurch
from one crisis to another as sceptical foreign financial opinion questioned
the government's economic performance.
'We had a credibility problem after the devaluation,' admits Dr Sirkka
Hamalainen, governor of Finland's central bank. She disliked having to float
the currency and hopes it can be pegged at an exchange rate related to the
European currency unit once the markets have calmed down.
Floating provides a breathing space but is no solution for anything. Indeed,
there is a strong chorus of complaint from Finnish industrialists who
dislike the uncertainty that a floating markka means for business. The trade
unions are also unhappy because they face the prospect of having to accept a
real cut in the wage packets of their members for next year in central pay
negotiations with employers.
For the politicians as well, floating is not an easy option. Next month,
Finland goes to the polls in local government elections and no party wants
to say or do anything unpopular before the results. The Conservatives in the
coalition may lose ground, though Mr Aho is confident his own Centre party
will show greater resilience. After all, as ministers insist: 'There is no
alternative' to what they propose to do.
Whatever happens, Finland is not about to suffer a relapse to the kind of
misery and deprivation the country knew during the inter-war years, As Dr
Hamalainen points out, all that the country needs to return to the straight
and narrow is contract its public sector to its size in the early 1980s
before the government became a really big spender.
Nonetheless, relatively straitened times will not come easily to the Finns
as they prepare to celebrate the 75th anniversary of their independence from
Russian rule. In recent years they have grown used to a standard of life
that is one of the most affluent in the world.
Under the shadow of Soviet Communism for its first days of freedom in 1917,
Finland survived the Second World War not through diplomatic appeasement but
from fighting bravely against the Red Army. It was the only European country
to confront Stalin that escaped eventual Soviet occupation.
After 1944 the Finns were forced to pay large reparations to the Kremlin.
Yet four years later they entered into a bilateral clearing house trade
agreement with the Soviet Union that lasted until 1990 and was of enormous
benefit for Finland as the country received an agreed volume of crude oil
and natural gas in return for selling its neighbour sophisticated
manufacturing goods and consumer durables.
In its foreign and defence policy the country stood firmly neutral. It
eschewed moral posturing that might offend the Soviet Union and western
countries. At the same time Finland grew rapidly after the 1960s as a
thriving market economy, the most capitalistic in the Nordic region. With
more than a touch of luck but also a great deal of cunning, the Finnish
political establishment was able to enjoy the best of both worlds.
The results in the 1980s were remarkable as Finland's growth rate rose much
faster than the western European average. In the past, Finns had emigrated
in search of work to Sweden and further afield: now they came home. There
was almost a Klondyke spirit in Finland as personal consumption reached
Swedish levels. It became almost commonplace for families to enjoy two
extended holidays a year.
It is the speed at which that aggressively booming, swaggering image of the
country in the 1980s has changed that bewilders and angers many Finns. From
boom to bust in 18 months is an experience no other western European country
has suffered in recent times. Dr Max Jakobson, a former diplomat, notes
gloomily that Finland is 'heading into worse times'. The 1990s look like
being one long hang-over for the country.
This does not mean Finland is about to witness the rise of political
extremism. 'The left-right spectrum is meaningless these days,' says Dr
Jakobson. Finland does not even have any populist anti-statist party, unlike
other Nordic countries. But there is widespread apathy and disillusionment
with the political system.
Accustomed to a sense of security, many Finns are keen to ensure their
country is anchored firmly with western Europe. Support for European
Community membership remains much higher in Finland than elsewhere in the
Nordic region. Negotiations are expected to start with Brussels early next
year and a national consensus persists on the merits of joining the EC. Last
spring's application for entry by Mr Aho's government has still not produced
a fierce backlash even after the narrow Danish No vote against the
Maastricht treaty in June.
Dr Jakobson believes there is a good reason for this. 'Many Finns want to be
in the EC not for material reasons but to identify themselves with western
Europe,' he explains.
Neutrality, the sense of balance between east and west and the need to
maintain a special relationship with Moscow were the crucial signposts that
guided post-war Finnish foreign and security policy. But now, they have lost
almost all their relevance. Slowly, Finland is edging closer to a
realisation that its national interest lies through developing a greater
sense of collective security in Europe. Ministers do not rule out eventual
participation in the Western European Union or whatever military formation
emerges out of the EC in the future.
This is not to say that Finland wants to provoke or humiliate Russia. On the
contrary, Helsinki's policymakers are keen - within clearly defined limits -
to remain on good terms with their neighbour but they share no illusions on
what may lie ahead. A conservative, nationalistic dictatorship with
revanchist claims on Finland seems improbable at present. But many Finns are
uneasy about what they see as the spread of criminality from Russia that has
brought drugs, prostitution and black market activity to the streets of
Helsinki.
There will be no 'open door' policy to potential Russian immigrants.
Nightmare visions two winters ago of hundreds of thousands of hungry jobless
Russians trying to break into Finland may have been melodramatic and
mistaken but Finland is not going to relax its guard.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (14): New sector
looks to the home office - The SoHo Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST addition to the personal computer industry lexicon is 'SoHo', an
acronym for 'Small-office, Home-office' and a password for the return to
fast-paced sales growth, according to US personal computer manufacturers.
A rapid increase in the number of people in the US who work from home is
fueling the SoHo market and creating new opportunities to sell PC to
individual customers.
'There are powerful forces at work which are creating this market,' says Mr
Tony Santelli, head of International Business Machines PS/1 brand team.
Families with working parents who use computers at work are likely to
purchase a machine for their own use and share it with their children.
Professionals who have lost their jobs are setting up home offices to do
free-lance or consulting work.
'Telecommuting' from home offices is also an increasingly popular way to
beat traffic jams that is encouraged by environmentally conscious employers.
Lower prices are drawing these potential customers into the PC market.
With fully configured systems selling for as little as Dollars 1,000, many
more people can afford to consider a home computer. According to Apple
Computer, some 14m US families can now afford to buy a home computer, of
whom 7m have not done so in the past 10 years.
The requirements of the SoHo market are, however, quite different from those
of traditional business market segments, Mr Santelli says. Sold primarily
through retail outlets, PCs aimed at the home and very small business market
are pre-configured at the factory, with software already installed.
The aim, he explains, is to enable the customer to 'get up and running in 10
to 15 minutes'. With recent additions to its PS/1 product line, IBM aims to
get its share of the SoHo market, now dominated by lesser-known clone
makers.
Apple Computer has also launched a new range of Performa Macintosh PCs
targeted at the same customers. Dell Computer is also offering products
aimed at individual buyers with its Dimension line of PCs, sold via mail
order and its Precision brand, sold in the Price Club, a warehouse discount
store.
Both companies have recently announced plans to offer their new products in
department stores and consumer electronics stores where until recently only
'clones' have been sold. 'The traditional computer resellers were dominated
by the 'brand name' products, so retailers became a haven for the clones,'
Mr Santelli explains. 'We recognised that the retail channel represented an
uncovered opportunity.'
The so-called SoHo market is extremely price sensitive. People paying for
computers out of their own pockets are more inclined to shop carefully and
search out bargains.
However, one of the primary concerns among this customer group, according to
computer makers, is the fear of obsolescence. Therefore, although they are
looking for good value they want to buy the latest technology and the
average selling price is well above that for bottom of the range machines.
In the US market, PCs based on Intel 486 microprocessors are rapidly taking
the place of older 386 based machines as the highest volume products in all
market sectors and the SoHo segment is no exception.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (13): Corporate
computing keeps software developers busy - Companies want to connect their
PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is much to occupy personal computer software developers nowadays. They
must keep pace with changes in hardware technology. They must allow for
advances in infrastructural software, such as operating systems and
graphical user interfaces (GUI) while, at the same time, anticipating shifts
in emphasis in an increasingly competitive market.
But the most important item on the agenda for PC software companies in the
1990s is the transition from 'stand alone' computing to corporate computing.
There is strong evidence that companies want to connect their PCs to each
other - and to their central corporate computer resources. According to IDC,
the market researcher, around 1bn PCs will be connected to some sort of
network by 1995.
This means that both the infrastructural software and the application
software, which turns the technology into a usable and useful system, will
go through fundamental changes.
The changes are more than technological. They are also cultural. PCs have
become a window on the world of corporate computing and applications
software must change to accommodate this.
'We are now going through the same level of change as we did when we moved
from punched-card input to character-based visual display screens in the
1970s,' says Mr Robin Bloor, chief executive of ButlerBloor the UK-based
research and consultancy company.
'This time the change is from character-based input to bit-mapped input.'
Mr Bloor believes that PCs are the catalyst which has stimulated the change.
They have provided users with the power to run local processing and GUIs -
which in turn allows them to handle new types of data.
Bit-mapped input, which includes images, audio and video, would be almost
impossible to process with character-based software.
But individual personal computing must be supported by the corporate network
which must be able to offer centralised storage and processing services.
Mr Bloor suggests that the so-called client/server model of computing offers
a way forward. This approach separates the 'front-end' software associated
with GUIs and personal computing from the 'back-end' software such as
database management and corporate transaction processing.
'Few PC software companies have realised the implications of the change.
Client/server system bring in issues such as security, data integrity and
system recovery - issues that few PC companies understand,' says Mr Bloor.
In spite of this, however, some PC software companies have begun to take
notice of the issues and build software which can meet both the local
demands of personal computing and the global needs of corporate systems.
Lotus Development, the originator of the ubiquitous 1-2-3 spreadsheet
program, has led the way with its Notes 'groupware' package - one of the
first programs to exploit the advantages of the client/server model.
Notes has attracted wide support from leading systems integrators and
software consultancies - including all but one of the 'big six' accountancy
companies.
It offers a way to build applications which can use both the front-end
processing power of PCs and the back-end processing power of more
traditional mainframe and minicomputer-based systems.
'There has been a major change in our business and how we sell our
products,' says Mr Paul Bailey, European vice-president of Lotus.
'With Notes we are no longer selling a commodity - a single, shrink-wrapped
product off the shelf like the original 1-2-3.
'We must now work with third-party consultants or integrators to provide a
service which can help build and then support applications,' says Mr Bailey.
As a result, Lotus has had to take notice of the broader corporate issues
and build its software to accommodate them. 'Notes has features which ensure
that data is replicated through the database and synchronise changes so that
everyone sees the same data,' explains Mr Dieter Geisebrecht, managing
director of Lotus UK.
'The synchronisation rate can be pre-set by the user. This lets Notes give
users a broad platform for corporate communications,' he says.
Lotus is, of course, not alone in recognising the changes that result from
integrating personal and corporate computing.
Other leading PC software developers have also seen the technology and
cultural problems involved in bringing the two together.
Microsoft's Windows NT operating system software - scheduled for release by
the end of this year - is another example.
When it is complete, Windows NT will incorporate many of the features which
are usually associated with a minicomputer or mainframe operating
environment with those now well established in personal computing.
In parallel, Microsoft is building applications software which allow user to
share resources across a network and take in data from other systems.
Borland International, a challenger both to Lotus and Microsoft, is also
working on software which will bridge the gap between personal and corporate
computing.
Borland has been a leading innovator in application-building tools for PCs
since it was founded in the early 1980s. In the past two years it has
concentrated its efforts on what is called object-oriented technology - a
new way of thinking about information technology systems which is quickly
gaining credibility among manufacturers and software suppliers.
Object-oriented technology breaks systems down into a objects which can be
related easily to working practice. An object can be anything from an
invoice to a profit and loss account.
This approach makes it easier for non-technical users to build their own
small-scale applications without the need to understand complex programming
techniques. This does not mean, however, that there will be no need for
professional programming expertise. But it opens up opportunities to spread
the load.
'Professional staff can concentrate on the large-scale infrastructural stuff
 -but with object-orientation, users can build their own interfaces and
processes based on their knowledge,' explains Mr Mike Hill, marketing
director at Borland UK. 'They don't have to understand the runes to build
effective applications,' he explains
Like Lotus, Borland has recognised that it must also offer the background
technical support for corporate computing.
One of the prizes of its takeover of Ashton Tate, the database market
leader, in 1991 was the advanced Interbase database management technology.
'Interbase can offer a consistent view of data - regardless of what is going
on in a system,' Mr Hill says.
'If someone wants to invoke a large transaction - like a bank account
summary - they can do it while other users continue to update the data.
Usually it would have to be locked out - but Interbase's multi-generational
features let the software keep track of changes easily and apply them when
the transaction is completed.'
There is no doubt that all PC software developers will increasingly be
forced to take account of the corporate-wide issues highlighted by Lotus's
work with Notes and Borland's work with Objectvision and Interbase.
The days of the isolated PC are by no means over. But this is not where the
action - or the profits - will be found in the 1990s.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (5): Figures point
to new pressures - Workstations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE workstations is still one of the big-selling product families of the
computer industry, generating good revenues for the suppliers in spite of
the recession. But competition in the workstation marketplace is becoming as
fierce as that of the the PC.
Sun Microsystems, generally accepted as the market leader, has seen its
annual revenues grow from Dollars 3.2bn in 1991 to Dollars 3.6bn in the
financial year that ended in June, while watching profits dip from Dollars
190.3m last year to Dollars 173.3m. At the same time, the number of units
shipped reached record levels. - 56,000 during the company's last quarter.
These figures points to increasing price competition in the workstation
marketplace, although Sun's President and CEO, Mr Scott McNealy, stresses
instead a high spend on research and development as the cause of the profit
decline.
The pressure on pricing and market development and growth is definitely on,
however.
In the US, IBM has started a mail order service for its RS/6000 product
family. In practice, this approach is aimed mainly at selling add-on
products such as expansion memory and extra disk capacity to existing users.
However, although the company does not expect many customers to buy complete
systems 'off the page', the fact that this is possible demonstrates the way
the workstation market has changed over the past year.
Hewlett Packard is also expanding its routes to market. It is adopting the
technique already perfected by Sun and Mips Computers of licencing third
party manufacturers. In HP's case, its latest agreement is with Korean-based
Samsung, which is to start by selling a re-badged version of HP's Model 700
workstation. Samsung's semiconductor division is, however, already working
on producing its own version of the system's Risc processor, and
workstations of its own design are bound to follow.
Unix-based workstations are finding their level in the overall spectrum of
computing. They are still the best solution to a number of different tasks,
especially those such as computer-aided design where high resolution
graphics and the ability to run a number of different applications on a
desktop system are important.
In most situations where these capabilities are required there is also a
need to network several workstations together. To do this, the same hardware
architectures of the leading workstations are now important in the role of
network file servers and network management. Here, the capabilities of Unix
to run multi-tasked applications within a virtual memory environment - while
fully exploiting the power of the processors - is proving an important lever
for many users, particularly in the financial community.
One of the biggest developments in the workstation marketplace, however, is
in the user interface to the system. The Unix operating system used in
workstations is, to the uninitiated, complex to use.
Over the past year, however, this complexity has largely been eradicated by
the widespread adoption of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) as the standard
working environment. This means that anyone with some experience of using
either an Apple Macintosh or a PC-compatible with Windows 3, is now equally
experienced at using a Unix workstation.
There are two main contenders for the title of 'standard' GUI for this
market. One, Open Look, has Sun Microsystems as its prime supporter. The
company ships this GUI with every workstation it sells, making it
numerically the dominant system. The Open Look GUI is a Sun development, and
is promoted by Unix International (UI), the Unix industry grouping of which
Sun is an important member.
Open Look is, however, only prevalent on Sun systems and on those from
companies that use the Sun-developed Sparc Risc processor and associated
operating systems, SunOS or Solaris. The GUI that is proving the most
popular with manufacturers is Motif, promoted by the rival industry grouping
to UI, the Open Software Foundation (OSF).
The most popular implementation of the OSF-Motif style guide comes from
Cambridge-based IXI. Its X Desktop system has been licensed by most
workstation suppliers, including IBM, Bull, NCR, Data General, ICL, Unisys
and Olivetti.
Not only is there increasing price competition in the workstation market for
the dominant suppliers, Sun Microsystems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, there is
also growing competition on the technology front. Digital Equipment, in
particular, has started to ship the first workstations built around its new
Alpha Chip processor which, at an operating speed of 200 Million
Instructions Per Second (Mips), is the fastest processor available in this
market.
The performance of the Intel-based PC is also rising sharply. The company is
now scheduled to introduce its next processor, known as the P5, early in the
new year and this will produce PCs capable of running at up to 100 Mips.
This will be fast enough to cope with many of the applications for which a
workstation is currently the only practical solution.
Also needed, is an operating system that can exploit such potential power.
Microsoft's combination for Intel-based PCs, MS-DOS and Windows, does not
offer sufficient functionality, particularly in multi-tasking, and users
have the choice of either OS/2 from IBM, or one of the PC-based
implementations of Unix.
Microsoft hopes to rectify this next year when 'industry-strength' versions
of its new operating system, NT, are launched.
The combination of P5-based PCs and the NT operating system could at last
see the PC challenging workstations in terms of functionality and
performance. If this happens, current workstation suppliers could be in for
a difficult time.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (6): Distinctions
begin to blur - The handheld market is characterised by a confusion of names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASSIFICATION of handheld computers seems almost as difficult as that of
Darwin's beetles. Some differentiate between handhelds and portables, on the
grounds that portables may be held by the hand but genuine handhelds are
held in the hand. Certainly, as prices for these machines range from Pounds
60 to Pounds 6,000, there must be several different species involved.
Portable computers started to appear in the early 1980s and soon branched
into two - palmtops, consumer electronics products such as sophisticated
pocket calculators and notebooks, business equipment for the travelling
manager.
But this distinction is shaky and these two lines could soon converge again.
Palmtops include, or overlap with, personal organisers and personal digital
assistants. Notebooks can be divided by size into laptops, true notebooks
and subnotebooks.
The confusion of names shows how young the market is. Even in the US market
research on the subject is still thin and in Europe even thinner.
The market for portables is growing much faster than that for desktop
computers, even though the price of the miniaturised systems is higher.
Mr Bruce Stephen, an analyst at IDC, says the palmtop-handheld sector more
than doubled in the US between 1990 and 1992 to 670,000 units, or Dollars
242m of shipments, at an average price of Dollars 360.
In the US, the Japanese company Sharp is the dominant supplier of palmtops.
In the UK it claims to have half of the market for organisers priced between
Pounds 60 and Pounds 260. It puts the current market at 350,000 units and
forecasts growth to 450,000 in the next two years.
The UK company Psion is a big vendor in Britain but its small size means it
will struggle to maintain its position in the global market.
The recent entry of Hewlett-Packard into this sector with its HP95LX, priced
at around Pounds 350 and compatible with the industry standard PC operating
system DOS, has created a stir and is expected to lead to a spate of clones
from the Pacific countries.
Apple has put its reputation at stake with a big publicity campaign for its
forthcoming Newton machine, to be manufactured by Sharp and due to be
introduced in the US early next year at a price probably lower than Pounds
400.
It will run on the British-designed Advanced Risc Machine (Arm) 610 chip.
Described as a notepad rather than a notebook, it will not have a keyboard
or a mouse - input will be by a pen. It will provide one of the first tests
for the concept of pen-based computing, which is seen as the future medium
for many form-filling applications.
Apple's claims that the machine will learn to recognise the owner's
handwriting in just an hour and that future versions will also be able to
recognise speech have met some scepticism in the industry. It risks a strong
adverse reaction if it fails to deliver what has been promised.
Apple will be challenged by an alliance of Tandy and Casio, Olivetti's
Quaderno, and no doubt many others. But some leading manufacturers believe
the technology is still not mature and have decided to wait for it to
develop further before entering the field.
The palmtops sector is one of the few in the industry where prices are
rising, as more functions are added. But given their low price they should
be selling better, says Mr Stephen of IDC.
'They are too complex and have too many buttons. Many people have been put
theirs away,' he says.
Palmtops remain unstandardised and the question of what standards are needed
if any is being debated. Sharp and Apple have both adopted proprietary
designs.
Ms Rosemary Eccles, Sharp's UK product manager, argues that users want
simplicity above all, so there is no likelihood that personal organisers
will evolve towards more complex PC-based standards.
However, other vendors think that users will prefer systems which are
compatible with desktop PC standards including DOS.
The notebook sector - larger machines, but still able to be carried in a
briefcase - is growing even faster. It trebled in worldwide sales to 3.3m
units in 1990-92 and in the UK sales shot up to around 90,000 last year.
Some experts are forecasting 300,000 sold in the UK by 1996.
The increase is being driven by a rapid fall in prices, in line with those
of desktop personal computers. Many are now in the Pounds l,000- Pounds
l,500 bracket.
Notebooks may weigh around 6lb, their little cousins the subnotebooks only
half that. They usually conform to desktop PC standards, running on Intel
386 or 486 32-bit chips, with a DOS operating system, Windows user
interface, 2-4 megabytes of RAM, 40-120 megabytes of hard disk and VGA
colour screens.
Mr Mike Lunch, UK director of PCs for Toshiba, which has around 30 per cent
of the world market for notebooks and larger handhelds, says they are now
starting to replace desktop PCs for many functions and sales will overtake
those of desktop PCs in the mid-1990s.
The storage medium for these machines remains an issue. Reducing the power
needed for memory is important because their batteries tend to run out after
a few hours.
Intel claims that its new 'flash' solid state memory erasable chips will use
less power and be cheaper, faster and lighter than rotating hard disk
drives.
It says flash memory will replace hard disks in handheld computers in the
next couple of years. Apple's Newton will use flash memory on cards the size
of bank credit cards. But some experts dispute Intel's claims and argue that
very small hard drives will prove more successful.
Wireless communications is another area of controversy. The popularity of
these new devices will depend heavily on the ability to send faxes, exchange
electronic mail messages, receive news by satellite and send data back to
head office. Until suitable communications standards emerge it remains
uncertain how effective these functions will be.
Palmtops and notebooks are to a great extent creating a new market of users
who have not had PCs before, such as sales people, financial services
representatives and the general public.
As palmtops become more expensive and notebooks become cheaper, the two
sub-sectors may before long come together again. That development would
probably bring even tougher competition in the market.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (1): A time for
bargains - Evidence for the profound changes sweeping the industry has
emerged with PCs moving to centre stage. But the revolution, which this year
has also seen prices tumbling, is presenting problems for the manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE turnaround in the computer industry is as shattering as if the earth had
finally been revealed as the true centre of the galaxy, circled by the sun,
moon and planets.
In the past year, the lowly personal computer has emerged as the mainstay of
the computer business. In just over a decade it has been responsible for
carving a new profile for the industry while destroying a market
infrastructure built up over 30 years.
Some will argue that this has been inevitable since the Apple II made its
debut in 1978, despite the refusal of many in the mainframe business either
to see or accept the decline of the traditional industry.
Nobody now doubts, however, that the future of data processing lies with PCs
and workstations linked in powerful networks rather than with mainframes,
minicomputers and data centres. Mainframe computers will increasingly be
relegated to a peripheral role as network servers, in contrast to their
former position at the hub of corporate data processing empires.
A number of remarkable developments over the past 12 months or so have
signalled the industry's acceptance of the PC in its new role.
First, PCs have become commodities. Traditional computer manufacturers and
PC vendors have made a dash for the lower ground this year, launching new
ranges of PCs at astonishingly low prices. Computer users therefore have the
choice between 'value for money' or 'premium' products.
Some manufacturers, such as International Business Machines (IBM), have
tried to disown their bargain basement products: in Europe, IBM has
established a separate, wholly-owned company to sell Ambra PCs.
Others, including Compaq, the US-based leader in high performance PCs, and
Zenith, the PC arm of Groupe Bull of France are trying to establish the two
distinct categories of product within the same range.
Hewlett Packard, on the other hand, is opting only for the low-price
approach. The large manufacturers have been driven to adopt these strategies
by the continuing success of 'no-name' or clone manufacturers who now hold
close to half the global PC market.
This is powerful evidence that customers are quite prepared to buy on price
alone, with the assumption that quality will be acceptable; the success of
Compaq's low priced range suggests, however, that the combination of a low
price and recognised branding is irresistible.
The impact of no-name vendors on the market share of established players has
been considerable. In Europe and elsewhere International Data Corporation
figures show IBM remains the market leader but its 19.1 per cent share by
value is far removed from the greater than 40 per cent share of the market
it once held. Compaq and Olivetti at 7.4 per cent and 5 per cent
respectively are not surprises, but the German no name vendor Vobis sells
more machines in Germany than IBM, and has a 2.1 per cent share of the
European market.
Figures from the marketing consultancy InfoCorp suggest the European PC
market will grow 10 per cent in units this year but decline by 12 per cent
in value, a clear indication of the move towards lower priced machines. All
of which makes IBM's launch last month of a range of higher priced premium
machines for 'power' users something of a gamble.
Second, PCs will be portable. The industry has already created a new
expression, 'nomadic computing', to describe the latest in small,
lightweight computers. The growth of the market for 'notebook' PCs has been
spectacular, but it is already diverging.
At the upper end are conventional notebook computers weighing only a
kilogramme or so; these have been made possible by advances in disk drives
as well as liquid crystal display technology. They use the same 32-bit chips
as their desk-top counterparts and can do virtually everything the larger
machines can do. With such power in a easy-to-carry package, it is hard to
justify using desk-top machines.
There is, however, a need to link into office networks and manufacturers
such as Compaq are catering for this with fully wired desktop docking
stations into which a portable computer can be clipped. Zenith has reduced
the docking pod to a simple backplate, a forerunner, perhaps, of a time when
computing power and information will be accessed through a wall socket.
At the other end of the scale are tiny computers which compress much of the
functionality of a full scale computer into a package which will fit into a
pocket. Hewlett Packard has had success with a pocket computer which has
Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular spreadsheet, already installed.
Psion, a UK-based manufacturer, is collaborating with Motorola, the world
leader in cellular radio, to develop a handheld computer with an inbuilt
radio modem.
The devices will be able to transmit data over public switched data
networks, enabling, for example, a sales representative to maintain constant
contact with head office.
Much of the excitement in nomadic computing, however, is focused on Apple's
yet-to-be launched 'Newton' personal digital assistant. The prototype is
about 7 by 4 inches, a black plastic box with a screen but no keyboard.
Communication with Newton is via an electronic stylus, used to write on the
screen. The idea is that the user scrawls notes, records appointments or
draws diagrams. Newton automatically orders and files the information. Mr
John Scully, Apple chief executive believes the market for personal digital
assistants will be enormous by the end of the century.
Somewhere between fully-fledged computer and pocket machine comes Olivetti's
'Quaderno', an innovative cross between an electronic organiser and a
notebook, complete with integral digital sound recording facility.
Third, PC marketing has become more important than technology. The PC did
not evolve from the traditional computer industry, but is a product of the
semiconductor business. Early PCs had hundreds of silicon chips but
integration is steadily reducing the number. Eventually, a PC may well
comprise a single chip in a plastic box.
It is hard for traditional manufacturers to add value to such a product.
Intel, which dominates the market for the microprocessor chips used in
IBM-compatible computers and Microsoft which makes the MS/DOS operating
system used in most of these machines, have won the lion's share of the
market's gross profit, with everybody else fighting for the rest.
This explains the diversity of low cost channels now used to distribute PCs.
The list includes mail order, 'off-the-page' (magazine) advertising, and
business superstores.
Although the PC has established itself as the centre of the computing
galaxy, it is by no means certain which technologies will prove to be
shooting stars and which will vanish into black holes. At a recent industry
conference in Vienna, Mr Scott McNealy, the combative chief executive of Sun
Microsystems, one of the fastest growing workstation companies, picked his
winners in processors, operating systems and distributed objects (a new
programming technology).
Not surprisingly, Sun technology was among the winners in each category
along with Intel and IBM in processors, IBM and Microsoft in operating
systems and IBM, Apple and Microsoft in distributed objects. Apple's unique
technology has a place of its own in Mr McNealy's firmament.
But he consigned to the dustbin of computing history IBM's 3090 mainframe
and AS400 processors along with Digital Equipment's VAX and Mips reduced
instruction set processor. He was equally dismissive of operating systems
such as IBM's mainframe MVS and VM and newcomers such as OSF/1 and Steve
Jobs' NextStep.
The industry is in such a state of ferment that the accuracy of Mr McNealy's
predictions should be apparent within the next 12 months.

FT  30 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE recovers losses in late rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SOMEWHAT surprising rally in the UK stock market yesterday afternoon was
accompanied by a spate of rumours of impending developments, ranging from a
bid for a stock in the FT-SE list to cuts in German interest rates. Some
traders sounded sceptical, however, pointing out that fund portfolios were
being polished up for the close tonight of the third quarter of the year,
and that stock index futures had been bid up heavily yesterday.
By the close, the Footsie had recovered all and more of its early setback of
28.5 points and the final reading of 2,565.5 showed a net gain on the day of
5.5 points.
The strong upswing towards the end of the session was encouraged by a
powerful recovery in the pound against the D-mark. In the background,
however, uncertainty over the economic policies of the UK government and the
outlook for domestic interest rates continued to restrain activity.
There was still room for confusion over the near term prospects for a change
in UK economic policies. Evidence of further strains over Europe inside
Britain's governing Conservative party, together with the progress of the
annual conference of the Labour opposition party, added to the general
uncertainty.
The stock market reacted to a strong warning against taking risks with
sterling from Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Governor of the Bank of England.
The City of London read this as a discouragement for early cuts in base
rates. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, reiterated his belief that he
can persuade other European leaders to his view on the problems within the
ERM.
Equity trading volume, lower in the first half of the trading session,
turned smartly higher when the market rallied. The day's Seaq total of
533.8m shares compared with 487.6m on Monday, when retail business worth
Pounds 1.2bn maintained the significant upturn in business seen since
Britain's departure from the European monetary system.
The Footsie Index was helped by a recovery in the pharmaceutical stocks
which have borne the brunt of London's reaction to comments in the US
presidential campaign from Bill Clinton on medical spending.
But domestic stocks remained uneasy after this week's heavy brokerage
downgradings of ICI cast a cloud over the more optimistic earnings valuation
put on the market in the wake of Britain's withdrawal from the ERM and the
cut in UK base rates.
An indication of more favourable attitudes was shown in a sharp rise in
shares in Sears, the leading UK store group and owner of Selfridge's store
in London's Oxford Street, despite confirmation of a widely-predicted cut in
the dividend payout. However, the rest of the retail sector stocks remained
weak yesterday after the Sears board said there was still no sign of any
recovery in consumer spending.
Renewed worries over the levels of consumer and business debt were also
reflected in further selling of bank stocks which are now fast losing the
gains achieved in the initial response to the market's hopes of lower
interest rates.

<TEXT>
THE IMPROVED performance of sterling together with suggestions of a cut in
German interest rates led to a late squeeze in stock index futures and
enlivened an otherwise poor trading session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The December contract on the FT-SE opened for business at 2,609, a 54 point
premium to the cash market, and quickly went into retreat on the back of
reasonable selling and fading hopes for a cut in UK interest rates. It had
fallen to 2,572 by midday.
A period of sideways trading followed before the improved performance of
sterling and rumours of a cut in German interest rates caught the early
sellers on the hop. This led to a squeeze which sent the contract sharply
forward. December finished the session at 2,626, a 5 point improvement on
Monday's closing level and around 22 points above its estimated fair value
premium to cash of about 40. Turnover was healthy and it reached 11,340 by
the close.
Business in the traded options was much improved and turnover rose to 31,894
contracts, up from Monday's poor 20,382 lots. The FT-SE 100 option more than
doubled to 15,563 lots. Barclays was the busiest stock option with a day's
total of 1,319 contracts.

FT  30 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gain in Sears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIVIDEND cut, deepening losses and huge restructuring costs at Sears had
the seemingly contradictory result of sending the stores group's shares
sharply forward in brisk turnover. Sears cut its interim dividend from
1.525p to 1p after reporting a pre-tax interim loss of Pounds 8.8m. It took
a provision of Pounds 32.2m for rationalisation of its shoe subsidiary and
an Pounds 84m extraordinary charge following its withdrawal, announced last
week, from menswear retailing.
However, with the bad news well signposted, the results were already in the
share price, while the dividend cut at least removed uncertainty surrounding
the dividend policy.
Analysts also reported a positive post-results meeting. 'Sears has bitten
the bullet and the market can now look at the potential for recovery of the
company,' said Ms Kimlan Cooke at County NatWest, who yesterday moved from a
sell to a hold on the stock. 'But the shares do not look cheap and Sears has
some way to go before it is out of the woods.'
Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort, brokers to the company, was more bullish.
'While the dividend cut was not as large as some had wanted, the issue is
now resolved. Investors can now focus on the underlying business and the
prospects for growth.' Sears shares climbed 8 to 80p, with turnover of 24m
making it the heaviest traded stock of the day.
Banks sold
Bearish noises from County NatWest put substantial pressure on a banks
sector that has recently outperformed the wider market.
'The sector was at a 10-year relative high and included too much in the way
of recovery hopes built into it,' said Mr John Aitken, banks analyst at
County.
He targeted the whole sector as ripe for profit-taking but picked out
current earnings forecasts for Lloyds and TSB as especially liable to
revision. Mr Aitken warned that Lloyds exposure to the Maxwell empire could
be greater than previously thought.
On TSB he said his current year profits estimate could be as much as 30 per
cent too high, implying a potential downgrade from Pounds 220m to Pounds
150m. He cited Hill Samuel's property lending book as a cause for concern as
well as TSB's ordinary banking bad debts. Mr Aitken's caution on Barclays
largely reflected doubts about an upturn in the property market.
County's bearish views on Lloyds triggered a 21 slide in the shares which
closed at 431p after turnover of 2.6m. Barclays lost 11 to 351p on 4.2m
traded. TSB were barely changed at 133p.
Fisons, the troubled chemicals, group was one of the Footsie stocks spoken
of as a potential takeover target, the shares edging up 3 to 187p, on good
turnover of 4.4m shares.
After several uncomfortable sessions, chiefly at the hands of US investors,
pharmaceutical stocks rebounded as some UK brokers decided the retreat had
been overdone.
Glaxo jumped 18 to 764p, SmithKline 19 to 492p and Wellcome 11 to 920p. More
downgrades of ICI yesterday, following on from Monday, continued to
undermine the shares. They closed 16 off at 1129p.
Enterprise Oil shares, heavily supported by US investors over the past
couple of weeks ahead of news of Monday's ADR listing in New York,
maintained their strong performance to close a further 14 higher at 426p on
relatively high turnover of 1.9m. Lasmo also performed well, edging up 2 to
162p on 2.8m.
Burmah Castrol, on the other hand, were upset by news that Strauss Turnbull
had removed the stock from its buy list, rating it no more than a 'hold'.
Strauss said it would not discourage profit taking at the current level.
BP mirrored the overall market mood, slipping 4 to 213 1/2 p on 8.3m traded,
and was also affected by suggestions that investors were switching out of
the stock and into Shell, which hardened to 539p on good turnover of 5.4m.
Utilities made good progress at the outset but relinquished much of their
early gains as the session wore on. British Gas settled 2 better at 245p on
8.7m. In the electricity distribution stocks Midland held on to a gain of 7
at 405p, while the water stocks showed Thames 9 firmer at 451p.
The power generators staged a useful revival, still boosted by hopes that a
favourable new five-year deal with British Coal will be revealed in the near
future. PowerGen closed 8 1/2 up at 286p and National Power rose 6 to 275p.
Supermarket group Kwik Save surrendered 12 to 672p after Cazenove was
reported to have crossed 1.5m shares at 660p. Northern Foods was the subject
of 'take profits' advice from BZW, among others. The shares lost 4 to 167p.
Airtours moved ahead 8 to 237p as Hoare Govett recommended the tour group,
arguing that the shares have the potential to go to 280p. Rival Owners
Abroad added 4 to 60p.
In the other industrial materials sector, English China Clays lost 19 to
425p, after BZW advised investors to take profits. The four worst performers
in the London market all came from the building areas. Hepworth plunged 40,
or 14 per cent to 243p, damaged by suggestions that the company's own
broker, James Capel, had chopped its current year profits estimate to around
Pounds 44m. Meyer International fell 21, or 9.5 per cent, to 200p, Heywood
Williams 15, or 8 per cent, to 164p, and Tarmac 5 1/2 , or 6.8 per cent, to
75p.
Redland, due to announce interims tomorrow, recovered strongly after a bout
of heavy selling early in the session, and closed only 3 off at 358p, having
been as low of 346p.
Shares in British Steel shed 3 to 58p, after Smith New Court lowered its
current year profits forecast from a profit of Pounds 25m to a loss of
Pounds 50m.
The broker said it expects the company to make no profits the following
year. Mr Ian Lowe at Smith said: 'We do not accept that British Steel has
derived any mid-term advantage from the recent devaluation and indeed in the
longer term it maybe a disadvantage.' Turnover reached 7.7m.
Strong two way business in British Aerospace of 5m left the shares 2 better
at 118p. The company yesterday held a meeting with analysts in an attempt to
steady nerves after last week's disappointing results. Mr Clive
Forestier-Walker at Charter House Tilney said: 'It was a reassuring meeting
but it still leaves prospects about the future uncertain.'
TI Group ended 11 lighter at 290p on the weaker US dollar and nervousness
about the levels of provisions at its Dowty Group subsidiary, due to be
announced tomorrow.

FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Hopes of rate cut stop Dow
falling further

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended slightly lower yesterday after hopes for another cut
in interest rates were overshadowed by more bad news on the economy, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.46 at 3,266.80,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.18 higher at
416.80. The Amex composite slipped 1.64 to 375.61 and the Nasdaq composite
added 2.29 at 577.63. Turnover was 171m shares.
The morning's economic news sparked an early sell-off. The Conference Board
announced that its September index of consumer confidence fell to 56.4, from
59.0 in August. The decline was bigger than expected, and when combined with
news of a 0.2 per cent drop in August's leading economic indicators,
confirmed that economic conditions throughout the country remain weak.
Although depressing, the figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve might
cut interest rates one more time, and this prevented share prices from
falling too far yesterday. Investors were speculating that the Fed may ease
policy on Friday if the September employment report is particularly weak.
Among individual stocks the big feature of the day was Sears Roebuck, which
after a delay because of an order imbalance on the buy side, jumped Dollars
3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 in turnover of 5.4m shares after the giant retailer
announced it was selling off a large chunk of its profitable financial
services operations. The deal, which should raise more than Dollars 3bn in
cash to reduce group debt, was seen as a move to realise shareholder value
and allow Sears to concentrate on core businesses.
Rail stocks were also active after securities house Morgan Stanley
recommended the sector. Among those to benefit most were Consolidated Rail,
up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 5/8 , CSX, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 59,
Norfolk Southern, Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 55 3/4 , and Union Pacific,
Dollars  5/8 firmer at Dollars 54 5/8 .
Times Mirror fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 31 1/4 after the newspaper
publishing group warned that August advertising revenues were down 5.6 per
cent on a year ago.
Middleby soared Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 2 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange
after the company said it won a Dollars 27m verdict in its breach of
contract action against Whitman Corp, which fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 12
1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks suffered their biggest one-day drop since April as a plunging
Canadian dollar and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming constitutional
referendum affected sentiment.
The TSE 300 composite index sank 40.75 points, or 1.21 per cent, to end at
3,327.24. Declining issues swamped advances 414 to 179. Volume was 36.206m
shares worth CDollars 396.8m against 23.625m shares worth CDollars 266.6m on
Monday.
Petro-Canada was up  1/8 to 9 3/4 after it said it will cut its debts.
Telepanel shares jumped 0.475 to 5 3/8 after it signed a marketing agreement
with IBM Corp. BP Canada stock was up  1/4 to 14 3/4 .

FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Investing after the currency turbulence
 -Three international money managers discuss their views with Peter Martin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are a fund manager, how you view the events of the past few weeks
depends on where you sit. For sterling-based international investors, the
devaluation of the pound has produced a helpful boost to performance: in
sterling terms the FT-Actuaries World index excluding the UK has risen by 13
per cent in the past three weeks; in dollars it has fallen 2 per cent.
For investors elsewhere, the news has been more mixed. As the chart shows,
since the Bath meeting of EC finance ministers at which the ERM's tensions
first came to a head in early September, only three of the ten stock markets
shown have risen in value in local currency terms: the UK, Switzerland and
the Netherlands. The others have all fallen, with Japan - down nearly six
per cent - the worst performer.
For one international manager, Henry Looser, head of private banking at Bank
Julius Baer in Zurich, a lot has changed in the past few weeks. Until
recently, he had taken his most aggressive equity position of the past 20
years. Now, with rallies in the UK, Switzerland and Italy, he has readjusted
his portfolios towards a more normal weighting, pulling out of a number of
equity markets entirely. 'We have no further holdings in Italy or Spain,' he
said yesterday, 'and Britain is a market we have really sold out of in the
last two to three days - and we have even started to go short there.'
In equity markets generally, the risk of earnings disappointments is high,
he believes, and it will be possible to buy back in at lower levels. 'There
is a lot of disappointment ahead,' he says. 'It's a minefield, and we will
see mines exploding, taking the market down with them.'
In particular, the outlook for the German economy is very poor, he says, and
D-Mark interest rates are likely to remain at high levels into the first or
second quarter of 1993.
For Robin Apps, head of European equities at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management in London, the outlook is dominated by currency considerations.
The dollar is still cheap on a purchasing power basis, he argues; sterling
could go a lot lower if the British government decides to dash for growth;
the French franc has probably escaped imminent danger of devaluation against
the D-Mark but at a price - in terms of short-term interest rates - that may
prove unsustainable.
'As a house we've been perennially bearish on equities,' he says, because of
an overall expectation of recession, and that position has not changed. 'At
the margin, however, in certain countries one might expect slightly more
growth.' One of these is the UK, 'if it can get away with a
beggar-my-neighbour devaluation.'
Germany is slowing down quite markedly, he believes, with little prospect of
an interest rate easing there until the federal government either raises
taxes or cuts back on payments to the east. 'That is the moment at which the
Bundesbank will ease,' he says.
Even before that moment, however, he is overweight in Germany, believing
that many German companies would offer good value if they were managed on an
Anglo-Saxon basis, with return to shareholders the central consideration.
'Whether they ever do that is debatable, however,' he says.
That long-term play is also part of the investment strategy of William
Holzer, who manages the Scudder Global Fund in New York. Like Apps, he is
significantly overweight in Germany and Switzerland. In other respects,
however, his views offer a marked contrast: as a US-based manager, he can
afford to display an Olympian disregard of the events of the last few weeks.
He is overweight in Switzerland not so much as a country decision but
because he believes 'you can buy global companies cheaper there than
anywhere else.' Elsewhere, his decisions are dominated by big-picture
themes. The last big shift, into undervalued financial services companies,
dated back 'a couple of years or so'.
He thinks another big shift is coming up soon, to adapt to the impact of an
ageing baby boom and a shift of manufacturing out of developed countries to
the Third World. 'The dynamic of the old system was the inflation of
collateral,' he says. 'This time round, it is the infinite ability of the
ldcs to absorb capital and offer a high return on it.'
That leads him to favour global companies which are the essential technology
transfer agents for this process, and savings institutions which will handle
the baby boomers' need to save for retirement.

FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): September book
closingfails to give Nikkei a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL-LOT selling and futures-linked arbitrage unwinding depressed share
prices in thin trading, and the Nikkei average closed down in spite of
buying by public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index fell 224.52 to 17,748.09 after a high of 18,066.21 and a
low of 17,565.21. Volume rose to 240m shares from 203m. Declines led
advances by 813 to 151 with 138 unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 17.37 to 1,331.72 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 0.29 to 1065.85.
Traders noted small-lot buying by public funds in the morning session.
However, institutional investors remained inactive, prompting disappointed
investors to liquidate holdings.
Expectation of a rally ahead of the September book closing had previously
lifted share prices. However, Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that
since banks have been exempted from including valuation losses on
stockholdings in their interim earnings results, large-lot window dressing
has not been seen.
The yen moved slightly higher against the dollar, depressing exporters.
Toshiba fell Y23 to Y575 and Fujitsu lost Y27 to Y578. Toyota Motor declined
Y40 to Y1,370 and Nissan fell Y34 to Y581.
Speculative short term traders dominated business. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting,
the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y498. Aids-related issues lost
ground, with Meiji Milk Products down Y1 to Y990 and Green Cross down Y40 to
Y1,590.
Kubota, a leading maker of farm equipment and ductile iron pipes, rose Y19
to Y570, on its classification as a leading environmental stock.
Hazama, the construction company which will become a component stock of the
Nikkei index next month, rose Y5 to Y506. Seika also drew buying interest,
adding Y7 to Y703.
Godo Shusei, which in turn will be dropped from the Nikkei on October 1,
rebounded on bargain hunting, advancing Y28 to Y598. The issue was sold
heavily on Monday due to the announcement of the exclusion.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 350.52 to 19,151.72 in volume of 20.6m
shares.
Roundup
APART from Taiwan, and in some individual shares, the region's equity
markets moved narrowly yesterday.
BANGKOK saw Krisda Mahanakorn, the property group, hit its 10 per cent
downward limit for the second consecutive day. The SET index was 1.45 higher
at 850.52 in turnover of Bt12.2bn.
Krisda Mahanakorn dropped Bt20 to Bt184 in turnover of Bt2.3bn while Bangkok
Land lost Bt2 to Bt132.
TAIWAN rose on institutional buying of blue chips, but brokers said that
investor confidence remained weak. The weighted index closed 45.66 or 1.4
per cent higher at 3,397.29. Turnover dropped to TDollars 10.8bn.
NEW ZEALAND continued its fall as FCL lost 9 cents to NZDollars 1.91. The
NZSE-40 capital index closed 8.55 lower at 1,426.07 in turnover of NZDollars
30m.
Carter Holt closed up 4 cents at NZDollars 2.58 while Air NZ lost 9 cents to
NZDollars 2.52.
AUSTRALIA ended weaker as the market paid little attention to a better than
expected August current account deficit. The All Ordinaries index closed 8.7
down at 1,487.7 in turnover of ADollars 289.9m.
TNT closed 3 cents lower at ADollars 1.00 following news that Sir Peter
Abeles, the managing director, had resigned to concentrate on the group's
Ansett Transport Industries.
HONG KONG eased after institutional selling reversed morning gains. The Hang
Seng index fell 15.28 to 5,581.92 after rising almost 40 points in the
morning. Turnover rose to HKDollars 1.78bn from HKDollars 1.57bn.
MANILA was stronger on bargain-hunting as PLDT made steady gains. The
composite index gained 8.89 to 1,395.36 in turnover of 440m pesos. PLDT
gained 5 pesos to 970 pesos.
SINGAPORE was steadier on selective gains in blue chips. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 3.98 to 1,353.79 in volume of 51.9m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed three consecutive days of advances and the composite
index shed 4.72 to 605.93. Falls led rises by 210 to 60, in volume of 63.7m
shares against Monday's 119m.
BOMBAY fell in thin volume, displaying neither investment nor speculative
interest as the BSE index fell 44.23 to 3,195.75. Brokers said that the
market was drifting ahead of a four-day holiday weekend beginning this
Friday.

FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late buying brings Paris
little consolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a suggestion of US buying as the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index
improved from its lows in the late afternoon, but this brought little
consolation to the Paris bourse, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS fell another 2.1 per cent as hopes for an easing in interest rates
diminished. Some analysts also pointed to the weakness in the dollar and
arbitrage between the futures and cash markets. The CAC-40 index closed down
38.33 at 1,731.93 in turnover of FFr2.5bn.
Mr Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW in London, said the fact that
there was no sign of an easing in monetary policy by the Bundesbank (its
next meeting is scheduled for Friday), together with expectations of lower
earnings this year was having a negative effect on sentiment.
Financial stocks suffered, with Suez losing FFr11.90 to FFr239.50, and
Paribas weakening FFr22.70 or 6.7 per cent to FFr313.30 ahead of first half
results. Total saw selling following a presentation in London to close
FFr7.10 weaker at FFr203.00.
BRUSSELS hit trouble in steel shares. Clabecq, which announced heavy job
cuts and salary reductions on Monday as part of a restructuring programme,
crashed 19.3 per cent to BFr460 after trade was halted several times for
limit-downs. The Bel-20 Index fell 1.90 to 1,107.20.
Meanwhile the Luxembourg-based Arbed showed a severe drop in first half
profits and fell 4.6 per cent to a 1992 low of BFr2,655, before plans to
cooperate on long steel products with French steel giant Usinor-Sacilor
allowed it to recover to BFr2,760, just BFr20, or 0.7 per cent down on the
day.
FRANKFURT saw some price volatility below international blue chips level as
the DAX index rose 1.22 to 1,476.26.
Turnover rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.2bn. Most carmakers recovered from early
lows after being hit hard on Monday. BMW rose DM3 to DM470 after DM461.50,
and Volkswagen DM3.50 to DM279.50 after DM275. However Porsche dropped DM20
to DM500 after saying that it will lay off 1,000 employees this year after
943 in 1991-92.
Meanwhile, said Mr Deltlev Klug at B Metzler in Frankfurt, dealers took the
initiative in steels, which have been severely depressed recently.
Mannesmann put on DM8.50 to DM215 and Klockner-Werke and Thyssen rose in
sympathy, by DM4.50 to DM71 and DM4.50 to DM166.50 respectively.
STOCKHOLM retreated for its third consecutive day, the Affarsvarlden index
losing 18.3 to 654.1 in turnover of SKr446m. Svenska Handelsbanken, which
reported a 80 per cent fall in interim earnings, saw its B shares lose SKr2
to SKr27.
Skanska B rose SKr2.50 to SKr38.50 in spite of news that Mr Lars-Ove
Hakansson, the chairman, had resigned following losses incurred in its
currency trading department.
MILAN was mixed, the Comit index closing 1.63 lower at 358.82. In banking,
Ambroveneto rose 2.4 per cent, or L73 to L2,063 on media reports that Gemina
was seeking to sell its 13.5 per cent stake. Gemina rose L19 to L799.
AMSTERDAM improved slightly, encouraged by a cut in commercial bank interest
rates. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 111.0.
ZURICH recovered from intraday lows after late foreign buying, the SMI index
closing 1.0 higher at 1,880.2, almost 20 points above the day's low. Dealers
said that late trading became lively when US investors entered the market.
ATHENS fell again on the scramble out of stocks and into high-yield
government bills.
The general share index dropped for the fifth consecutive trading day, this
time by 27.93 or 4.1 per cent to 645.11, down 14.5 per cent since western
Europe's currency crisis began to surface on September 7.
OSLO rose on the takeover battle for the chocolate maker, Freia Marabou. The
all-share index closed 3.99 higher at 327.61 in turnover of NKr156m.
Freia B soared NKr130 to NKr430 after the board said that it was
recommending a NKr450 bid from a Philip Morris unit although the rival
bidder, Hershey Foods, said that it had not given up hope of buying Freia.
COPENHAGEN saw Unidanmark A fall DKr4 to DKr123 as analysts said that the
bank will lose around DKr2.5bn this year, writes Hilary Barnes. The
all-share index closed 0.97 lower at 262.57.

SAO PAULO saw an 8.3 per cent gain in heavy trading by midsession yesterday,

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pact disappointment hits coffee
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES fell sharply in London yesterday as the market registered
disappointment at the lack of definitive progress towards a new
international coffee agreement at talks in London scheduled to end today.
The London November robusta contract closed at Dollars 774 a tonne, down
Dollars 23 on the day, after recovering from an earlier low of Dollars 763.
In New York the December arabica contract was off by 1.40 cents in late
trading at 53.85 cents a lb.
Analysts believe the markets will head downwards again if today's final
communique from the International Coffee Organisation is as anodyne as they
expect.
On Monday last week the markets shot up on optimism over the ICO talks, and
the London robusta contract reached Dollars 816 a tonne. 'We have seen this
euphoria at the start of each ICO meeting,' said Ms Judith Ganes, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'And then as the meetings turned sour, the
market quickly reversed course and tumbled to new contract lows.'
It appears that nine days of talks will end with only one concrete sign of
progress - a proper definition of the 'universal quota' - and that was
agreed last Tuesday. Such an export quota system would be the foundation of
any pact, but problems remained of defining controls and 'selectivity' -
which would allow consumers to import the type of coffee they want.
The principles of export control regulation have been broadly agreed in
principle, and proposals on selectivity were being discussed late last
night. But this was not likely to satisfy the markets, which were looking
for definite progress towards a new pact, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles,
analyst with GNI, the London futures broker.
The ICO will meet again in December, but between now and then there is
little chance of substantive negotiations behind the scenes. The US, the
biggest consumer, has the Presidential elections coming up, and Brazil, the
biggest producer, has presidential troubles of its own.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biggest nickel supplier
searches for cost savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCO, THE western world's largest nickel supplier with about 25 per cent of
the market, is in talks with trade union representatives about the action it
must take to stem losses caused by extremely low prices.
The unions have been asked to put forward suggestions after hearing graphic
descriptions of the company's plight at meetings in Ontario and Manitoba. Mr
Bob Allen, Inco's vice president of public affairs, said that union
responses were still awaited but there would probably be an announcement at
the end of this week. 'We have a number of options, including production
shutdowns or shorter work weeks.'
However, he dismissed metal market rumours that Inco, which produces about
113,000 tonnes of nickel a year, might cut production for six months as
'absurd'.
Nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange rallied from a two and a
half-year low yesterday as conviction grew that Inco and Falconbridge,
another Canadian nickel producer, would announce output cuts soon. Nickel
for delivery in three months, which fell by Dollars 172.50 a tonne on
Monday, closed up Dollars 5 last night at Dollars 6,787 a tonne or Dollars
3.08 a lb.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, said:
'They have to do something soon if we are not to drown in a sea of nickel'.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said: 'Rumour has it that Inco and Falconbridge are preparing to make cuts,
but only when nickel falls below Dollars 6,610 a tonne or Dollars 3 a lb.
But why wait until then? If it's so inevitable, why not head it off?
Prospects of a demand-led recovery are receding and an improvement in the
price can only be brought about by further producer cutbacks'.
Nickel demand is suffering both from a fall in stainless steel production -
stainless accounts for 60 per cent of nickel consumption - down by 3 per
cent in the first half of this year. This resulted in a similar drop in
nickel demand.
Prices have also been depressed by a substantial increase in Russian exports
to the west. Through most of the 1980s communist countries' net exports to
the west amounted to about 35,000 tonnes a year. Russian exports reached
120,000 tonnes in 1990 and 1991 and this year are expected to be about that
level again.
Mr Roger Chaplin, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'With western
economies recovering more slowly than expected at the start of 1992, the
outlook for nickel markets in the medium term appears grim.' He expected the
nickel price to average Dollars 3.50 a lb this year and said it would be
doing well to reach Dollars 4 next year.
Mr Chaplin suggested that Inco's all-in production costs were about Dollars
3.25 a lb so it was suffering losses in the second half of 1992 and, 'unless
there is a substantial rise in the nickel price, it will make losses again
next year'.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean mines minister replaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Chilean minister of mining, Mr Alejandro Hales, has been sworn in to
replace Mr Juan Hamilton, who has resigned to prepare his campaign for
election to the senate next year.
Mr Hales, who held the same post in the 1960s, will automatically become
chairman of Codelco, the Chilean Copper Corporation, the world's biggest
copper company. He is close to the ruling Christian Democrat party, of which
Mr Hamilton is also a member.
The change comes at a time when Codelco officials are negotiating for a
sharp increase in the investment budget for 1993 to make room for the
construction of the Radomiro Tomic mine, a Dollars 500m project planned to
be producing 150,000 tonnes a year of copper cathodes by 1995.
Codelco's 1992 budget was Dollars 430m and officials say they need at least
Dollars 600m to develop Radomiro Tomic, the company's most promising new
deposit. The mine is Codelco's largest investment since it was nationalised
in 1971.
Selecting a financing strategy for Radomiro Tomic will be a key decision for
Mr Hales. Mr Hamilton had created a special task force, made up of officials
from the mining ministry and Codelco, to propose ways to raise cash for the
project.
The task force will also look into the possibility of divesting assets that
are not linked to Codelco's mining activities, including a hospital next to
the Chuquicamata mine and the Tocopilla power station, which supplies energy
to Chuquicamata and BHP-RTZ's La Escondida copper mine.
Mr Hamilton's tenure as minister was marked by several semi-public
skirmishes with Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's chief executive. The latest,
which took place last week, was over the appointment by Mr Hamilton of Mr
Osvaldo de Castro as vice president of new business, officials in the
company say.
Mr Noemi's choice for the job was Mr Jorge Bande, at present vice president
of planning. Finally, Mr Noemi and Mr Hamilton worked out a formula whereby
Mr de Castro will only take on negotiations for the El Abra mine, a
promising project for which Codelco needs to form a joint venture.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gummer urges subsidy block on
polluters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community should have the power to suspend payment of subsidies
to farmers who abuse the environment, Mr John Gummer, the UK minister of
agriculture and current president of the EC Agricultural Council, said
yesterday.
He said individual governments could withdraw payments under national
schemes but did not have the power to do so under community schemes.
Mr Gummer was speaking after chairing an informal meeting of EC agriculture
ministers at Cambridge.
He said those few farmers who behaved in a way that was clearly damaging to
the environment should not receive EC support. In the absence of such
powers, the Common Agricultural Policy suffered as a result of public
opinion, which wanted farmers to not only produce food but to be guardians
of the countryside.
Mr Gummer said he did not believe that environmental protection should be an
optional choice for the countries of Europe.
He wanted to see duties of environmental care written in to as many of the
EC market support systems as possible.
However, he made clear that not all EC agriculture ministers agreed with the
need for more environmental regulations at a time when their farmers were
already trying to come to terms with reform of the CAP.
'Mr Gummer's environmental fig leaf has finally wilted,' was the comment of
Mr Hugh Raven, co-ordinator of the Safe Alliance (Sustainable Agriculture,
Food and Environment), on the minister's statement, which he said
acknowledged 'his dismal failure to have environmental criteria incorporated
as part of the CAP support mechanisms.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper smelters 'face stiff
competition'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER SMELTERS face a difficult time in the second half of the 1990s
because of substantial growth in solvent-extraction, electrowinning (SX-EW)
technology which does away with the smelting process, suggests the Metals &amp;
Minerals Research Services consultancy group.
'The smelting industry may be faced with an unappetising choice between
radical pruning or persistently poor market conditions,' said Mr Stephen
Briggs, author of an MMRS report on the market for custom copper
concentrates.
The report suggests that in the next five years there will be an increase of
more than 20 per cent in total mine production potential and smelter
capacity growth. However, more than half of mine capacity growth will come
from SX-EW operations.
The near doubling of SX-EW's share of total mine capacity and the widespread
desire of mining companies to have their own smelting capability will narrow
the base of the custom mining sector even though the range of custom
smelters will not diminish.
'If the copper market is to be balanced and concentrates (an intermediate
material used to feed smelters) are to be available, primary smelter
capacity utilisation rates will be forced to drop - and sharply so by the
mid-1990s. This will have profound consequences for the custom concentrate
market,' said Mr Briggs.
Treatment charges for copper concentrates 'will be forced back in favour of
miners over the next five years, either to choke off some of the growth in
smelter capacity or to reflect increasingly tight concentrate supplies.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mauritius plans to overhaul
flagging sugar industry - Julian Ozanne on the challenges faced by Africa's
third largest producer in a changing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRITICAL strategic review of the Mauritian sugar industry is being
undertaken by the government and producers as the sector, the backbone of
the economy, confronts the prospect of declining revenues for its annual
production of 600,000 to 650,000 tonnes.
Production last year dropped to 611,340 tonnes from 624,302 tonnes in 1990
as a result of drought and continued contraction in the area planted.
Concerns are mounting in Mauritius that this trend will continue as revenues
are forecast to stagnate or decline as the European Community considers
reducing the guaranteed support price paid to African Caribbean Pacific
(ACP) producers under the Lome convention.
A major overhaul of the industry is now critical if Mauritius, Africa's
third largest sugar producer after South Africa and Egypt, is to remain
competitive and productive in a changing world market.
A report drawn up by the Mauritius Chamber of Agriculture lays down the
guidelines for a reappraisal of the sector. It warns that the industry has
come to a crossroads and that if major hard policy decisions are not
confronted now the industry's decline is inevitable.
At the heart of the concerns voiced by the 19 big estate producers, who
account for 62 per cent of cane production, is the need for a fundamental
reassessment of the role of state intervention in the industry.
However, there appear to be growing differences between the powerful sugar
lobby and the government over what role the state should play. The Chamber
of Agriculture says that the sugar industry is heavily regulated and that
significant liberalisation is vital to restore the sector's profitability
and preserve its international competitiveness. 'If reform does not take
place,' the chamber warns, 'there is a very real risk that resources will
gradually be siphoned off from the sugar industry to other sectors.'
The chamber has put forward a number of policy recommendations to a joint
government-private sector working committee, which include:
Price liberalisation - The industry argues that price controls on domestic
sales make Mauritian sugar the cheapest in the world and force the industry
to subsidise the consumer by up to 50 per cent of the cost of production.
Reform and Reduction in taxation, export duty and government cesses.
Abolition of restrictions which prevent a miller from closing an
economically unviable factory at will.
Improved incentives for investment in the milling sector.
Already this year the government has responded to some demands made by
producers. The June budget provided for the issue of tax free debentures by
sugar companies for the modernisation of their equipment and removed customs
duty on mechanical harvesters. In August the government also substantially
increased the domestic price of sugar injecting MR60m (Pounds 2m) into the
industry. Mr Madan Dulloo, agriculture minister, says other measures will be
considered to amend the Sugar Industry Efficiency Act before the end of the
year. But he warns that the government is not going to give in to the
'propaganda' of sugar barons and that, given the pivotal importance of the
sector to the economy, any policy changes will have to be balanced within a
political, economic and social context and will have to ensure the
protection of the 33,000 small planters.
The debate on the proper role of government in the Mauritian sugar industry
is likely to continue for several years and any changes will probably be
minor.
In the meantime both government and producers are working on the areas on
which they do agree, which include:
The need significantly to boost sugar yields from the present rate for the
estate sector of 8.5 tonnes a hectare (3,4 tonnes an acre) to 10 tonnes or
more by better irrigation techniques. Encouraging small holder farmers to
regroup in Land Unit Management Areas to enable them to take advantage of
better mechanisation for land preparation and harvesting.
Continuing the development of an international marketing policy which
increases annual sales of 75,000 tonnes of premium sugars like demerara and
molasses sugar. Finding new ways to add value to by-products of the sugar
industry and intensify agricultural diversification.
If the government and producers can find creative ways to implement many of
these measures the industry hopes to restore its competitiveness and
profitability and to restore production to the 1973 peak level of more than
700,000 tonnes to reduce costs further and be able to capitalise on new
opportunities on the international market.

Sentiment in most of the LME base metals remained depressed by rising
inventories, slack demand, and sluggish economic growth prospects. The
latter factor was underlined by US economic data - August leading indicators
fell 0.2 per cent, while September consumer confidence dropped to 56.4 from
59. COPPER continued to decline, dropping to the lowest levels for three
months with stocks rising again. Final business was at the low of Dollars
2,360 for three-month metal, Dollars 19 down from Monday. In contrast ZINC
rallied in kerb trading on late short covering to end at the day's highs
after encountering solid support at Dollars 1,280 for three-month metal.
PLATINUM closed easier in London and futures prices were down at midday in
New York, under pressure from the downbeat US economic data and a fall in
the Nikkei stock average. Japan is the world's biggest platinum importer.
New York COTTON futures were lower in all months at midday but somewhat
recovered from fresh life of contract lows. Analysts said there was no fresh
fundamental influence, but prices continued to be dogged by world oversupply
and sluggish demand for US cotton.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Equity Issues: Turmoil causes Swedish
government to postpone Procordia privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT turmoil in the European financial markets has taken its toll on the
international equity issues business.
The Swedish government has decided to postpone the privatisation of
Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical group, because of the
unfavourable stock market conditions, and investment bankers claim that
fewer companies are lining up to launch international equity offerings while
the markets are in such an unsettled state.
The privatisation of Procordia was expected to take place this autumn, but
has now been scheduled for the spring - provided stock market conditions
prove more conducive.
The Swedish stock market has plummeted recently on worries about possible
devaluation of the krona, concern over the troubled financial sector, and
against a backdrop of very high interest rates.
The government agreed an economic package with the main opposition parties
on September 20 aimed at boosting confidence in the Swedish economy and, at
the same time, said it would postpone selling its shares in Procordia.
Bankers point out that, given the current state of the Swedish stock market,
it could prove hard to drum up much retail interest in the offering. About
half of the shares will be aimed at international investors, while the rest
will be aimed at domestic buyers.
Procordia's stock market capitalisation has fallen to SKr35.3bn (Dollars
6.4bn) from SKr45.7bn at the end of May.
The Swedish state owns 40.4 per cent of Procordia's voting shares and 34.2
per cent of the total share capital. The other main shareholder in the
company is Volvo, the Swedish car and truck manufacturer.
Repsol, the Spanish state-owned oil, gas and chemicals group, has also
delayed its planned international equity offering until next year. However,
the decision to postpone the issue was not related to market conditions but
hinged on the fact that Repsol must wait for parliament to lift certain
legal barriers.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Referendum uncertainty puts pressure on
Canadian bond prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN government bond prices dropped 1 1/4 points yesterday, as the
Canadian dollar came under fire in the foreign exchange markets. The
currency fell below key resistance levels against the US dollar, following
pressure during re-cent trading sessions, and suffered against the yen,
prompting some Japanese investors to sell Canadian bonds.
Fears about the outcome of the October 26 referendum on a package of
constitutional measures have contributed to volatile conditions in Canada's
financial markets. Yesterday, opposition leaders criticised Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney for causing panic on financial markets with warnings that
Canada could break apart if the No side wins the national unity referendum.
Support for the package has slipped since the deal was struck a month ago,
according to recent polls. The bond market was further undermined by concern
about the reception of yesterday's CDollars 1.5bn government bond auction.
GERMAN bond prices ended slightly higher in thin trade yesterday. Activity
was concentrated in the German money market where the government both
drained and added liquidity in different areas of the market, prompting
continued confusion over the Bundesbank's intentions over interest rates at
Friday's council meeting.
However, the strength of the D-Mark, combined with growing fears over the
German economy, may tip the scales in favour of a rate cut, according to
some analysts. Speculation that the fluctuation band between the D-Mark and
the French franc will be tightened is encouraging hopes of an interest rate
cut, which would help support the franc.
The German bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 90.50, up from 90.34 at
Monday's close.
FRENCH government bonds ended  3/4 point lower, as hopes that France would
join a fast-track to monetary union faded.
High money market rates continued to hamper activity in the bond market,
where it is now very expensive to finance trading positions. The market has
also become rather nervous about the French government's 1993 budget plans
and the monthly auction of bonds later this week.
GILT prices recouped earlier losses to end the day virtually unchanged, as
the market continued to trade nervously within a fairly narrow range.
Comments by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England,
suggesting that sterling's weakness would not leave room for further
substantial rate cuts, helped depress sentiment.
The market 'is still reorganising itself' in the wake of sterling's
suspension from the ERM two weeks ago, according to Mr John Kendall, an
economist at Baring.
Nevertheless, expectations of some reduction of interest rates in the near
future continue to benefit the short end of the market, while longer-dated
bonds have steadied.
The long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 97.17, slightly lower than
Monday's close of 97.21.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied again yesterday as the yen continued to
strengthen against the US dollar. However, worries that the government may
issue deficit-financing bonds pulled both the cash and futures market down
late in Tokyo trading and the market closed lower on the day. The yen
reached a high of 119.38 to the dollar in Tokyo trading, and climbed further
to reach 119.10 to the dollar in the London session. The strength of the
Japanese currency has revived hopes recently of an easing in interest rates,
pushing up bond prices.
The futures contract, which opened at 106.62, reached a high of 106.75 on
the yen's strength. However, shortly before the market was due to close, a
Japanese news service reported that the government would probably have to
issue deficit-financing bonds. Dealers said the reports pushed bond prices
down and the futures contract closed at 106.52.
Deficit-financing bonds are issued specifically to finance deficit spending
in excess of revenue.
Traders said some of the selling at the end of the session may have been
hedging ahead of today's expected Y800bn auction of 10-year bonds.
US Treasury prices eased slightly across the maturity range yesterday,
despite further bad news on the economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 98
19/32 , to yield 7.361 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly weaker,
down  3/32 at 100 13/32 to carry a yield of 3.804 per cent.
The day's figures continued to paint a bearish picture of economic
conditions. The Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence fell from
59.0 in August to 56.4 in September, the third straight monthly fall and a
worse figure than analysts expected, while the leading index of economic
indicators fell 0.2 per cent in August.
Although both sets of data increased the chances that the Federal Reserve
may ease monetary policy again, possibly after Friday's employment report,
investors are cautious about pricing an interest rate cut into the market.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: International interest in
Latin paper to be tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW spate of Latin American borrowings in the international bond markets
is under way, further testing the interest of foreign investors for Latin
American paper.
Yesterday saw the pricing of the latest issue from the Rep-ublic of
Argentina, the third since its return to the international bond market. At
Dollars 250m, with a maturity of five years - longer than it has previously
attempted - the issue marks a new test of the country's acceptability
internationally.
The bonds were priced yesterday to yield 300 basis points over US Treasuries
 -considerably higher than the spread of little more than 200 basis points
that has been talked about in recent weeks. Discussions with potential
investors proved that Argentina, still rated only a B1 credit by Moody's
after a July up-grade, has not yet achieved such levels of financial
acceptability.
Compared with the yield spread of some 400 basis points on another five-year
issue from Telecom Argentina, the bonds were considered to be fairly priced,
though an issue of this size is expected to take some time to sell.
Meanwhile, another new Latin credit is about to be presented to
international investors - the Corporacion And-ino de Fomento (CAF), the
de-velopment fund for the Andean Pact countries (Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru
and Colombia).
The Dollars 75m issue, led by Chemical Bank, is not expected to be launched
for some weeks, after a road-show to potential investors. CAF is regarded as
a good credit, since the Andean Pact countries are likely to regard their
debts to the fund as ranking before other international commitments, said Mr
Paul Luke, an economist with Morgan Grenfell in London.
In a further new issue from the region, Venezuela is preparing to borrow
Dollars 115m. Unlike other borrowers, though, it is launching the bonds in
Colombia in a move aimed at attracting some of the excess dollars in the
country.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Denmark produces tightly-priced Dollars
500m issue to top up its foreign reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK turned to the Eurobond market yesterday to help top up its foreign
exchange reserves, producing an extremely tightly-priced Dollars 500m issue
that brought sharp intakes of breath from some underwriters.
The lead-managers, though, reported that most of the paper was placed during
the day, apparently disproving a view that borrowing costs in the
international bond market would rise sharply after the events of recent
days.
The five-year issue had attracted bids at a yield of over 45 basis points
above US Treasuries, but Daiwa won the mandate at a bid below 30. At launch,
the bid spread was 28.2 basis points over Treasuries.
Even the lead-managers said this was some four or five basis points below
the market clearing level, though other banks said the yield should have
been up to 10 basis points higher.
Demand was said to be strong from the Far East, with more than half the
bonds sold being placed there overnight.
Daiwa said it and the two co-leads - Westdeutsche Landesbank and Warburg -
had placed some 80 per cent of the Dollars 420m of bonds they had
underwritten between them. That was a higher proportion than most others had
thought possible given tight pricing.
After breaking syndicate, Daiwa stood behind the issue, picking up some
bonds as the yield spread rose to around 32 basis points. That appeared
comfortable with the break-even for the syndicate at around 34 basis points,
however, and the spread tightened later to under 30.
The deal drew a mixture of grudging support and disbelief from other
bankers. Even for a borrower renowned for squeezing every last basis point
out of the market, the pricing was seen as very tight. Other bankers said
only once the price had found its final level in the secondary market could
the deal be judged.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to outline restructuring
plan
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing property developer, will today present the
outline of a restructuring plan to creditors of its operations in the US.
A feature of today's meeting will be the absence of the Reichmann family,
who own O&amp;Y, or of the team handling restructuring negotiations for the
Canadian parent company and the Canary Wharf project in London.
The US subsidiaries, which have managed to avoid the bankruptcy protection
granted last May to O&amp;Y's operations in Canada and the UK, have sought to
distance themselves from the rest of the company.
O&amp;Y is expected to ask the creditors to agree to postpone principal payments
on its US buildings for the next five years and to pay interest only on
those buildings which generate enough rental income to service their debts.
This, in essence, is what the company has been doing since its problems
surfaced earlier this year.
Today's briefing, which will be held in one of O&amp;Y's buildings in downtown
Manhattan, will be chaired by Mr John Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New
York who is chief executive of the US arm.
The meeting is being described as a preliminary which will be followed by
discussions with individual groups of lenders. Each of O&amp;Y's two dozen or so
buildings has its own group of bank lenders and/or bondholders. However,
negotiations are complicated by the fact that, in some cases, loans to one
building are backed by other properties. In addition, there are a number of
unsecured lenders.
O&amp;Y has equity partners in several of its US properties, including Mr Li
Kashing, the Hong Kong tycoon and JMB, the Chicago-based property developer.

<TEXT>
NORTHERN TELECOM, the Canadian telecommunications group, is to take a 7.5
per cent stake in MMB, the French holding company which controls Matra, the
telecommunications and transport group, and Hachette, the advertising and
publishing company.
The move, to come into force at the end of this year, is a consequence of an
offer published yesterday to buy out the outstanding MMB shareholders to
pave the way for the merger of Matra and Hachette.
Northern Telecom is separately to pay FFr1.36bn (Dollars 270m) for a 20 per
cent stake in Matra's telecommunications subsidiary.
Mr Philippe Camus, chairman of MMB, said Paribas, the French bank and
industrial holding group, would also take 4 per cent in MMB, while other
French financial institutions would take 25 per cent.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the businessman who controls Matra and Hachette,
would take more than 10 per cent and Floirat, a holding group allied to Mr
Lagardere, would take less than 10 per cent. Before the offer, MMB was 38.4
per cent owned by a Lagardere-controlled holding company, Arjil Groupe.
Outstanding shareholders are being offered FFr85 per share. This compares
with the FFr83.9 at which MMB's shares were suspended on Monday, while the
details were awaited.
Hachette was on course to report a net profit of FFr100m to FFr200m this
year, after a FFr1.93bn loss in 1991, but the outlook for 1993 was
uncertain, said Mr Camus.
Matra was set this year to report an increase on last year's net profit of
FFr252m and the prospects for 1993 were good, he said.

on Stealth bombers

<TEXT>
NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2
Stealth bomber programme, may lose about Dollars 232m in profits on its
first 10 bombers because of manufacturing problems, according to US press
reports.
The company, which is trying to increase its presence as a supplier of parts
to commercial jets, is taking a third-quarter charge of Dollars 152m on a
missile programme. Northrop's profit rate on the 10 aircraft is expected to
drop to 9.5 per cent from a negotiated rate of 13.8 per cent. As of June,
the programme had run about Dollars 555m over the contract target of Dollars
7.4bn.
The higher costs were attributed to lower aircraft orders, problems with
sub-contractor performance, and a 42-day strike. The company said it had
taken these issues into account.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Chairman pumps life into US tyre
group - John Griffiths talks with Stanley Gault who has wasted little time
in changing direction at Goodyear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS than two years ago, Goodyear Tire and Rubber's employees were
contemplating their company's rapidly-deflating fortunes with dismay.
A 1987 net profit of Dollars 770.9m had plunged by 1990 to a loss of Dollars
40m. Savage job cuts were under way among the worldwide workforce of more
than 100,000 people, and Goodyear was being demoted from first place to
third in the world hierarchy of tyre manufacturers.
Today, Goodyear is rolling away from recession almost as rapidly as the
company skidded into it.
It achieved record first-half sales of Dollars 5.8bn and a leap in
first-half net earnings to a well-above-forecast Dollars 176m. This week,
the company indicated there would be further third-quarter gains in both
sales and profits.
Goodyear is being helped by a recovery slowly gaining pace in world tyre
markets. But long-serving executives at the headquarters in Akron, Ohio, say
that no less significant is the shake-up instituted by Mr Stanley Gault,
chairman, since taking office in June last year.
It is a shake-up not without tensions: tomorrow, Mr Oren Shaffer,
long-serving chief financial officer, is to resign to pursue other
interests.
Unlike most of his predecessors Mr Gault, 66, is no dyed-in-the-treads tyre
man.
He spent 10 years as chairman and chief executive of Rubbermaid, the Ohio
toys-to-furniture group, before joining Goodyear. However, the bulk of his
31-year career had been spent with General Electric, where he became senior
vice-president in charge of GE's industrial products and components sectors.
Mr Gault has wasted little time in altering Goodyear's course, while not
overtly criticising his predecessors at Akron.
Nothing could better symbolise his strongly marketing-oriented approach than
the announcement in March that Goodyear-branded tyres would be sold through
North America's biggest retailing chain, Sears, Roebuck.
However, Mr Gault's edict was heresy to the managers of Goodyear-owned
replacement tyre depots and independent dealers through which the company's
tyres had been sold exclusively in North America.
He has no problems defending the decision. Goodyear's share of the large
North American replacement car tyre market had fallen from 15 per cent to 12
per cent in the previous three years. The dedicated outlets had a reputation
for being expensive and the market was changing, with brand loyalties
fading.
Sears, Roebuck, moreover, is North America's single largest tyre retailer,
selling nearly 10m units a year. 'In other words, we haven't had tyres for
sale in the places where people want to buy them,' says Mr Gault.
His concern about the replacement market is well-founded. It is three times
larger than the original equipment sector and, although highly competitive,
offers better margins.
Goodyear has since reclaimed one percentage point of its lost market share
and added more than 1,000 employees to the North American retail market this
year.
The 2.5m Goodyear tyres Mr Gault hopes Sears will sell annually would
restore nearly two percentage points.
The deal with Sears covers supplies of own-label tyres produced by
Goodyear's more downmarket subsidiary, Kelly -Springfield. For these,
distribution deals have been concluded with Wal-Mart another mass retailer,
and with Big O, an independent tyre retailing chain.
Goodyear has added another 3,300 outlets selling Goodyear or
Goodyear-produced tyres in North America - a 35 per cent increase.
Goodyear's profits are being helped by the tyre industry's determined effort
this year to break the long, recession-induced squeeze on margins by
announcing price increases of up to 7 per cent.
No one expects it all to stick. However, Mr Philip Wylie, Barclays de Zoete
Wedd analyst and author of a recent Economist Intelligence Unit report on
the world tyre industry, estimates that about half should be retained, with
a further lift coming from a long-delayed upturn in US vehicle production.
Mr Gault has brought to the market some new products perceived as providing
Goodyear with a technological edge. Most notable is the Aquatred, a tyre
with a large central groove, which gives the impression of two tyres mounted
on one wheel. It is claimed to have superior grip on wet roads.
Much of Mr Gault's first year has been devoted to morale-improving missions
to plants as the number of employees has shrunk to 97,000 and Goodyear has
continued to seek productivity improvements.
In 1991, 7,000 jobs were lost worldwide. The company will continue to reduce
manning levels wherever possible, Mr Gault insists, but the harshest cuts -
15,000 over the past four years - are said to be over.
The aim is to improve operating margins; reduce further the debt burden
incurred in fighting off Sir James Goldsmith's takeover bid in the late
1980s and maintain tight control of capital spending.
Excluding restructuring items, Goodyear's operating margin improved to 9.2
per cent in the first half of this year, from 6.2 per cent in the same
period of 1991.
Mr Gault hopes the debt burden will fall to below Dollars 2bn by the end of
this year, down from Dollars 3.7bn in last year's first quarter - and two
years ahead of schedule.
He acknowledges there is little prospect of selling off the multi-billion
dollar All American Pipeline, Goodyear's most ill-advised diversification
project of the 1980s. However, its operating losses in the first half of
this year were cut to Dollars 13.5m, about one-third of year-ago levels and
Mr Gault holds out the prospect of it soon making a profit.
Goodyear's European operations have been slimmed down, and in this region at
least 'there is not a lot of restructuring left for us to do'. Indeed,
Goodyear plans a Dollars 12.5m investment next year at its Luxembourg truck
tyre plant.
Expansion is also planned for Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia
and other Pacific Rim countries.
Mr Gault is philosophical about Goodyear's demotion as the world's biggest
tyremaker by both Michelin of France and Japan's Bridgestone. Both, he
suggests, are saddled with bigger debt burdens than they bargained for with
their respective acquisition of Uniroyal-Goodrich and Firestone.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: Make-your-mind-up time - John Major cannot
afford to put off the crucial decision on the UK's future role in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign affairs, domestic politics, economic policy: the barriers between
them have broken down. At this moment in British history, a commentator can
no longer take refuge in his 'specialist' role. It is a time when choices
have to be made.
I am not qualified, in any specialist sense, to pass an economic judgment on
Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. Nor would I
deny that political ambitions are doomed to failure if they ignore economic
realities. But I believe the choice facing the UK government in these
crucial weeks is more important than any technical issue about the
management of the exchange rate.
Until two weeks ago Mr John Major's name stood for something, not only in
Britain but in Europe:
He was the chancellor who had persuaded the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to
bring the pound into the ERM. Too late, perhaps. At the wrong rate, it now
seems almost certain. But he did it.
He was the leader to whom his party turned when Mrs Thatcher's position,
largely because of her anti-Europeanism, had become untenable.
He was the prime minister who promised to put Britain at the heart of
Europe, who forged a new working relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
and who blessed the alliance of his party with the Christian Democrats in
the European Parliament.
Finally, he was the man who negotiated and accepted the Maastricht treaty.
Admittedly he did so in the run-up to a general election, with many anxious
backward glances. He earned, in those negotiations, the sobriquet of 'true
Euro-sceptic' bestowed on him last weekend by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones.
He fought, in alliance with the French government, to expunge all traces of
federalism from the proposed European Union, thereby ensuring that it would
be less democratic and probably less effective than it might have been. He
insisted on reserving Britain's final decision on joining the monetary union
until a later stage in the process. And he set his face so firmly against
any social dimension of the Union that, in the words of one Conservative
MEP: 'If they'd put a blank sheet of paper headed Social Chapter in front of
him and left him to fill it in for himself, he still wouldn't have signed
it.'
This, of course, was so that he could return to London claiming victory.
'Game, set and match for Britain,' he proclaimed, making many of us wince.
But it was all good politics: a means to the end of ensuring that Britain
was at last accepted by the rest of the EC as a wholehearted, if sometimes
difficult, partner.
Now that achievement has been, to say the least, thrown into doubt. It is
not all Mr Major's fault. He was not helped by the Danish referendum result
 -though with hindsight he must surely regret not pressing on regardless
with Britain's parliamentary ratification process and getting it out of the
way. He was not helped by President Francois Mitterrand's decision to hold a
referendum in France, which may have seemed like a purely procedural issue
in early June but, by late August, had generated enough uncertainty to throw
the currency markets into turmoil. And he was not helped as much as he might
have been by the Bundesbank, which - not having been consulted about the
exchange rate fixed in 1990 - was neither convinced by it intellectually nor
committed to it morally.
He was not helped, either, by British industry, which failed lamentably to
seize the opportunities offered by Germany's unification boom - with the
result that Britain was less able than Holland or France to sustain the high
interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank to choke the boom off.
So a realignment within the ERM would have been an acceptable, if in some
respects regrettable, response to what had become a very bleak economic
position. Pulling out of the ERM was harder to reconcile with Mr Major's
European reputation, but that reputation can still be retrieved if he
confirms unambiguously that this is only a temporary measure, and above all
if he commits himself clearly to getting Maastricht ratified by the British
parliament as soon as possible.
That may be what he thought he was doing in his speech in the Commons last
Thursday. But outside the House the blast of the trumpet has come over as a
weak and feeble sound. It seemed as if Mr Major was more concerned to delay
or at best avoid the issue, by hedging both ERM re-entry and Maastricht
ratification with conditions, than to summon his supporters for a decisive
struggle.
Meanwhile Mr Norman Lamont has continued banging his new-found nationalist
drum. He has staked out a supposedly independent British monetary policy
which, if it means anything, means that Britain will henceforth give a lower
priority to the fight against inflation; and he has engaged in an
unbelievably puerile war of words with the Bundesbank.
Emulating the unjust steward in the gospel, Mr Lamont has been trying to
save his career by making himself 'friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness', among the fiercest critics of what was until a fortnight
ago the be-all and end-all of his economic policy. By yesterday things had
reached the point where, in order to placate these new-found friends, he was
obliged to disclaim any intention of apologising for his intemperate
anti-German remarks.
Two weeks ago Mr Major was honourably unwilling to make Mr Lamont the
scapegoat for the failure of a policy to which he himself was equally
committed. That was rather quixotic even at the time - especially in view of
his willingness to throw Mr David Mellor to the wolves for far more trivial
reasons. But Mr Lamont's position has now become completely untenable.
Given his constantly repeated anti-devaluation stance before September 16 he
cannot credibly present himself as the architect of an entirely different
policy. But equally his statements since then are incompatible with any
attempt to retrieve even the shreds of the government's European policy and
the prime minister's reputation.
Mr Major's instinct is, it seems, to play for time, in the hope that he can
avoid splitting his party by extracting new forms of words from his European
colleagues. He may even hope that, if he waits long enough, Maastricht will
collapse under its own weight.
That instinct is wrong. Even if it enables him to remain prime minister
(which is far from certain), it will be only - as Mr John Smith so
felicitously put it - as the 'devalued prime minister of a devalued
government' and indeed of a devalued country.
Maastricht is not perfect. It may have to be augmented, reinterpreted or
even revised. But Mr Major can only argue that case within the EC if it is
absolutely clear that he is not trying to wriggle out of the commitment he
gave last December. If he wants Britain ever again to be taken seriously in
Europe he must make up his mind now, remind the world what he stands for,
and insist that his party follow him or choose another leader.

Sir, Your published illustration of a selection of European bank notes

While international markets have been churning sterling in recent weeks, the
Royal Mint has been contributing for years to our monetary confusion.

<TEXT>
Sir, Donald Elkin's 'Investor Protection - Expatriates' (Finance &amp; the
Family, September 15) stated that Ireland does not have an investor
compensation scheme.
While there is no national scheme for the investment services sector, member
firms of the Irish Stock Exchange participate in a scheme for investor
compensation.
Mr Elkin's final comment was that 'expatriates have greater protection when
dealing with UK firms than they would by investing in an unregulated
environment'. One cannot quibble with a statement of the obvious. However,
some readers may have inferred from his statement that most places outside
the UK, in particular certain countries mentioned, do not have regulated
environments.
The Irish stock market is subject to a high quality system of regulation,
based on the same code as in the UK. Members of the Irish Stock Exchange
participate in an investor compensation scheme.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Drowning Germany clings to the franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MAURICE ANDRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I express the wholly unorthodox view that, in recent days, the
Bundesbank was trying less to save the French franc than to protect Germany
from the consequences of its refusal to pay for being reunited?
'Hard-core Europe,' that child of Messrs Delors, Kohl and Mitterrand, is
only a device allowing the drowning German economy to cling as long as
possible to the French one (the fundamentals of which were the best in
Europe two weeks ago) until both are finally sunk.
Otherwise, there is no reason for France to go on living with an
uncompetitive exchange rate and real interest rates twice or thrice as high
as what is sustainable in the long run.
If a united Europe is thought necessary, then let the other 11 countries go
ahead and leave Germany alone until it is willing to solve its own problems.

George Soros, the Hungarian-American investment guru, has just hired another
economist who knows Capitol Hill and the international economic
policy-makers circuit as thoroughly as he understands Wall Street.
Robert Johnson, a foreign exchange specialist from Bankers Trust in New
York, is also a former chief economist of the Senate Banking Committee and
is the sort of forex expert to make chartists nervous.
In the recent Euro-turmoil, it is those plugged into the policy-making scene
who have been able to make the most of the central banks' discomfiture - and
hedge funds, such as those in the Soros stable, have increasingly been on
the look-out for economists who can span both worlds.
It is also the hedge funds in particular that are understood to have had a
field day in the past few weeks - though Johnson is of course not prepared
to give anything away on that score.

<TEXT>
If there is any doubt that grandsons who inherit the family business can do
better than their ancestors, then the career of Italy's Gianni Agnelli
proves otherwise.
After spending 25 years at the helm of Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector
company, and over half a century as a director, Agnelli has finally
announced he will hand over the wheel in 1994.
Fiat's fortunes have prospered under Agnelli, but with the domestic economy
souring and Fiat's share of the domestic car market now in steady decline,
L'Avvocato, as he is known, may have decided he could hardly bend Fiat's
rules which forbid anyone who is 75 during his term of office from standing
for re-election.
However, Agnelli is handing over to his brother Umberto, 13 years his
junior, because he says his own son, Edoardo, is not a businessman.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: In praise of the 'New Look Employment' scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D J ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article 'Flexibility is all in a Year's Work: A look at
one company's experience of introducing an annualised hours system' by
Catherine Milton (September 7).
The article, I felt, did less than justice to the 'New Look Employment'
scheme operated at the Van den Berghs factory in Purfleet, Essex.
British industry has been plagued for years with the uncompetitive practices
of low productivity, high overtime and trade demarcations.
The annual hours 'New Look Employment' contract that was introduced ln
January 1990, with a majority Yes vote from the membership of each of the
unions concerned, has proved to be a very successful means of wiping away,
at a stroke, these costly industrial practices.
In recognition of this, our employees now enjoy a guaranteed annual salary,
work substantially fewer hours than previously, and are much more involved
in the day-to-day problem solving in their work areas.
Productivity increased significantly and the foundation was laid for a
better working climate for everyone ln the factory. We are very proud of the
factory, our achievements and also of the annual hours agreement.
From being one of the most expensive Unilever margarine factories in Europe
in the 1980s, we are now the cheapest.
That turnround has been achieved with the excellent co-operation of our
employees, and was considerably helped by the benefits we have all obtained
from the 'New Look Employment' package.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Letter: Public sector pay limit represents desperate ploy
rather than solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The government, currently standing amid the ruins of its economic
policy, has now latched on to a 2 per cent limit on public sector pay as a
vital element of economic recovery.
The CBI has followed up with a cry for a public sector pay freeze.
Your leading article on the subject (September 25) heartily endorsed such an
approach while failing to identify more precisely what the costs and
benefits might be.
Assuming that the total public sector pay bill amounts to about Pounds 70bn,
a reduction in pay awards from perhaps 3.25 per cent next year to 2 per cent
would cut the pay bill by some Pounds 800m; a not insubstantial amount that
might be put to good use elsewhere.
However, this figure should be put into perspective. It would amount to only
0.3 per cent of the government's planned spending next year and would only
reduce the PSBR by about 0.2 per cent of GDP. Its material impact on the
underlying problems of the economy would therefore be minimal.
Furthermore, the costs of enforcing such a limit would be high.
It would wholly undermine the existing systems of pay determination in the
public sector and provoke unrest at a time of relative stability.
It would demotivate public servants when the government is ostensibly trying
to encourage better performance from them. It would undermine attempts to
improve public services. Unless applied in perpetuity it would lead to
public sector workers pursuing higher claims in subsequent years to catch up
with their private sector counterparts. It would not lead employers in the
private sector to take similar action since they will continue to reach
settlements that are mainly determined by the cost of living, their
financial circumstances, and their competitors' rates. More significantly,
such a pay policy would do little to stimulate economic recovery in terms of
investment in manufacturing and infrastructure, better training, or consumer
spending.
The proposal to make real cuts in the pay of public sector workers at this
point must therefore represent a desperate ploy to rescue the government
from its current difficulties rather than a serious attempt to address the
underlying weaknesses of the economy.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Chairman of Skanska resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman and chief executive of Skanska, Scandinavia's largest
construction and property group, resigned yesterday, accepting his share of
responsibility for the estimated SKr1.2bn (Dollars 222.2m) losses suffered
by the company as a result of alleged unauthorised foreign exchange
speculation and the high Swedish interest rates.
Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson, head of Skanska since 1986, said he was leaving
immediately. He will be replaced as chairman by Mr Percy Barnevik, chief
executive of Asea Brown-Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering conglomerate,
who has been on Skanska's board for the past six years and became
vice-chairman in 1991.
Mr Sven-Eric Hersvall will remain as Skanska's president but the post of
chief executive will be subsumed in the organisation.
The sudden change at the top of the company followed an emergency board
meeting yesterday. 'Skanska is a well-run company strong on the contracting
business side with a number of industrial companies and a good stock of real
estate companies', said Mr Barnevik. It was important to concentrate harder
on key operations and restore confidence in the company, he said.
Mr Hakansson's abrupt departure from Skanska follows the dismissal of the
head of the group's financial subsidiary earlier in the month for alleged
currency speculation during the summer that cost Skanska an estimated
SKr1bn.

SVENSKA Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank, reported
yesterday that operating profits fell 80 per cent to SKr441m (Dollars 81m)
in the first eight months of 1992 from the comparable period last year,
writes Chris Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
Credit losses rose 86 per cent to SKr3.94bn as a result of the protracted
recession and the deteriorating property market. The losses correspond to
2.1 per cent of total lending at the end of August.
The bank made a loss of SKr223m in the second four months, after reporting
operating profits of SKr664m in the first four months of the year. This was
because the latest period saw a further SKr615m of losses stemming from
loans to Gamlestaden, the collapsed finance company.
Svenska Handelsbanken's total share of losses relating to Gamlestaden now
exceeds SKr1.1bn.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Allianz to maintain 22.3% stake
in Dresdner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A MOVE that bears witness to growing competitive pressures in the German
insurance market, Germany's cartel authorities yesterday ruled that Europe's
largest insurance group, Allianz, does not have to scale back its 22.3 per
cent stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank.
The original decision was seen by many observers as a declaration of war on
two of Germany's most powerful institutions as they laid plans for increased
business co-operation.
However, the Berlin-based Bundeskartellamt said yesterday the competitive
landscape had changed since March when it first told Allianz to reduce its
stake in the bank to just over 19 per cent.
Cartel authorities cited Deutsche Bank's and Assurance Generales de France's
(AGF) recent purchases in the German life insurance sector. These
acquisitions by large, financially strong institutions, had intensified
competition and ensured Allianz no longer had a dominating market position,
the Bundeskartellamt said.
At the beginning of this month, Deutsche announced the purchase of a
controlling stake in Deutsche Herold Versicherungs, a family-controlled
insurance group, and in July it bought a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, the
largest privately-owned insurance company in Germany. The Gerling deal
received Cartel approval yesterday.
Also in July AGF, one of France's biggest insurance groups, won a struggle
to have its voting rights recognised on a 25 per cent-plus stake in Aachener
und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-biggest insurance
company.
The authorities said another reason behind the change of heart was that
Allianz had reduced its direct holding in Hamburg-Mannheimer
Lebensversicherung, Germany's second biggest life insurance company.

<TEXT>
BENETTON, the Italian clothing group, raised net profits by 16.5 per cent to
L92.8bn (Dollars 74.47m) in the first half of this year, on a 7 per cent
rise in sales to L1,233bn.
The improvement came across virtually every line of the group's business,
with strong growth from its up-market Sisley brand, which increased sales by
29 per cent.
Turnover by Benetton's socks and accessories division also jumped, with a 90
per cent increase stemming largely from increased sales of sports and
women's shoes, as well as accessories. Geographically, Germany and Spain had
performed particularly well, while sales had risen due to expansion into new
areas, notably among developing countries.
The company confirmed the return of Mr Aldo Palmeri, its former managing
director for eight years, to his previous position. Mr Palmeri, a one-time
Bank of Italy official, left Benetton in February 1990 to become Citicorp's
chief country corporate officer for Italy.
Benetton's gross industrial margin rose by 9.3 per cent to L460bn, while net
financial charges dropped by L1.5bn to L16.8bn. Net debt fell by L75bn to
L327bn.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group and one of the world's biggest
producers of light bulbs, plans to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Kondo
Sylvania, the Japanese lighting company, from GTE Sylvania of the US, writes
Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
The Dutch company, which declined to disclose financial details, said it had
already reached agreement with both GTE Sylvania and Kondo Sylvania's
minority shareholders. The deal is expected to be completed soon.
The purchase will add about Dollars 40m in sales to Philips' annual lighting
turnover of Fl 7.4bn (Dollars 4.6bn). It marks the first time Philips will
manufacture lighting products in Japan. Until now, the company's Japanese
sales comprised exports from Philips factories elsewhere.
Kondo Sylvania employs 300 people and specialises in developing, making and
marketing halogen lamps, particularly those with professional photo and
projection applications such as for film projectors and studio lighting.
Philips, a relative latecomer to the fast-growing field of halogen lighting,
has succeeded in building its market share in halogen lights for cars, the
home and a variety of professional uses. It said Kondo Sylvania's presence
in professional photo lighting was a 'very welcome addition' to its product
range.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Porsche to cut workforce by a
quarter as sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORSCHE, the troubled German luxury carmaker, yesterday announced a
swingeing round of job cuts, the second during the current business year,
which it said were unavoidable if it was to preserve its independence over
the long term.
The company also warned of deteriorating conditions in markets which had
hitherto been strong, for example in Germany, Italy and Japan, together with
continuing problems in the US and the UK.
It said export sales would be made even more difficult because of the recent
turbulence in European currency markets and the strengthening of the D-Mark.
The bleak statement, which gives the first indication of the circumstances
leading up to the surprise replacement of Mr Arno Bohn as chief executive by
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking last week, concluded by saying that Porsche was
expecting a further fall in profits and sales during the current business
year, following sales down from DM3.1bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to DM2.7bn in the
year to end-July.
Porsche explained yesterday it intended to cuts its workforce by a further
1,000 people this year, in addition to the 850 job cuts already announced.
This means that during 1992-93 the workforce will shrink by almost a quarter
from the 8,062 employees at the end of July.
The job cuts, which are intended to fall equally on all areas of the
business, will go hand in hand with restructuring measures which are
designed to lead to a sharp improvement in efficiency.
'The management board has decided that this package of measures is
unavoidable if the company is to remain independent over the long term,' the
statement said, emphasising that the family shareholders which control the
company were determined to preserve its independence despite its current
difficulties.
While the statement provided the background to the change of chief
executive, it gave no indication of the precise problems which lead to Mr
Bohn's departure because of disagreements over 'matters of business policy'
last week. In response to questions, the company said Porsche and Mr Bohn
had agreed to keep quiet over the circumstances of his departure.
Porsche said that in the year to end-July it sold 22,481 cars, down from
26,486 in the previous year. The share taken by exports fell from 61 to 49
per cent, with unit sales rising by 9 per cent to 11,404 in Germany but
falling by 30 per cent to 11,077 abroad. In the mid-eighties, sales amounted
to 50,000, with 30,000 cars sold in the US alone.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Winding up petitions add new twist to
Blystad bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISAGREEMENT between directors of the Blystad Group over the conditions of
a Pounds 7.5m paper bid has taken a new twist with the issue of winding up
petitions against two companies connected with three of the directors, all
members of the Norwegian Blystad family.
The petitions are part of a campaign by directors outside the family to
recover a Dollars 3.9m (Pounds 2.3m) loan to Sokana Industries, which is
controlled by the family. Sokana and the South Pacific Banking Corporation
are the subject of the petitions.
Three Blystad brothers holding 65 per cent of the loss-making Blystad, which
owns KCA Drilling, the UK independent offshore oil service company, have
accepted the 5.4p-a-share bid from Abbot Holdings, a private company set up
by Mr Alasdair Locke.
The non-family board members, including the managing director and finance
director, and Henry Ansbacher, financial advisers, oppose the offer because
of a potential conflict of interest over the loan from Blystad to Sokana
Industries.
Abbot's approach to the loan, set out in the press release announcing the
bid, is not to take any 'precipitate' enforcement action, although it does
not rule out the loan being recovered at a later date.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sears continues retailing drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS' drive to focus on retailing and mail order may be finalised this year
with the disposal of its Galliford house-building business.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said this could incur a further
extraordinary charge this year on top of the Pounds 84m included in the
interim results. All but Pounds 2m of this sum was for the shedding of men's
wear through the sale, announced last week, of Fosters and Your Price to
management for Pounds 1.
Galliford used to contribute up to Pounds 30m a year in trading profits, but
the group decided to give it up in July 1990. The only provision made then
was for the carrying costs 'to avoid it impacting on the profit and loss
account'.
The portfolio had since been run down from Pounds 109m to Pounds 58m and
Pounds 11m cash was released in the first half of this year. The original
plan was 'to develop it out by July 1994'. The group was considering whether
to dispose of it within the next six months, possibly via a management
buy-out.
Housing sales, 'tax planning' and cash generation had helped reduce net debt
by Pounds 75m in July 1991 to Pounds 133m this time, gearing of 11.3 per
cent. Net interest costs, however, rose to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.3m) as the
amount capitalised in Galliford was cut from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2.8m.
Recession finally caught up with the home shopping division, where trading
profit fell from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 11.9m on sales of Pounds 264.9m
(Pounds 249.8m). 'It hit the wall quickly last year leaving a cost
overhang,' said Mr Liam Strong, chief executive.
The subsequent cuts had included 300 jobs, 6 per cent of the workforce. The
annual savings would amount to between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m.
Sears paid Pounds 477m for the Freemans mail order business in 1988 and
failed in its bid to expand it last year by buying Grattan from Next.
Mr Strong said he hoped to push Freemans' annual trading profit up to more
than Pounds 30m.
In speciality retailing, women's wear was the biggest contributor with
Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.6m) profit on sales of Pounds 243.6m (Pounds 214m).
Miss Selfridge - which claims 20 per cent of the disco clothing market - and
Wallis, aimed at 25 to 35-year-olds, had performed strongly.
Selfridges department store in London, which has a division to itself,
enhanced its productivity in a period of sluggish sales caused by a lack of
tourists. Trading profit rose to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 4.9m) on sales of
Pounds 94.6m (Pounds 92.7m).

British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances, the building products group which
is 75 per cent owned by BM Group, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m
for the 15 months to June 30. For the year to April 4 1991 the loss was
Pounds 575,000.
Mr Graham Brealey, who became chairman in March, said the period had been
'the most exciting in the group's 55-year history.' During the 15 months the
group 'radically changed its shape' following the acquisition of 12
businesses, including the main businesses of the building products and
services division of BM Group.
He was confident that with a full year's contribution from the acquired
companies, the group would return to profitability in the current year.
Turnover for the period totalled Pounds 7.79m (Pounds 4.45m). The pre-tax
loss was after administrative expenses of Pounds 3.26m (Pounds 1.97m).
Losses per share amounted to 53.8p (30.9p). There is no dividend for the
period (0.5p) but the group intends paying both an interim and final for the
current year.

Turnover rose to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.3m) with Thorlux Lighting lifting
home sales by 8 per cent and exports by 39 per cent. Operating surplus
showed a lower level of expansion because of pricing pressures affecting
margins and the launch of Compact Lighting.
Pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.6m). Earnings per

SURREY GROUP, the USM-quoted bookmaker, returned to losses in the second
half of the year to March 31. And with further substantial losses expected
in the present six months it is changing its acquisition strategy in order
to cut debts.
At its flotation in 1989 it intended to reach critical mass for economies of
scale by buying betting offices. However, the chairman said that the level
of borrowing had become excessive compared with its ability to service it in
the light of poor trading.
In the year to the end of March pre-tax profits were Pounds 5,000 against
losses of Pounds 216,000 in the previous year. Interim profits had been
Pounds 117,000.
From turnover of Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 35.8m) operating profits were Pounds
766,000 including Pounds 611,000 from the sale of betting offices and other
operating income.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 398,000, relating to the company's former

had been paid by the new owners, left the retained loss at Pounds 295,000
(Pounds 404,000).
Earnings per share came out at 0.07p, helped by a tax credit of Pounds
98,000 (Pounds 65,000), against losses of 0.15p. The final dividend is being
passed. Last time there was a single final payment of 0.05p.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Family values take on Lou Grant - Karen
Zagor on the background to Pat Robertson's bid for TVS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REV Pat Robertson, the US televangelist, and Lou Grant, the liberal
journalist of the eponymous television series, would make strange
bedfellows.
But TVS Entertainment, which will lose its independent television franchise
for southern England at the end of this year, looks likely to bring them
together.
If the Pounds 38m bid for TVS from Mr Robertson's US-based International
Family Entertainment succeeds, he will control his first overseas television
company. And UK viewers will have access to the wholesome family-oriented
programming that has made IFE successful in the US.
Mr Robertson has been scouting the market for ways to expand his
broadcasting business, according to Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst at
PaineWebber. TVS appeared to be a good opportunity.
For IFE, one of the most attractive aspects of TVS is MTM, its US production
company, with a library that includes Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant. Such
shows may not be to Mr Robertson's personal tastes but he has an uncanny
ability to tap into the American consciousness.
His 700 Club talk show, launched in 1960 and still going strong, inspired a
host of other televangelists. And the Family Channel, with its stated
dedication to family-oriented programming, hit the airwaves three years
before Mr Ronald Reagan was first elected president and more than a decade
before 'family values' became the theme of this year's presidential
election.
Mr Robertson, who controls IFE with his son Timothy, was one of the few
leading televangelists to emerge from the 1980s with his reputation
unsullied by fraud or sexual misconduct.
Since April, when IFE's public stock offering left observers marvelling at
his ability to transform a Dollars 183,000 (Pounds 107,000) investment into
stock valued at flotation at about Dollars 90m, he has come in for an
unprecedented amount of scrutiny.
Mr Robertson started the Family Channel in 1977, as a branch of his
Christian Broadcasting Network, financed largely with donations from
viewers. By the late 1980s, the Family Channel was so successful it had
started to threaten Christian Broadcasting's non-profit status.
In 1989 the Robertsons incorporated IFE with Tele-Communications, the
world's biggest cable television business, as a minority investor.
Tele-Communications makes an interesting bedfellow for International Family.
Its alleged strong-arm tactics have led Senator Albert Gore to dub the
company the 'ringleader' of the 'cable Cosa Nostra'.
The Robertsons invested Dollars 150,000 in the new company, buying 4.5m
shares at 3.33 cents each, later buying another tranche for about 2.22
cents.
Although the Robertsons' convertible shares in IFE account for only 6m of
the of the 36.2m shares in issue, their voting power adds up to 60 per cent,
thanks to their ownership of Class A shares which carry ten votes per share.
The common stock carries one vote per share.
In 1990 the Family Channel was sold to IFE in a deal worth Dollars 250m. The
deal left Christian Broadcasting with about 4.8m shares in IFE. A university
founded by Mr Robertson holds another 9m shares, while 10m shares are held
by the public.
The Robertsons have profited handsomely. Although the stock has recently
fallen to about Dollars 11 1/2 from Dollars 15 at the time of the initial
public offering, it is unlikely to plunge as far as the few cents the
Robertsons originally paid, barring disaster.
Meanwhile, the Family Channel goes from strength to strength, attracting
almost as many viewers as the MTV rock video channel. Last year, it earned
net profits of about Dollars 19.8m on revenues of almost Dollars 113.7m,
against profits of Dollars 14.4m on revenues of Dollars 93.4m a year
earlier.
Looking to the UK, IFE expects to make a version of the Family Channel
available on cable systems. UK viewers may not, however, be treated to the
Mr Robertson's 700 Club performance on IFE channels.
The publicly-held IFE is careful to stress its independence from the
Christian Broadcasting Network. The Family Channel's programming is
distinctly secular, including shows such as The Waltons and Father Knows
Best. Should Mr Robertson choose to use the UK Family Channel for his 700
Club, he would have to buy air time like any other broadcaster.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Socks pull Sherwood up to Pounds 8.2m
midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HELPED by the boost given to its garments division by its two socks
businesses, Sherwood Group lifted pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to Pounds
8.18m in the first half of 1992.
In May the company, which makes lace and produces bras, lingerie and socks,
graduated from the USM, where it had been for six years, to a full listing.
At the same time there was a 4-for-1 scrip issue.
The pre-tax advance from last time's Pounds 6.55m was struck on turnover
ahead 20 per cent at Pounds 66m (Pounds 55.2m).
Operating margins rose from 14.2 to 14.3 per cent, while the pre-tax margin
grew to from 11.9 to 12.4 per cent.
Mr David Parker, chairman, said that some Pounds 29m of group sales were
overseas.
Turnover in the lace division declined from Pounds 41.3m to Pounds 37m: of
that, Pounds 27m, or 73 per cent of divisional sales, was abroad. Lace
operating profits were down almost Pounds 1m at Pounds 5.6m and the
operating margin slipped from 15.8 to 15.1 per cent.
Mr Parker said sales had been lost on the commodity end, which had had 'a
more difficult time on price'. The almost three-dimensional lace produced
for the top end of the market on Sherwood's new Textronic machines helped
maintain margins, he said.
The garments side lifted profits, turnover and operating margin, from Pounds
1.32m to Pounds 3.87m, from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 29.5m and from 9.2 to
13.1 per cent respectively. The two socks businesses - Samuel Eden and
Charles W Hall acquired for a combined Pounds 26m in June 1991 and January
1992 - made the group one of the UK's leading sock producers.
Capital expenditure in the half was Pounds 8m with 77 per cent of that going
on Jacatronic and Textronic machines. One Textronic machine produces about
Pounds 200,000 of turnover: Sherwood currently has eight and will have 12
next year when capital expenditure for the 12 months will fall to Pounds
9.5m.
Gearing rose from 44 per cent at the December year-end to 59 per cent at
June 30.
Earnings were static on the enlarged equity at 5.3p per share and the
interim dividend is raised 15 per cent to 0.9p (0.78p).

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins hits T&amp;S
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;S STORES has attributed a fall in pre-tax profits to a squeeze on margins
at Supercigs, its tobacco retailing subsidiary, and Dillons, its chain of
newsagents.
In the first half of 1992 pre-tax profits fell nearly 8 per cent, from
Pounds 7.08m to Pounds 6.54m, in spite of a 9 per cent increase in turnover
to Pounds 166.1m.
Cigarette volumes were affected by another increase in duty but sales of
newspapers and confectionery held up well. Neighbourhood and convenience
store retailing fared better than Supercigs, which continued to suffer from
fewer customers on the high streets.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have to do
something about reduced consumer demand, rather than blaming it.'
The growing chain of Dillons convenience stores, currently at 94, lifted
turnover 33 per cent to Pounds 32.1m and trading profits 41 per cent to
Pounds 1.99m.
Although turnover from the 212 Supercigs outlets rose 5 per cent to Pounds
83.92m, trading profit dropped 9 per cent to Pounds 2.04m. The group
maintained its 3 per cent share of the national cigarette market, which had
fallen by about 8 per cent overall.
The Dillons chain of 283 newsagents lifted turnover by 4.5 per cent to
Pounds 50.1m but saw trading profits dip 2.5 per cent to Pounds 2.55m.
Although the group's overall trading profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds
6.57m, the pre-tax figure was reduced by an interest payment of Pounds
50,000, which compared with interest receivable of Pounds 200,000 last time.
T&amp;S said the air of uncertainty in the property market had restricted the
sale and purchase of businesses, and profits from disposals fell from Pounds
623,000 to Pounds 222,000.
A reduction in shop stock coupled with tight warehouse controls reversed the
year-end cash position from an overdraft of Pounds 15m to cash of Pounds 5m.
Earnings per share rose to 7.69p (7.57p), while the interim dividend is
lifted to 2.4p (2.25p).
COMMENT
Mr Threlfall has stripped out more than Pounds 1m of annualised costs by
slimming the management structure, closing four regional offices and making
more use of information technology, although the benefit will be felt more
next year. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m put the shares, down 5p to
181p yesterday, on a prospective multiple of about 12. That seems
undemanding, given the quality of the management and success of its
news-based convenience store formula. The group perhaps suffers from being
associated so strongly with tobacco, but the contribution from cigarettes is
set to diminish. The share price may also be overhung by concerns about
another big acquisition, following its Pounds 53.9m purchase of the Dillons
and Preedy chains from Next, which required a rights issue in 1989. T&amp;S
might well be interested in a convenience store chain, with a warehouse and
distribution network in the south, but said the rights issue required for
such a deal would probably be closer to 20 per cent of the group's size.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Boosey &amp; Hawkes out of tune with City as
shares dive 95p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOSEY &amp; Hawkes, one of Britain's oldest instrument makers, yesterday
announced a 10 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.44m,
but warned that the global recession was beginning to dampen growth.
The City marked the shares down by 95p to 865p on the news, in a generally
steady market.
Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said he was baffled by the fall in the
share price. 'The result we produced is a very good one in the current
climate,' he said. 'All we are saying is we must accept a slower rate of
growth compared with the 20 per cent of previous years.'
The dividend was raised by 9 per cent to 6p, while earnings advanced almost
13 per cent to 18.6p (16.5p).
Mr Holland said the group expected to report progress in the second half
similar to that of the first six months. However, profits would be depressed
by about Pounds 200,000 as a result of the recent sterling crisis. He said
the devaluation of sterling would eventually benefit the company as it
sought to increase exports.
Boosey reported an 8 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 26.5m for the six
months to June 30.
Growth was slower in the music publishing division partly due to the depth
of the US recession. However, Mr Holland said the rate of growth represented
a 'more normal' level, following last year's sharp improvement.
The instrument making division felt the effects of economic slowdown in
Japan, which accounts for about 20 per cent of sales. Profits in this
division had advanced, although not as rapidly as last year. Mr Holland said
there was a risk of a further setback in Japan, although he remained
optimistic about the longer-term outlook.
A redundancy programme in the UK and Germany resulted in the loss of about
40 jobs. There would be no significant redundancy costs, Mr Holland said,
although the benefits would feed through next year.
Interest charges rose about 10 per cent to Pounds 1m, due to the element of
foreign currency debt. Borrowings as a percentage of shareholders' funds was
at a seasonal high of 88 per cent. Gearing at the year end was expected to
be lower than the 69 per cent in 1991.

<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE OIL, the independent exploration and production company, is
raising a further Dollars 280m (Pounds 164m) in the US through an initial
public offering of American Depositary Sharesand a further tranche of
cumulative preferred shares.
It filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission for 6.75m ADSs, each representing three ordinary shares. The
issue, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will raise about
about Dollars 150m. The ordinary shares represent approximately 5 per cent
of Enterprise's issued ordinary shares.
It is also raising Dollars 127.5m through a second tranche of 5.1m
cumulative prefered shares. It raised Dollars 172.5m in the first tranche in
June.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said the US listing of ADSs
was a 'strategic step' in Enterprise's US funding programme, which has
already included the issue of debt and fixed-rate preference shares.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Banks fail to agree borrowing facilities
for Mosaic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE TO agree borrowing facilities with its bankers yesterday led Mosaic
Investments to delay the redemption of preference shares, withdraw its
planned final dividend and suspend temporarily the listing of its shares at
60p.
This is the second cloud in two months which has passed over the
mini-conglomerate, based in Birmingham.
In July the board decided Mosaic needed a stronger focus on packaging and
promotion activities, sold the engineering division and deposed Mr Brian
Disbury as chairman.
In his stead it installed Mr Gregory Hutchings, who owns 8.5 per cent of the
shares but is better known as chief executive of Tomkins, a larger
conglomerate.
Mosaic's current problems spring from the demand by Mr Rodney Day for
redemption of Pounds 2.99m worth of convertible preference shares, acquired
when his advertising company was taken over.
The redemption should have taken place on Monday, but Mosaic was not able to
reach an agreement with its bankers on financing this one-off payment.
According to Mr Leon Angrave, the managing director, this was because 'of
the complexity and the term of the facilities rather than the amount.'
Mosaic was asking for funds to meet that demand in addition to normal
working capital.
Three banks were involved, Mr Angrave said, although he would not name them.
In the last available annual report for Mosaic, Midland Bank in West
Bromwich and Barclays Bank in Swindon were listed as the group's principal
bankers.
Mosaic had been negotiating with the banks, and with Mr Day, for between two
and three weeks. It expected the bank negotiations to be completed in about
three weeks.
However, because of the subordination of ordinary shareholders to preference
holders, inability to redeem the preference shares on the due date had led
to the withdrawal of the recommended 1991-92 final dividend of 5.5p, which
would have cost Pounds 897,000.
The hiatus led in turn to the suspension of the shares 2p higher than their
overnight close, giving the group a market value of Pounds 10m.
The shares, in spite of recent market firmness, have been at the bottom of
their trading range, suggesting that the City remained unimpressed with the
changes of last July.
Mr Angrave said there was no reason why the group should change shape
because of the problems with the preference shares and the dividend.
Mosaic told the Stock Exchange it was trading profitably.
It had net borrowings of Pounds 500,000 and pro forma net assets of Pounds
12m.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Profits warning from GPA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING PROFITS at GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, will
show 'a significant reduction' in the second quarter compared with the
first, warned Mr Tony Ryan, chairman, at yesterday's annual meeting.
The company has been hit by costs arising from the failure of its Dollars
800m (Pounds 468m) share offering in May and a squeeze on lease rental
margins.
One result is that GPA is likely to make provisions and charges in the
accounts for the year ending in March 1993.
Mr Ryan said that those 'may be material in the context of annual earnings.'
He confirmed that the company was planning a follow-up to its successful
Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation (ALPS) aircraft securitisation issue
earlier this year.
Alps 92-2 will involve the sale of 18 aircraft for Dollars 752m and should
go ahead next month. 'We have received preliminary indications from the
major debt rating agencies that they will give an AA rating to the senior
debt in this fund,' said Mr Ryan.
Progress was also being made over the raising of more equity capital. 'This
is likely to take the form of an issue of convertible preference shares,' he
said. 'Discussions (with the company's main shareholders) have been
constructive.'
He outlined the agreement in principle with Boeing, the aircraft maker, to
defer delivery of aircraft worth Dollars 5bn and added that other deals with
suppliers 'will make Dollars 650m of additional liquidity available to GPA
over the next 18 months.'
Nevertheless, the forces behind the flotation failure and the postponement
of orders remained.
'GPA continues to be affected by uncertainty in the world economic scene, by
a temporary oversupply of aircraft, the consequences of the withdrawal of
our flotation and by lease rental margins and aircraft sales levels that
have been adversely affected by recessional influences.'
The oversupply of aircraft and low sales levels are important to GPA because
much of the company's profits arise from the sale of second-hand aircraft
after they have been leased for a few years.
Mr Ryan painted an optimistic picture for the longer term. Some 193 aircraft
had been leased so far this year compared with 111 in the same period last
year.
However, 'the benefits of much of the business we are writing today will not
be reflected in our financial statements until the aircraft concerned are
delivered to customers and start earning revenue.'
GPA has leased two aircraft to Air Ukraine International, a newly-formed
subsidiary of the national airline Air Ukraine.
The 150-seat Boeing 737-400s go into service in November.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Higher interest charges push down Prestwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESTWICK HOLDINGS, the Strathclyde-based manufacturer of printed circuit
boards used in the computer, electronics and telecommunications industries,
yesterday reported a decline in full-year pre-tax profits, despite a 20 per
cent increase in turnover.
Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 91,000 in the year to July 31 compared
with Pounds 109,000 last time, mainly reflecting sharply higher net interest
charges which grew to Pounds 455,000 (Pounds 64,000) as the group raised its
borrowings to help fund acquisitions and internal investments.
The company is dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged final dividend of
1p per share, which with the interim dividend, will maintain the total at
1.5p. The board said it felt justified in recommending the payment out of
reserves because of the prospects for the group.
Turnover increased to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 25.3m), and profits before tax
and interest grew to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 173,000), after charging
exceptional items of Pounds 76,000 (Pounds 373,000.)
During the year Prestwick completed four acquisitions, Band Electronics,
Prestwick-GTN, Electroconnect and Northumbria Circuits, at a total cost of
Pounds 704,000.
Following the acquisition of Electroconnect in October last year Prestwick
spent Pounds 3m on a capital investment programme on advanced design and
manufacturing technology designed to enhance the group's ability to meet its
customers' needs from initial design concept to volume manufacturing.
Mr Wayne Osman, chief executive, said the company had invested about Pounds
6m during the year, and had moved from zero borrowings to net borrowings of
about Pounds 4m at year-end.
After allowing for a Pounds 15,000 tax credit (nil) and Pounds 216,000
(Pounds 218,000) in preference share dividends the group posted an increased
loss of Pounds 110,033 (Pounds 108,780), equivalent to losses per share of
0.5p (same).

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US courts approve GWR reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Western Resources, the US-based natural resources company, appears to
have won its 18-month struggle for survival with the approval by US
bankruptcy courts of a reorganisation plan for the company's coal
subsidiaries.
GWR, which is quoted on the USM in London, put its coal subsidiaries into
Chapter 11 - the US bankruptcy proceeding which protects a company from
creditors - last April. The move followed a prolonged dispute over pricing
and contracts with the company's largest coal customer, the South Carolina
Public Services Authority (Santee Cooper).
The decision to accept the reorganisation plan, which included a new coal
contract with Santee Cooper and a restructuring of the company's Dollars 82m
debt, will become official on October 11 if there are no appeals.
Mr William Phillips, vice president and chief financial officer, said the
decision was 'very good news . . . It sets the stage for getting business
back to normal.' However, any benefits would not materialise in the year
which ends today. The company is likely to report a substantial loss when
the results are published in December.
Mr Phillips said Great Western expected to deliver some 3.5m tonnes of coal
over the next 12 months, compared with the 3m delivered in 1990.
However, the new contract with Santee Cooper sets a coal price of about
Dollars 30 a tonne, against Dollars 36 previously. The difference in price
would be narrowed through production efficiencies, said Mr Phillips.
The decision also frees Dollars 31m in coal payments withheld by Santee
Cooper. GWR plans to pay Citibank, its main creditor, some Dollars 15m. The
balance would be used for capital expenditure, and the development of oil
and gas assets.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the UK stockbroker owned by Girocredit Bank of
Austria, yesterday bowed to the overcapacity in the London stock market and
closed down its UK equity business with the loss of 25 jobs.
The firm, bought by the Austrian bank in 1986, had already disposed of its
fixed income business to Hoare Govett last year, though it will continue to
be active in Austrian shares in London.
Mr Julian Knight, managing director and one of those being made redundant,
blamed the firm's demise partly on the concentration of equity business in
the hands of a small group of market makers. That, and the growth of
so-called 'soft commission' business, which allows investors to receive
broking services at cut-price rates, meant that there was too little
commission business left to make it worthwhile continuing as an agency
broker, he said.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood warns on trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD Appliances, the kitchen equipment company, has warned shareholders
that its markets have worsened since it became the first in a line of
post-election flotations.
Only days before its freedom to comment is restricted by the start of its
two month close period, the company told analysts their forecasts were too
optimistic.
'Retail trade fell off a cliff for us in July and August,' said Mr Tim
Parker, chief executive. 'We are not expecting to make up that shortfall in
volume.'
On Monday, Kenwood shares fell 42p following analysts' shaving of profits
forecasts. The price had drifted from a small premium to its 285p June
flotation to 254p before sterling's devaluation gave the stock a fillip.
Kenwood closed 7p lower at 238p yesterday.
Devaluation will help the company, said Mr Parker, as 'sixty five per cent
of our business is overseas'.
When the company came to the market the directors were confident the current
year would provide further growth. 'But since then the picture is much more
difficult in the UK and in the European economy, particularly Germany.'
'But that is not to say we cannot yet achieve growth this year,' said Mr
Parker. The group is increasing market share with no unexpected impact on
operating margins and introducing new models.

FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Watts Blake Bearne advances to Pounds 3.74m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Watts Blake Bearne, the world's largest supplier of ball
clay, rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 3.74m during the first six months of this
year.
Almost all the improvement was due to higher contributions from new
acquisitions, according to Mr John Pike, managing director.
The group declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.7p on earnings
increased from 11.6p to 12p per share. Turnover was 8.6 per cent higher at
Pounds 34.1m.
An 11.5 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 4.2m was offset by
higher interest charges up from Pounds 264,000 to Pounds 457,000 following
last year's purchase of the Didier clay operations in Germany.
Almost two-thirds of the group's sales are used for the manufacture of
sanitary ware and wall and floor tiles. Its performance therefore is very
dependent upon the health of the construction industry.
The group was particularly satisfied with a turnround in the US from a
Pounds 100,000 loss to a Pounds 250,000 profit. This was due a first-time
contribution from its new Texas business as well as more efficient use of
management and marketing overheads.
In Germany the group had a full six months' contribution from Didier
compared with just two months in the corresponding period last year. German
profits as a result rose by about Pounds 430,000.
UK profits fell by about Pounds 350,000. The group said that it was a
measure of the quality of its business that it had managed to maintain
profits in such difficult trading conditions.
Net debt of Pounds 10.08m was lower than the Pounds 10.27m recorded at the
end of last year and represented gearing of just under 17 per cent.
The shares closed 23p up at 325p.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Jefferson Smurfit down by 20% as low prices take toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JEFFERSON Smurfit, Ireland's largest industrial group, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits for the first six months to July 31 down 20 per cent from
IPounds 75.1m (Pounds 78.33m) to IPounds 60m. Results were below
expectations and the company's shares fell 11 per cent from 257p to 228p.
Mr Dermot Smurfit, chairman and chief executive of Smurfit Continental
Europe, said the results were disappointing. The group was continuing to
struggle with low prices while the industry suffered a period of deflation,
he explained.
He stressed, however, that the company was a strong ship in turbulent
waters. In particular, the balance sheet was in good shape with net cash of
about IPounds 200m.
Operating cash flow was positive at IPounds 26m.
The group remains on the lookout for acquisitions, he said. But although the
industry's earnings were falling, transaction prices had not dropped to a
level at which the company was interested. Any acquisitions would be funded
in cash or through bank borrowings, rather than a rights issue, he added.
The results were achieved on turnover up 7 per cent, from IPounds 611m to
IPounds 654m. Earnings per share fell 22 per cent from 11.7p to 9.1p on a
part capitalisation basis. The company recently had a one-for-one share
issue.
Margins had been suffering in the US and Europe, said Mr Smurfit. Poor
demand and prices had meant the US and Canadian businesses' profits before
tax fell from a profit of IPounds 728,000 to a loss of IPounds 4m for the
six months. The group has restructured the borrowings of its JFC/CCA
American subsidiary, which should increase its profits by Dollars 23m
(Pounds 13.4m) for the full year.
In continental Europe profits fell from IPounds 22m to IPounds 16m. A number
of plants in Germany and Spain were operating short time.
However the Venezuelan business was a star performer, with profits up 16 per
cent from IPounds 10m to IPounds 11.6m. The group plans to expand and
modernise the San Felipe paper mill in Venezuela at a cost of Dollars 77m.
The directors declared a second interim dividend of 1.2306p per share for
the year ending January 31 1993. The board's intention is to recommend a
full-year dividend of 3.74p, an increase of 5.7 per cent over the previous
year.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Sears to close 350 shops and shed 1,800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, the UK retail and mail order group, will close 350 shops and shed up
to 1,800 jobs over three years in the latest reorganisation of the British
Shoe Corporation, which includes shops such as Dolcis, Saxone and Freeman
Hardy Willis.
The group also cut its interim dividend from 1.525p to 1p. Mr Geoffrey
Maitland Smith, chairman, said the final would also be reduced to give a
total of 3.5p, down from 5.355p. The cut came as no surprise to the market
and the share price gained 8p to close at 80p. It has risen 25 per cent
since last week's announcement of a withdrawal from men's wear.
The Pounds 32.2m exceptional cost of rationalising British Shoe pushed Sears
into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.8m in the six months to July 31, and
increased the loss per share from 0.3p to 0.5p. Turnover slipped to Pounds
902m from Pounds 923.7m, reflecting a Pounds 55.2m fall from discontinued
activities.
Pre-tax losses for the same period last year were Pounds 2.4m after Pounds
25.2m of rationalisation costs for men's wear. Mr Liam Strong, chief
executive since February, said the stream of exceptional charges was over.
The announcement of job-cutting at British Shoe follows a 2,000 reduction in
the workforce over the past year.
After converting some of the closed shops and opening others out-of-town,
the net effect would be to reduce the number of shops from 1,200 to to
1,000. The number of concessions (shops within shops) stays at about 570.
Freeman Hardy Willis and Curtess would be most affected. 'They sell shoes
cheaply to all the family,' said Mr Strong.
The footwear division recovered from a trading loss of Pounds 3.3m to a
profit of Pounds 1.9m on sales of Pounds 249.4m, down Pounds 7.7m. Dolcis
improved on last year's good figures and Saxone returned to like-for-like
sales growth.
Verdict Research, which monitors the retail sector, said British Shoe had
18.3 per cent of the UK's Pounds 3.73bn shoe market last year. The market
had been flat in real terms since 1986.
Other divisions contributed to Sears' Pounds 27.4m trading profit as
follows: speciality retailing - children's wear, women's wear and
leisurewear - up to Pounds 6.5m; Selfridges department store, up to Pounds
5.5m; home shopping, down to Pounds 11.9m; property up to Pounds 8.5m;
others, mainly discontinued, lost Pounds 6.9m.

FT  30 SEP 92 / US seeks a chunk of European taste: The continental
chocolate industry has been undergoing takeovers and blending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, it seems slightly improbable that two leading US food
companies should be competing to pay more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) for
a medium-sized Nordic manufacturer of chocolate, snack and biscuit products
which are almost unknown to consumers outside Scandinavia.
However, the intensity of the contest between Kraft General Foods (KGF),
part of tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris, and Hershey Foods to take over
Freia Marabou of Norway is explained in two words: rarity value.
In the last five years, Europe's chocolate industry has undergone rapid
concentration as manufacturers concluded that it was faster and less costly
to expand across borders by acquisition than by struggling to build brands
and win market share a few points at a time.
Today, two thirds of the European chocolate market is controlled by five
companies: Nestle of Switzerland; Mars of the US; Jacobs Suchard, which is
owned by Philip Morris; Cadbury Schweppes of Britain; and Ferrero of Italy.
With few companies left to buy, prices soar when a manufacturer with proven
brands and a strong market position becomes available. KGF's Dollars 1.5bn
bid for Freia Marabou values the Norwegian company at about 25 times
earnings - typical of the multiples paid for other big acquisitions in the
industry in the past few years.
How quickly such huge premiums can be recouped through increased efficiency
and scale is questionable. 'A business school professor would conclude that
a lot of big acquisitions are hard to justify on a cash-flow basis,' says Mr
Clive Richardson of London brokers Henderson Crosthwaite. 'The large
acquirers are taking a very long-term view.'
In acquirers' minds, however, such doubts are often overshadowed by the
prospect of seizing unrepeatable opportunities. Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman
of Nestle, says the Pounds 2.5bn paid for Rowntree in 1988 was worthwhile
because the deal 'decided relative positions in the industry for the next
100 years'.
Though Freia Marabou sells little outside Scandinavia, it dominates a
regional market which has so far been hardly penetrated by big multinational
confectionery companies. It supplies a quarter of the biscuits, a third of
the chocolates and almost half the snacks sold in the four Nordic countries.
Hershey and Philip Morris have entered the bidding from different starting
points. The former has long had most of its sales in the US, where its
chocolate is a brand leader, and recently began scouting for small-scale
acquisitions in Europe. Apart from its 18.5 per cent stake in Freia Marabou,
it has so far made one - Gubor Schokoladen in Germany.
Philip Morris is already Europe's fourth largest food manufacturer, with
sales of about Dollars 8bn, and an extensive distribution network. Its
operations there include coffee, cheese, dressings and pasta as well as
chocolate.
If the Freia Marabou contest is decided simply on price, the odds
overwhelmingly favour Philip Morris. Its net income of Dollars 3bn last year
exceeded Hershey's sales of Dollars 2.9bn, and its tobacco business
generates massive surplus cash.
Until recently, there had been doubts about the company's long-term
commitment to chocolate. However, most analysts believe this week's bid has
removed any uncertainty.
'Philip Morris has clearly signalled its intention to build an international
empire in the business,' says Mr John Campbell of brokers County NatWest.
Whether or not KGF wins Freia Marabou, the company is therefore likely to be
on the look-out for further expansion opportunities in Europe.
Among potential acquisition candidates, only three of any size remain:
Ferrero, Lindt in Switzerland and Cadbury Schweppes of Britain.
However, Ferrero and Lindt are controlled by families which have shown no
inclination to sell out. Cadbury has long been touted as a potential
takeover target, but seems determined to resist predators.
Furthermore, although Cadbury's 30 per cent share of the UK chocolate market
could be attractive to Suchard, which has almost no presence in Britain, the
two businesses would be difficult to integrate.
Indeed, the two companies are believed to have abandoned discussions on a
proposed joint venture last year after concluding that there was little
scope for productive co-operation. Not only do their strengths in moulded
chocolate overlap, but a 'taste barrier' keeps continental demand for
Cadbury's products small.
Even if Europe's second rank chocolate manufacturers retain their
independence, they must contend with steadily fiercer competition from
industry leaders such as Nestle, Mars and Cadbury.
Increasingly, growth in the European chocolate market is generated by
transferring well-established brands internationally. Though national
preferences in classic moulded chocolate differ widely, there is a growing
convergence in taste for snack products and some speciality lines.
Nestle has led the way, aggressively extending across Europe sales of
Rowntree brands such as Kit-Kat bars and After Eight chocolate mints. These
are now made on the continent as well as in Britain.
This is an enormously expensive game, requiring powerful local distribution
networks and lavish advertising and brand support budgets.
Among the smaller, nationally-based producers, only Ferrero has so far
played it with any success, largely because of its prowess at product
innovation. Though Cadbury has acquired chocolate makers in France, Spain
and Germany, it has lacked the scale and resources to establish a strong
market position in these countries.
Given the steadily rising stakes in the industry, the question facing
second-rank chocolate makers is whether it is worth persevering with
ambitions to build a Europe-wide presence, or whether they should retreat to
a more defensible home base.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Hershey may launch counter bid for Freia Marabou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERSHEY Foods, the big US chocolates producer, is considering a counter bid
for Freia Marabou, the Norwegian confectionery group which yesterday agreed
to a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 870m) takeover offer from the US Philip Morris
group.
Hershey is Freia Marabou's second biggest shareholder with an 18.6 per cent
stake, acquired in May this year for NKr1.16bn (Pounds 113.8m) from Orkla,
the Norwegian diversified foods group.
The Philip Morris bid has to be accepted by shareholders, who have been
called to an extraordinary general assembly on October 9. The offer has to
win two-thirds backing by Freia's shareholders to amend the company's
articles of association to allow the takeover.
Philip Morris also needs approval by Norway's energy and industry minister,
Mr Finn Kristensen, who said he will consider the sale on the basis of the
buyer's plans for the company.
Mr Richard Zimmerman, Hershey chief executive, said yesterday in Oslo that
his company last weekend made an unconditional offer to acquire Freia
Marabou for Dollars 1.3bn.
Mr Zimmerman said Hershey's bid still held but the company was considering
several options to gain control of Freia Marabou and has invited Orkla to
co-operate in a joint solution to acquire the company.
'We contacted Orkla on Monday indicating our intention to explore
opportunities to work together in the pursuit of Freia Marabou. They
expressed interest in continuing these discussions,' Mr Zimmerman said.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Cost reprieve for Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL is today expected to make important progress in its dispute with
the Transmanche-Link (TML) consortium of building contractors over the costs
of building the Channel tunnel.
Eurotunnel's 220 banks are expected to give the company an additional two
months to continue its negotiations with TML over claims made by TML for
additional payments.
Separately, TML contractors were last night braced for bad news from
arbitration proceedings on whether they should continue to receive Pounds
50m a month in extra progress payments from Eurotunnel to cover some of the
cost-overrun.
They were worried the arbitrator may rule that the Pounds 50m payments
should be terminated. Judgment is due today.
The monthly cash payments have been especially valuable to the UK
contractors, which have been hurt by the building industry recession.
Eurotunnel was furious when an independent disputes panel ruled in March
that the payments should be made and it appealed against the decision.
Since the disputes panel ruling, Eurotunnel has been forced by its banks to
hold talks with TML to end the row over whether it or TML should bear the
brunt of a sharp increase in the costs of building the tunnel.
The banks had set a deadline of early September for settlement of the
dispute over the contractors' claims for more than Pounds 1bn in extra
payments at 1985 prices.
Eurotunnel failed to meet the deadline, so its banks have had to vote on
whether to allow Eurotunnel to continue drawing from its Pounds 6.8bn loan
facility or whether to prompt a financial crisis, which could involve the
banks taking control of the project.
The banks are voting on whether to allow Eurotunnel sufficient funds to
continue meeting its obligations for another two months, while negotiations
with TML continue. By yesterday evening, 100 banks had voted. An
overwhelming majority - as measured by the value of their loans to
Eurotunnel - had voted in favour of allowing Eurotunnel to continue drawing
on facilities.
Eurotunnel needs a majority of only 65 per cent of votes cast. However, for
the vote to be valid, 112 banks have to cast a vote. Bankers said yesterday
they were confident the remaining 12 would vote by today's 5pm deadline.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Smith calls Major 'opt-out' PM: Labour leader's address to
conference targets Tory disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH rallied the Labour party behind his leadership yesterday with
a sharp attack on the competence of Mr John Major as 'an opt-out prime
minister leading a do-nothing government off the European stage'.
In his first leader's address to the party conference, he targeted
Conservative disarray after the UK's abandonment of the exchange rate
mechanism, promoted the idea of 'active government' and consolidated Labour
as the party of Europe.
His 50-minute speech, given a three-minute ovation by delegates in
Blackpool, was also clearly aimed at raising morale after four election
defeats by tacitly drawing attention to his own image of confident
authority.
By contrast, he accused Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as
the joint authors of the sterling crisis, mocking them as 'the Laurel and
Hardy of British politics'.
The public had witnessed 'a government gripped by indecision, paralysed by
fear and a prime minister plodding to disaster', he said, charging Mr Major
with humiliating Britain and betraying the trust of the people.
The Labour leader added that the humiliation was complete on Monday when Mr
Lamont apologised for criticising the Germans.
Delegates welcomed Mr Smith's debut as a demonstration of his qualities of
pragmatism and reliability. But many conceded that its low volume delivery
and abrupt conclusion had come as a stark contrast to the oratorical
fireworks of Mr Neil Kinnock.
Mr Tony Banks, the leftwing MP for Newham North West, described it as a
'sensible shoes' style that stressed the leader's credentials as a safe pair
of hands. 'In a situation when the country is in a deep mess, it underlined
the competence of John Smith,' he said.
After his attack on the government, Mr Smith set out his own creed in
language that reflected his christian socialist upbringing.
Claiming that Conservatives believed people were driven purely by greed and
self-interest, he said Britons wanted to be citizens of a community that
'does not pass by on the other side'.
A key theme to the speech was the need for active government, not one that
'abdicates in favour of the market'.
He said: 'The market must serve our needs, not we the needs of the market.
And if the market system becomes an agent of speculation and stagnation
instead of an engine for prosperity, then it is time for governments to
act.'
Mr Smith said Labour's goal was to promote 'active government' with a
responsibility to shape society, offer opportunities and provide for need.
He added that Labour would put the real economy at the heart of its economic
policy, making growth and jobs the benchmark of success.
In a passage on Europe, Mr Smith reaffirmed his belief in the Maastricht
treaty by insisting that 'Europe cannot stand still'. But in a gesture to
Labour's doubters, he went on to stress the need for the UK to take up the
social chapter of workplace rights and the importance of decisions being
made at the closest practical level to the people.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Kohl rejects idea of 'two-speed' move to single Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday rejected the idea of a
'two-speed' Europe and urged Britain to keep to the path of integration with
the other 11 members of the Community.
Mr Kohl, who has strong domestic reasons for proceeding cautiously towards
European economic and monetary union, said the Community should stick to the
timetable of a single currency by 1999. A two-speed move would mean a small
number of Community countries would achieve monetary union in a much shorter
timescale.
He insisted that renegotiating Maastricht was out of the question, in spite
of opposition to it in Denmark and Britain.
Public opinion in both Germany and France was also likely to be strongly
sceptical about a two-speed move to European union, which would leave out
key nations that both countries regard as economic and political allies. 'We
want Britain to be with us, we want a Europe of 12, we don't want a
two-speed Europe,' Mr Kohl told a press conference in Luxembourg.
His message to Britain is likely to be reinforced by the French government
when Mr John Major, the prime minister, visits Paris today.
In spite of the growing split in the Conservative party over Britain's
European policies, President Francois Mitterrand is expected to counsel Mr
Major against anti-German rhetoric.
Mr Mitterrand will try to persuade Mr Major to put aside the quarrelling
with Germany sparked by this month's currency turbulence. He will urge Mr
Major to adhere to the plan to ratify the EC treaty this year, French
officials say.
The attempt to persuade Britain to stick to the Maastricht process comes
amid speculation that opposition to the treaty could prompt France and
Germany to forge Emu with a small 'core' of other states.
Neither Paris nor Bonn, however, appears ready to press ahead with such a
move.
Mr Kohl, who is under pressure from domestic critics who say the intended
new European currency might be less stable than the D-Mark, denied that his
government wanted a slimmer Emu.
'There are many rumours,' he said. 'It's like the Loch Ness monster, it
keeps reappearing.'
The chancellor's sentiments were backed up in London by Mr Hans-Peter Stihl,
president of the German association of chambers of commerce and industry. He
suggested that a delay in the Maastricht timetable was more likely than an
overt move to a two-speed Europe.
Mr Kohl said there was no reason to delay the start of negotiations with
other European nations such as Austria and Sweden which have applied to join
the Community. He added that it was wrong for people to fear the emergence
of a European superstate or for them to blame the European Commission
bureaucracy in Brussels for the problems of the EC.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Jefferson Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK institutions are traditionally wary of Irish companies, and have every
excuse to avoid them when they are barred from the Footsie. Even so, the
market can hardly deny that Jefferson Smurfit's balance sheet is in fine
fettle for a paper and packaging business at this stage in the cycle.
ItsIPounds 220m of net cash is in impressive contrast to the position of
most of its Scandinavian and Canadian competitors, whose debt in some cases
exceeds their turnover. Admittedly there is some Dollars 2.3bn of
off-balance sheet debt post the restructuring of JSC/CCA - but there is no
recourse to Smurfit, and there is value in this US joint venture which may
yet be cashed in.
The immediate challenge for Smurfit, though, is earnings, hit by the
familiar problems of overcapacity and keen pricing in US and European
markets. The company can only hope that its proposed linerboard increase
will stick, and that the pressures which have caused discounts of more than
30 per cent in North American newsprint really are starting to ease. But
while the stronger dollar should also make an impact on the UK and Spain in
the current half, profits are unlikely to be much more than IPounds 140m for
the year as a whole.
The shares, down another 11 per cent to 228p yesterday, have been
conspicuously weak since the end of March. Earnings will rebound sharply one
day, but the timing of recovery remains as elusive as ever. For the moment
investors are unlikely to be trampled in the rush.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems the market wants to fall in love with Sears. Having missed the boat
with the likes of Storehouse and Next this year, fund managers are
determined to be aboard any recovery stock in the stores sector. After
Sears' interim figures, brokers have a nice story to sell them. A cut in the
interim dividend by a third to 1p follows hard on the heels of the painful
and expensive exit from menswear retailing. Both suggest that the new chief
executive, Mr Liam Strong, is determined to confront the company's problems.
Even the reduced dividend provides some underpinning for the shares. If the
company pays a total of 3.5p as expected, they will still yield 6 per cent
at yesterday's close of 80p.
But investors should not get carried away. Down-at-heel British Shoe still
has substantial difficulties and the 22 per cent profits fall at Freemans is
alarming. Perhaps even more importantly, the whole group needs the magic of
attractive new store presentations and innovative retailing ideas, things
which Mr Strong has yet to show he can provide. One may also wonder about an
asset valuation of 83p a share made in 1988 when recent disposals have been
accompanied by red ink.
Mr Strong has made a promising start, but he must be all too uncomfortably
aware that attempts to change corporate cultures fail more often than they
succeed.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Freia Marabou
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of Freia Marabou's share price to match the Jacobs Suchard NKr
450 offer suggests uncertainty about whether the takeover will be a pushover
after all. In political terms, Jacobs' position is akin to that of Nestle
when it bid for Rowntree. Hershey is still waiting in the wings and has the
advantage of already holding an 18 per cent stake. It has a long-standing
connection with Marabou. By teaming up with a local company, Orkla, it could
more easily overcome Norwegian resistance to foreign ownership of a flagship
company, although it has been talking about a lower price.
A more likely explanation for the 6 per cent share price discount to the bid
is the time value of money. Jacobs needs time to clear administrative
hurdles. While the outcome is by no means certain, its ultimate parent,
Philip Morris, has the resources to put up a powerful fight.
Besides, it is questionable whether Hershey could justify paying a multiple
of some 25 times for a business with only limited value as a bridgehead into
Europe. Marabou has more strategic value to Suchard. Not only would it gain
an advantage over Mars and Nestle in the Scandinavian market: Marabou's
Daijm is a high-margin bar product in a segment where Suchard is weak. The
Marabou acquisition would thus add to its range in Europe as a whole. If
that is Suchard's strategy, Cadbury Schweppes could have cause for unease.
Its European prospects would become less exciting still.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Freedom's limits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont may have been moved to sing in his bath by the policy
freedom conferred on Britain by devaluation. Yesterday's clutch of economic
data suggests that freedom may be illusory. The savings rate remains
depressingly high, while foreign investors were selling gilts hand over fist
as pressure on sterling mounted in August.
The drop in the savings ratio to 10.3 per cent from 11 between the first and
second quarters seems initially encouraging. But if the first quarter was
distorted upwards by bonus payments ahead of the election, the second
quarter was certainly distorted downwards for the same reason. The
underlying trend still points to consumer debt aversion. Sears and
Kingfisher have just reminded us there is no sign of a revival in consumer
demand. That must wait until the housing market recovers, which, in turn
requires yet lower interest rates.
How overseas investors might react to an even weaker pound is another
matter. They bought Pounds 6.3bn in gilts in the year to July and sold
Pounds 1.3bn in August. So they still have plenty left to sell. True, there
is no immediate funding need, but that will not last. Before the government
went into surplus in the late 1980s, gilts investors generally required a
premium of more than 3 percentage points over German bond yields. It is now
just 1.6 points.
Since sluggish world growth will keep export markets weak, recovery still
has to be consumer-led to some degree. One tactic could be to cut interest
rates sharply now. The authorities would have to hope sterling had
stabilised and recovery was in place by the time funding had to resume in
any quantity. But that would be a gamble to say the least. It will take luck
and a measure of courage bordering on the reckless to generate much growth
out of the new environment.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Gas-powered car project launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is to launch the first serious attempt to put gas-powered
vehicles on UK roads.
The company expects to be running 100 of its own vans and cars on compressed
natural gas by the end of the year and is putting out to tender an order to
convert 200 more vehicles to gas early next year.
More significantly, it is taking the first steps to set up the nationwide
network of gas filling stations that will be essential if it is to compete
with petrol and diesel as a transport fuel.
A network of nine natural-gas refuelling stations will be in place by next
spring. They will be available for use not only by British Gas but also by
other companies that invest in fleets of natural-gas vehicles.
Mr Keith Nelson, British Gas marketing manager for natural-gas vehicles,
hopes that within eight years the UK will have at least 200,000 gas-powered
vans and cars and a refuelling infrastructure good enough for private
motorists to consider using gas instead of petrol or diesel.
The UK has been experimenting with various forms of gas-powered car for
several decades but lags far behind several other countries in introducing
gas as a transport fuel.
Almost 1m natural-gas vehicles are in use worldwide, with large development
programmes in Italy, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US.
The impetus behind their development in many parts of the world is
environmental. Such vehicles emit 30 per cent less carbon dioxide and 70 per
cent less carbon monoxide than petrol-powered vehicles. The gas is stored
under pressure in cylinders fitted in the boot of the car or on the floor of
the van. They can be filled quickly at one of the refuelling stations or
overnight with a special device attached to the domestic gas supply.
Mr Neil Fricker, for British Gas Research and Technology, insists that,
contrary to common perception, compressed gas is less hazardous in an
accident than a petrol tank.
The main disadvantage of today's gas-powered vehicles - which have
'bi-functional' engines that can run on either gas or petrol/diesel - is the
space taken up by the gas cylinders. But that should disappear in the long
run.
VERY large gas users face considerably higher prices than users in some
European countries and have not seen any price benefits from measures to
introduce competition into the UK gas market, Mr Ian Powe, director of the
Gas Consumers Council, said yesterday, Neil Buckley writes.
His comments will strengthen demands for lower energy prices from UK
industry, where many customers are already complaining about electricity
prices.
The Gas Consumers Council, which represents 18m British customers, said
yesterday one reason for the price rise for large users was the requirement
 -imposed by the Office of Fair Trading - that British Gas must halve its
share of the industrial supply market by the mid 1990s.
The consumers' council will shortly report to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, which is carrying out an inquiry into the UK gas market.
British Gas said that in real terms UK industrial contract prices had
dropped by 30 per cent since the company was privatised in 1986. It
accepted, however, that prices for large users were higher than in some
European countries.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: Crisis and confusion beneath the surface - Prix Italia
Broadcasting Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Prix Italia broadcasting festival is anything to go by, and
experience suggests it is, radio and television are in a greater state of
change and confusion in all parts of the world today than ever in the
history of these two relatively young mass media. When this festival began
as a radio event in Capri in 1948 television was little more than a
technical trick used by a few broadcasters to provide illustrations for
radio programmes. Today television is so inextricably bound up with cultural
identity and political power that its fortunes lie at the very heart of the
apocalyptic changes occurring in eastern Europe, and the shift in western
Europe from public service broadcasting to market driven systems is causing
deep anxiety, at least among programme makers.
Not that a newcomer to broadcasting would have divined this from the
programmes on offer in the viewing and listening rooms of the shabbily
splendid Palazzo di Colorno, just outside Parma. Not immediately, anyway.
The autumn sunlight across the valley of the Po caught the occasional flake
of paint, drifting down from the wall paintings commissioned by Napoleon's
wife, Marie-Louise, past television screens showing programmes which, to old
Italia hands, looked remarkably familiar.
True, old age has suddenly emerged as a dominant subject in documentaries
throughout the industrialised world. True, the suffering and saintliness of
women occupies more time than ever in drama from Croatia (Sestre, about the
love between two sisters) to Japan (Shinenai Tori, about a woman's search
for dignity) and the UK (Prime Suspect, about a woman who chooses to do a
more-than-full-time job in the police force and the shopping as well and
then exercises her female prerogative and complains that she has no time).
True, programmes in the music and arts category, so often over-long in the
past, seem abnormally - and, at a festival of this sort, mercifully - short
this year.
But such changes scarcely seem to support the belief, shared by so many of
the 900 people here to serve on juries, join in debates, or simply observe
(well, yes, and to enjoy the Parma ham and the Verdi concerts) that
broadcasting is about to plunge into a new age of ratings obsessed
vulgarity. Most newcomers spending 10 days assiduously watching programmes
for eight or nine hours a day, either in the viewing rooms or in the even
more heavily used 'On Demand' cubicles, such a feature of television
festivals since the appearance of the video recorder, would probably have
come away heartened.
Of course the Prix Italia is an event which studiously excludes the material
forming the bulk of most television schedules: there are no game shows,
sitcoms, chat shows, sport or news programmes here. However, even in the
three prize categories - drama, documentaries and arts - you might expect to
find evidence of popularisation and trivialisation if the descent into the
commercial maw is really as swift and precipitous as many in Parma were
asserting.
On the surface there seems little sign. The winner of the television arts
prize, Anton Webern, from La Sept in France, is a relentlessly superior
visual tone poem (in monochrome, naturally) which airily ignores the
benefits of speech, providing no presenter, voice-over, or commentary of any
sort. It can be properly comprehended only by those already well up on
Webern - Prix Italia jurors for instance. Here is the face of old fashioned
broadcasting at its most supercilious. Television is a mass medium? So what?
ITV's entry in this category, the 'South Bank Show' on The Making Of Sgt
Pepper was considered unremarkable; the sort of programme, said the jury,
which a good broadcasting organisation ought to be making every week. Only
the Russian juror wanted to give it a prize, on the grounds that, if
screened in Russia, it would get the highest ratings ever.
The drama prize went to another French entry, La Controverse de Valladolid,
a deeply worthy 16th century ecclesiastical courtroom drama about a
post-Columbus debate among Catholics as to whether black people were men
with souls or merely clever animals. In television terms it was less than
remarkable but no one could deny its political correctness. The BBC won the
documentary prize with a programme from the 'Video Diaries' series, War,
Lives and Videotape in which Nick Danziger recorded his own efforts to find
a home for orphans in Kabul, and incidentally dwelled lengthily on wounded
children screaming in hospital.
Apart from the topicality of Danziger's piece, none of the prize winners
would have looked out of place at any Prix Italia in the last 20 years. So
why the neurosis? Where is the crisis? So far it may be concealed but it is
no fantasy. Even at this old, deeply civilised festival, the evidence is
there, albeit under the surface.
Speak to the producers and you find that the arts entries are shorter this
year because everywhere arts budgets are under attack. Arts programmes
(apart from 'unremarkable' productions such as the 'South Bank Show') don't
win ratings. Think carefully about the dramas and you realise that a
category dominated not so long ago by single plays, usually on serious
social or political themes, now features a remarkable array of detectives
and a growing number of episodes from serials or mini-series.
Look at the very organisation of the festival itself and you discover that
one of the chief reasons for coming here year after year - the integrity of
the prize system, achieved by allowing a company to enter either a programme
or a juror in a given category but never both - has been torpedoed this
year. Why? Because co-production is said to be so widespread that it was
becoming impossible to enforce the old rule, in television if not radio.
Thus the Prix Italia itself is falling victim to the globalisation of
television. Even if people did not actually give prizes to their own
programmes, there was a significant tendency this year for programmes from
the jurors' own companies to reach the shortlist. How could one juror vote
another's off the shortlist?
Above all the evidence comes from the knowledge of the broadcasters and
journalists gathered in Parma. The eastern Europeans tell you that the
ex-communist societies do not want to switch to public service broadcasting
with its collectivist, even statist overtones; too much like a chip off the
old block. They want to go straight to the commercial marketplace. Even a
buffer state such as Finland is shifting on January 1 1993 from its present
system of running some commercial content on the public service channels to
a mixed system with an entire channel for commercial broadcasting and the
old public service people left to fill far more time with no more money.
The French are gloomy about changes which have already occurred in France
and more pessimistic still about non-commercial broadcasting in the future.
During the course of the Prix Italia Padulla, the president of RAI, Italy's
equivalent of the BBC, labelled television banal, repetitive, and in
retreat. And of course it was impossible to find a British broadcaster in
Parma who was not filled with foreboding about the changes beginning in the
UK next January. The virtual unanimity of the belief that the new
market-driven ITV, red in tooth and claw, will drive down British programme
standards is unique in my experience of reporting on the industry over the
past 25 years.
That reporting has included coverage of previous Prix Italia festivals where
public service broadcasters have felt under threat. This occasion, the 44th,
is the first where there has been serious talk of the Prix Italia itself
coming to an end because the broadcasting world in which it existed now
seems to have the glow of sunset upon it. How ironic if the Prix Italia were
to end as it began: as a select festival for high quality radio programmes.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: The Comedy of Errors - New York Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Nothing succeeds like excess?' Maybe not. The New York Shakespeare
Festival's production of The Comedy of Errors prompts a qualifying of Oscar
Wilde's dictum which, quoted in a programme note, was clearly its
inspiration. It's excess is excessive, and rarely successful.
The temptation to gussy up The Comedy of Errors with lots of onstage
business, as director Caca Rosset has done here, is understandable. It is,
after all, the simplest of Shakespeare's plots: the Antipholus twins,
separated at birth and unaware of each other's existence, show up in the
same city with their twin servants, both named Dromio, and are mistaken for
each other again and again.
Rosset has made his one-joke wonder of a script into a sight-gag-aholics
dream: no mugging is too shameless, no shot too cheap (yes, there's even a
'Dromio, Dromio' called down from a balcony window) to end up on Rosset's
stage. The problem is that much of the business is sloppily executed, and
what is supposed to be wackily funny often comes off as cringingly silly.
Rosset's frantic staging does pay off with a few sublimely off-centre
moments. Vide Karla Burns, built like the Tasmanian Devil and possessed of a
similar energy, who bursts on stage and hurls herself into a gut-wrenching
gospel anthem.
That we have never seen this character before nor know what she is doing are
concerns that are drowned out by Burns' mighty talent (as it transpires, she
is Nell the maid). And the production takes on a wonderfully self-aware tone
when, at a particularly frenzied moment, Antipholus of Syracuse calls a
time-out American-style, hands forming a 'T' over his head, freezing the
onstage action and bringing up the house lights, so that he can express his
confusion directly to the audience.
The Shakespeare Festival continues to cultivate its bad reputation for
casting media stars regardless of their skills in speaking verse; Marisa
Tomei's (My Cousin Vinny), Adriana substitutes shouting and gestures for
interpreting the text. There are a few gems among the other performances,
particularly John Michael Higgins' Antipholus of Ephesus and the Dromii,
Peter Jacobson and Howard Samuelsohn.
Whatever this production's indulgences, Free Shakespeare in the Park
continues to be one of New York's most beloved summer traditions. That Joe
Papp's dream of a public theatre lives on after his death last year is a
fact that gives pleasure long after the bad-joke hangover from this Comedy
has faded.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Il Pirata' and 'Fidelio' - Opera in Zurich and London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK and ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like two lovers who don't speak the same language, German-speaking Europe
has long been fascinated by bel canto opera without being able to make much
sense of it: you either get some disastrously way-out form of Regietheater,
or a bland pictorial reproduction by an imported Italian director. It seems
to be only non-partisan outsiders who can pull off the marriage between
German logic on the one hand, and Latin warmth and spontaneity on the other.
This is what distinguishes the new staging by the American producer
Francesca Zambello of Bellini's Il Pirata at the Zurich Opera House.
Il Pirata was Bellini's first commission for La Scala (1827), the first of
his collaborations with the librettist Felice Romani and one of the first
Italian operas to dispense with recitativo secco in favour of the continuous
Romantic style of composition. As with any successful revival, one is left
wondering why it has been left to languish so long (Callas in the 1950s and
Caballe in the 1960s being its last great exponents). Il Pirata rewards the
listener with some of the most sublime melodies Bellini ever wrote. At first
sight, its dramatic ingredients are not far off the romantic stereotype:
Imogene, married to Ernesto, loves the pirate-nobleman Gualtiero, Ernesto's
political rival, and ends up with neither. But look beneath the surface, and
you find what Edward Dent recognised more than 50 years ago as 'a
stimulating exercise in emotional analysis'.
In her emblematic, psychologically-perceptive staging, Zambello sees Imogene
as a universal archetype - the woman whose dutiful marriage and Hausfrau
existence preclude any sort of romantic fulfilment except in day-dreams.
Imogene dreams of Gualtiero, symbolised by the miniature galleon which she
cradles as the curtain opens on Act one, and which the designer Bruno
Schwengl turns into a motif for the whole production. He bathes the stage in
Mediterranean colours, adding little more than a gauze, a drop cloth and a
few nautical props. In her direction of the principals, Zambello accepted
the conventions of Italian opera, but encouraged the singers to substitute
emotional poise for melodrama. Only in Ernesto's arrival-scene - dominated
by a golden horse and a posse of pink-plumed guards - did the production
dissolve into kitsch.
But however well they fare as theatre, Bellini's operas stand or fall on the
quality of the singing. The main audience draw in Zurich was Mara Zampieri,
who met the technical challenges without disguising a breathy, effortful
quality in her voice production. Imogene is no Minnie or Forza Leonora: for
all her stage presence, Zampieri lacks the sparkling clarity and tonal
delicacy for Bellini.
The real vocal sparks came from Salvatore Fisichella, an underrated Sicilian
tenor who regularly reserves his best for Switzerland. With his sweet and
open tone, clear diction and clarion despatch, he glided over the numerous
hurdles in Gualtiero's high-lying music. The American baritone Rodney
Gilfrey, much admired in French opera and Mozart, made an unhappy Ernesto,
Pythonesque in his ceremonial armour and vocally ill-at-ease.
The mainstay of Zurich's Italian repertoire is Nello Santi, whose
performances are scrupulously prepared and executed, if sometimes marred by
a strictness more appropriate to a bandmaster. Il Pirata found him in
sensitive form, shaping the music tenderly and drawing exquisite solo
contributions from horn and cor anglais.
The drab staging of Fidelio by Adolf Dresen has been brought back to Covent
Garden two seasons after it was introduced. The revival has been directed by
Astrid Vehstedt with a largely new set of principals; only Gabriela
Benackova returns in the title role. Jeffrey Tate is the conductor.
Dresen's reworking of the text, with significantly tightened dialogue, has
been retained. It shortens the running time, but is otherwise not
beneficial, and the question of why it was thought necessary in the first
place is never answered. The whole effect, indeed, is of a production
without purpose; one waits in vain for enlightenment to arrive, for a reason
other than decorative reference in Margit Bardy's designs for the slight
updating of the story, for a dramatic spark to set the moral fable ablaze
rather than reduce it to an everyday narrative.
Given thrilling performances the very neutrality of such a setting might
have been a bonus, an unobtrusive backdrop to the musical drama. On Monday
there were no thrills. Though much of the singing was more than competent,
Tate's conducting was leaden and lacked any sense of scale or fervour; it is
almost an achievement in itself to make the Prisoners' Chorus as
matter-of-fact as it was here, or fail so completely to strike sparks from
the Act 2 finale. Elsewhere ensemble was sometimes tenuous, but then few of
the musical components cohered.
Benackova produced some gleaming phrases, but not enough to create the
combination of moral certainty and moving commitment at the core of Leonore;
the heroic dimension was missing. There was a useful clean-toned Rocco,
complete with limp, from Gunter Missenhardt, an underpowered (though
reportedly under-the-weather) Pizzarro from Gregory Yurisch. Lynton
Artkinson's fresh Jacquino and Judith Howarth's lively Marzelline provided
the brightest playing; Thomas Sunnegardh's Florestan swamped a few
well-turned mid-register phrases with some extraordinary squalls and wild
pitching above the stave. An unsatisfactory evening almost all round.
Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; further performances October 1, 7, 10, 13
and 17.

It's an odd thing but during all the discussion of joy-riding over the past
year and more, never once have I heard any mention of young people elsewhere
in Europe engaging in joy-riding. So maybe it is a particularly British form
of flamboyant sexual display. Whatever the truth may be, joy-riding is a
favourite pastime in Belfast which provides the setting for tonight's
Screenplay on BBC2, You, Me and Marley (9.00).
The play won a small stack of awards for Belfast playwright Graham Reid at
this year's Edinburgh International Film Festival, so it promises to be well
worth watching.
BBC 1's Inside Story, The Assassin (9.30) describes the unusual career of
Michael Townley, a normal American guy until he married a quite
exceptionally forceful Chilean political activist. As a reward for their
anti-communist fervour, the couple were invited to join President Pinochet's
ruthless secret police, called DINA. Together they went on long foreign
holidays, taking with them a perfume-flask full of nerve-gas with which to
eliminate enemies of the state.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Game of give and take - David
Dodwell sees signs of closer co-operation between environmental groups and
trade policymakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental lobby groups, so long at loggerheads with trade policymakers
bent on liberalising international trade, have in recent weeks been drawn
into an intimate embrace.
At meetings with staff of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt),
and last week with national delegations at the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, the groups have been provided
with an unprecedented platform to voice their concerns.
Whether their arguments prove strong enough to moderate national policies on
international trade rules has yet to be seen. They almost certainly come too
late to have any direct impact on the outcome of the long-delayed Uruguay
Round of world trade talks. But the fact that they have been drawn into the
debate on reform of trade rules, rather than viewed by governments with a
mixture of hostility and suspicion, is nevertheless significant.
By the time some 50 environmental and development campaigners sat down last
week at a joint meeting of the OECD's trade and environment committees, they
had honed a common position, focusing on six principal areas of concern:
The need for internationally-agreed standards, particularly on food and farm
products, to provide a floor from which environmental standards should rise,
rather than a ceiling which governments can aim towards.
Indicative is concern over plans to harmonise the EC's 'E-numbers' of
permitted food additives. Ahead of harmonisation, the UK has a list of 300
approved additives. This compares with 150 in Germany and Greece, for
example. After harmonisation, all EC member states will have a list of 411
approved additives - an alarming backward step, as far as environmentalists
are concerned. The result is that food products that in the past have been
barred from Germany because they include prohibited additives may now be
freely imported.
The need for the Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO), a powerful new body
proposed as part of the Uruguay round of trade reforms to oversee
international trade, to give high and formal priority to environmental
concerns and in particular sustainable development.
The need for 'pace-setting' governments keen to set environmental standards
higher than the international norm to be free to do so. This includes a more
controversial conviction that such pace-setters should have a right to act
unilaterally in blocking imports from countries with lower standards or
dirty industrial processes.
This worry strikes a chord with trade economists - so long as environmental
standards are not being exploited by protectionist industries. For example,
why should Sweden not be allowed to ban the import of goods containing CFCs
if there is strong public pressure for the government to take a tough line,
and sound scientific evidence to back the move?
But such unilateral powers would become more controversial if Austria and
the Netherlands, for example, insisted that all timber imports be 'forest
friendly' - that is, the wood must come from forests that are being
sustainably logged. The mind boggles as to how a customs officer is to
distinguish 'forest friendly' timber from other kinds.
The need for industry to 'internalise' the environmental cost of a product -
ranging from electricity generators incorporating the true cost of treating
nuclear waste to timber prices which include reimbursement to exporting
countries for their loss of biodiversity.
While trade economists are beginning to come round to this argument, they
have yet to find an agreed set of formulae for measuring the environmental
cost to be internalised. They are also anxious that industries should not be
allowed to use these costs as an excuse to call for duties on imports from
countries that are not bearing higher environmental costs.
The need for industrial countries to recognise that they bear the main
responsibility for the cost of environmental improvement in poor countries -
both because they have the wealth to afford it, and because they are the
principal source of globe-threatening pollution. This involves considering
schemes such as recycling cash raised through tariffs back to developing
countries to improve their environment.
The need for international trade bodies to be more open and answerable. This
would include not just the Gatt, but also organisations such as the
Rome-based Codex Alimentarius, which sets international food standards.
Trade economists are alarmed by various implications of these proposals.
Several proposals condone protectionism and make environmental lobbyists
easy prey for industry groups anxious to keep foreign competitors at bay.
Others are administratively unmanageable. Some confer on powerful
governments a right to interfere in the affairs of less powerful countries.
Debate in the OECD and in the Gatt nevertheless appears to have made
progress in paring down the areas of difference, and in helping either side
to recognise the merits of the other's arguments. Not least it appears to
have reduced the chronic suspicion with which free-traders and
environmentalists have traditionally glared at each other.
Groups emerging from last week's OECD discussions say that some intractable
areas remain - most significantly over a country's right to attack 'process'
standards, and to take environmental measures which interfere with another
countries' sovereign right to set their own environmental priorities.
At a more general level, advocates of free trade are likely to remain
irreconcilable with environmentalists over their fondness for regulation.
But it now appears possible that the Gatt will reconsider its draft
proposals for the MTO, giving it a more explicit brief to take account of
the need for trade to contribute to sustainable development, rather than
trade growth on any terms.
Trade policymakers also appear ready to pay serious attention to building
into the price of products their true environmental cost.
For their part, many environmental campaigners will continue to shun
economic growth, arguing that the west's relentless quest for growth is a
fundamental cause of environmental problems. Still more challenge the claim
that growth - and the wealth it generates - will provide the resources
needed to protect the environment.
But an increasing number appear to acknowledge that strong environmental
policies are unlikely to grow out of weak or recession-ridden economies.
Since trade liberalisation is powerfully linked with strong economic growth,
so there is a clearer recognition that free trade need not be an adversary
in the fight for higher environmental standards, but indeed could be an
ally.
'There is no question that OECD delegates have become much more sensitised
to environmental concerns,' an OECD official said yesterday. She signalled
that the next step would be to call a meeting between the OECD and
industrial interests, probably in November. Beyond that, the ambition is to
meet jointly with both environmentalists and industrial interests, probably
early in 1993.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: German industry snubs carbon
tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and PAUL NEEDHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
German business leaders attacked their government's support for a carbon tax
at last week's German Environment Conference in Frankfurt, estimating that
it could cost German industry DM 12bn-15bn (Pounds 4.7bn-Pounds 5.9bn) by
2000.
The German government has frequently made clear its support for proposals
for a tax to help cut emissions of gases that could harm the atmosphere. At
the Rio Earth Summit in June, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he planned cuts of
25-30 per cent in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 compared with 1987
levels.
However at a recent meeting of EC environment ministers at Gleneagles, Klaus
Topfer, the German environmental minister, said help cut emissions of carbon
dioxide 'is absolutely necessary, and very soon' if Germany is to meet those
targets. 'It will be a hell of a job to get there,' he added. 'The German
government is in favour of a tax, but many parts of German business are
against it.' The depth of that opposition was clear at Frankfurt, one of
Europe's biggest environmental conferences, where industrialists and union
leaders warned that a tax could cost German industry billions of D-Marks and
destroy its competitiveness.
Roland Turowski, director of the energy department of the German Electricity
Industry Federation, said: 'I know Mr Topfer's view and it is wrong. These
are high costs which will be passed on to the consumer, DM 3bn-5bn a year
and DM 12bn-15bn by 2000.'
Dietrich Wittmeyer, energy spokesman for the German Chemical Industry
Federation, also accused the government of being 'too much fixed on the
environment - they must also consider economic competitiveness'.
Several industrialists instead favoured more investment in energy-efficient
technology. Dieter Franke, environmental spokesman for the German automobile
association, also recommended a price structure that favoured
environmentally cleaner cars.
However, technological changes alone may not be enough to counter the
rapidly rising level of emissions caused by modernisation of the former east
German states, which Topfer describes as a huge impediment to his plans.
Of the 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by Germany each year, around a
third comes from the former eastern states, although they have only a fifth
of the combined population. That is partly because of their use of lignite
fuel, a particularly dirty form of energy. The government also projects that
the number of cars in east Germany will double to the west's level of one
car for every two people. As well as the opposition of businesses, the
German government must counter the ambivalence of many EC members about the
form of such a tax. At Rio EC members gave their backing on the condition
that a tax would not be implemented unless all 24 OECD countries agreed to
it. Topfer said - in what may be wishful thinking - that he hoped the EC
could decouple tax proposals from this condition.
However, the German position has the full backing of EC environment
commissioner Karel van Miert, who repeated his belief last week that 'we
need to go ahead with it'. Because of the importance of transport policy in
meeting the targets, Germany has been a vigorous supporter of van Miert, who
is also EC transport minister.
Van Miert's appointment as environment minister lasts only until December
but he recently said: 'I would be happy to stay on after December, subject
to the Belgian government's plans, and it is very probable that I will.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Management (Health Check): Tackling the types who take
stress to heart - Dr Michael McGannon looks at new research into coronary
disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the 1960s, attempts have been made to define certain personality
characteristics that make some people more prone to coronary heart disease
than others. 'Type A' people, as opposed to their more laid-back 'Type B'
counterparts, have been described as the sort of people who are always in a
hurry, are inordinately impatient, aggressive or even hostile, speak in an
explosive way, and are goal-oriented, competitive and driven.
Over the years there has been no clear verdict on whether Type A personality
can be categorised as an independent risk factor for heart disease. However,
new research is shedding light on this complicated issue.
Two characteristics of Type A behaviour which may well lead to heart
disease, and which have also been linked to suppressed immune function and
cancer deaths, have been isolated by US researchers. They are: hostility -
antagonism as a form of severe competitiveness - and time urgency - 'never
enough hours in a day'.
These two traits are interrelated: to a person who has a sense of needing to
compress more and more activity into a shrinking day, anyone or anything
blocking that process will cause irritation and may provoke a hostile
reaction.
The human nervous system evolved during more primitive times when the main
threats to survival were physical. When faced with stress, the body's
systems, therefore, are geared to an appropriate physical response. The
nervous, cardiovascular and hormonal systems prepare the body either for
flight or a fight.
For example, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rates all rise,
increasing oxygen demands by the heart; muscle tension increases in
preparation for a flight to safety, or a fight; and sweating increases as a
cooling mechanism.
In a modern context, there is usually no physical resolution to this stress.
Moreover, at the moment when the mind and body scream for simple things such
as oxygen and water, modern managers inappropriately respond with
cigarettes, which decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, or
immoderate alcohol, which can depress lucidity, raise blood pressure and
force the body to lose precious water.
A personal strategy for coping with stress should include:
Broadening your definition of success to include self-preservation. This
first step, already adopted by younger managers on the rise, is taken not
just for your own career but also for your family and friends. Do not
exchange precious years of your life, your marriage or your health for a
perceived need for professional control. Ask yourself of every stressful
situation: 'Is it really worth getting sick for?'
Listening carefully to your body and mind. Start to decipher individual
signs and symptoms, not as something to escape or anaesthetise, but as
valuable warning of a potentially serious underlying problem. Watch for high
blood pressure, chronic fatigue, nervous eating or drinking, sleeplessness,
peptic ulcers, tension headaches, obesity and depression.
Managing your time intelligently. Start by living in the real world and
planning accordingly. Plan breaks into your daily agenda - even five minutes
to take a breath of fresh air and re-evaluate - and make daily checklists.
Finish what you have on your plate before loading more on.
Planning some physical exercise in your daily life. Walk for 10 minutes
after lunch and dinner. This will help periodically to decompress an
otherwise chronically compressed cardiovascular system. If you need a
structured exercise programme, consider joining a health club near your
office.
Not making your reaction to stress more dangerous to your life than the
stress itself. There are healthy ways to detach yourself from the stresses
that threaten your quality of life: for example, talking things over with
your spouse, a health professional or a member of the clergy, deep breathing
and yoga, meditation and prayer, going to see a film, humour, massage,
delegating, taking a holiday, engaging in physical activity, decreasing the
use of coffee and alcohol or going fishing.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Management: Sit where you like - Executives are being
deprived of their desks to save space but there are compensations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An Englishman's home may still be his castle, but the fortifications around
his workspace are collapsing as property prices and the quest for greater
efficiency batter traditional ideas of office organisation.
Open plan offices, it is clear, were the thin edge of the wedge. Executives
'owned ' their desks but shared a communal working space. Now, a number of
companies are beginning to implement the concept of 'hotdesking' or the
'virtual office', where executives own neither desk nor workspace but make
use of any desk that is free during visits to the office.
The pioneers of hotdesking in the UK are the large multinational computer
companies, International Business Machines (IBM) and Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC), as well as Andersen Consulting, the management
consultancy.
Clearly, it is a concept suited only to organisations where staff spend
appreciable amounts of time away from their desks and where office space is
at a premium. Andersen's consultants, for example, are as often at clients'
premises as in the company's Arundel Street, London, offices. Hotdesking,
Andersen claims, is making possible an occupancy ratio in Arundel Street of
three square metres a person, or one third the conventional rate.
The two computer companies say that technology is both the reason for, and
the key to, hotdesking. All traditional computer manufacturers have been
hard hit by a combination of the recession, price collapse caused by
technological advances and static demand. As a consequence, they are
'rightsizing', laying off staff and closing facilities while looking for
ways to make more economical use of space.
Hotdesking for such companies is possible only because of the 'intelligence'
it is possible to build into a desk through computers and clever telephone
systems.
While IBM has experimented with hotdesking at a number of its older sites in
the UK, its recently completed Pounds 60m national marketing centre in New
Square, Bedfont Lakes, a few minutes from London's Heathrow Airport, is the
company's first offices purpose-built for the new approach.
Open plan offices are spread round the periphery of the building at three
levels, with open spaces in the centre providing communal dining and
recreational facilities. The overall impression is of black girders, bolts
and glass.
IBM's idea in developing Bedfont Lakes was to consolidate staff scattered
around four leased buildings in west London on to one long-term site.
Eventually there will be 1,000 people in the building. At present, it is
only about half full as staff move from the older offices, but IBM's
planners reckon they are achieving between 20 and 30 per cent space savings
compared with traditional office organisation.
IBM's ideas of shared space go back to 1988 when its planners noticed that
unoccupied space was growing as the nature of work changed. Surveys showed
that desks were typically used for little more than two-thirds of the
working week and usually much less.
Research also revealed that while most of the company's larger customers
already had an IBM terminal on their premises, IBM's own employees were in
favour of portable technology and flexibility in their place of work.
Customers, software developers and systems builders had all taken precedence
over IBM's own marketing and sales specialists when it had come to the
allocation of the latest computing technology.
This unfulfilled desire for flexibility formed the basis for a unique deal.
Employees were persuaded to give up their personal space - individual desks
and offices - but in exchange were given the latest IBM personal computer
technology, including portable systems.
In other words, Bedfont Lakes staff have traded off a loss of identity in
the workplace against freedom. IBM's own surveys suggest they are at least
as happy in the new environment as they were in the old.
Work areas at Bedfont Lakes are of two sorts; one for staff who come into
the office every day and which are little different from traditional
offices. Then there are the hotdesks which offer standard facilities
throughout the building.
Each member of staff has his or her own secure locker for personal effects.
There are larger, lockable filing cabinets for documents and records used by
work groups.
Each hotdesk is equipped with a personal computer connected to the corporate
network, a point to plug in a portable computer and a telephone handset.
When staff visit the building, they find an empty desk and key into the
computer system which automatically sends their own electronic mail and
telephone messages to that workspace.
In practice, staff tend to use the same desk or one close to it; members of
work groups cluster together as if they owned the same desks and office
space. Robert Young, a customer service specialist, says: 'I thought I was
not going to like it, but it is working quite well.'
He now uses a laptop computer in the office and at home. It is an innovation
which has opened new possibilities for staff. 'Some people in this
department are quite determined never to go into the office again,' one
manager admitted.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Management: When the show must go on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Destruction of life and property on the scale caused by the IRA bomb blast
at the Baltic Exchange in the City of London in April (above), is not,
fortunately, an everyday occurrence. Nevertheless, increasing numbers of
organisations are engaging in 'business continuity planning' just in case
disaster should strike.
According to a Gallup survey commissioned by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants and management consultants, 62 per cent of the top 500 UK
companies now have an emergency plan, up from 48 per cent a year ago.
However, that still leaves a significant proportion of organisations with no
contingency plans for staying in business should the worst happen. Moreover,
among companies which did have plans, almost half focused exclusively on
what would happen in the event of the loss of a computer system.
As Coopers &amp; Lybrand points out: 'Any disaster that affects an
organisation's main computer systems will, in all likelihood, impact all of
the business functions located in the same building.' There is little point
organising manual systems to replace computers if staff have no back-up
offices to work in or equipment.
Only 52 per cent of existing plans make specific provision for handling
customer enquiries during a disaster, highlighting 'the extent to which
existing plans focus too heavily on systems recovery rather than the needs
of the business'.
Perhaps most surprisingly, only 2 per cent of companies in the manufacturing
sector appear to have any arrangements for alternative manufacturing
facilities in the event of a disaster hitting the main plant.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Jobs: Even non-lunatic fringes can blind - Consultants'
survey confirms that UK organisations' executive-pay policies reflect the
Gospel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is time for an addition to be made to the standard dictionaries of
English. True, most include the phrase 'perk up' - defining it, for example,
as 'to make or become more cheerful, hopeful or lively'. But in none of them
can I find 'perk down' which, as all too many people have learned this past
year or two, means 'to be brought back to earth with a bump'.
Although spoken of lightly as fringe benefits, the perquisites executives
receive are apt to have a profoundly anaesthetic effect on their perception
of reality. The Jobs column owes the most striking example it knows of to
39-year-old reader Ed Hughes. Describing the effects of suddenly ceasing to
be a managing director, he singles out the shattering realisation that
'petrol is no longer 50p a gallon, as was the case the last time one bought
it personally.'
What might be some compensation to him and his luckless contemporaries, is
the fact that things could have been worse. In Britain's pay-freezes of the
1970s, several companies extended the perks-supply to suits or dresses for
spouses as well as executives, household furnishings, and boarding-school
fees for children. Hence job loss might leave a once-proud couple shivering
in their underwear, bereft of curtains to hide their shame from the
neighbours, and picturing their kids awakening in the dormitory to find
their suitcases standing packed beside their beds.
While those lunatic days may be gone, however, managers evidently still have
a lot on the fringe to lose - at least in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the
rule seems to be that the bigger they are, the harder they are prone to
fall. That much is plain from the underlying table, which is drawn from the
P-E International consultancy's latest survey of executive rewards in the
UK.
Anyone who wants the full report, which contains a wealth of information and
is priced at Pounds 350, should contact P-E's Michael Smith at Park House,
Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; telephone 0784-434411, fax 0784 437828. My
extracts are limited to the survey's findings on the more common types of
perks - although they exclude some apparently in growing vogue, such as free
counselling on personal finances.
The table takes 13 salary-bands from Pounds 20,000-Pounds 25,000 upwards and
shows the percentage of managers on the various perches of the pay
pecking-order who enjoy each perk listed. The all-ranks figures at the
bottom, comparing this year with 1987, refer to all executives covered by
the survey, including those on salaries under Pounds 20,000 a year.
In general, the table surely again confirms that UK pay policies are guided
by Matthew XXV:29, which starts: '. . .unto everyone that hath shall be
given, and he shall have abundance'
Alas, amid the joys of profiting by said principle, it's too easily
forgotten that the same verse ends: 'but from him that hath not shall be
taken away even that which he hath.'

                  XXXX
The copy-book answer, which several dozen of you have taken pains to show
you arrived at, is:
                 80709
             _________
        124 ! 10007916

                  1116
                  1116
One independent spirit also did the trick using a divisor of 111, but it
seems questionable whether that solution fits the form of the sum as it was
set out.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Sheffield plays the games and counts the cost: The world
student tournament proved a managerial and financial disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Student Games in Sheffield last summer were a triumph for sport
but a political and financial disaster for the city that staged them.
The idea was to demonstrate vision, Yorkshire grit and Sheffield's ability
to pull itself up by its bootstraps after the collapse of much of its
industry in the early 1980s.
Instead, the city was shown to have been incompetent at management and
financial control. The council budgeted for a Pounds 5m loss to be on the
safe side, but things went so wrong losses were Pounds 10.4m.
Last week the council's policy committee drew up plans to sack about 700
people to finance Pounds 7.5m of overspending on its current budget. Mr Mike
Bower, the council's Labour leader, says that cannot be linked to the extra
losses on the games but is just as easily attributable to spending on
education, housing or cleaning.
However, Mr Gordon Sutton, district auditor for the area and the
government's watchdog on public spending, says the games compounded
Sheffield's already serious financial difficulties, making cuts in jobs and
services inevitable.
The catalogue of managerial errors and chaos surrounding the games is
recounted this week in reports by Mr Sutton and Mrs Pamela Gordon, the
council's chief executive.
Mr Sutton says optimistic income projections by Mr Ray Gridley, Sheffield's
director of housing, who was seconded in June 1990 to run the games, misled
councillors. The council will go into camera on Friday to debate whether he
should be disciplined. Mrs Gordon's position will also be scrutinised.
Nevertheless, the reports also make clear that other officials and
councillors were not assertive enough in satisfying themselves of the risks
involved.
Powers had been delegated to Mr Gridley and Mrs Gordon to get on with the
job, but Mr Sutton says too many people assumed things were under tighter
control than they were, and there was no proper internal audit.
It was only when accounts were finalised four months after the games that
the scale of the loss became apparent.
Neither Mr Bower nor Mrs Gordon's report considers the period before June
1990, when the council took over the games, but both believe the council
started at a disadvantage. Britain was in recession - a sharp contrast to
1987, when the games were awarded.
The basic handicap was that Sheffield embarked on a high-risk, Pounds
20m-plus venture with poor prospects of selling television rights and,
hence, consumer-product sponsorship.
The unmarketability of the games as a worldwide TV spectacle dogged
Universiade GB, a company set up the council and Sheffield's private sector,
to manage them.
There were clashes between Mr Peter Burns, a former Reed International
director brought in as chief executive, and Labour councillors over his
'capitalistic' management style. He left at the end of 1989 in a blaze of
bad publicity.
When Universiade GB eventually became irredeemably insolvent because it
could not even raise enough sponsorship to keep itself going, the council
took over, believing it could do better. It failed.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Big users' gas bills condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VERY large gas users face considerably higher prices than users in some
European countries and have not seen any price benefits from measures to
introduce competition into the UK gas market, Mr Ian Powe, director of the
Gas Consumers Council, said yesterday.
His comments will strengthen demands for lower energy prices from UK
industry, where many customers are already complaining about electricity
prices.
The Gas Consumers Council, which represents 18m British customers, said
yesterday one reason for the price rise for large users was the requirement
 -imposed by the Office of Fair Trading - that British Gas must halve its
share of the industrial supply market by the mid 1990s.
The release gas programme, whereby British Gas sells off tranches of its
contracted gas supplies to competitors, was inadequate, and the only way BG
could cut its market share was by putting up prices. That in turn did not
give an incentive to independent marketers to cut prices as much as they
might.
The GCC will shortly report to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which
is engaged in a comprehensive inquiry into the UK gas market.
British Gas said that in real terms UK industrial contract prices had
dropped by 30 per cent since the company was privatised in 1986. BG
accepted, though, that prices for large users were higher than in some
European countries.
In contrast, domestic gas customers paid less than in Italy, the Benelux
countries, France and Germany.
Mr Powe told a conference in Brussels there was 'a stark difference, to the
disadvantage of UK Limited, in prices paid in the big gas-consuming
countries of Europe and the UK at higher consumption levels'.
While household users have benefited from a tough price formula that has
produced two recent price cuts, unregulated industrial prices were creeping
up, he added.

BRITISH AIRWAYS is to start services between the US and both Birmingham and
Manchester. The announcement yesterday provoked a sharp attack from the US
airline industry, which said the move highlighted the unfair advantages BA
had over its US rivals.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of US carrier United Airlines, last night met Mr
Ian MacGregor, the transport secretary, to renew pressure on the government
to ease restrictions on the operations of American carriers in the UK.
He and other US airline chiefs are pressing for the changes as a quid pro
quo for British Airways' proposed purchase of a Dollars 750m (Pounds 438.5m)
stake in USAir, the American carrier.
'I want to make sure the British government understands the degree by which
BA wins in this deal,' Mr Wolf said yesterday.
'BA would be able to run a US domestic route network while we would not have
access to top UK regions or onward flights to third countries. BA's
announcement (on Birmingham and Manchester) underscores the discriminatory
nature of the air services agreements between our two countries.'
BA did not need prior permission to announce the new services because it
already had the rights to fly the routes.
American Airlines, the largest US carrier, said yesterday that BA was
starting the services only after years of pressure. 'We would begin a
Birmingham-Chicago service within 90 days if given the green light.'
Mr Wolf pressed Mr MacGregor to allow his airline to fly twice daily between
the US and Manchester and Birmingham. He asked the government to try to
persuade third countries to accept onward flights from London by US
airlines.
BA's services will start in March 1993 and will link Birmingham with Newark,
near New York, and Manchester with Los Angeles.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Tory activists call for reform at headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY party managers face the prospect of an embarrassingly high-profile
public debate on making Conservative Central Office, the party's
headquarters based in central London, democratically accountable to party
members.
Fifty local Tory associations are supporting a call for a special meeting of
the Tory central council, a gathering of senior party activists, to bring
about such changes. The group, spearheaded by the Party Reform Steering
Committee, a group of 11 activists, accuses Central Office of being 'remote
from the constituencies and out of touch'.
The difference between this and previous moves to reform Central Office is
that the party's rules say that its executive committee must summon a
special meeting of the central council if 50 associations require it. The
call is another headache for the national union, the voluntary wing of the
Tory which is already deep into arrangements for what promises to be a
difficult conference next week.
Central Office said the first step would be to check whether the rules were
as definite as the reform committee envisaged, and whether all 50 of the
local associations had indeed signed up to the move.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, has already promised a review of
spending.
Central Office is traditionally the scapegoat of the Conservative party
conference, with complaints about presentational failures coming from
representatives who are not prepared openly to criticise party policy.
Mr Michael Normington, the chairman of the steering committee, said
yesterday that the call for change was widely supported and that Central
Office had put pressure on many constituency associations not to join the
move.
If Central Office were properly subject to democratic accountability and
control by constituency associations, the committee argues, there would be
nothing like the level of dissatisfaction with it.
The committee is seeking the transfer of responsibility for Central Office
and party central funds from the appointed officers to a committee which is
mainly elected and then elects its officers.

FT  30 SEP 92 / People: MacSharry to join Smurfit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray MacSharry, EC agricultural commissioner, will be joining the board of
paper, packaging and printing group Jefferson Smurfit, Ireland's largest
company, as a non-executive director early next year following his departure
from Brussels at the end of December.
Jack Lynch, prime minister of the Republic until 1979, and on the board of
the company since then, is retiring aged 75.
MacSharry, who earned the nickname of 'the second Cromwell' in his native
Ireland because of farmers' fears for their countryside in the wake of CAP
reform, has achieved the distinction of pushing through the most
far-reaching changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year
history.
Twice a finance minister in Charles Haughey's cabinet, he was long tipped as
the next Irish prime minister, but in the event he did not challenge Albert
Reynolds and now says he wishes to withdraw from public life. Before
entering parliament in 1969, he was involved in road haulage.
The company is keen to deny any close personal connections between him and
its chairman Michael Smurfit. 'Ireland is a small place and no doubt they
have run into each other,' says a spokesman, 'but this was a board-driven
appointment. We wanted someone who knew the streets of Europe.' Smurfit is
keen to expand its presence in continental Europe and it also thinks
MacSharry's advice will be valuable in helping deal with the flood of
'green' legislation from Brussels.
William MacDonald, 74, a former company secretary, is also stepping down
from the board. Meanwhile, Martin Rafferty, chairman of Dublin
pharmaceuticals distributor United Drug, joins as a non-executive director
and as the first chairman of the newly formed audit committee. The most
financially experienced non-executive director, according to the company, he
is also chairman of Ulster Investment Bank, the Industrial Development
Authority, and Readymix, as well as being a director of Aer Lingus, Ulster
Bank and Church &amp; General Insurance Company.
*****
Tom Roberts, deputy chief general manager of General Accident, is to retire
at the end of November. One of the Perth-based company's stalwarts, Roberts
has been with GA since 1953. Now 62, he worked his way up through the
company's hierarchy, working in Newcastle, St Albans and finally at the head
office in Perth where he became deputy chief general manager in 1989.
Recently he has been closely involved in GA's work on road safety, winning a
CBE for his services in this area in 1989. GA is not making a replacement
for the moment.

FT  30 SEP 92 / People: Beckwith brothers stand down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Beckwith (left) and Peter Beckwith, two of the best-known property
developers in the UK, yesterday resigned from the board of London &amp;
Edinburgh Trust, the property company they created and sold at the peak of
the market in 1990.
SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Scandinavia's largest insurance company, which
bought LET for Pounds 491m, says the management changes have been made 'to
integrate the international property activities more closely with other
investment and property operations of Trygg-Hansa SPP and to confirm the
continuing commitment of SPP to its international property interests'.
'It was natural that one day the existing management of LET and SPP would go
their different ways,' explains Anders Ek, the chairman of SPP's
international property operations who has been appointed the new chairman of
LET, as well as of its holding company and subsidiaries.
The sale of LET to SPP was seen as a personal coup for the Old Harrovian
Beckwith brothers, whose personal holdings were valued at about Pounds 40m
each. Conversely, SPP has not yet benefited from its acquisition of LET,
which made a loss of Pounds 150.9m for 1991.
Peter Beckwith, chairman of LET, will leave the group, while John Beckwith
will remain full-time with the group in Continental Europe. Stuart McDonald,
joint chief executive of LET, will also leave the group.
Nicholas Sheehan, a former partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley who is currently
joint chief executive of LET, will become managing director of LET.
Ek says the changes would lead to a lesser emphasis on development. 'As an
institutional investor we feel that it is more within our corporate nature
to focus towards property investment rather than development,' says Ek.
The Beckwith brothers were associated with some of the most prominent
developments in the UK, including the proposed Spitalfields development in
the City of London and Birmingham's Bull Ring Centre.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Prescott attacks
privatisation - BR sell-off is rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, the shadow transport secretary, yesterday blamed the
government's ideology of market forces and privatisation for the
deterioration of public-transport systems and the environment.
His speech, which ended yesterday's debate on the environment, transport and
water with a vision of safer, more reliable public transport and a cleaner
environment, was greeted with a standing ovation and the congratulations of
Mr John Smith.
Reliance on market forces to shape policy and services was attacked by other
speakers. 'How much longer are we going to be burdened with a government
that is prepared to sacrifice both industry and the environment to market
forces?' asked Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing,
Science and Finance union.
The conference went on to approve a resolution calling for privatised water
companies to be brought back under public control. Mr Prescott did not
insist on nationalisation of utilities as a cure for all environmental ills.
He said he recognised that centralisation of power did not necessarily
guarantee a clear environmental record, and so demanded an environmental
charter giving individuals the right to information on the environment.
Mr Prescott said the import of toxic waste meant Britain had become 'the
dustbin of Europe', but the NEC opposed a resolution calling for an
immediate end to toxic waste imports because of other clauses demanding the
closure of nuclear power stations and a ban on all imports of coal.
Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for Linlithgow, was met with jeers when he spoke in
support of nuclear power as the 'greenest' energy form. The resolution was
narrowly rejected on a card vote.
During the transport debate, delegates from several transport unions warned
that they would fight the privatisation of British Rail.
'My union won't stand by and let it happen,' said Mr Derrick Fullick,
general secretary of Aslef. 'If trains are unsafe we won't run them.'
He continued: 'Anyone interested in buying bits of our rail system or taking
out a franchise does so for only one reason: to rape the system and pillage
its assets.
'One system for the businessman. The champagne express. Another for the
typist. The commuter cattle truck.'
Mr Richard Rosser of the National Executive Committee condemned the idea of
putting BR 'under the hammer and selling it off bit by bit to the highest
bidder'.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport
Workers union, said that rail fares would rise 142 per cent because of
privatisation.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Bank manager emerges with
credit - Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS has been a good week in Blackpool for Mr John Smith. But then, neither
he nor his party has yet left the foothills beneath the mountain to be
climbed before the next election.
His first speech to the party conference yesterday had none of the
rhetorical flourishes of his predecessor. It was worthy and uninspiring, a
statement of the values that underpin Scottish socialism rather than a call
to arms.
It was too long but timed for the moment. The message ran as follows: Mr
John Major was floundering in a crisis of his own making; Mr Smith would
maximise his discomfort. But he would be calm and consistent in formulating
his alternatives.
In the flat delivery and in the uncontroversial content there was an
admission that, like the prime minister, Mr Smith is from the bank managers'
school of politics.
The important difference was that his newly opened branch would not go bust.
Consistency is the favourite word of those closest to the new Labour leader.
He was appropriately generous in his tributes yesterday to Mr Neil Kinnock.
But his friends saw no contradiction in emphasising that his Europeanism and
his preference for a mixed over a command economy were grounded in long-held
conviction. There were none of the belated conversions that made Mr Kinnock
such an easy target.
With a cynicism explicable only in a party that has lost four successive
elections, one or two took the comparison further. Mrs Margaret Thatcher had
won the trust of the electorate because she was unshakable in her core
beliefs. Mr Smith would prove himself equally resolute.
By contrast, recent events had shown Mr Major as a leader of straw whose
course would be mapped out by events. Just like poor Mr Kinnock.
Mr Smith does not have to rely on fanciful parallels to feel content.
The National Executive election results more than compensated for the
awkward headlines generated by Mr Bryan Gould's abrupt departure from the
shadow cabinet over Europe.
Mr Gould left the NEC alongside the unreconstructable Mr Dennis Skinner.
In their place are Mr Smith's acolytes Messrs Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.
He now has unprecedented power bases spanning the shadow cabinet and the
NEC.
His grip will be further tightened by the creation of a new joint committee
charged with all initial policymaking.
Within two or three years the party's awkward squads may discover that they
are powerless to embarrass the leadership by forcing it to accept new
commitments from the floor of conference.
The proposed concentration of power has slipped by unnoticed in Blackpool.
Unsure whether to celebrate the crisis in Mr Major's government or to mourn
the April election result, delegates have opted for respectful compliance.
Mr Smith has taken full advantage. An overwhelming endorsement of his
instinctive Europeanism and the comfortable defeat of calls for new
commitments to the welfare state or to economic interventionism have left
him free to redraw Labour's policies in his own image.
Yet for all that, it is impossible to miss the uncomfortable atmosphere of
uncertainty that creeps into any conversation on whether Mr Smith can win
rather than wound.
What should have been the most important debate of the week - the
post-mortem on the party's defeat - was a deliberately cursory affair
sandwiched between the debates on Europe and the economy.
A few desultory exchanges saw the ritual criticism of the tabloid press,
some soul-searching about the triumphalism of the party's Sheffield rally,
and a few words about the need to reassure women voters.
No one, least of all Mr Smith, has been ready to debate the fundamental
reasons why Labour lost.
Its image as the party of the downwardly mobile and the voters' mistrust of
its economic and tax policies have been brushed to one side.
So, too, have the profound implications of the electorate's perception that
the Conservatives are now the party of opportunity.
Nor does the Labour leadership seem willing or able to confront the conflict
between its formal links with the producers in the trades unions and a
recognition that it must restyle itself as the champion of the consumer.
The blue-suited trades unionists who delivered their block votes to Mr Smith
this week look like men confident they will keep a grip on the levers of the
power.
Mr John Edmonds of the GMB has been curtly dismissive of talk of changing
the relationship between Labour and its paymasters. Mr Edmonds and his
colleagues will accept reform but not divorce or separation. Mr Smith seems
disinclined to press them.
The new leader may yet surprise us. Those close to him insist that
consistency does not exclude radicalism. There will be policies to go with
the values. But he cannot afford to spend too long in the foothills.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party At Blackpool: Activists protest over policy
plans - Delegates denounce joint policy committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTITUENCY activists embarrassed the party leadership yesterday with a
fierce, but ultimately unsuccessful, protest over plans for streamlining the
party's policy-making process.
Proposals backed by Mr John Smith for reducing the size of the new National
Policy Forum and imposing a Joint Policy Committee, chaired by himself, to
oversee the forum's work, were denounced as centralist and an assault on the
role of conference.
Left-wing delegates also tried to commit Labour firmly to clause four of the
party's constitution on state ownership but were defeated on a card vote by
4.3m votes to 1m.
During an uncomfortable debate for Mr Smith, a succession of delegates
called for a rethink of his proposals. But a motion rejecting the plans and
reasserting the right of constituency parties and trade unions to make
policy submissions directly to conference was defeated on a show of hands.
The Joint Policy Committee will be made up of shadow cabinet and National
Executive Committee members. Membership of the National Policy Forum, which
would embark on a rolling policy review programme, would be limited to save
money to a total of 100 from trade unions, constituencies, MPs and MEPs. The
forum was agreed by conference two years ago.
Leading the revolt, Mr Francis Prideaux, of the Westminster North Labour
party, said that the new framework would 'increase the overcentralised power
of the PR consultants inside the leader's office'.
Ms Glenda Weston of Kettering Labour party complained that constituencies
would be under-represented on the forum and that the role of conference
would be 'to rubber-stamp proposals from the NEC and shadow cabinet'.
Mr Issan Ghazni, of the South Nottingham Labour party, said the proposals
were 'designed specifically to put a stranglehold on grassroots policy
development' and transfer power to the 'Labour establishment'. They would
increase bureaucracy and reduce party membership.
Ms Clare Short, a member of the NEC, said constituency parties would in fact
be brought in earlier into policy making with the ability to contribute to
draft policy documents. She described the plans as the 'final part of the
modernisation of our party' - the rejuvenation of local parties.
In the same debate, supporters of the motion on clause four sought to carve
a stronger identity for Labour as a socialist movement.
Mr Michael Mclurg, from Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, said the leadership
was 'riding roughshod over the deeply held convictions and feelings of
ordinary members'.
He said: 'On far too many policies, this party is only a shade different
from the Conservative party.'
Mr Mike Green, from Northavon, said the redistribution of wealth was
essential to pay for improvements in society. 'Let us tell it straight.
Those who have got lots of money are going to have to pay.'
Ms Teresa Pearce of Erith and Crayford Labour party, said Labour's failure
to convey a strong image contributed to its election defeats. 'The Tories
were out there making political speeches and we were messing about with
balloons.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party At Blackpool: Smith spells out vision of
government - Leader's speech redefines movement's values and party's mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTION to help industry, boost the housing market, preserve strategic assets
such as coal, and the positive promotion of opportunities to overcome
discrimination were included in Mr John Smith's programme for an 'active
government' in his first conference speech as Labour leader.
Labour stood for the government taking responsibility, 'not pointing the
finger at somebody else'. Active government lay 'at the very heart of a
fair, a prosperous and a free society,' Mr Smith said.
But he said government should not run people's lives. 'Government need not
run companies or small businesses, but it must create the conditions for
them to prosper.'
Seeking to redefine Labour's mission after its fourth successive election
defeat, Mr Smith argued that the party had been 'born out of the
determination of ordinary citizens to play their full part in society, to
claim for themselves the opportunities enjoyed by others, opportunities of
individual advancement and fulfilment that they had previously been denied'.
Labour was a vehicle for individual aspirations, he explained.
Those who had written off the party after April 'were wrong not merely
because the Tory dream has turned into a nightmare. They were wrong because
they failed to understand the enduring values of our movement.'
Labour's commission on social justice was the first serious attempt since
Beveridge to find ways of dealing with deep social ills. 'Income, wealth
distribution, poverty, social welfare policy and taxation are all
interlinked.'
Mr Smith denounced the government's vision of individuals as consumers and
Mr John Major's desire to see the 'privatisation of choice'. The result was
a society 'shaped to answer financial demand, not social need. It's a
society that respects purchasing power, not individual rights.'
Sterling's weakness on foreign exchange markets 'was not the work of weeks -
it was the result of years of economic error compounded by mismanagement. It
has left the pound, not top of the pile, but as the one currency that no one
wants to hold.'
Market forces had to serve society's needs. 'And if the market system
becomes an agent of speculation and stagnation instead of an engine for
prosperity, then it is time for governments to act.'
Mr Smith wanted a government 'acting to help industry, create jobs, boost
the housing market. Not sitting on its hands waiting for those green shoots
to sprout.'
He said active government was also about protecting important resources.
An active government would involve 'efficient and caring' public services,
environmental protection and a strengthening of workers' rights, including a
minimum wage, he said.
Government also had responsibility to ensure everyone could contribute to
public life. 'It is not enough to make discrimination illegal. An active
government must positively promote opportunities for all our citizens in
every aspect of public life.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party At Blackpool: Drastic cuts urged as
financial strain begins to show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFERENCE DELEGATES up to and including frontbench spokespeople are being
billed for their photocopies and faxes by Labour's resource office this
week. It is a small but telling example of how the party's financial crisis
is biting.
With membership both of the trade unions and the party itself still falling,
putting income under strain, an NEC report approved yesterday calls for
administration costs to be slashed by 30 per cent from 1991 levels, with
'even more drastic' cuts to follow in 1993.
'The general election defeat has left the Labour party with probably the
most serious financial crisis in its history,' the document states. It was
an effective way to sober up an audience intoxicated by Mr John Smith's
debut conference address as party leader.
Outlining the report, Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North and conference
chair, explained the gravity of Labour's position, saying: 'We are not
talking about the normal financial problems we have encountered over the
years.'
If conference failed to approve an increase in membership subscriptions, he
said: 'I will immediately have to look for further staff reductions and
reductions in activity.
The rigour of the cost-cutting programme also reflected the need to achieve
surpluses in the early part of the parliamentary cycle to enable the party
to afford extra spending in the next general-election run-up.
Having endured a string of combative speeches arguing against the proposed
Pounds 3 increase to Pounds 18 in individual subscriptions, the NEC will not
know until today - when the ballots have been counted  - whether its
recommendation has been accepted.
The upward trend in subscription charges certainly goes against the
long-term wishes of many senior party figures as well as the grass roots. It
was billed by Mr Evans as 'a holding exercise' pending a longer-term
assessment of the subscription structure.
Earlier, Mr Sam McCluskie, the NEC's gruff retiring treasurer, gave an
equally glum assessment of the party's position, saying it had to 'face up
to the fact' that its income could not 'continue to maintain an organisation
at the current levels'.
Supported by Mr Jimmy Knapp, an honorary auditor, he presented accounts
showing that Labour made a bigger-than-expected Pounds 1.33m loss on
everyday spending in 1991 - its ninth such deficit in 11 years.
That almost doubled the cumulative end-1991 deficit in the party's general
fund to Pounds 2.9m - the largest ever.
To cover its losses, the party negotiated an extra loan facility of Pounds
600,000 from the Co-operative Bank, which it has been repaying at a rate of
Pounds 50,000 a month since the general election in April.
Notes to the 1991 accounts show that bank charges and interest payments,
even without that burden, climbed more than 60 per cent to Pounds 187,000
from Pounds 116,000 a year before.
They also indicate that membership processing costs trebled year-on-year to
Pounds 498,000 (Pounds 161,000).
During yesterday's sombre debate, the leadership even had to endure a salvo
from the party's hard left in the shape of Mr Ted Knight, former Lambeth
council leader.
Referring to large sums designated in the accounts as unitemised other
expenses, Mr Knight questioned how much of those funds had been earmarked
for internal party investigations.
'How much is it costing the party to investigate, to expel, to suspend and
in many ways demoralise members of the Labour party?' he asked. 'If we want
to save some money, stop witch-hunting Labour party members.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Sharp rise in company failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS failures in the third quarter of this year rose by 53 per cent
compared with the corresponding period last year, according to figures
released today. They highlight the continuing sharp impact of the recession,
especially on smaller companies.
According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information company, the 46,545
failures in the first nine months of the year means the total figure for
1991 has almost been surpassed already.
In the third quarter, 15,823 businesses failed, compared with 10,371 in the
corresponding period last year. The total for the first nine months was 39
per cent up on the 33,532 recorded during the January-September period in
1991.
Last year saw 47,777 business failures, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. That
itself was the biggest number recorded by the company since it started
keeping the statistics in 1980.
Since the start of this year, on average, more than 1,220 businesses have
collapsed each week.
Of the total, two out of three have been bankruptcies of partnerships or
traders, indicating how small businesses have suffered worse in the
recession than big ones.
The rest of the failures have mainly been liquidations of relatively large
limited companies.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet says many small companies have been forced to go under
because of the chain reaction of cuts in orders from large companies and
'harsh competitive conditions' caused by high interest rates and large
company debts. It says the weak state of the economy seems likely to
'continue to devastate the small-business community' for some time.
The south-east, excluding London, has accounted for roughly a quarter of the
business failures so far this year. The total of 10,375 in the region
represents an increase of more than 50 per cent on the equivalent period
last year.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Machine tool sector gloom deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE worldwide recession in the machine tool industry has claimed another UK
victim with the appointment of administrative receivers at Coventry-based
Wickman Machine Tool Manufacturing.
Mr Maurice Withall and Mr Roy Welsby of Grant Thornton are seeking
purchasers for a company that, in its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, was
Europe's largest manufacturer of multi-spindle automatics, used for
high-volume production of turned parts by the automotive and other
industries.
The receivership is the third in the UK machine tool industry this summer,
and will increase the industry's frustration at the government's attitude
towards manufacturing industry and the lack of fiscal stimuli to investment
in new capital equipment.
It also underlines the severity of the present machine tool recession, which
has hit machine tool makers in Japan, the US and continental Europe.
Wickman employed more than 400 people at its peak but that has now fallen to
58, including 15 employees made redundant before the receivership
appointment, Grant Thornton said.
The receivers are offering the business and assets as a going concern, and a
two-day auction starts today at Wickman's Banner Lane plant to sell 3,000
lots of surplus stock and equipment.
Wickman was founded before the second world war by Axel Wickman, a former
Alfred Herbert apprentice who developed a wide product range of
multi-spindle automatics before selling the company to John Brown in the
1950s.
The company continued to thrive until the early 1980s, when, under new
ownership, it ran into difficulty seeking business in the Soviet Union and
spent heavily on a new range of computer numerically controlled
single-spindle automatics. It continued to lose ground during the 1980s and,
according to one observer, was unable to generate enough volume to withstand
a business downturn.
In the 16 months to December 1990, the company had sales of Pounds 26m and
net profit of Pounds 2.6m. By December last year, annual turnover had fallen
to Pounds 12m, yielding a Pounds 500,000 profit.
Nevertheless, Wickman has several attractions for a potential purchaser.
Apart from a skilled workforce and a quality reputation, earlier this year
it launched a range of multi-spindle automatics incorporating the latest
technology.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Personal loans up as businesses repay debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES continued to repay debt in the three months to the end of August,
according to figures from the British Bankers' Association, which represents
the nine biggest UK commercial banks. The figures underline the weakness in
economic activity among businesses.
The repayments were offset by a rise of Pounds 2.7bn in borrowing by
individuals, mainly for house purchases, which the association thinks was
largely due to the rush to beat last month's deadline on the reintroduction
of stamp duty on all house sales.
In the three months to August 31, construction companies repaid Pounds 657m.
Other repayments came from hotel and catering groups (Pounds 410m) and
property companies (Pounds 274m).
Taking into account the activities of companies and consumers, total net
lending on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis during the three months grew
Pounds 2.3bn, as against Pounds 862m in the three months to the end of May.
Seasonally adjusted, the two figures are Pounds 2.9bn and Pounds 3.1bn
respectively.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Falling pound prompts increase in gilt sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS financial instit-utions sold gilts worth Pounds 1.3bn last month as
they worried about the falling pound, the Bank of England said yesterday.
It was by far the largest monthly selling of gilts by non-UK institutions
since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990.
It indicates that such groups may be averse to buying large stocks of
government bonds now the pound is floating outside the ERM.
Last month the government sold Pounds 1.2bn worth of gilts, taking into
account redemptions.
The state of corporate finances improved in the second quarter although
industrial and commercial companies continued to run a financial deficit.
Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday
showed a financial deficit of Pounds 2bn in the second quarter compared with
Pounds 4.3bn in the first. Gross trading profits of the corporate sector,
net of stock appreciation, were Pounds 20.5bn, more than Pounds 1bn higher
than the first quarter.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Thrift stays firmly in fashion: Emma Tucker draws
international comparisons for savings ratios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL fall in personal-sector savings in the second quarter will have
provided scant comfort for Britain's hard-pressed retailers.
For almost two years shop owners have watched consumers make the repayment
of debt - which official figures count as savings - a priority. The result,
along with the sharpest fall in consumer borrowing since the mid 1970s, is
that net savings - defined as the difference between consumer income and
consumption - has risen to levels not seen since 1982.
In the face of the rise and complaints from retailers that the government
has made saving too attractive with high interest rates and the introduction
of tax-exempt savings accounts, international comparisons show that the UK
remains a country with relatively low personal-sector savings.
Measures of household savings can be easily distorted - for example, by the
failure to standardise the measurement of public and private pension schemes
 -but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publishes a
series of harmonised international comparisons.
They indicate that Japan is a country with high household savings, in the US
and the UK people are disinclined to save, and France and Germany come
somewhere in between.
Several theories have been put forward to explain the differences between
countries. They include:
Demographics: Young populations tend to save while ageing populations do
not. That factor is expected to exert a strong downward pressure on the
level of household savings in Japan, which will move from being one of the
youngest OECD populations to the second-oldest by 2025.
Tax systems: The bias in Japan has been towards savings, whereas tax systems
in the UK and many Scandinavian countries have traditionally favoured
borrowers through tax deductions on the interest paid on loans.
In the UK, that includes income tax relief on mortgage borrowing, which,
although frozen in recent years, remains a strong incentive to borrow to buy
a house.
Monetary policy: In countries where real interest rates have been negative
and inflation volatile, it has often made more sense to invest in assets,
such as houses, than to save money in bonds or building societies.
In Germany, where the savings ratio is high and relatively stable, buying a
house is not seen as a way to wealth.
Social security: The extent of state welfare provision is said to influence
the level of savings. The argument runs that where social security systems
are not highly developed, people save more as an insurance against
misfortune.
That may contribute to the high level of savings in Japan for example, and
the very low, even negative savings ratio in Sweden, where the state
provides extensive social security.
Expectations in the UK that the savings ratio will remain at its present
level are based on the assumption that burgeoning household debt and high
real interest rates will continue to encourage people to pay back debt and
save money rather than to borrow in order to spend.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank, says: 'I think the savings ratio will come down slightly over the next
couple of years, but not towards the low levels of the 1980s. Households
still have too much debt and real interest rates are sufficiently high to
deter people from borrowing.'
Although that may not be welcome news to retailers, it may benefit the
economy in the long run.
One consequence of low consumer spending is that inflationary pressures will
be lower. That should allow interest rates to come down faster, thereby
lowering the cost of capital for industry.
Another advantage of a high and stable savings rate is that it is more
likely to foster stability than the high levels of borrowing in the 1980s.
Those ultimately proved unsustainable and contributed to the sharp drop in
economic activity at the end of the decade from which the country has yet to
recover.
REAL personal disposable income fell by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter
compared with the first, but rose by 0.8 per cent compared with the same
quarter a year ago.
Central Statistical Office seasonally adjusted figures also show that the
savings ratio, which measures personal savings as a percentage of total
personal disposable income, dropped from 11 per cent in the first quarter to
10.3 per cent in the second quarter.
The quarterly fall is not expected to be repeated as rising unemployment and
the high levels of household debt probably exerted a cautionary influence
over consumers in the third quarter.
The fall in the ratio resulted largely from postponed spending because
Easter was late this year. In the third and fourth quarters of last year the
ratio was also 10.3 per cent.

A TELEVISION researcher who worked on a controversial documentary that
alleged systematic collusion between members of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and loyalist paramilitary death squads today faces a charge of
perjury.
Mr Ben Hamilton, who worked for Box Productions which made The Committee for
the Channel 4 Dispatches series, was arrested at his home in north London
yesterday.
Scotland Yard said he would appear today before Horseferry Road magistrates
on one count of perjury allegedly committed on or before July 28 this year
at the Royal Courts of Justice, in The Strand, London.
Channel 4 and Box were fined Pounds 75,000 in the summer for contempt of
court for refusing to reveal the identity of the informant who had made the
allegations against the RUC.
The Committee alleged that an organisation of 60 people plotted and carried
out 20 sectarian killings over two years.
Channel 4 said yesterday: 'Ben Hamilton's arrest at 6.30 this morning
suggests that dawn raids against journalists are back in fashion.'

Other large lenders, including Halifax and Abbey National, have cut their

the 1-point cut in the base rate to 9 per cent.
New customers will benefit immediately but Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's cut

TSB, the sixth-largest UK bank, has also cut its mortgage rate to 9.95 per

FT  30 SEP 92 / Defence overhaul axes 2,000 staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 2,000 defence research employees, mainly in the south of England, will
lose their jobs in an overhaul of the network of government-owned
facilities.
Plans announced yesterday by the Defence Research Agency involve abandoning
17 sites, almost a third of the total. About 400 jobs are expected to go in
the Portsmouth area of Hampshire, 350 in Dorset and 320 around the DRA's
headquarters at Farnborough, Hampshire. It will bring the total employed by
the agency to about 9,500.
The cuts, to be completed over the next two to three years, come on top of
more than 7,000 job losses announced by private-sector defence contractors
so far this year.
The DRA, set up last April with the aim of putting defence research on a
more cost-effective footing, said the measures were intended to save Pounds
90m a year in running costs. Mr John Chisholm, chief executive, said the DRA
needed 'radical' measures to ensure its future viability.
The DRA was formed as a semi-autonomous agency to take over the activities
of four Ministry of Defence units - the Royal Aerospace Establishment, the
Admiralty Research Establishment, the Royal Armament Research and
Development Establishment and the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment. The
agency said all had overlapping support and administrative services.
It plans to concentrate on 12 main sites that have been earmarked for
'significant investment', including Farnborough and Fort Halstead in Kent.
However, there would be 'substantial consolidation' at three of the sites,
at Bromley in Kent, West Drayton, near London, and Farnborough itself, where
more land would be offered for sale.
The cuts, which had been awaiting ministerial approval, will now be
discussed with the unions involved.
The DRA said it would also begin 'market-testing' whether some of its
activities could be hived off. Some jobs from the axed facilities will also
be transferred to other sites, including one at Winfrith in Dorset belonging
to the Atomic Energy Agency where the DRA would be a tenant.
Unions said the closures and job losses would 'throw Britain's finest skills
on the dole and disband world-beating research and development teams'.
Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU general union and spokesman for the seven unions
in the Defence Research Agency, said: 'Our members were beating swords into
ploughshares. Now they face the sack because the Treasury wants cuts in the
MoD budget.'
Mr Derrick Baker, of the GMB general union, said: 'The language of the
market is not appropriate for research centres.' He added that the
commitment to consult the workforce was worthless if the decisions had
already been made.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Open justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, warned judges yesterday that they would
have to cut the length of custodial sentences or the new provisions of the
Criminal Justice Act would result in a 'bulge in the prison population',
Robert Rice writes.
At the second of what, in the interests of more user-friendly justice, he
hopes will become regular press conferences, Lord Taylor said he would be
issuing a practice direction to judges on Thursday when the act comes into
force.
Under the act, judges will have to take account of the actual time likely to
be served when passing sentence. Lord Taylor said: 'There is a very real
risk that if judges continue to sentence on the scale of the past, some
prisoners may serve longer than they would have done under the old regime.'
Under the old regime, a person sentenced to three years would be eligible
for parole after serving a year. At most with remission they would serve
only two years. Under the new act they must serve at least half their
sentence before release on licence. Lord Taylor said: 'If we are not careful
we will have a bulge in the prison population.'
Effectively, judges would have to pass shorter sentences, although another
object of the act was to ensure that violent and sex offenders served
longer.
Lord Taylor dismissed the idea of an independent inspectorate of judges,
which has been proposed by Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar. That was
not because judges should be beyond criticism but because such a system
might threaten the independence of the judiciary.

<TEXT>
A GROUP portrait of John Cotes and six of his eight sons by John Devis, the
18th-century artist who popularised family portraiture in England, sold for
Pounds 88,000 to a London dealer yesterday at a sale of the contents of
Pitchford Hall, Shropshire.
It was the highest price paid at the two-day auction, which went ahead when
the government refused to buy the 16th-century listed timber-framed house
and its contents for Pounds 1.8m. The Colthurst family needed the money to
meet debts incurred at Lloyd's of London.
The auction, organised by Christie's, totalled about Pounds 1.5m, near the
top of Christie's estimate, even though four lots - including some of the
more important early family portraits - were withdrawn before the auction
for private sale to national museums. The house will now be sold.
The Cotes lived at Pitchford in the 19th century. Another John Cotes,
portrayed by Thomas Weaver in 1809 giving instructions to his bailiff, went
for Pounds 46,200.
The London dealer Partridge was an enthusiastic bidder, acquiring a Regency
mahogany four-pedestal table for Pounds 46,200, twice its estimate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE round-table talks on Northern Ireland's political future resume in
Belfast today amid signs that positions in the nationalist and unionist
camps are hardening, and that the news blackout imposed at the beginning of
the process is breaking down.
Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic Labour party,
speaking on Irish radio yesterday, dismissed as 'gamesmanship' and 'point
scoring' unionist insistence that the Irish Republic drop its territorial
claim to Northern Ireland, enshrined in its constitution, before any further
progress at the talks can be made.
The hardline Democratic Unionist party boycotted the Dublin phase of the
talks last week, arguing that the Irish government had not shown any
flexibility on the issue. The Ulster Unionist party attended the talks but
little headway appeared to have been achieved.
Mr Hume said the unionist position 'is not facing up to the real problem
which is 'how do we live together in this island and how do we respect our
differences?''.
He added: 'If we were playing the same game, I would be demanding that the
British constitution be changed because it is an extremely sectarian
constitution. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. Church of
England bishops have seats as of right in the House of Lords.'
He also ruled out power sharing or majority rule as possible solutions that
might emerge from the talks. Mr Hulme said that Northern Ireland 'is not a
natural political entity because it was unnaturally drawn, the normal
political standards do not work . . . that is a self-evident truth . . . We
are not going to give back power to the unionists, full stop.'
The Stormont parliament was dissolved in 1972, when direct rule from
Westminster was introduced after the breakdown of law and order in the
province. The SDLP proposal is for a commission of six people to govern the
province, including representation from Dublin and the EC. The unionists
have rejected that.
The DUP said at the weekend it would abandon the talks entirely after
November 16 - the date set for the next Anglo-Irish Conference meeting
between the British and Irish governments - if agreement between the four
Ulster parties and the two governments could not be reached by then. It
would attend talks in Belfast this week only if the Republic's
constitutional claim was being dealt with 'seriously'.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Sterling's decline helps oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in the value of sterling after the UK's withdrawal from the
European exchange rate mechanism might add Pounds 2.5m a day to the output
of the UK oil industry, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland's monthly
oil index.
The recent rise in the dollar - the currency in which oil is traded - has
produced an 'almost complete about-turn' in the fortunes of the North Sea
oil industry, the bank's economists said.
In August, output rose by 2.6 per cent to just under 1.9m barrels a day, but
that was more than offset by a 3 per cent fall in oil prices to just under
Dollars 20 a barrel and a 1.2 per cent weakening of the dollar-sterling
exchange rate.
However, August's production at today's prices would have been worth Pounds
2.5m a day more - at Pounds 21.7m - leading the bank to have a very positive
view of likely output value in September and October.
The possible strengthening of international oil prices this winter might
increase output value even more. Many analysts are forecasting a tight oil
market, with an increase in demand.
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed earlier this month
to freeze its output at its August level in the fourth quarter. Also, some
forecasters are predicting an unusually cold winter, which would also push
up oil prices.
The Royal Bank of Scotland said: 'The result will be a welcome fillip to UK
oil revenues - and particularly to those oil companies which have been
suffering earlier this year.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / Call for shake-up of auditing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN SHOULD create an independent agency to appoint and oversee the work
of auditors of large companies, according to a study sponsored by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
The report, by three academics, also called for auditors' responsibilities
to be extended beyond existing shareholders of companies, and for them to
detect material fraud.
The radical conclusions by Mr Christopher Humphrey and Mr Stuart Turley, of
Manchester University, and Mr Peter Moizer, of Leeds University, are likely
to prove embarrassing to the institute, which has argued strongly for the
retention of self-regulation through its own organisation.
The findings follow a detailed analysis of the 'expectations gap' - the
difference between the service non-auditors expect and which auditors
provide. The study says the gap has existed since at least the end of the
last century and auditors have tended to believe the fault lies with public
ignorance of their role.
The study argues there is an enduring expectation that auditors should
detect material fraud and that auditors should respond by accepting this
role, even though there would be an effect on fees charged.
It says that there should be an 'office for auditing' to oversee auditors of
companies, with appointments and the setting of fee levels taken out of the
hands of directors on whom they are reporting.
The study also suggest that auditors' responsibilties should extend beyond
existing shareholders to potential shareholders and existing and potential
creditors.
Mr Henry Gold, technical director at the institute, welcomed some of the
findings but said it was 'less confident' about the recommendations for an
'office for auditing' and to develop more explicit responsibility for fraud
detection.
He said the argument for independent regulation was not developed in
sufficient detail to analyse its effectiveness.

THE Bank of Canada pushed domestic interest rates up sharply yesterday in an
attempt to brake a sharp fall in the Canadian dollar.
The Canadian currency began sliding in early September but the fall has
accelerated in the past two weeks, first in response to the turmoil in
international financial markets, and more recently on fears that voters will
reject proposals for a new Canadian constitution in a referendum scheduled
for October 26.
The drop in the dollar led the Bank of Canada to lift its overnight call
rate by 3 percentage points yesterday morning to 7.75 per cent. Commercial
banks have not yet raised their lending rates, however. Their prime rate is
currently at 6.25 per cent.
Based on yesterday's peak in money market rates, the prime rate should be in
the 7.5-8 per cent range. But no bank wants to be first to reverse a
two-year decline in rates, and the banks are also unsure how long the upturn
in money-market rates will last. By late yesterday the Bank of Canada had
lowered its call rate again below 6 per cent.
The dollar, which was trading at almost 84 US cents at the end of August,
has fallen by 2 cents in the past two days. It tumbled as low as 79.27 US
cents yesterday, its lowest level since early 1988 and some 11 per cent
below the peak reached in November 1991, before staging a partial recovery
following the jump in interest rates to close at 79.94 cents.
'The markets are starting to build in the worst-case scenario of the country
breaking up,' the chief economist of one Toronto securities firm said
yesterday.
Recent public opinion polls show that opponents of the constitutional deal
have a clear lead in Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. Mr Brian
Mulroney, prime minister, warned earlier this week that a No vote would mean
'the beginning of the process of dismantling Canada'.
With inflation in Canada running at an annual rate slightly above 1 per
cent, most economists are confident that interest rates will drop back once
the political uncertainty and international currency upheaval is over.
Goldman Sachs in New York told clients earlier this week that recent turmoil
in Canadian financial markets 'may be overdone'. The firm said that even in
the event of a No vote, 'nothing happens - at least immediately - and we
simply revert to the status quo of the last few years'.
Although opponents of the constitutional deal, known as the Charlottetown
Agreement, have made a strong showing in the early stages of the referendum
campaign, most commentators expect the Yes campaign to catch up in coming
weeks.
The constitutional reforms would be the most far-reaching changes to
Canada's system of government since the federation was formed 125 years ago.
They include changing the Senate from an appointed to an elected house,
giving wider powers to provincial governments, and recognising the right to
self-government for Canada's 600,000 aboriginal people. Quebec would gain
the right to 'preserve and promote' its distinct identity.
Some experts contend that the resource-rich prairie provinces and the less
well-off regions of Atlantic Canada will gain extra clout in Ottawa through
the revamped Senate.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Arms treaty clears last obstacle to ratification
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) yesterday passed its last big
hurdle before ratification, when the US Senate defeated an attempt by six
right-wing Republicans to block passage, writes George Graham in Washington.
While Start has already been superseded in many respects by the more radical
bilateral nuclear arms cuts agreed by President George Bush and President
Boris Yeltsin at their summit in Washington in June, the administration has
argued that its ratification is still important, both because the June
agreement builds on Start's warhead cuts and because of the verification
procedures it sets up.
But Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, with five other Republicans, had
complained the treaty had too many loopholes - particularly the exclusion of
mobile missile launchers. The Senate swept his objections aside with an 87-6
procedural vote, clearing the way for ratification before Congress adjourns
next week.
Under Start the US would have to cut its strategic nuclear warheads to about
8,550 by 1999, while Russia would cut back to about 6,450 strategic
warheads. The subsequent reductions agreed in June will further lower the
number of warheads to 3,800-4,250 apiece by 1999, and to 3,000-3,500 by
2003.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Washington seeks shift in IADB role: Risk to democracy in
Latin America and Caribbean sparks loan proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration has proposed a radical shift in the role of the
InterAmerican Development Bank, suggesting it lend without protection of
government guarantees and urging a big expansion in lending to attack
poverty and poor social conditions.
The proposals, according to US officials, are meant to address concerns in
Washington about the risks to democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean
should the benefits of the emerging economic recovery in the region not be
distributed among the population.
The US, the largest shareholder in the bank, also indicated its willingness
to explore a 'healthy increase' in the bank's capital resources to sustain
its lending 'indefinitely'.
The officials said this would mean that capital increases after the next
would not be automatic, as in the past, but would depend on need, a similar
arrangement to that of the World Bank.
The previous capital increase of Dollars 26.5bn (Pounds 15.4bn), agreed in
1989, was meant to support the bank until the end of 1993. This has allowed
the IADB, under its president Enrique Iglesias, to raise its lending to
about Dollars 7bn a year.
The proposals also suggest diverting more of the bank's resources to the
region's poorer economies. The bigger economies, which now dominate the
bank's lending policies, will be expected to rely increasingly on
private-sector capital inflows.
Reflecting concern that the bank's policy of lending only with a government
guarantee could discourage privatisation, the US has called for the IADB to
explore the possibility of lending, for a transitional period, to
just-privatised companies.
The proposals were contained in a little-noticed speech this month by Mr
Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury. Mr Wethington said in an interview that it should be possible to
complete negotiations on a capital increase next summer, in time to include
it in the fiscal 1995 budget.
He said the proposals had broad support in Washington.
Mr Wethington, who would not be drawn on what he considered an appropriate
capital increase, said there had been strong support from Latin America. US
officials said Brazil, Argentina and Chile had all indicated they backed the
proposals.
The US suggestions also include the merging of the IADB's private-sector
arm, the InterAmerican Investment Corporation, into the bank proper and that
the Multilateral Investment Fund, set up last year to encourage investment
reform, should also be integrated into the bank.
Future capital increases for the IIC should be provided by the bank. Some
European governments whose shareholdings in the IIC are larger than those in
the IADB are concerned that this would dilute their influence.
The US has also called for a strong reorientation of the bank's priorities
towards ensuring that 'economic opportunity and government services are
broadly distributed'. This would include a broad attack on poverty. Fifty
per cent of the bank's lending should therefore support 'economic
opportunity, social sector development and governance objectives in all
borrowing member countries'.
The US also proposes that:
Thirty per cent of the bank's lending should support traditional
infrastructure, which in many countries is a big constraint on economic
development.
So-called policy-based lending - balance of payment finance to support
specific policy reforms - should be reduced to 15 per cent of total lending.
Many larger borrowing countries that have already opened their economies are
expected to have less need for such finance. There is now a 25 per cent
limit on such lending.
The bank's concessional loans arm, the Fund for Special Operations, should
be restructured to offer interest support on bank loans, rather than act as
a direct lender as at present.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Brazilians celebrate vote to impeach Collor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<DATELINE>
   BRASILIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Brazilians poured on to the streets of Brasilia, the capital,
last night, firing rockets in celebration after a landslide congressional
vote in favour of impeaching President Fernando Collor de Mello for
corruption.
The scene was repeated in state capitals throughout the country as Brazil
registered relief at the end to months of uncertainty which has unnerved the
financial markets and severely impaired the president's ability to govern.
Mr Collor, who took office in March 1990 as the first directly elected
president for 30 years, becomes the country's first head of state to face an
impeachment trial. He will now be suspended from office for up to 180 days
while he is tried by the Senate on charges that he profited from a
multi-million dollar corruption scam. His lawyers are preparing an appeal.
Mr Itamar Franco, the vice-president, will take over. He faces a tough task
in trying to reduce the inflation rate from over 20 per cent a month but the
backing of a wide coalition of opposition parties from both left and right
will initially help him to push important projects through Congress.
Nine ministers in Mr Collor's cabinet resigned last night following the
vote, including Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the much-respected economy
minister, and the foreign and justice ministers. The rest are expected to
follow, allowing Mr Franco to appoint a new cabinet which, however, is not
likely to include Mr Moreira. Mr Franco will today meet leaders from the
main opposition parties who have led the impeachment campaign to discuss
policy.
Inside a packed Congress the mood was jubilant as vote after vote was
registered in favour of Mr Collor's impeachment. As the 336th vote was
registered, signifying that Mr Collor had been defeated, an enormous cheer
went up on the floor and there was a standing ovation along the galleries on
which were gathered state governors, union and political leaders. The house
stopped for an emotional rendering of the national anthem.
Earlier in the day Mr Collor's advisers had been so confident he would
survive that a victory speech was prepared. But once voting started it was
clear the tide was going against him and the main Sao Paulo market closed
7.7 per cent up on the assumption he would be defeated.
Many Collor supporters switched sides and after 137 minutes the voting
closed with 441 votes in favour of impeachment and only 38 against.
Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest state, said
after the result: 'We must now institutionalise these lessons so this never
happens to Brazil again.'
The 43-year-old former governor of Alagoas state had been elected,
ironically, on an anti-corruption platform. His downfall was prompted by
charges by his brother Pedro that he was running a corruption scam, an
accusation against which he has presented no real defence.

<TEXT>
US personnel pull out today from the Philippines' Subic Naval Base, the
largest American overseas military facility, as part of a process that puts
an end to a 45-year military presence.
At its busiest in the late 1980s Subic, which served as repair and supply
centre for the US Seventh Fleet, was home to more than 6,000 staff and
troops and 5,000 or so dependents. A year ago the Philippine Senate voted
down a treaty that would have given the bases another 10 years.
American spending from the bases represented about 5 per cent of Philippine
gross national product, but many argued it distorted growth.
The remaining 1,000 base staff are moving to Cubi Point, an adjacent naval
air station where the final goodbyes are due in November. An agency formed
by Philippine civilian and military officials will now operate the Subic
facility.
The Philippines continues to have a mutual defence treaty with Washington,
and Mr Richard Solomon, the new American ambassador to Manila, said
yesterday that the US was ready to work out a new arrangement which could
include joint military training and intelligence gathering.
The physical infrastructure facilities in the 55,000 acre Subic site are,
meanwhile, attracting investors from Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong
Kong. Its deep harbour and airstrip offer easy transport. It has its own
electric power generator that could shield industries from the pernicious
power cuts in Manila.
A Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority will oversee the transformation of the
base area into an industrial enclave.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Rome 'aware of BNL Iraq loans': CIA reports quoted in
Atlanta court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US federal judge presiding over the case of more than Dollars 5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) yesterday revealed that three reports by
the Central Intelligence Agency 'definitely' show that the bank's head
office in Rome was aware of the Atlanta loans.
Judge Marvin Shoob made the revelation, which was entered into the public
records last night, during a conference in court with US prosecutors and the
lawyer representing Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta branch
manager who faces a jail sentence.
The judge's disclosure marks the first time a US official has quoted secret
CIA reports in court that show BNL's head office to have been involved in
the Iraqi loans scandal. Two former BNL executives had previously told the
FT it was untrue that Mr Drogoul acted without Rome's approval.
The central premise of the US government's case against Mr Drogoul is that
he was the sole orchestrator of the loans, which helped to finance President
Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects.
Judge Shoob said in court yesterday that the CIA reports that he had read
'definitely do support the defendant's position that BNL Rome was aware of
what he was doing, and they also undermine the government's position that
this was a lone wolf type operation.'
Earlier Mr Luigi Sardelli, former head of BNL's North American division,
testified he had sent an auditor's report to the bank's Rome headquarters
detailing irregularities in Atlanta in October 1988.
Mr Sardelli said the report, mysteriously, was only brought to the attention
of BNL executives in July 1989, just three weeks before US officials
uncovered the illegal Iraqi loans made through the Atlanta branch. Mr
Sardelli said his warnings were ignored by Mr Giacomo Pedde, former BNL
chief executive.
George Graham adds from Washington: Senator Al Gore, the Democratic
vice-presidential candidate, yesterday launched a swingeing attack on what
has stood as perhaps President Bush's proudest achievement - the Gulf war.
Detailing loan guarantees and technology sales by the Reagan and Bush
administrations that helped Iraq build up its military capability before its
1990 invasion of Kuwait, Mr Gore attacked Mr Bush's foreign policy judgment:
'His poor judgment, moral blindness and bungling policies led directly to a
war that should never have taken place.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit narrowed last month, easing fears that
interest rates would have to rise.
The deficit fell to ADollars 903m (Pounds 380m) in August in seasonally
adjusted terms, from nearly ADollars 1.5bn in July.
The government said the August figure was in line with its budget forecast
that the deficit would rise from ADollars 11.7bn last year to ADollars
15.7bn in the year to next June.
Economists said the figures should end speculation that the Reserve Bank
would raise interest rates from 5.7 per cent to dampen demand for imports.
In seasonally adjusted terms, most of the reduction in the deficit was
caused by an improvement in the trade account, which was in surplus by
ADollars 338m following a deficit of ADollars 104m in July.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Output shows steep monthly fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE industry is facing its stiffest test since the deep recession of
the mid-1970s, according to official figures yesterday showing industrial
production last month was 7.6 per cent lower than a year ago.
It was the 11th successive month in which output was down, the longest
series of falls since the 20-month run of declines between May 1974 and
December 1975. Production was down 3.7 per cent on July, the largest monthly
fall since January 1975.
Government economic policymakers argue that backward-looking indicators such
as industrial production paint too depressed a picture. They stress more
attention should be paid to forward-looking indicators, in the wake of the
boost to business confidence delivered by the announcement in August of a
Y10,700bn (Pounds 52bn) emergency spending package.
Hopes that the economy will be buoyed this autumn by a resurgence in
business confidence was lent support yesterday by a marked improvement in
official indicators used to forecast economic activity three and six months
ahead.
The Economic Planning Agency said its leading indicators of economic
activity leapt to 70 per cent in July, from 46 per cent the month before,
one of the steepest monthly rises recorded.
It was the first time for almost two years that the leading indicators have
risen above 50 per cent, which is interpreted as the dividing line between
growth and decline.
However, EPA officials said the leading indicators combined with indicators
of current and past economic performance still showed the economy in a
slowdown. The leading indicators would need to stay above 50 per cent for
three months before there could be any confidence that an upturn was on the
way.
The collapse of demand was highlighted by the continued rise in industrial
inventories in August. Shipments were 6.8 per cent down on the year before
and so inventories rose by 4.3 per cent. The ratio of inventories to sales
was 10.6 per cent up on the year before.
The continued rise in inventories, despite deep and sustained cuts in
production, makes it increasingly likely that industry will have to start
cutting into labour costs through early retirement and freezes on
recruitment.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Battle looms on Tokyo deficit: Japanese finance minister
rules out special borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese finance minister, yesterday fired an opening
salvo in what is expected to be a protracted battle over how the government
should finance increased public spending to stimulate the economy.
Mr Hata, delivering a lecture in Tokyo, ruled out a return to special
borrowing to finance the Y10,700bn (Pounds 52bn) emergency spending package
announced in August. He also rejected demands from retailers and industrial
leaders for an income tax cut in 1993 to boost flagging consumption.
Mr Hata's remarks are the furthest he has gone in pledging that the ministry
of finance will not allow short-term demands for economic stimulus to
corrupt what officials refer to as the hard-won 'decency of public finance'.
His comments signal an intensification of the political struggle over how
the government should finance higher public spending, which is virtually the
only domestic source of economic growth at the moment.
It is understood the ministry plans only a limited increase in borrowing to
finance the emergency package with a construction bond of between Y1,000bn
and Y2,000bn. Officials believe the rest of the package can be financed if
the ministry is allowed to use all the Y1,500bn tax surplus it has carried
over from last year. It would normally use half the sum to pay off
government debt.
In addition it will seek to trim general government expenditure and finance
most of the package by raising funds from individuals through the post
office savings system.
However, Mr Hata's hard line is an indication of how tricky it will be to
construct a durable consensus between Japan's political leadership and the
various arms of the economic bureaucracy over how higher spending should be
financed.
Ministry hopes of trimming general expenditure are unlikely to bear much
fruit. Departmental requests for the 1993 budget at the end of August are
thought to suggest that general expenditure may increase by 5 per cent,
while the general account, which includes capital spending and local
government transfers, could grow by 7.2 per cent.
However, the ministry's main immediate concern is the way the recession is
eating into tax revenues. In July these were 3.9 per cent down on the year
before, with a 27.1 per cent fall in corporate tax collected and a 23.7 per
cent drop in consumption tax.
Official estimates that this year's tax revenues could fall Y3,000bn to
Y4,000bn short of the budgeted total of Y62,500bn are judged to be too
optimistic by private sector economists.

Taiwan. Singapore's Keppel Corporation wants to set up a ship-repair yard.
South Koreans are also looking at possible locations for light industries,
and there are signs of interest from large Japanese trading houses.

AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit narrowed significantly last month,
easing fears that interest rates would have to rise to head off a balance of
payments crisis.
The deficit fell to ADollars 903m (Pounds 380m) in August in seasonally
adjusted terms, from nearly ADollars 1.5bn in July. The unadjusted deficit
declined from ADollars 2bn to ADollars 1.1bn.
The government said the August figure was in line with its budget forecast
that the deficit would rise from ADollars 11.7bn last year to ADollars
15.7bn in the year to next June, equivalent to 4.1 per cent of forecast
gross domestic product.
'To all the Jeremiahs who were saying a month ago that imports are rising
inextricably again, I think all this proves that you can't put that much
store in one month's numbers,' said Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister.
Economists said the figures should end speculation that the Reserve Bank
would raise shortly official interest rates from 5.7 per cent to dampen
demand for imports.
However, the deficit is likely to widen over the remaining 10 months of the
fiscal year as a result of forecast imports of civil aircraft, liquefied
natural gas tankers and a recently launched telecommunications satellite.
In seasonally adjusted terms, most of the reduction in the deficit was
caused by an improvement in the trade account, which was in surplus by
ADollars 338m following a deficit of ADollars 104m in July.
Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at Bankers Trust, said the value of imports
had probably been inflated by a recent fall in the value of the Australian
dollar.

UNDER multi-coloured umbrellas, Angolans queued yesterday to cast their
votes in the country's first democratic elections.
Voters pouring with sweat and clutching plastic voter identity cards pushed
to get into polling stations in the capital Luanda in festive spirit.
Members of the National Electoral Commission, whose T-shirts depicted a
white dove with ballot paper in its beak, processed voters in an orderly and
professional manner remarkable by most African standards.
Mr Onoffre dos Santos, commission chairman, said yesterday no violent
incidents had marred the first of two days of voting, but a number of
polling stations had not opened by the afternoon in the hotly contested
rural provinces of Uige, Huambo and Malange where difficult logistics could
become the key issue in post-electoral controversy.
In the worst case, in Uige, 160 polling stations out of 450 were still being
installed yesterday after their delivery by helicopter had been delayed.
However, Mr Dos Santos said all 5,800 polling stations would be open today,
and everybody would be able to vote even if it meant keeping polling
stations open tonight. Mr Dos Santos also said turnout had been high,
especially in Luanda.
Many voters appeared confused about how to cast their first ever democratic
vote after decades of Portuguese colonialism and 30 years of civil war.
Electoral commission members, watched by representatives of the political
parties, went through a series of checks against electoral fraud.
Even Unita, the former right-wing rebel movement and the main electoral
opponent against the ruling MPLA government, after consistently warning
against electoral malpractice yesterday gave a cautious preliminary approval
to the first day of voting.

A GENERAL and three bankers who did not stand in this month's Thai general
election have been included in the country's new cabinet, formed yesterday
after more than two weeks of negotiation in the five-party coalition.
General Vichit Sukmak will have to quit the army in order to take up his
cabinet post as defence minister. He is seen as a protege of General Prem
Tinsulanonda, the former prime minister who played a key role behind the
scenes in reducing the power of the group of commanders who staged last
year's coup and attracted mass protests this year.
Of the three bankers Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, president of Siam Commercial
Bank, becomes finance minister. Mr Amnuay Viravan, chairman of the elected
board of Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, becomes deputy prime minister,
as does Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, president of the Thai Military Bank.
Together, they signal the government's commitment to cautious fiscal and
monetary policy. This has been seen as the foundation of Thailand's economic
stability and as helping to maintain one of the fastest growth rates in the
world despite periodic political problems and corruption.
Some commentators suggested that the appointment of the three could lead to
a clash of superstars who do not always agree about how the economy should
be handled. But Mr Chuan Leekphai, the new prime minister, yesterday said it
would be healthy for ministers to have differing views so that they could
counter-check each other.
Mr Chuan held out against a controversial bid by his Democrat party's
secretary general, Major General Sanan Kachornprasart, to be appointed
defence minister. Maj Gen Sanan, who left the army after a failed coup
attempt in 1977, and the current military commanders are said not to be on
good terms.
Mr Sanan will not now enjoy the promotion to full general that is normally
granted to defence ministers. He has been given the industry portfolio.
Trouble also threatened when General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, former army
chief and now leader of the New Aspiration party, sought to strengthen his
own clout by proposing a fourth non-elected economist to the cabinet. This
would have deprived one of his MPs of a cabinet seat, and he had to back
down.
The leader of the third largest party of the coalition, Major General
Chamlong Srimuang, declined a cabinet seat although other members of his
party are included. Mr Chamlong, a former governor of Bangkok, led the
anti-military protest in May, at one stage going on hunger strike.
His more radical approach caused a rift between his party and the Democrats,
which is said to have contributed to his decision not to join the cabinet.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: EC offer averts trade war with US
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US and the EC were hauled back from the brink of trade war last night
following an 11th-hour EC proposal of compromise on a long-standing dispute
over trade in oilseeds.
The EC move in Gatt's governing council came after it formally rejected a US
demand for binding arbitration by an independent Gatt panel on trade damages
caused by its oilseed subsidies.
The compromise offer occurred as the US administration came under fierce
pressure from Senate Republicans to move fast and firmly in imposing
retaliatory tariffs on EC food and drink imports - for what it claims is
Dollars 1bn in losses suffered by US oilseeds producers because of market
barriers in the EC. The EC has offered compensation of less than Dollars
400m.
Two Gatt panels have ruled in favour of the US in the dispute, which has
dragged on since 1987.
The oilseeds dispute, together with a tit-for-tat escalation of wheat
dumping, threaten to derail efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks
on world trade liberalisation, and plunge the US, the EC and their trading
partners into trade war.
The last-minute compromise proposal by Mr Tran van Thinh, EC ambassador to
Gatt, which will be discussed in more detail by the Gatt council today,
combines elements of the independent panel called for by the US with
elements of a Gatt working party favoured by the EC. A small group,
excluding the US, EC and other interested parties, would be established
under Gatt to consider EC compensation for losses to oilseed traders within
a fixed time period.
As trade negotiators haggled at the Gatt council in Geneva, Mrs Carla Hills,
the US trade representative, and Mr Julius Katz, her deputy, were called to
a meeting with Republican senators in the office of Senator Robert Dole, the
minority leader.
The senators stressed the concern they had found among farm state voters
about the administration's failure to make headway in its long running
oilseeds dispute. An observer at the meeting said the trade officials
expressed concern about the damage to be inflicted on US business from EC
counter-retaliation, but that senators were adamant that the oilseeds
dispute be made 'a litmus test' of the Gatt's ability to resolve trade
disputes.
Any final decision to move ahead with US retaliation must be made by the
Bush cabinet and the president himself. The opportunity for such a meeting
is not expected until next week.
Earlier in the day in Geneva, both the US and the EC drew fierce criticism
from trading partners over escalating subsidies for wheat exports.
Mr David Hawes, Australia's ambassador to Gatt, said US and EC export
subsidies had 'effectively created a two-tier world market where more than
half the wheat traded was sold at predatory, subsidy-discounted prices'.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: France angered by steel levy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRAINED trade relations between France and the US worsened yesterday when
the French government called on the European Community to consider
retaliation against US levies recently imposed on imported French, German
and British steel.
The French industry ministry said the duties on imported European carbon
steel bars and rods, provisionally imposed on September 22, would block
exports worth FFr90m (Pounds 10.32m) a year from Usinor Sacilor, the French
state-owned steelmaker.
'This is a protectionist operation carried out under a legal disguise,' said
Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, international affairs director of Usinor
Sacilor.
EC foreign affairs ministers were expected to discuss action at a meeting
next Tuesday, at France's request, he said.
Usinor Sacilor might be forced to make lay-offs next year unless the duties
were reversed, Mr de Silguy said.
Paris fears the preliminary levies could be extended to flat-rolled
products, the raw material for car bodies and white goods, which would block
FFr1bn of French exports and FFr5bn of EC sales a year to the US.
'Such practices, which lead to the de facto closure of the US market to
foreign steel products, call into question the US commitment to an open
world trading system,' said the French industry ministry.
The preliminary levies, paid as a cash deposit or bond, are due for a final
decision by the US Commerce Department by December 7.
It would then be up to the International Trade Commission to confirm whether
the US steel industry was suffering real injury, before customs began
collecting the duties.
Usinor Sacilor, which has made several large takeovers in the US in recent
years in an attempt to avoid import rows, has been harder hit by the
preliminary duties than any other European steel maker.
The company is being charged a 64.55 per cent dumping margin, on top of a
12.88 per cent preliminary anti-subsidy duty imposed by the US earlier this
month.
German steel makers are being provisionally charged 49.3 per cent of import
value, while British imports are subject to a preliminary levy of 32.02 per
cent.

ALMOST one in three young German adults admits to being hostile towards
foreigners, according to a survey published yesterday.
The rest of the nation's youth views antagonism towards foreigners as a
serious problem for society - although second in overall importance to the
state of the environment - but only 25 per cent reject 'all forms of
discrimination' against non-Germans.
The study, which described its sample as 'self-confident, constructively
critical, realistic and informed', involved more than 2,000 people, aged
between 16 and 24, and was carried out by the Institute for Empirical
Psychology.
The ministry for youth and family responded to the findings with a claim
that other studies showed only 1 per cent of the age group surveyed was
prepared to use violence against foreigners.
However, the study, which appeared as sporadic attacks on asylum-seekers
continued, and followed the weekend fire-bombing of the Jewish barracks in
the former Sachsenhausen concentration camp, showed that 13 per cent were
'resolutely' anti-foreigner.
In a previous similar survey, made in 1990, less than 30 per cent believed
xenophobia was a serious problem. Since the end of that year, however, the
number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany each year has almost doubled.
More than 400,000 are expected this year.

<TEXT>
ORDERS for German engineering products continued to fall in August,
reinforcing both machinery makers' fears of a real 5 per cent fall in
production this year and more widespread concern over the threat of
recession.
The value of new contracts for machinery and plant signed during the month
was 9 per cent down on the same month last year, the VDMA manufacturers'
association said yesterday.
A three-month comparison, less prone to distortion by short-term factors,
showed new order intake to the end of August down 12 per cent on last year.
The same measure at the end of July showed an 11 per cent year-on-year
slump.
Meanwhile, a survey of 3,000 Mittelstand, or medium-sized, companies
concluded that German economic growth would fall 0.5 per cent in the next
six months.
After stagnating for the past six months, the economy was 'already on a
recession-like downtrend,' said Mr Jurgen Kolsch, chairman of the Federal
Association of Young Entrepreneurs (BJU).
Plant utilisation among members surveyed had fallen from 90 per cent of
capacity to 85 per cent within six months and was expected to fall further
to 83 per cent in the next six.
The machinery and plant industry, which shares top position in the German
exporters' league with vehicle makers, is already shedding 80,000 of its
1.15m workforce this year. Meanwhile, Porsche, the luxury sports car maker
yesterday announced plans to cut its 8.000 workforce by a further 1,000.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Europe and World Trade: Korean investors unfurl red flags
with eye to China - John Burton on trade links fuelled by Roh's visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINESE flags are flying along the main avenue of central Seoul this week
for the first time since enemy Chinese troops entered the city in early 1951
during the Korean war.
The display of the red Chinese banner this time represents the prospect of
economic gains that Korean companies hope to make in China after the visit
of President Roh Tae-woo to Beijing, which ends today.
The establishment of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Seoul last
month has already benefited Korean concerns. Samsung Engineering last week
won the largest construction order any Korean company has received from
China - for the building of a Dollars 200m chemical plant. The Halla Group
has announced the establishment of a joint venture cement plant. And an
agreement was recently signed for the construction of a Korean industrial
park in Tianjin.
South Korea's cumulative total investment in China is expected to double
this year to Dollars 300m, making China the leading recipient of foreign
investment by South Koreans.
Sino-South Korean trade is also expected nearly to double this year to
Dollars 10bn, as trade accelerates in the second half. This would make China
the third-largest trade partner for South Korea after the US and Japan.
Momentum has been building for closer economic ties since the two countries
established trade offices last year. This led to expanded direct trade,
which had formerly been conducted through third-parties in Hong Kong.
Trade links were further improved in February when China reduced tariffs on
South Korean products and granted some investment guarantees. Because of the
tariff cuts, South Korea is showing signs of a slight trade surplus with
China this year, after suffering deficits for the last three years.
South Korea's exports to China mainly consist of textiles, electronics,
machinery, chemicals, steel and metal products, while imports from China
include silk, cotton fabrics, coal, oil and copper.
President Roh's trip to Beijing is likely to increase the confidence of
South Korea's big conglomerates, or chaebol, to begin investing in China.
Medium-sized Korean companies have so far been the biggest investors in
China, producing cheap, labour-intensive goods such as toys, textiles and
footwear.
Thirty-seven senior businessmen, including the chairmen of the leading
chaebol, accompanied President Roh to Beijing, where agreements on
investment guarantees, trade and technological co-operation were signed.
The chaebol are interested in joint-venture factories for the production of
electronic products and vehicles to take advantage of China's inexpensive
labour. Samsung Electronics recently announced it would set up a VCR factory
in Tianjin.
Hyundai is negotiating a joint venture to manufacture minibuses and trucks
in Harbin and another to produce cars in Tianjin and Wuhan. Daewoo wants to
build buses in Shanghai.
Other proposed projects include the construction of cement plants by Daewoo
and Ssangyong, the development of zinc ore mines by Hyundai and the building
of a machinery plant near Beijing by Lucky-Goldstar.
The contract awarded to Samsung Engineering last week for an ethylene plant
in Jilin province is only the first indication of the construction orders
that South Korea could win as part of China's current five-year plan, which
is expected to produce Dollars 300bn in orders.
South Korean participation in the building of industrial facilities
throughout China will also encourage Korean companies to expand out of north
east China, where Korean investment is concentrated.
The Korean preference for this area reflects not only its close proximity to
South Korea, but also that this region is home to most of the 2m ethnic
Koreans living in China.
However, the official Korean Trade Promotion Corporation is warning
companies about entering China in haste because of continued political
uncertainty and the lack of sufficient infrastructure.
Pioneer efforts by Korean companies to penetrate China have not always fared
well. Daewoo, for example, has lost an estimated Dollars 1m annually on a
refrigerator factory it opened five years ago in Fuzhou.
Moreover, there is concern that China is becoming a competitor to South
Korea in global markets because of its low wages. Korean producers of
footwear and textiles have complained that the Chinese are taking a growing
share of the Korean market for these products.

ALMOST one in three young German adults admits to being hostile towards
foreigners, or at least being susceptible to xenophobic thoughts, according
to a survey published yesterday.
The rest of the nation's youth views antagonism towards foreigners as a
serious problem for society - although second in overall importance to the
state of the environment - but only 25 per cent reject 'all forms of

The study, which described its sample as 'self-confident, constructively
critical, realistic and informed', involved more than 2,000 people, aged
between 16 and 24, and was carried out by the Institute for Empirical
Psychology. It was funded by IBM Deutschland.
Two years after unification, the study has uncovered converging ambitions
and opinions between young people from both sides of the country, but 80 per
cent of easterners still feel themselves to be 'second-class Germans'.
More than two-thirds also miss some of the good things from their past life
under communism, mainly social welfare and child care facilities.
Half of those in the west and three-quarters of those in the east say their
economic expectations of unification had not been fulfilled.
And while Germany's main problem in the eyes of young westerners remains
environmental protection, 95 per cent of easterners worry most about
increasing unemployment.
The ministry for youth and family responded to the findings with a claim
that other studies showed only 1 per cent of the age group surveyed was
prepared to use violence against foreigners.
However, the report showed how important it was for older people to speak
plainly and openly to foster understanding, said Ms Cornelia Yzer,
parliamentary state secretary.
The study, which appeared as sporadic attacks on asylum-seekers continued,
and followed the weekend fire-bombing on the Jewish barracks in the former
Sachsenhausen concentration camp, showed that 13 per cent were 'resolutely'
anti-foreigner.
In a previous similar survey, made in 1990, less than 30 per cent believed
xenophobia was a serious problem. Since the end of that year, however, the
number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany each year has almost doubled.
More than 400,000 are expected this year.
There were almost 1,500 violent attacks on foreigners in 1991 - a five-fold
increase - and a further rise is expected this year.

A COALITION representing 1,500 US companies yesterday called for action in
Latin America to combat the piracy of American movies, music and audio
recordings, computer software and books.
Appearing before a Senate judiciary sub-committee, Mr Eric Smith, executive
director of the International Intellectual Property alliance, released a
report detailing an estimated Dollars 660m in annual losses in Central and
South America.
The report estimated losses to US industry of Dollars 200m a year from
displaced sales through Paraguay's export of pirated audiotapes.
It claims that El Salvador is the Central American base of audio piracy with
a manufacturing capacity estimated at 100,000 units per month - nearly twice
the legitimate sales of the record industry in the Central American region.
The alliance released a second study concluding that the copyright-based US
industries are among the largest and fastest growing sectors of the national
economy.

FT  30 SEP 92 / US hopes to resume Sarajevo airlift soon

<TEXT>
THE US is considering a swift resumption of relief flights into Sarajevo,
the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, where up to 400,000 people could die of
starvation and exposure this winter, according to United Nations aid
officials.
Six thousand tonnes of urgently needed food and other supplies had failed to
reach Sarajevo since the flights were suspended four weeks ago, Mrs Sylvana
Foa, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said yesterday.
'We are not anywhere near prepared for winter,' she said. 'It seems we will
lose a lot of people. It really is too late probably for thousands and
thousands of people.'
An extra 6,000 UN troops needed to open new land routes into Bosnia had
still not arrived, she said, and the agency was short of cash and trucks.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has meanwhile
called for urgent despatch of peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, arguing that
their presence could stop a new wave of 'ethnic cleansing'.
Only fast action by the international community could prevent 'further
deterioration of an already terrible situation', she declared.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said in Geneva after talks with
Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, that all sides in the conflict had agreed
to demilitarisation of Sarajevo in principle.
He added that Mr Vance had expressed the hope that US flights could resume
in 24 hours. However, a UN official denied that the flights would be resumed
immediately but said the US administration was considering a resumption
'within days'.
'The airlift, unfortunately, is interrupted today but it looks as if by the
end of the week we may be able to resume,' Mr Thomas Niles, assistant
secretary of state, said in Washington.
The airlift was suspended after the shooting down of an Italian aid aircraft
nearly four weeks ago.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen, the EC mediator, have made clear their dismay at the
failure of governments to resume the flights.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen are due to have talks in Geneva today with Mr Douglas
Hurd, the British foreign secretary, on proposals to establish a 'no-fly'
zone in Bosnia aimed at halting Serbian air attacks on the Moslem
population.
Mr Hurd is also due to meet Mr Franco Tudjman, the Croatian president, and
Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav federal president, while in Geneva.
Though most members of the UN Security Council, including the US, Britain
and France, have serious reservations about using military aircraft to
enforce a 'no-fly' zone in Bosnia, Mr Hurd believes that the idea is worth
pursuing by other means.
Britain favours a solution under which UN monitors would be stationed on
Serbian airfields to control military aircraft sorties.
Mr Hurd will also discuss with Mr Vance and Lord Owen what means can be
employed to get humanitarian aid flights restarted.
Meanwhile, the Croatian defence ministry said a soldier was being questioned
about firing without authorisation on two UN helicopters on Monday. Croatian
radio said the ministry had apologised for the incident in which, it said,
the soldier had fired seven rounds from an anti-aircraft gun.
In eastern Croatia, UN peacekeepers tightened security and warned they would
use force if necessary to prevent thousands of Croat refugees from marching
on their former homes in Serb-held territory.
The march, scheduled to take place today, could reignite the Serbo-Croat
war, a UN commander said. The war left about 10,000 people dead and hundreds
of thousands homeless.
'Croatian plans to send back the refugees is a violation of the UN
peacekeeping plan and could provoke a return to war,' said Colonel Aleksandr
Khromtshenkov, UN commander of the eastern sector.

THE accelerating erosion of electoral support for Italy's traditional
political parties has been highlighted by local election results in northern
Italy.
The elections on Sunday, of which the most important were in the city of
Mantua and the surrounding region, were a triumph for the populist Lombard
League, headed by Mr Umberto Bossi. The League got almost 34 per cent of the
vote, an increase of 11 percentage points since the April general elections.
Against this, both the Christian Democrats and Socialists saw their vote
drop by more than one-third. These two parties plus the Social Democrats and
Liberals making up the current coalition government could muster only 23 per
cent.

BELGIUM'S six-month-old centre-left coalition yesterday fended off collapse
with an 11th-hour compromise on its 1993 budget amendments and
constitutional reform.
The main challenge for the four coalition partners now is to find an ally to
help push through the reforms in parliament.
The constitutional changes require a two-thirds parliamentary majority which
the socialist/Christian Democrat coalition does not possess.
The leaders of the four parties agreed to raise another BFr21.8bn (Pounds
413m) through savings, including BFr5.2bn of cuts in social security, to
make up a shortfall in the 1993 budget.
The agreement on constitutional reform is supposed to pave the way for
Belgium to become a federal state, with more power devolved to
French-speaking Wallonia and to Flemish-speaking Flanders.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Joxe urges bigger French role in Nato: Defence minister
wants Paris to abandon 'empty chair' policy
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE should abandon the 'empty chair' policy it has long practised at Nato
military meetings, Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, suggested
yesterday.
This is the first time a French defence minister has said in public that he
would like to attend Nato ministerial meetings in the way that France's
foreign minister has always done.
Mr Joxe's comments came as Nato prepared to launch its new rapid reaction
force, in which France will not participate, in Germany on Friday.
It is expected to have about 250,000 troops available to it, two to three
times the number envisaged when plans were first drawn up last year. But
there is continuing discussion about the role it might play, if any, in
conflicts outside the boundaries of the member countries of Nato.
Mr Joxe told a European defence seminar that he hoped 'France in the future
could participate more than it has in the past in politico-military
discussions' in Nato.
But for this to happen, Nato would have to undergo 'real change', and there
was no chance of France again placing its forces under what Mr Joxe
described as the alliance's outmoded integrated military command.
He cited with approval the example of Spain, which stayed outside Nato's
integrated peace-time command when it joined the alliance in the late 1970s,
although its defence minister usually sits in on meetings of Nato's defence
planning committee and nuclear planning group.
The fact that Mr Joxe cleared yesterday's speech with the Elysee indicates
he is having some success in shifting President Francois Mitterrand in a
more pro-atlanticist direction.
France's decision to take part in working out Nato's new 'strategic concept'
last autumn was a step towards greater military involvement in Nato, Mr Joxe
noted yesterday. When, shortly after that review, Nato inaugurated its
'Co-operation Council' with eastern Europe last December, Mr Joxe expressed
frustration at being virtually the only defence chief in Europe - east and
west - not to attend.
At the same time, Mr Joxe took up the hint, dropped by Mr Mitterrand last
year, that France might be ready to enter discussions with its European
partners on future nuclear strategy. This could involve 'a widening of the
nuclear guarantee,' he said.
On conventional forces, the French defence minister said the planned
'Euro-corps', to be composed of 35,000 French and German troops by 1995, was
'an opportunity and not a threat' to other countries and to Nato.
Speaking at the same seminar, Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister,
said arrangements putting the planned Euro-corps under Nato command in time
of emergency should be settled by December.
Nato officials said yesterday that the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction
Force (ARRC), still in embryonic form, involves 12 Nato countries and will
be able to draw on up to 10 divisions. However, no more than four divisions
 -a force of between 60,000 and 90,000 men - would actually be deployed in
response to a crisis.
Under the first blueprint approved by defence ministers in April last year
the corps, under British command, was to consist of two UK divisions, a
multinational airmobile division and another division for southern Europe.
The US made clear at that time its willingness to add a US-based heavy
division.
Forces assigned to the ARRC are now expected to include a German division,
an Italian division with Portuguese participation, and separate Greek and
Turkish divisions. Spain, while not formally part of Nato's military
structure, is also making a division available.
Nato officials emphasised that final details had not been settled.
One allied officer said Greece and Turkey had engaged in 'competitive poker'
over their contributions, and it was still uncertain what these would
entail.
Greeks and Turks are also due to join Italian forces in a combined
Multinational Division South.
This is one of two divisions which will be under permanent Nato command in
peacetime. The other, the airmobile Multinational Division Central,
comprises British, German, Dutch and Belgian troops.
All the forces are due to be operational in 1995.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Brittan warning to energy sector: Brussels may force open
markets
</HEADLINE>

THE European Commission will not fight shy of using special powers to open
up EC energy markets to greater competition, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
competition commissioner, warned yesterday.
Sir Leon's comments were the first formal indication since the French
referendum on Maastricht that Brussels will continue to challenge public
monopolies, despite sensitivity about how such attempts might be interpreted
by national governments.
The Commission's controversial plans to liberalise energy markets are based
on a gradual approach, with the eventual aim of giving users the ability to
buy gas and electricity from anywhere in the EC. Proposals to push through
directives without the approval of member states - using special powers
under the EC treaty - were shelved last year, and even the watered down
proposals have met strong opposition from energy producers.
But Sir Leon told a Forum Europe symposium on energy liberalisation
yesterday: 'We want to go forward and are prepared to use those powers if it
proves necessary.'
Brussels commissioners could face a more immediate test of their mettle
today, when they are due to debate the long-awaited policy paper on
liberalisation of the telecommunications sector.
Publication of the paper - which proposes to open up cross-border telephone
calls to competition - was delayed in July because of political sensitivity
about the measures, particularly in France.
EC officials said that the paper might still be withdrawn from today's
agenda. Alternatively, it could be discussed, but not published. 'I tend to
feel they (the commissioners) won't want to push it to a vote,' said one
official.
Commissioners will decide today whether to allow Du Pont of the US and
Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK to swap chemical assets, or whether
to impose strict conditions on the deal, as recommended by Sir Leon Brittan,
competition commissioner, writes Andrew Hill.
The deal would involve ICI swapping its nylon interests for Du Pont's
acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. Under the plan proposed by Sir
Leon, Du Pont would have to give up 12,000 tonnes of its annual capacity in
nylon carpet fibre to a competitor. This third party would 'share' a Du Pont
factory, as well as related research and development facilities and staff.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Major has little time to conjure
modest victory out of defeats - British run the risk of being left out of
the game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE British presidency of the European Community has reached a turning
point. The next three weeks are likely to show whether a modest political
victory can be wrested from the string of humiliating defeats, or whether Mr
John Major's pledge to move Britain to 'the heart of Europe' will prove no
more than a cute Foreign Office slogan.
Time is running out. This week's meeting of European finance ministers in
Brussels underlined Britain's near-isolation in the EC, with ministers
giving short shrift to Mr Major's demands for a reform of the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), and demanding that all EC members proceed at
the earliest date possible with ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European monetary and political union.
Worse still, the British prime minister's European policy is foundering amid
mutual recrimination in the Anglo-German relationship and a residue of
suspicion in virtually all EC countries about the British and their
attitudes to the Community. Repairing the damage before next month's
emergency EC summit in Birmingham to discuss Maastricht will require a huge
effort by Mr Major and his cabinet colleagues.
When Mr Major succeeded Mrs Thatcher, the bete-noire of Brussels, two years
ago, he inherited a good deal of good-will. With his early efforts to forge
a closer relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Mr Major appeared to be
the first British prime minister since Mr Edward Heath to be willing to lead
his country to play a full role in the development of the EC.
The political and monetary crisis of the past three months has revealed just
how exaggerated the hopes were of a new relationship between Britain and the
Community.
'We thought we were moving forward with Mr Major, now it looks as if we may
not even be able to stand still,' said a senior EC official. 'We may even be
moving backwards.'
The most important force propelling the current crisis was last June's
referendum in Denmark which led to narrow rejection of the Maastricht
treaty.
Not only did it unleash the current political uncertainty in Europe about
Maastricht; it also gave fresh impetus to anti-European voices in Britain,
both in the Conservative and Labour parties.
In retrospect, says a senior German official, all EC members misread the
impact of the Danish referendum. 'What we thought was the Danish problem in
fact turned out to be the 'British problem'. Or as another EC official put
it yesterday: 'Even if we solve the Danish problem, we cannot be sure we can
solve the British - and that may be one problem too many for the Community.'
Brussels officials believe Mr Major's decision to withdraw from the ERM was
a serious blow to his European policy, but it was not fatal. Indeed, they
argue that the real damage has come from misjudgments and tactical errors
before and after sterling's withdrawal from the ERM.
The first mistake, they believe, came with the British presidency's campaign
to open speedy negotiations to enlarge the EC to admit Sweden, Austria and
Finland, before ratification of the Maastricht treaty and before final
approval of the Delors II spending package providing extra financial aid to
the poorer southern states such as Italy, Spain and Portugal. However
honourable the motives, Mr Major's push looked like a replay of Mrs
Thatcher's efforts to limit the EC to a free trade area.
The sterling crisis magnified British misjudgments. First, Britain declined
to raise interest rates despite increasing evidence this was the only way to
avoid a devaluation of sterling; then it refused to join in a general
realignment in return for a cut in German interest rates; finally, it
announced a withdrawal, accompanied by accusations of betrayal against the
Bundesbank and calls for reform of the ERM.
Downing Street's attack against the ERM has ballooned, at least in the eyes
of Brussels diplomats, into a broader assault on the integrity of the
European Monetary System. The resulting damage in relations with the other
11 members is hard to underestimate. As the joint communique signed on
Monday night suggested, the EMS is viewed as the sina qua non of monetary
stability in Europe.
This explains, in part, why there has been so much loose talk in the past
fortnight of a two-speed Europe, an early push by France and Germany to
monetary union. Doubtless contingency plans exist in Paris and Bonn; but the
wider message is that if anyone, particularly perfidious Albion, should seek
to dismantle the Maastricht process, they risk being left out of the game.
What can Britain do? Brussels officials say final judgment on the British
presidency will depend on three factors. First, how far it allows domestic
political considerations to influence its views on Denmark's pleas for
special treatment post-Maastricht; second, its willingness to listen -
rather than dictate - on the EMS; third, whether it manages to broker a
compromise on the Delors II package.
Beyond these issues, there remains the question of ratification of
Maastricht before the British parliament. Mr Lamont said on Monday night the
Conservative government was 'honour bound' to present the treaty for a vote.
In Brussels, the view is that Mr Major must deliver - or be damned.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lamont's stock tumbles after heady
political ride - Peter Norman explains how the UK Chancellor ran into German
and British flak when trying to play the two audiences simultaneously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'LAMONTS' used to be a rather dull little stock with a limited political
future. They have suddenly emerged as the most volatile issue on the City
and Westminster gossip exchanges.
Two weeks ago, as the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism, Mr Norman Lamont's future looked bleak indeed. The chancellor
appeared unlikely to survive the sterling crisis.
Seven days later, by contrast, he seemed on top of the world. With a one
percentage point cut in interest rates under his belt and growing support
from the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party, he was the popular advocate of
a 'British policy in British interests'.
Yesterday Mr Lamont's fortunes took another tumble. Remarks by the
chancellor at the end of Monday's meeting of European Community economics
and finance ministers in Brussels were widely construed as an apology to
Germany for earlier remarks criticising the Bundesbank's role in the
sterling crisis.
He awoke yesterday morning to find the Daily Telegraph - the one newspaper
he takes more seriously than any other - urging his resignation and the
early editions of yesterday's Evening Standard reporting fury in the
Conservative ranks after the 'humiliation' of his words of regret to
Germany.
Not for the first time in the past three weeks, observers of UK economic
policy making were left shaking their heads and asking what is really going
on.
Mr Lamont's latest discomfiture is a salutary tale on several levels. It
shows how UK domestic party politics do not travel in the European Community
and how Britain, for all its pro-European rhetoric before Black Wednesday,
stands apart from all its other EC partners in harbouring serious doubts
about the utility of the European Monetary System in its present form.
Mr Lamont's latest stumble highlights the problems of playing simultaneously
to two audiences. Relations between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank have
been poor since the beginning of September when Mr Lamont tried and failed
to force a cut in German interest rates at the informal meeting of economics
and finance ministers in Bath.
The Treasury is also firm in its belief that its efforts to prop up the
pound on black Wednesday were fatally undermined by Bundesbank
indiscretions. This sense of anger was not assuaged by the very substantial
support given by the German central bank to the French franc last week:
support that had not been available on such a scale for sterling on
September 16.
Mr Lamont's obvious irritation with the Bundesbank and his apparent
determination not to return quickly to the ERM made him the new hero of the
Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party. This contributed to the strong
support he was given last Thursday when he successfully defended himself in
the commons debate on the economy. In his speech, the chancellor once again
pinned the blame for sterling's fall on the Bundesbank.
During the previous week, however, he had also been trying to mend fences
with Germany. This was apparent in Washington during the weekend after
sterling's float where he attended meetings with Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, and Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. At
that time, UK officials insisted that both sides wanted to put the bad blood
behind them. But it seemed that every dose of soothing words on the
international stage from Mr Lamont was matched by some criticism of German
policy, designed for the UK audience.
In Brussels, Mr Lamont's approach of policy of tailoring his remarks to his
audience caught up with him. His statement at a press conference that 'I am
sorry if anything has been said that greatly upsets them' was widely
construed as a personal apology to Germany and therefore as a humiliating
climbdown. His subsequent clarification that he was referring only to
comments in the press for which he has no responsibility has put back the
controversy to square one.
But the events of the past days have done more than that. The Brussels
meeting, when the other 11 EC nations rallied behind the ERM, showed that in
a beauty contest between the UK government and the Bundesbank, Britain's
erstwhile ERM partners will opt for the Bundesbank every time.
This week's meeting of EC ministers also exposed Britain's lack of concrete
suggestions for reforming the ERM, despite the lapse of several days since
the prime minister and chancellor first detected 'fault lines' in the
system.
Britain is still without a clear plan on how to approach the ERM question at
the Birmingham summit of EC leaders on October 16. It became clear yesterday
that the Treasury has neither broad proposals for a significant change in
the system nor specific ideas for detailed technical changes.
In normal circumstances, such an absence of initiatives could be bearish for
Mr Lamont's stock. But the chancellor can probably rest easy for the time
being. The UK parliament is not due to reconvene until October 19. Before
then he will have an opportunity to restore his reputation at next week's
Conservative Party Conference It remains to be seen how he will negotiate
the high wire between his Eurosceptic supporters at home and his
increasingly frustrated colleagues among the EC's finance ministers.

ITALY'S prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, yesterday sought to stop what he
said was an irrational rush to withdraw cash from banks, by assuring the
public that the government was not planning to touch their money.
Bankers said there had been a trend among clients to sell up investment
portfolios and withdraw cash, apparently fuelled by rumours the government
was planning to freeze 30 per cent of bank deposits. 'It is not a rush, but
it is noticeable,' said the director of one large bank.

MR JOHN MAJOR'S 90-minute meeting at the Elysee Palace this afternoon could
determine the success of the emergency European Community summit in
Birmingham next month.
The UK prime minister's discussion with President Francois Mitterrand is,
one insider said, 'designed to enable him to start trying to shape the
consensus'.
'It's about squaring the circle' was the perhaps more realistic phrase of
another.
Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Mr Major has a good relationship
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whatever the view about briefings from
officials of the Bundesbank, and said that the two often spoke on the
telephone.
With the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders before
the mid-October summit looking remote, however, France is increasingly
significant as a possible ally on the way forward on the dispute over the
exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht.
Mr Mitterrand will urge Mr Major to reduce recent Anglo-German tensions. He
will also back the UK leader's plan to inject more democracy into the
Maastricht process in an attempt to get Britain to ratify the EC treaty this
year, say French officials.
France recognises Mr Major's internal political problems in pushing treaty
ratification, but believes the January 1, 1993, target date for the treaty
to enter into force can be met.
In the short term, France is worried about the possibility of the UK
government taking irreversible steps away from the Maastricht treaty,
following sterling's departure from the parity grid of the European Monetary
System and consequent British bitterness at lack of Bundesbank support.
For their part UK Foreign Office officials say that while the close result
of the French referendum has some side benefits for the UK's agenda, such as
its reinforcement of the importance of retaining each country's national
identity, other aspects could add to Britain's difficulties.
Though some of the damage to Anglo-German relations may have been undone at
this week's EC finance ministers meeting, Mr Mitterrand is still expected to
counsel Mr Major not to let himself, or his cabinet colleagues, give vent to
anti-German rhetoric.
French officials say they realise, from the way relations with Germany
figured large in the stormy French referendum debate on Maastricht, that
such rhetoric can prove popular. But they warn that Britain needs
co-operation with Germany if it is to bring the pound back into the ERM.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: How central banks ran into the hedge
 -James Blitz on the logic of a currency market biased to safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank and the Bank of France may have won the battle to save the
French franc. But the world's central banks are losing a war to preserve
their influence over how the foreign exchange market trades their
currencies.
Since the middle of the 1980s, the central banks have had some success in
checking fluctuations in exchange rates when they threatened to become
extreme. After 1985, for example, the central banks successfully intervened
in the market to depress the value of the dollar, by concertedly buying
other currencies.
Ten years ago, currency markets were dominated by commercial bank dealers
taking short-term positions. Now, managers of pension, insurance and
investment funds - the institutional investors - are playing the market
aggressively. And they are taking longer-term positions, backed by currency
portfolios that match the banks' holdings for size.
'There is an increasing emphasis on the foreign exchange aspect of fund
managers' decisions,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency
research at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'Their aggressive approach and
their particular way of playing the market partly accounts for the recent
runs on sterling and the Italian lira.'
During the 1980s fund managers increasingly internationalised their asset
holdings as capital controls were reduced. The average UK pension fund, for
example, now has 20 per cent of its portfolio invested overseas, compared
with 6 per cent in 1980.
However, the underlying value of a fund's overseas holding of bonds and
equities is affected by fluctuations in the denominated currency. So, fund
managers are increasingly 'hedging' - or protecting - themselves against
currency risk by buying and selling the denominated currency on forward
foreign exchange markets.
Hedging by investment funds is now the fastest-growing business in foreign
exchange. The Bank of England reported last week that the proportion of
interbank business in the London foreign exchange market, the largest in the
world, had declined by 9 per cent since 1989, while the proportion involving
other financial institutions, such as investment funds, had increased.
The share of forward foreign exchange business in London has increased by 12
per cent over the same period, while immediate (or spot) foreign exchange
trading has declined by 14 per cent.
These developments concern governments and central banks for several
reasons:
The scale of currency hedging is producing investment flows that rival
central bank reserves.
The International Monetary Fund reported in June that the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries had total foreign exchange reserves of Dollars
350bn. A leading investment fund manager in London said this week that his
bank had Dollars 25bn of assets which were regularly hedged on currency
markets.
'On a very busy day, our active flows would be in the order of Dollars 1.5bn
to Dollars 3bn,' he said. 'There are 10 other banks in London which could
move the same sums. You can therefore see how the central banks could have
encountered an avalanche of money in the opposite direction in recent
weeks.'
Unlike bank dealers, fund managers take long-term decisions which are far
more difficult for the central banks to reverse.
The bank dealers who have become familiar on TV screens make short-term
currency plays. They sell a currency, watch it depreciate, buy it back again
and make a profit. This short-term view makes them easily influenced by a
central bank raising overnight interest rates or buying a currency to
trigger moves in the exchange rate.
Fund managers, however, are more interested in managing risk rather than
making short-term gains. As interbank dealers continued to test sterling two
weeks ago, the fund managers came into the market and sold the currency on a
long-term basis.
'It is much harder for intervention to reverse that kind of decision,' says
Mr Chertkow. The growing use of hedging instruments such as options and
forward contracts reinforces the prevailing currency flows.
The trade in these sophisticated 'derivative' products has grown because
they allow fund managers to safeguard long-term currency positions. A fund
manager pays a small premium to a bank which, in turn, guarantees to buy or
sell a nominated currency in the event that it touches a lower rate.
Several weeks ago, a fund manager might have feared that sterling would be
devalued below its lower ERM rate of DM2.7780. He might have bought a 'put'
option from a bank , giving him the right to sell sterling to the bank at a
price of DM2.70 if he wished to exercise it.
As sterling started to edge towards the 'exercise price', the bank which had
sold the option would have started to fear that it would end up acquiring a
depreciating currency.
'The bank would itself have had to start selling into the market to avoid
recording a loss once the 'strike price' was reached,' says Mr Mark Austin,
chief economist at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London.
'That example, repeated a hundred times over, explains what happened to
sterling on 'Black Wednesday'.'
It would be wrong to exaggerate the role of these institutional investors in
any explanation of the recent sell-off of weaker ERM currencies.
Analysts stress that the interbank market was in a uniquely 'pathological'
state after the central banks spent huge sums to prop up the lira.
The German and French central banks have also shown that a concerted
intervention can still turn the market, even if it is anticipating that a
currency might be devalued.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK bank chief aims for pound target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may need to institute some measure of targeting for the pound, even
while the currency is outside the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, hinted yesterday.
Speaking in London, he also warned that countries such as the UK with large
budget deficits would have little room to speed growth through looser fiscal
policies.
He indicated that much of the world was looking to Germany to cut interest
rates in the coming months as a way of helping international recovery.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that while Britain no longer needed to keep the
pound within set limits of other European currencies, it remained dependent
on the economies of other developed nations.
The pound's suspension from the ERM 'does not mean that the exchange rate
does not have a profound impact on (Britain's) economic fortunes'. As a
result, the continuing need to bear down on inflation meant the UK 'cannot
afford to ignore' the sterling's level against important currencies.
However, Mr Leigh-Pemberton gave no details about what, if any, form of
targeting of the exchange rate the bank would like to see Britain adopt. His
speech was seen as repeating the broad line set by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, that the UK would continue to monitor sterling.
With much of the world in economic slowdown, there were many demands for a
fiscal loosening in specific countries to bolster demand.
But in many nations the 'room for manoeuvre is limited' because of large
public sector borrowing requirements built up during economic expansion in
the 1980s.
The governor warned: 'Those countries with severe deficits need to pursue
budgetary consolidation vigorously.' That passage was taken as having
specific reference to Britain which is likely this financial year to have a
PSBR of more than Pounds 30bn, or roughly 5 per cent of gross domestic
product.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton also indicated that a cut in German interest rates would
help the prospects of world growth. He said: '(Monetary) relaxation by
countries with strong currencies and a satisfactory prices performance, such
as Germany, is most likely to have positive international spillover
effects.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRIES which slow progress towards European monetary union risk
strengthening Germany's economic domination across the continent, according
to Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German association of chambers of
commerce and industry.
Mr Stihl, who has emerged as an influential spokesman for German business in
the debate over future European integration, labelled as 'short-sighted'
countries such as Denmark and the UK showing opposition to the treaty.
If the Maastricht treaty were not ratified, this would establish the D-Mark
more quickly as the 'main currency in Europe', since the move to a single
currency with a European central bank would break down, Mr Stihl said.
'This would mean the domination of the German economy in Europe,' he said.
The Maastricht treaty might have to be implemented initially by a smaller
group of EC states, he said. If monetary union went ahead with only a
limited number of countries, this would have the effect of 'exerting
pressure on other countries in Europe to maintain (economic) stability'.
However, there were strong political arguments against too overt a move
towards 'two-speed' Europe. The EC would try to ensure as many countries as
possible took part in the final stage of monetary union. The most likely
outcome was that the Maastricht process would continue, but more slowly than
envisaged.

one insider said, 'designed to enable him to start trying to shape the
consensus'.
'It's about squaring the circle' was the perhaps more realistic phrase of
another.
Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Mr Major has a good relationship
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whatever the view about briefings from
officials of the Bundesbank, and said that the two often spoke on the
telephone.
With the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders before
the mid-October summit looking remote, however, France is increasingly
significant as a possible ally on the way forward on the dispute over the
exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht.
Mr Mitterrand will urge Mr Major to reduce recent Anglo-German tensions. He
will also back the UK leader's plan to inject more democracy into the
Maastricht process in a bid to get Britain to ratify the EC treaty this
year, say French officials.
France recognises Mr Major's internal political problems in pushing treaty
ratification, but believes the January 1, 1993, target date for the treaty
to enter into force can be met.
In the short term, France is worried about the possibility of the UK
government taking irreversible steps away from the Maastricht treaty,
following sterling's departure from the parity grid of the European Monetary
System and consequent British bitterness at lack of Bundesbank support.
For their part UK Foreign Office officials say that while the close result
of the French referendum has some side benefits for the UK's agenda, such as
its reinforcement of the importance of retaining each country's national
identity, other aspects could add to Britain's difficulties.
Though some of the damage to Anglo-German relations may have been undone at
this week's EC finance ministers meeting, Mr Mitterrand is still expected to
counsel Mr Major not to let himself, or his cabinet colleagues, give vent to
anti-German rhetoric.
French officials say they realise, from the way relations with Germany
figured large in the stormy French referendum debate on Maastricht, that
such rhetoric can prove popular. But they warn that Britain needs
co-operation, not conflict, with Germany if it is to bring the pound back
into the ERM.
British officials said the prime minister would be keen to hear first-hand
President Mitterrand's analysis of the French referendum outcome and of his
bilateral discussion with Chancellor Kohl last week.
Mr Major is also expected to brief Mr Mitterrand on his discussions with
Danish ministers about how they expect to proceed after their country's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
He is likely to argue that even if other countries do not see the need for
fundamental changes in the ERM, the probability of a second Danish
referendum before the uncertainty about Maastricht is resolved could impose
strains similar to those in the run-up to the French referendum. So some
sort of review is required.

MRS Ruth Richardson, the New Zealand finance minister, yesterday denied she
had received a number of offers in June to buy the government's 104.5m
shares in Fletcher Challenge, the country's leading forestry group.
Mr Michael Cullen, opposition Labour finance spokesman, had earlier said the
government received offers valuing its stake at NZDollars 400m (USDollars
215m)now worth about half this figure.
'The government's lack of action has cost the taxpayers NZDollars 200m,' he
said.
Fletcher Challenge shares have come under sustained selling pressure since
they hit a 1992 peak of Dollars 3.80 in June because of concern over its
high debt level, and whether it would be able to sell assets in the current
market. Investors are also concerned over the company's loans to its
employee unit trust, which controls 12 per cent of its capital.
Under arrangements with banks, the company must top up loans by NZDollars 1m
for every cent the share price falls below NZDollars 2.30. Its shares
dropped a further 9 cents yesterday to NZDollars 1.91, a six-year low.
Mr Cullen said the government had received a number of offers for the
shares, which would have netted it approximately what they had cost. The
government paid NZDollars 3.83 a share last March for its stake as part of a
complex deal agreed in 1988 when Fletcher Challenge bought the state-owned
resources group Petrocorp. It paid NZDollars 3.83 a share in March.
However, Mrs Richardson told parliament the government had received 'no
serious offer' for the shares. Of the offers made to treasury none could be
considered 'firm'.
One had been a faxed message from Ord Minnett, the New Zealand firm of
brokers, which gave the government only three hours to accept, she said.
This would have been unbusinesslike, she added.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM to take Dollars 2.8bn charge
in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) will take post-tax charges of Dollars
2.8bn in the current third quarter to cover a streamlining of its worldwide
manufacturing capacity and additional workforce reductions. The charges will
result in a net loss for the quarter, the company said.
The charges will be partially offset by a change of accounting methods that
will enable the company to recognise about Dollars 1.9bn in deferred tax
assets.
IBM added it now expects to reduce its worldwide workforce by about 40,000
this year, doubling its previous estimate. The company has already cut
28,000 in the US this year, through voluntary severance programmes which
have now been closed. Similar programmes continue in international
operations, however, and are expected to complete the 40,000 reduction.
IBM will take a Dollars 2.1bn pre-tax charge against earnings to cover the
costs of the additional workforce reductions. These charges will be spread
over the third and fourth quarters. In addition, IBM said it will take a
third-quarter, after-tax charge of Dollars 2.1bn for the cost of
streamlining its manufacturing operations. This will involve consolidation
of some operations and the write off of surplus buildings and equipment. It
will not, according to an IBM spokesman, involve closure of plant sites or
job cuts although some operations may be relocated.
'Our business units have been carefully evaluating their capacity
requirements within an industry environment marked by rapid changes in
technology, shifting marketplace demand and prolonged worldwide economic
weakness,' said Mr John Akers, IBM chairman. With the actions announced
yesterday, 'IBM will achieve an improved balance between assets and current
business needs.'
By year-end 1992, IBM will have reduced its worldwide force by approximately
25 per cent since 1985. Over the same period, IBM will have reduced its
total manufacturing space by approximately 40 per cent.
IBM said its cost and expense structure would be reduced by about Dollars
4bn annually, beginning in 1993, as a result of the capacity reductions
announced yesterday and restructuring actions that were initiated in late
1991.

BRITISH AIRWAYS is to start services between the US and both Birmingham and
Manchester. The move yesterday provoked a sharp attack from the US airline
industry, which said the move highlighted the unfair advantages BA had over
its US rivals.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of US carrier United Airlines, last night met Mr
John MacGregor, the transport secretary, to renew pressure on the government
to ease restrictions on the operations of American carriers in the UK.
Yesterday Mr Wolf said that BA's announcement 'underscores the
discriminatory nature of air services between our two countries'.
Mr Wolf pressed Mr MacGregor to allow United Airlines to fly twice daily
between the US and Manchester and Birmingham. More than 200 BA cabin crew
staff in Manchester and Birmingham yesterday agreed to accept new working
practices and end their dispute.
The Civil Aviation Authority has recommended to the government that a fund
to protect scheduled airline passengers should be raised by a levy on UK
airlines, not customers.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Machine tool gloom deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE worldwide recession in the machine tool industry has claimed another UK
victim with the appointment of administrative receivers at Coventry-based
Wickman Machine Tool Manufacturing.
Mr Maurice Withall and Mr Roy Welsby of Grant Thornton are seeking
purchasers for a company that, in its heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, was
Europe's largest manufacturer of multi-spindle automatics, used for
high-volume production of turned parts by the automotive and other
industries.
The receivership is the third in the UK machine tool industry this summer,
and will increase the industry's frustration at the government's attitude
towards manufacturing industry and the lack of fiscal stimuli to investment
in new capital equipment.
It also underlines the severity of the present machine tool recession, which
has hit machine tool makers in Japan, the US and continental Europe.
Wickman employed more than 400 people at its peak but that has now fallen to
58, including 15 employees made redundant before the receivership
appointment, Grant Thornton said.
The receivers are offering the business and assets as a going concern, and a
two-day auction starts today at Wickman's Banner Lane plant to sell 3,000
lots of surplus stock and equipment.
Wickman was founded before the Second World War by Axel Wickman, a former
Alfred Herbert apprentice who developed a wide product range of
multi-spindle automatics before selling the company to John Brown in the
1950s.
The company continued to thrive until the early 1980s, when, under new
ownership, it ran into difficulty seeking business in the Soviet Union and
spent heavily on a new range of computer numerically controlled
single-spindle automatics. It continued to lose ground during the 1980s and,
according to one observer, was unable to generate enough volume to withstand
a business downturn.
In the 16 months to December 1990 the company had sales of Pounds 26m and
net profit of Pounds 2.6m. By December last year, annual turnover had fallen
to Pounds 12m, yielding a Pounds 500,000 profit.
Nevertheless, Wickman has several attractions for a potential purchaser.
Apart from a skilled workforce and a quality reputation, earlier this year
it launched a range of multi-spindle automatics incorporating the latest
technology.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Gould critical of economic
policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN GOULD, the former shadow national heritage secretary, last night
launched an attack on his party's economic policy.
Speaking to a Tribune rally, Mr Gould, who resigned from the shadow cabinet
earlier this week, said the party's election defeat in April had a 'silver
lining' because Labour would have suffered a similar fate to that of Mr John
Major's government on the so-called Black Wednesday.
When the Tories had entered the exchange rate mechanism, 'we were incapable
of doing anything but bleat about the consequences of the policy because we
couldn't attack the policy itself,' he said.
'It pains me to say this, but does anyone in this room doubt that, if we had
won the election, we would have sat around with a cabinet team in the midst
of a sterling crisis raising interest rates, raiding the reserves, and
eventually going down to defeat? - the inevitable that such a policy always
produces.'
Mr Gould claimed that Labour politicians who had objected to Labour's policy
of supporting entry to the ERM at a rate he considered too high were moved
out of positions of responsibility on the economy.
'I was obliged to remain silent over that period. I thought it was a
sacrifice that was worthwhile in the interests of getting a Labour
government elected.'
In his speech, the Dagenham MP, who was voted off Labour's national
executive on Monday, said the Maastricht treaty handed power over economic
policy to an unelected central bank instructed to put price stability at the
centre of its policy and to cut public spending.

FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Warning over talks on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN McNAMARA, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, last night warned
that a return to Stormont rule in the province would be 'unacceptable and
unworkable'.
He told a fringe meeting organised by the party's Irish Society that it was
necessary instead to 'develop institutions which can accommodate the divided
loyalties of the various traditions in Northern Ireland'.
Mr McNamara said the current European debate was vital to Northern Ireland.
'In particular, we have to look at potential impact of the development of
the European Community in terms of its effect on political institutions,
civil liberties and the economy.
'I believe that a successful outcome (to the current Ulster talks) will be
more likely if we succeed in Europeanising the issues,' he said.
'Included in the deliberations should be consideration of the relationship
between any new political institutions and Europe.
'For instance, the cases for independent and separate representation for
Northern Ireland in the decision-making processes of the Community should be
examined.'
Mr McNamara said he believed the idea that the current round of talks was
about a return to Stormont was 'misplaced'.
He said: 'It is clear from the agenda that the discussions are much more
wide-ranging than that.'

FT  30 SEP 92 / US consumer confidence falls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER confidence fell again this month and is lower than on the eve of
any of the past five presidential elections, figures released yesterday
indicated.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of
consumer confidence fell 2.6 points this month to 56.4, casting fresh doubt
on President George Bush's re-election hopes.
In another gloomy report, the Commerce Department reported a 0.2 per cent
decline last month in the index of leading indicators, its main gauge for
forecasting economic turning points. This followed a fall of 0.3 per cent in
June and a marginal gain of 0.1 per cent in July.
Yesterday's figures were the latest in a series of consistently weak
economic reports that have put renewed pressure on the dollar.
Attention has shifted to September's employment report, due on Friday - the
last before the election. Most analysts expect another sharp decline in
employment, which would put additional pressure on the Bush campaign and
increase the likelihood of another cut in interest rates.
Consumer confidence has fallen for three months running and is at its lowest
level since March, when the economy was recovering from a second dip.
Confidence has fallen 16 points since June and is running at about half the
level expected during a healthy economic recovery.
Yesterday's survey revealed a further weakening in consumers' intentions to
buy cars, houses and home appliances.
The proportion of respondents expecting business conditions to deteriorate
and jobs to become more scarce rose relative to already weak figures in
August. Only 6 per cent of 5,000 families surveyed said jobs were plentiful.
Seven of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators fell last
month, led by declining commodity prices, rising claims for state
unemployment insurance and weaker order books in manufacturing.
The index of coincident indicators - designed to measure the current state
of the economy - dropped a sharp 0.9 per cent in August, but this mainly
reflected the damage inflicted by Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Louisiana.
President Bush yesterday rejected for a third time a plan to debate Governor
Bill Clinton, his rival in the US presidential election next month, forcing
the cancellation of a meeting that was scheduled for Sunday in San Diego,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Bush refused to accept the ground rules set by the bipartisan Commission
on Presidential Debates that call for a single moderator, wanting instead a
panel of three journalists.

NINE people were killed in renewed fighting in southern Lebanon yesterday
including a 29-year-old Irish soldier with United Nations peacekeeping
forces.
Guerrillas from the Iranian-backed Shia Moslem Hizbollah militia launched a
rocket attack against a hilltop position manned by the South Lebanon Army
(SLA), Israel's proxy militia. Hizbollah, which recently won eight seats in
the Lebanese parliament, stepped up its attacks after the latest Middle East
peace talks closed in Washington last Friday.
Four Hizbollah and two SLA men were killed in the initial assault yesterday.
Later, Hizbollah guerrillas attempted to pass through a United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) checkpoint manned by Irish soldiers. After
being denied passage, the guerrillas fired a rocket propelled grenade at the
guard house, killing Corporal Peter Ward. Two more Hizbollah gunmen were
killed in ensuing fire.
Cpl Ward was the 187th Unifil soldier to die in southern Lebanon since the
6,000-strong force was deployed in 1978.

ILVA, Italy's state-owned steel group which lost L498bn (Dollars 407.6m)
last year, yesterday announced its long-awaited joint venture for its
loss-making long products division.
The deal marks one of the biggest privatisation measures in Italy and should
go some way towards reducing Ilva's losses while reassuring the European
Commission that the group's rationalisation strategy is on track. Earlier
this year, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner in charge of competition,
questioned two recent Ilva capital increases and warned the commission might
open a formal procedure against the company.
Ilva is selling 60 per cent of the companies which control its big Piombino
and Turin works to the private sector Lucchini group. Under the transaction,
which is still subject to precise valuations, Ilva could receive around
L150bn from Lucchini, which will take on L280bn in debts from Piombino and
L24bn from the Turin plant. Ilva's current group debt stands at L6,300bn.
Bringing in private-sector participation to Piombino, Ilva's second-biggest
works, has been a crucial part of its strategy to staunch losses, expected
to reach around L1,000bn in 1992.
The new joint venture, which is still subject to approval from the
commission, will have sales of around L1,200bn and have annual output of
almost 2.5m tonnes.
The transaction had been under discussion for many months, but failed to
progress owing to the growing crisis in the European steel industry. Under
an original proposal, three private-sector steel groups would have come in
as shareholders.
The venture with Lucchini, will have around 20 per cent of the Italian
market, and will be Europe's fifth-biggest steel maker of long laminates.
Lucchini, which may launch a capital increase to help finance the deal,
currently has sales of around L1,000bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ESCALATING wheat export subsidies war between the US and the European
Community was condemned yesterday by trading partners in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Mr David Hawes, Australia's Gatt ambassador, said President George Bush's
recent announcement of an expanded subsidy programme would further squeeze
the markets available to 'fair-trading' wheat exporters.
These attacks on the US and the EC during the morning session of the Gatt's
ruling council provided an inauspicious setting for potentially acrimonious
exchanges expected later over the EC's refusal to bow to US demands for
binding arbitration on their longstanding oilseeds dispute.
Following two Gatt panel rulings in its favour, the US wants independent
arbitrators to settle the sum of the damages. It has threatened to impose
retaliatory tariffs for what it claims is Dollars 1bn in losses suffered by
US oilseeds producers due to market barriers in the EC. The EC has offered
compensation of Dollars 400m.
Both the oilseeds dispute and the tit-for-tat escalation of wheat dumping
could derail last ditch efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on
world trade liberalisation and plunge the US, the EC and their trading
partners into trade war.
Australia's call for urgent consultations to limit damage from the US-EC
conflict was backed by other rich and poor farm exporting nations in Gatt's
governing council. There were also renewed demands for an early completion
of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which would cut export and farm
subsidies.
Wheat export subsidies are one of the main outstanding issues blocking a
deal between the US and EC on farm trade reform which is needed to restart
the Uruguay Round negotiations.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the US was pushing for a Uruguay
Round deal but, in its absence, could not allow the EC to go on squeezing US
world market share. Earlier, at a briefing, Mr Yerxa said the US share of
the Dollars 20bn a year world wheat market had fallen from 40 per cent to 30
per cent over the past 10 years while the EC share had risen from 15 to 22
per cent.

AS MANY as 20m people in the three main republics of the former Soviet Union
have contemplated emigration, with the US, Sweden and Germany cited as the
most popular places for starting a new life in the west, according to a
survey published yesterday by Russian and Dutch academics.
The survey found that 8 per cent of Russians, 11 per cent of Ukrainians and
19 per cent of Kazakhs described themselves as 'frequently' or 'permanently'
thinking about emigration.
Although 11 per cent of respondents said the US was their first choice,
researchers found that Russians, Ukrainians and Kazakhs did not tend to
focus on just one or two countries as potential new homes.
'Given this even distribution, it would be conceivable for western countries
to indulge in a more liberal immigration policy, provided that nearly all
countries took such a stance simultaneously,' a report on the survey said.
The survey, which claims to be one of the most detailed accounts ever
compiled of the mental, physical and material needs of people in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, was conducted on the eve of the Soviet
Union's collapse in November and December 1991.
The questionnaire was devised by professors at Erasmus University in
Rotterdam and put to 9,000 households in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan by
Dr Yuri Levada, a Russian sociologist, and the Russian Centre for Study of
Public Opinion on Social Economic Subjects.
Despite the upheavals since late 1991, researchers say most of the survey's
data is still valid, although responses to questions about politics should
be regarded with caution. Prof Stanislav Menshikov, a visiting professor at
Erasmus, said yesterday that the mood in the former Soviet Union was now
'probably worse than a year ago'.
The former Soviet Union emerges from the 'Erasmus Survey 1991' as a region
beset by intense worry about job security, lagging purchasing power, crime
and poor, overcrowded housing.
Multi-generation households of grandparents, parents and children are still
common.
At the same time, one in five households still consists of two nuclear
families.
'If we assume that in all two-family households the families would prefer to
live independently, if possible, this would suggest a 20 per cent housing
shortage,' the report said.
More than 95 per cent of households in the survey area have refrigerators
and television sets, while slightly more than 82 per cent owned a washing
machine, though the report points out 'a Russian washing machine is not the
comfortable, luxurious apparatus known in the west.' Car ownership, at 21.2
per cent, is higher than most people in the west expect.
One intriguing aspect of the survey is the direct comparison between
attitudes in the former Soviet Union and the Netherlands.
Despite the high standards of the Dutch health care system, the Dutch tend
to have relatively more complaints about their physical health than
Russians, who lead harder lives.
However, researchers found 'very shocking' and 'dramatic' disparities in
mental health, even after allowing for differences in the Russian and Dutch
characters.
Nearly 15 per cent of Russian respondents said that they had occasionally or
frequently contemplated suicide, compared with 3.5 per cent of Dutch
respondents.
Only 33 per cent of Russians said they were in a good mood, compared with 90
per cent of the Dutch.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S economic reforms are seriously at risk and inflation could reach
'dangerous levels by the end of the year', a senior official of the
International Monetary Fund told Russian deputies yesterday, writes John
Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Hernando Cota, deputy head of the bank's European division, said that
while the IMF supported the policy and many of the actions of the
government, 'in recent weeks we feel seriously concerned that both budgetary
and credit policies are going off track'.
Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, in charge of relations with the international
financial institutions and permanent representative to the IMF, said that
the key imperative was to bring the countries within the rouble zone under
control.
The Russian administration is to be overhauled soon, according to the news
agency Itar Tass. Almost 100 committees would be axed, together with six
ministries, including the ministry of industry.

<TEXT>
ALL OF the 82 greenfield inward investment projects won by businesses in
north-east England and Cumbria since 1987 have settled in 'assisted areas',
a delegation from the regional regeneration body told Mr Tim Sainsbury,
industry minister, yesterday.
The body, the Northern Development Company, supports the case for the
region's 11 assisted areas to retain their status. It said the government's
regional industrial incentives were vital for the continuation of economic
regeneration in the north.
The development company said that the regional policy map, at present under
review by the government, should be extended to include parts of the
north-east coal areas that are facing more pit closures. It also said the
Copeland and Barrow districts of Cumbria should be included, having borne
the brunt of heavy job losses at the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing
site and VSEL, the builder of Trident submarines. Expected job losses in the
offshore industry, which employs 20,000 people regionally, should also be
considered, the company argued.
Today is the closing date for submissions to the government on its review,
which it has indicated is more likely to shrink than to expand the
assisted-areas map. The new map should be published early next year after
consultation with the European Commission.
The company's 15-page lobbying document presented to Mr Sainsbury says
assisted-area designation should respond to long-term structural
unemployment, not short-term trade cycle fluctuations - an allusion to areas
of southern England recently suffering from rising joblessness and now
competing for assisted-area status.
The NDC said the north region, covering north-east England and Cumbria, has
suffered from structural unemployment for 60 years. Since 1973 it has had
the highest regional unemployment rate in Britain, even though since early
1985 it has won Pounds 2.8bn of inward investment, creating or safeguarding
about 34,650 jobs.
Of the 82 new investments from overseas into the region between 1987 and
1991, 69 went to 'development areas' and 13 to the 'intermediate areas',
which receive less aid. Of all 202 projects in the region by overseas
companies in that period, including joint ventures, acquisitions and
expansions, all but nine were in assisted areas.

<TEXT>
FUJI Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, has told Heller International, its
US financial subsidiary, to reduce sharply its non-performing loans over the
next three years.
The continuing difficulties at Heller, purchased nine years ago, highlight
the problems facing Japanese banks which bought US financial institutions in
the mid-1980s. Several of those US units are now burdened by non-performing
loans made during the late 1980s, particularly to the property sector.
Fuji Bank has invested an estimated Dollars 700m in Chicago-based Heller,
and the bank hopes its three-year reform plan will put the unit firmly into
profit.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Personal Computers and Software (12): PCs move
into management - Profile of ASK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A REVOLUTION has taken place in manufacturing over the past 15 years
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
with minicomputer-based Manufacture Resource Planning (MRP) software
products being one of the vanguards of this change.
But now change has come to the revolution. Smaller desktop personal
computers are starting to take on the management of big manufacturing
systems in ways that traditional MRP software suppliers - and even PC
hardware companies - considered impossible only a few years ago.
One of the best examples of this change lies at Compaq's European
manufacturing plant at Erskine, Scotland. When it built the factory in the
late 1980s, even PC manufacturing high-flier Compaq could not risk trying to
run its MRP system on Compaq PCs and instead installed US software group
ASKs MANMAN manufacturing business management software on a Hewlett-Packard
minicomputer at the site.
Although Compaq would have dearly loved to run the manufacturing process for
its PCs using its own PC products, the company was realistic enough to know
that this was not possible with the technology available at the time. This
month, however, Compaq will start looking at a new ASK product - known as
MANMAN/X - that will run on Compaq PCs that use the Unix operating system.
The acronymns are not important here - the issue is that MRP systems are
soon to be able to be offered on the kinds of small systems that even modest
manufacturing operations are able to afford. ASK also predicts these systems
will have to be much more tightly integrated to manufacturing processes and
planning in the future.
According to ASK marketing manager Mr Paul Eggleton, a wider appreciation of
manufacturing software issues cannot come too soon. 'Historically,
manufacturing information systems have concentrated on addressing the needs
of a single facility or a particular function across a company,' he says.
'Applications for manufacturing planning, purchasing, accounting, finance
and customer service functions have reached a high degree of sophistication
 -however, the degree of integration between these applications outside the
plant level and with the rest of the organisation remains low.'
He suggests that a much higher level of co-operation will be vital in the
future - and that software has a key role to play in bringing this about.
'The number of organisations now operating the manufacture of different
components in a number of plants in the Far East, with final assembly at
plants in the USA and Europe is increasing,' says Eggleton. 'There is thus a
growing need for a framework to manage the data as a single entity across
the entire corporation - not as a collection of business functions, products
and facilities. For example, this will enable a car manufacturer to switch
its sourcing and supply of parts, and location of end unit production,
dependent on current geographic market conditions.'
ASK designs, develops, manufactures and markets a number of integrated
management information systems for manufacturing companies - including the
well-known MANMAN modular series of software products for the manufacturing,
marketing, financial and management reporting needs of manufacturing
companies. To get an idea of how MRP sky-rocketed over the past 20 years,
you only need to look at the evolution of a company like ASK - which now
boasts annual sales of more than Dollars 400m.
The company was founded in 1972 by Ms Sandra L Kurtzig, who recently stepped
down as chief executive officer, but still remains chairman of the board,
and by Mr Martin Brown, who also still retains a key role in the firm. Ms
Sandra and Mr Martin originally provided programming services for clients in
San Francisco's Bay Area until they started doing some custom programming
between 1972 and 1974.
The first big custom product to come out of this work was a Manufacturing
Automation (MA) system, for which the original logon code was MAMA. But to
fit in with an operating system requirement for a six-letter logon, it was
eventually extended an MANMAN was born. The product was first produced for
HP's range of computers as Ms Sandra's husband was working at HP and she was
able to produce a product to sit on a database on one of HPs minicomputers.
Ms Sandra then produced first the MRP application that used a database on a
minicomputer and was promptly told she couldn't do things like that. After
some hard work and a fair amount of marketing, Ms Sandra's efforts put ASK
well ahead of the market and set the style for the others in the emergent
MRP market - and soon other integrated systems were using databases on
minicomputers.
The real breakthrough in this is that it made an MRP technique, which had
previously only been available to IBM mainframe users in large companies,
available to smaller companies. And now that power is going to be offered to
even smaller enterprises with the availability of a Unix version capable of
running on PCs. It could be the next wave of the MRP revolution.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Safeway tumbles 44.6% to Dollars
20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH competition in the US food retail industry and the pressures of a
lacklustre economy were underscored in the underlying third-quarter earnings
of Safeway, the California-based supermarket group, which tumbled 44.6 per
cent to Dollars 20m, or 17 cents a share.
Net income for the same period of 1991 was distorted by extraordinary items,
which brought net income to Dollars 40.3m, or 33 cents a share.
Stripping-out one-time items, Safeway earned Dollars 36.1m in the quarter.
The company had warned investors to expect earnings to drop about 50 per
cent in the latest three months. On Wall Street, the shares closed down
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 9 7/8 , equal to their 52-week low.
Sales for the 1992 third quarter fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn, while
same-store sales eased 3.5 per cent. The company, which was subject to a
Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, reduced its interest expense in the
latest quarter to Dollars 63.7m from Dollars 82.2m a year earlier.
For the first nine months, Safeway earned Dollars 48.4m, or 41 cents a
share, against Dollars 102.6m, or 91 cents a year earlier. Revenues stood at
Dollars 10.3bn, compared with Dollars 10.46bn last year.
Times Mirror, the US media group, expects third-quarter operating results in
its Newspaper Publishing Group to be considerably lower than those of a year
ago, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
The company gave no figures, but said improving advertising volume at its
eastern newspapers and lower newsprint costs were not sufficient to offset
the sharp declines in advertising revenue at the Los Angeles Times. The
company said newspaper advertising revenues for the four weeks ended August
30 decreased 5.6 per cent, to Dollars 105.7m from Dollars 111.9m in August
1991.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Unfair view
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Red faces at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
yesterday. Three academics it had sponsored to carry out research on the
role of auditors came up with the wrong result.
The daring dons did not exactly stick to the party line, suggesting instead
that audit regulation should be wrested away from the Institute to an
independent 'office for auditing' (Offaudit?).
Rather than blaming the public for the so-called 'expectations gap' - the
difference between what is expected of them and what they actually do -
auditors should actually extend their responsibilities to include the
detection of material fraud.
More radical still, says the report, auditors should be appointed and their
fees determined externally, and not by those on whom they are reporting -
the directors of a company.
The Institute could hardly be said to have presented a 'true and fair' view
of the contents of the report. In the accompanying three-page press release,
it only mentions these recommendations halfway down the second page - though
they come bang at the front of the actual report - and then rebuts them at
equal length.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Vestey takes the helm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It says something about the paucity of talented admirals in Britain's
sinking shipping industry that Edmund Vestey, shy chairman of the family's
Blue Star line, has been refloated as president of the Chamber of Shipping.
It is 11 years since he last held the job and he had to be press-ganged into
serving again. After all, his own business is wallowing somewhat, not to
mention the distraction of being chairman of the Masters of Foxhounds
Association.
There simply aren't enough British shipowners to go round these days. At
least Vestey's fleet is near 50 ships and still expanding, whereas rivals
such as Ben Line, Port Line, Shaw Savill, Ellerman and Blue Funnel have sunk
from sight.
The UK-owned and registered fleet has shrunk from 36m dwt to 3.6m dwt since
Vestey was last president, and the number of seafarers has fallen by two
thirds. Presumably Vestey will follow his predecessors by angling for tax
breaks, albeit probably with no more success.
Indeed, the fact that his own shipping business has prospered undermines the
case for tax perks. Far better to seek a few entrepreneurial recruits for
the chamber's declining membership. And how about abolishing separate messes
for officers and other ranks? That might catch the PM's eye and ensure
Vestey's elusive knighthood.

FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Restructuring at Sears, Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, ROEBUCK, the world's second largest retailer, announced yesterday it
was spinning off or selling a large part of its successful financial
services operation in a large restructuring that should reduce corporate
debt. Analysts estimate the total effect of the restructuring will be to
reduce debt from Dollars 38bn to around Dollars 16.5bn.
The demerger is a big gamble for Sears, which is disposing of its most
profitable operations in the hope that, by reducing debt levels and
concentrating on a few businesses, it will be able to lay a secure
foundation for its loss-making domestic retailing operation.
The units Sears is selling accounted for 27 per cent of the Dollars 1.28bn
in group profits earned last year and 10 per cent of group revenues, which
totalled Dollars 57bn.
In recent years, this operation has lost market share to fast-growing
discount chains and speciality stores.
In the shake-up Sears intends to:
Sell 80 per cent of its Dean Witter Financial Services subsidiary (which
includes the highly profitable securities brokerage and Discover credit card
operations) to shareholders and float the remainder on the stock market via
an initial public offering (IPO) of stock;
Sell to private or public interests all of its Coldwell Banker Residential
Services group, which consists of the property brokerage and relocation
businesses, Sears Mortgage Corp and Sears Savings Bank;
Sell a 20 per cent stake in its Allstate composite insurance subsidiary to
the public in an IPO.
Sears expects the transactions to be completed by the end of next year, by
which time the group will be left to focus on two core businesses: its big
merchandise retailing operation, and its 80 per cent interest in Allstate.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears, said yesterday although its financial
services businesses had been successful 'a thorough assessment of today's
economic and business climate led us to conclude that refocusing our
business strategy, changing our structure, and reducing leverage are all in
the best interests of our shareholders and Sears.'
The demerger will be seen as a victory for the large group of dissident
shareholders who, unhappy with Sears' poor earnings performance, put forward
a plan to spin-off the financial services business at the company's annual
general meeting in May.
News of the restructuring was well received on Wall Street, where Sears
shares climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 in heavy trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBED, the Luxembourg steelmaker, yesterday announced a drastic reduction in
net profits for the first half of this year. The group recorded a profit of
only LFr364m (Dollars 12.1m), compared with LFr3.2bn in the first half of
1991, and warned there was no sign of an upturn in the global or European
economy.
Arbed blamed lower metal prices and the worldwide recession and pledged to
carry out further restructuring, including cuts in production costs, to
limit the damage for the full year.
According to Arbed, steel prices are now as low as they were in 1987, the
lowest point of the last downward cycle to hit the industry.
'The lack of industrial dynamism has been aggravated by increasingly
restrictive monetary and fiscal policy in a number of countries, especially
in the area of interest rates,' said the company.
Turnover in the first half of the year dropped from LFr105bn to LFr98bn, and
the company said it only broke even because steelmaking losses were offset
by non-steel activities, such as cement.
Arbed, Luxembourg's largest industrial employer, said it had been
particularly hit by the weakness of the dollar and losses in the US and
Asian markets, as well as heavy competition from east European
manufacturers.
The removal of EC steel quotas on imports from Poland, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary has taken its toll on all EC steel producers, some of which have
pressed for a reimposition of limits.
Arbed recorded net profits of LFr6bn in the whole of 1991.

Capital Industries, the financial services and industrial group, is to pay
Pounds 7m for Samuel Jones, which makes laminated paper products for
labelling and packaging.
Capital also said it would raise a total of Pounds 8.74m, through a
21-for-20 rights issue at 78p per share, to fund the acquisition and raise
net cash. Capital's shares closed 6p lower at 86p.
Rutland Trust, from which Capital Industries was spun off, has committed
Pounds 4.5m to underwriting the acquisition and is likely to raise its stake
in Capital from 37.4 per cent to 45 per cent. Mr Michael Langdon, deputy
chairman and chief executive of Rutland Trust, will join the board of
Capital as deputy chairman.
Capital meanwhile reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 988,000 (Pounds
640,000) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m in the six months to June 30. Earnings
per share fell to 4.9p (7.3p). The interim dividend is 1.6p (nil).

BRITAIN'S two big general unions - the GMB and TGWU - took another step
towards merger yesterday by announcing a joint recruitment campaign in the
building materials industry.
The unions have agreed to sign people up into each other's union depending
on which is larger in a particular company, and will even ask members to
switch to the stronger union on their site.
Union leaders hinted that the principle might be extended to other
industries where the two unions compete for members - such as the food and
drink industry or hotel and catering.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said: 'There's no reason any more for
competitive trade unions. Working together is the best way to help our
members and to build trade unions.
'I look forward to more co-operation in the future.'
The building materials industry has about 70,000 employees, of whom about
15,000 are in the TGWU and a similar number in the GMB. The campaign will
concentrate on companies such as Marley, Redland, Tarmac and Hanson.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALL OF the 82 greenfield inward investment projects won by businesses in
north-east England and Cumbria since 1987 have settled in 'assisted areas',
a delegation from the regional regeneration body told Mr Tim Sainsbury,
industry minister, yesterday.
The Northern Development Company supports the case for the region's 11
assisted areas to retain their status. It said the government's regional
industrial incentives were vital for the continuation of economic
regeneration in the north.
The company said that the regional policy map, which the government is
reviewing, should be extended to include parts of the north-east coal areas
that face more pit closures. It also said the Copeland and Barrow districts
of Cumbria should be included, having borne the brunt of heavy job losses at
the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing site and VSEL, the builder of
Trident submarines.
Expected job losses in the offshore industry, which employs 20,000 people in
the region, should also be considered, the company argued.
Today is the deadline for submissions on the government review, which it has
indicated is more likely to shrink than to expand the assisted-areas map.
The new map should be published early next year after consultation with the
European Commission.
The company's 15-page lobbying document presented to Mr Sainsbury says
assisted-area designation should respond to long-term structural
unemployment, not short-term fluctuations in the trade cycle.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Move to avert liquidation at MMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL-AUTHORITY policy-holders of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurance
company, will press creditors to accept a scheme of arrangement if this
week's rescue talks with a number of European insurance companies break
down.
The Labour party yesterday said a scheme of arrangement would be 'the
preferable action for both local-authority and individual policyholders'.
In a scheme of arrangement - under Section 425 of the Companies Act - MMI
would cease to trade but continue to administer the payment of claims. That
would avert a potentially costly liquidation of the company.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said such a solution
'is likely to produce better realisations from reinsurance debtors and would
permit earlier dividends to creditors than in the event of a court
winding-up'.
Mr Clive Grenyer, under-secretary of the Conservative-controlled Association
of County Councils, said a scheme would be 'the responsible course of
action'. It would allow local authorities to have at least some of their
outstanding claims paid.
The company yesterday called off a meeting with Mr Grenyer and other
representatives of local-authority associations, because of 'the delicate
nature of negotiations' with the French group, Garantie Mutuelle des
Foncionnaires.
Municipal Mutual insisted that its talks with the French group would take
place as planned this week. GMF said on Monday that it was no longer
interested in acquiring Municipal Mutual's business, but it is understood to
be prepared to act as go-between in MMI's talks with other members of
Eurosafe - a loose network of European companies that sell insurance to
civil servants and local government.
GMF's chairman Mr Jean-Luis Petriat is chairman of the Eurosafe consortium,
whose members also include HUK Coburg of Germany, Societe Mutuelle des
Administrations Publiques of Belgium, Gruppo MEIE Assicuriazioni of Italy,
Nueva Corporacion of Spain, Laederstandens Brandforsikring of Denmark,
Phoenix General Insurance of Greece, Lusitania of Portugal and Les
Assurances Mutuelles d'Europe of Luxembourg.
An increasing number of local authorities, especially those renewing in
October, are considering moving their policies away from Municipal Mutual.
Brokers say insurance cover is available in both the company and Lloyd's
markets, although buyers are generally having to accept much larger excesses
 -the portion of any claim which they must pay.
Some local authorities are reported to be finding difficulty in obtaining
insurance for employers and public liability.
The Consumers' Association pressed the government yesterday to issue a
definitive statement on the future of Municipal Mutual.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Northern Telecom blames recession for 426 jobs cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, yesterday
announced that it was cutting 426 jobs, most of them at its plant in
Northern Ireland.
The company blamed the recession for the redundancies and said the cuts
would reduce overheads and maintain efficiency.
The cuts involve 230 shopfloor posts and 90 managerial and administrative
jobs at the company's Monkstown plant in Newtownabbey.
The Monkstown factory originally belonged to STC, which Northern Telecom
took over two years ago. As a result of yesterday's announcement, the
factory will cease production of a range of products including point-of-sale
tills, power supply units and circuit boards for telephone exchanges.
A further 106 jobs are being lost at the company's plants in Basildon,
Essex, and in south Wales. The Basildon factory is being closed, with most
staff redeployed to nearby sites.
About 700 staff will continue to be employed at the Ulster factory making
high-technology transmission equipment.
The company said the redundancies would take place by the end of the year
and were designed to maintain the company's competitive position.
The workforce was informed at a mass meeting yesterday. A union spokesman
described the redundancies as devastating, in an area of Northern Ireland
already hard hit by redundancies.
Pirelli Cables, the UK subsidiary of the Italian cable and tyre group,
yesterday announced the shedding of nearly 300 jobs.
A total of 240 jobs are to go by the end of the year with the closure of its
copper cable factory at Bishopstoke, Hampshire. From next year, copper cable
production will be concentrated at the company's Newport plant in south
Wales.
Pirelli also said it would shed 50 workers at Newport in order to cut costs
and improve efficiency.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Block on new Peru loans lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE InterAmerican Development Bank has lifted a block on new loans for the
Peruvian government imposed when President Alberto Fujimori suspended the
constitution in April, writes Stephen Fidler.
However, although loans for Dollars 221.8m (Pounds 129.7m) were signed last
week to provide balance of payments support for reforms in the country's
financial sector, the bank will not disburse funds until after the
government has met conditions related to a return to constitutional rule.
The loans were approved by the IADB board on March 18, but the signing, due
to take place at the bank's annual meeting in April, was postponed after Mr
Fujimori's move.
It was not clear yesterday specifically what conditions had to be met before
the loans would be disbursed. The bank wants to encourage further economic
reform in Peru, but is unwilling to send too strong a signal of support to
Mr Fujimori until there is hard evidence of a return to constitutional rule.
Peru cleared its arrears to the IADB a year ago, allowing the bank to resume
lending. However, the IMF and World Bank are unable to lend, since Mr
Fujimori's actions jeopardised a multinational support operation designed to
bring Peru out of arrears with the two institutions.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (32): Europe, the universe,
and everything
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS IT was predictable: 1992 is the year of European integration, so you
can just imagine harried publishers scratching their heads a while back and
deciding to commission a series of Euro-business and language guides.
Essential information, where to stay, how to start a company . . .
Need to tell your Italian contact that you now use CD ROM storage for
financial records? Buy Essential Business Italian (Hodder &amp; Stoughton,
Pounds 4.99, 200 pages), turn to page 55 and the world's your ostrica. Or
your huitre, auster, ostra, should you wish to repeat such stilted phrases
in more than one language - the gurus at Hodder decided to repeat the
formula in Europe's main business languages.
Meanwhile at Cassell, an inadequate twist: should you wish, you can turn
instead to its Business Companions series. These glorified phrase books are
indeed 'new for the single European market'. At Pounds 12.99 a piece they
are also expensive.
The question publishers such as Hodder and Cassell should ask themselves is
who is going to buy such books. There cannot be many cross-border executives
who will learn very much from these guides. Perhaps the business travel
market has become more linguistically sophisticated, but in that case why
should anyone need help with such basic questions?
At least such books have limited pretensions. A companion series by Hodder
ambitiously suggests you can teach yourself Business German, a complete
course for beginners (Pounds 6.99, 218 pages), although it concedes that a
grammar might be a useful accompanying tool. That suggestion becomes
laughable when one opens Business Japanese, but perhaps the less said about
that the better.
Just as well, then, that Hodder has somewhat redeemed itself with Languages
in International Business: A Practical Guide (Pounds 10.99, 242 pages). The
editors adopt an appropriately serious tone and address sensible questions,
such as how can companies ensure that they have an organised approach to
language, defined as everything from staff training to promotional material.
This book does not set out to provide all the answers, but it does point to
the main pitfalls and as such is well worth the price for companies
venturing abroad for the first time.
That basic quality is central to the success of Working in France (Frank
Books, Pounds 8.99, 194 pages), where the emphasis is on how to find jobs
and even a career in the tricky French labour market. Advice covers
everything from graphology to where in Paris foreigners go to network.
Therein lies a warning for UK readers; the book has a US perspective which
at times is unhelpful. But in combination with Tim Green's useful and
amusing Real French; a thematic guide to fluency in speech and writing
(Harrap, Pounds 5.95, 127 pages), the aspiring citizen of Europe can get
down to some serious integration.

THE CHATTO BOOK OF OFFICE LIFE edited by Jeremy Lewis Chatto Pounds 14.99,
393 pages
WHY THIS anthology? The predictable are here - Wodehouse's Psmith in the
City, Sinclair Lewis' The Job, badly-aged 1970s horrors like The Death of
Reginald Perrin, all quoted so extensively that Jeremy Lewis has to
apologise: 'Repetition and familiarity are of the essence of office life'.
But this will not do for a selection that aims to entertain. Cumulatively,
it offers wry amusement of the self-disparagingly British kind, in the
reflections on national character, on our unchanging class-ridden and
irreverent attitudes to work. One-liners sometimes raise a smirk, but mostly
this choice is mediocre, unfunny.
Truly witty novels about work, like Scoop, are too sophisticated to retain
their sparkle in the slimline extracts allowed into an anthologer's
categories. Lloyd's most famous bank clerk was TS Eliot, and the best-loved
life insurance salesman was US poet Wallace Stevens, but neither dwelt on
the office out of hours. Kenneth Grahame, literature's most notable
Secretary of the Bank of England, and Charles Lamb, of the East India
Company, did; however, their hours were 10 till 4, and both wrote most of
their books at their office. Could they have done so now? And what of Kafka,
the world's most famous insurance clerk?

THE COMPLETE BOOK OF BUSINESS ETIQUETTE: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO GETTING
AHEAD IN BUSINESS by Lynne Brennan and David Block Piatkus Books Pounds
8.99, 185 pages
IN THE American Wild West of the last century, you had to park your shooting
irons before entering a saloon; before gaining admission to the restaurant
in the London Ritz, the customer is nowadays invited to park his mobile
telephone. And I am told that the food is not too bad either.
This little gem of information comes my way from The Complete Book of
Business Etiquette, a compact guide of all the essentials needed to get on
in business.
For example, we are told that uncultivated behaviour at business meetings
exposes 'who is garrulous, but ill-informed; who is well-informed but a poor
communicator; who is dynamic but emotionally driven; who has integrity and
who may be treacherous.' Don't we all know someone in at least one of those
camps?
But do not gossip about them within the company, since that, too, is not
etiquette. It can also be downright harmful, since when gossip and rumour
are malicious and destructive, they can harm careers, business
relationships, even the company itself.
So, no malicious gossip, and no other contraventions of corporate or
individual business etiquette.
For example, no firm handshaking of Japanese businessmen, and certainly no
slapping on the back. Master the art of Japanese bowing - which is not too
easy, since there are said to be 26 combinations of depth and quality of
bows.
On the other hand, firm handshakes are very much the thing in the Arab
business world and, after a long period of acquaintance can even develop
into a warm embrace and kisses on the cheeks. But we warned: non-Arab women
must not be touched under any circumstances.
All in all, says the wide-ranging guide, good business etiquette is of
enormous importance in business today; it will help your company to win and
keep its customers and will also help to win promotion and personal success.
Not a bad promise for a practical book costing less than the strawberries
and cream at Wimbledon.

NOTHING PERSONAL: THE BUSINESS OF SEX by Donald McRae Mainstream Pounds
14.99, 304 pages
BUTTERFLIES OF THE NIGHT by Lisa Louis Weatherhill Pounds 12.99, 214 pages
HAVE YOU ever wanted to see your financial adviser given a stern talking to?
Then soundly thrashed? And made to pay for it at three times the rate he
charges for his own professional services? If you think he would not enjoy
it too much, send him to Madame M, a woman in full possession of her
destiny, along with a cupboard of whips, ten clients a week, a Jersey
account and Pounds 70,000 a year.
Madame M, or Mandy, features in Donald McRae's informing, alarming and sad
book about the sex industry in England, Nothing Personal. She comes from a
wealthy family, has a couple of university degrees in philosophy, and at 30
embarked on a five-year mission to boldly give what no man has had before
and accrue a tidy sum as a purveyor of sado-masochistic (S &amp; M) fantasy to
the rich.
In the fantasy chamber, she introduces McRae to one of her clients for a
confidential chat: his name is Robert and he works as a market analyst. He
appears in a black leather cat-suit with an all-covering hood, and McRae
conducts a bizarre interview with the muffled city slicker which would be
high comedy if it were not such a sorry spectacle.
'Of course it's gonna seem strange to you at first', Mandy tells McRae, 'S &amp;
M goes to the root of people's darkest fears and desires. It's about
domination and submission, about control and abandonment, about pleasure and
pain.' It's also about Pounds 1,500 a week. So much for Mandy, but try to
avoid her friend, the penta-lingual Simone, who works in the basement with
needles and branding irons. She has Edward Munch's The Scream on the wall,
probably to take her clients' minds off her Pounds 1,000 hourly rate.
Pounds 1,000 in King's Cross would cover a year's weekly diversion of some
form. McRae writes on the range of sex for sale available on the street, via
telephone booths, in Soho bedsits and dingy peepshows. And it is not all
male clients. McRae includes a couple of edgy interviews with Rachel and
Arlene who speak out on the taboo of women paying men for sex.
But at last McRae meets Sara Dale, late of Shiny Housewife International,
peddling therapeutic sex and sympathy; then onward to a dreadful Soho pimp
and a pathetic Chinatown prostitute who supports her boyfriend's Pounds 100
a day heroin habit. Only once does McRae confront the fact that his
'anthropological' interest is bound to a darker voyeurism. But his humanity
persists in his humour: in the riotous assault by a big black woman who
thinks he might like and pay for it, in the absurdity of writing an
Afrikaans message to a Dutch 'peep show' stripper, and in the suburban
strangeness of sexual healing in Surbiton.
The message of Nothing Personal is that the sooner prostitution is
decriminalised the better, perhaps along the lines of Sara Dale's 'Career
Prostitution' charter for safe working conditions along with respect and
confidentiality with accompanying protection from disease, harassment and
non-payment.
In Japan, as Lisa Louis' Butterflies of the Night rightly suggests, matters
are more open and less hypocritical than in England, but every bit as sad.
Louis' approach is less implicated than McRae's. She enters the Kyoto mizu
shobai, the night life of Japan's bars, clubs and sex emporia, to interview
Geishas, Mama-sans and hostesses. She talks to waitresses in the noo pan
kissa (no-panty coffee shop) and soapers at the Sopurando or 'Soapland', a
modernised version of the old Toruku (Turkish bath), in which the girl uses
herself as a human sponge to massage the client. That might make Madam
Butterfly the world's first soap opera star.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): Weekend papers have
the edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHERE DOES the intelligent Briton in the street look for guidance about
money? The UK's specialist press is notably less powerful than the
corresponding publications in the US, where Barron's, Forbes, Money and a
variety of other periodicals command large circulations.
The main reason for the weakness of the financial magazine sector in Britain
is the unusually influential role of the weekend newspapers, both Saturday
and Sunday. Britain's uniquely strong and numerous national daily and Sunday
newspapers have blotted out various sectors which are powerful in other
countries, such as weekly newsmagazines, and they make life very tough in
the financial category too.
Exactly why the Saturday papers, in particular, should have been able to
seize the high ground of consumer financial advice is not clear, but at the
right season of the year and in a good phase of the market cycle the Daily
Telegraph on Saturday can carry anything up to a dozen pages on family
finance, packed with lucrative advertising.
Our own Weekend FT, of course, runs 'Finance and the Family' pages each
Saturday. The Daily Mail, however, prefers to run its Money Mail on a
Wednesday.
In the face of this competition the specialist magazines are forced into
niches. The Pounds 1.50 weekly Investors Chronicle (owned by the FT group)
has long focused upon private shareholders who want to keep track of the
companies they have invested in. Really enthusiastic amateur investors can
subscribe to a much newer monthly called Analyst, which at a thumping Pounds
240 for an annual subscription seeks to provide something close to a
personal advice service for private shareholders.
More specialist still are the numerous small circulation newsletters and
tip-sheets which reached their peak of prosperity back before the 1987 stock
market crash, when they could still boast in their advertising of how they
had picked Polly Peck at 8p and seen it climb to 800p. In much leaner times
the boastful ads have all but disappeared. The problem for the Penny Share
Guide and its like came to be that too many shares fell to a penny.
The mid-1980s also brought brief prosperity to the monthly finance magazines
such as Money (now Moneywise) and What Investment, the latter notable for
its extraordinary content of reply-paid coupons.
These publications cashed in on the unit trust boom but since 1987 have
found life much harder as money has shifted to building society accounts and
life and pension policies (which are aggressively sold through
intermediaries rather than advertised in the press).
But given a decent bull market the financial magazines could be packing the
newsagents' shelves once again.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): No room for glossies
in the UK - The failure of general business magazines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RHYS DAVID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FINANCE to fine art': that is what purchasers were promised at the
high-profile launch in 1986 of Business magazine. A gap - or so it was
thought - had been spotted for a high quality magazine dealing with business
issues and interests. And, with the Financial Times contributing its firm
grasp of what the business world wanted, and with the US group, Conde Nast,
offering its expertise in producing Vogue and other glossy magazines, it was
difficult to see how the project could fail, especially under the overall
control of minority shareholder Kevin Kelly, founder of one of the
publishing successes of the 1980s, World of Interiors.
Yet only five years later the two groups were forced to retire with heavy
losses, having failed to overturn one of the unwritten rules of UK
publishing - that a market does not exist for a successful, paid-for,
general business magazine.
The timing for the launch of Business could not have been more favourable.
In 1986 the stock market was still rising and unemployment falling. The
banks were falling over themselves to lend money for business start-ups, or
simply for personal consumption.
In keeping with the spirit of the times, Business set out to write about the
individuals who had become icons of the new boom age - not just successful
businessmen such as Lord Hanson, Sir John Harvey-Jones and Richard Branson,
but the likes of advertising enfant terrible Graham Fink, PR man
extraordinaire, Brian Basham, restaurant PR, Alan Crompton-Batt, and
designer Wally Olins. Others were similarly tempted by the apparent
opportunities. Eurobusiness, launched shortly after Business, was an attempt
to capitalise on the growing integration of European business.
During its existence, Business was not lacking in critical acclaim, or, for
most of the time, advertising. Prizes it won included 'Magazine of the Year'
and 'Business Magazine of the Year'. Its journalists also kept winning
awards. Until the bottom fell out of the advertising market in 1991, it also
managed to attract some of the most stylish advertising around, from
overseas banks, prestige carmakers, men's clothing manufacturers and other
advertisers anxious to present their wares in a high-quality environment.
Yet, in the words of its former chairman, Conde Nast's Daniel Salem,
Business was only a succes d'estime, and it never attracted readers in
sufficient numbers to keep going. Everybody seemed to love it, including
British Airways, which bought it for its Concorde, First and Club Class
cabins, and BMW, which advertised in every issue. Not enough people wanted
to buy it, however, to keep its advertising rate card moving forward in line
with inflation, or to bring in the extra advertisers that were still needed.
Circulation was held only with difficulty around the 45,000 to 50,000 mark,
in spite of a battery of subscriber incentives and tie-ups, including, late
in the day, a deal with the Association of MBAs which bought it for all its
members.
The contrast with comparable European countries is at first sight puzzling.
The German business magazine Capital sells more than 300,000 each month,
with Manager, a broadly similar magazine to Business, on 100,000-plus. In
most other European countries, too, there are strong business magazines. In
the US, where the success of business magazines was seen as a good portent
for a similar UK product, Forbes has a circulation above 700,000 and Fortune
is not far behind with more than 650,000, while even the very solid Harvard
Business Review has more than 200,000 purchasers every two months.
The problem in Britain, if it is one, has to be seen in terms of the quality
daily and Sunday press, and of the two main financial news magazines, the
Economist and Investors Chronicles, which between them clearly offer as
comprehensive a coverage of business as even the most avid business reader
is likely to require, and at better publishing intervals.
With a monthly publishing schedule Business, though it did get a number of
scoops, always felt it had to veer towards the offbeat. Really big financial
stories - such as the present UK sterling crisis - could not have been
touched because the magazine was always likely to be overtaken by events.
In other countries where there is a strong business magazine presence,
including Germany and the US, the press is more fragmented regionally,
making it much easier for nationalmagazines to position themselves at the
centre of business debates.
So, what options does this leave the would-be UK business magazine
entrepreneur, other than to invest elsewhere? In Britain the complement to a
strong national business press is a vibrant trade press, providing news,
views and features and, crucially, acting as the job search medium for
individuals working within the sector concerned. Because of its general
nature and monthly cycle, Business was never able to act as an information
board in this way
Even in the trade press, successful paid-for subscriber or newsstand
launches are now almost unheard-of. Most new entrants rely on the controlled
circulation route, and almost all those that are paid-for, such as The
Grocer, Caterer and Hotelkeeper and Estates Gazette have a long history and
deeply entrenched position to protect them against newer controlled
circulation rivals.
In the business field, the two surviving members of the triumvirate to which
Business used to belong, Management Today and The Director, both rely on
controlled circulation as their core readership - managers belonging to the
British Institute of Management in the one case and directors in the
Institute of Directors in the other. Both groups receive copies of their
respective magazines as part of their subscription.
Yet, the idea of a general UK business magazine keeps cropping up and it is
perhaps possible that a maverick operation might just work, as one
entrepreneur, Tom Rubython, seems determined to demonstrate. His first
venture into the general business magazine field was Management Week, an
irreverent mix of often none too flattering personality profiles, guru
potboilers, and 'management' news stories. It folded last year after not
many months' publication, but has now been reborn as Business Age, complete
with Business magazine's former slogan - Britain's best-selling business
magazine.
It may succeed, though the lessons of Business and Eurobusiness, and other
general titles such as Punch and The Listener, are not encouraging. In the
UK, unless there is a specialist category, or an area such as men's fashion
(which as GQ and Esquire spotted was not being covered in depth in the daily
press), newspapers rule.
Rhys David was publisher of Business magazine from 1988-1991.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (27): Work, death and other
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE EVER died from hard work, we reassure ourselves in those Western
countries which have adopted the Protestant work ethic. But the Japanese,
who should know, have a word for it: karoshi, meaning death by overwork.
Europe has not gone as far as the US in regarding a punishing work schedule
as a virility symbol rather than a sign that the company or the individual
is poorly organised. But the reverse of rising unemployment statistics is
increased pressure on those still in work. Awareness of the these pressures
has led to the growth of a consultancy industry aimed at tackling the
problems of managing time and stress. Courses and books on the subject now
abound.
Taken to absurd extremes they suggest a regime of obsessive note-taking to
establish work patterns and the implementation of artificial procedures to
reduce non-productive time. Taken sensibly they can throw a revealing light
on the disorganisation that lies beneath our apparently well-structured
lives.
Better Time Management (Jacqueline Atkinson, Thorsons, Pounds 5.99, 240
pages) begins with a series of questions. What sort of a problem do you
have? asks Ms Atkinson, a psychologist and an academic. Do you spend too
much time on trivial matters? Are you never able to finish one thing before
starting on something else? Are you unable to say No when asked to do
another job? Or do problems press in from the outside in the shape of too
many interruptions to your work routine?
You will not be able solve your time management problems overnight since
they probably reflect habits which have been ingrained over ten or 20 years,
says Ms Atkinson. But by analysing your present pattern of work and leisure
and making a conscious effort to plan your day you should be able to work to
greater effect and find more time for leisure pursuits.
Start by estimating how much time you spend each week at work, with family,
doing chores, following hobbies. Next keep a time log of how much time you
actually devote to these different activities. A detailed study of your
working day will probably show that a one-hour meeting took up to two hours
when you take into account the 'hidden time consumers.'
One sensible suggestion made in this practical and jargon-free guide is to
untangle realistic goals from daydreams. Many people dream of learning a
foreign language or mastering a musical instrument. But unless we make these
activities a real goal and fit them into our time schedules they become a
source of extra stress and frustration.
Time is Money: Save It (Lothar Seiwert, Kogan Page, Pounds 9.99, 222 pages)
covers much of the same ground, though the style is more academic. Diagrams
and mathematical symbols are used extensively to convey a somewhat spurious
precision.
Mr Seiwert, a time management consultant, suggests that you identify your
top five time-wasters from a 30-strong list which includes a failure to set
priorities, taking on too many tasks, lengthy meetings and procrastination.
When drawing up a timetable of activities set yourself specific goals - such
as reaching agreement on a particular issue - rather than just 'meeting with
so and so.'
Most work days have their productive periods, early in the morning or while
others are at lunch, and their less productive periods, so it makes sense to
time important tasks to take place in the most productive periods, Mr
Seiwert suggests.
Working Ourselves to Death (Diane Fassel, Thorsons, Pounds 6.99, 156 pages)
devotes more time to considering the causes of workaholism than it does to
suggesting a cure. This is less of a practical handbook than an apocalyptic
warning of what will happen if we fail to curb our over-emphasis on work.
Achieving a sound balance between the time we devote to work and to other
leisure activities is clearly an important one but Ms Fassel, a consultant
on work-related problems, spoils her case by exaggeration. 'Workaholics no
longer own their own lives,' she states. 'They are truly the walking dead.'
Ms Fassel's remedy for the disease involves limiting the time spent at work
or drawing up a work plan to restore balance. Companies may need to change
their systems if they demand too much of employees.
She borrows a programme of recovery from the techniques practiced by
Alcoholics Anonymous but rejects conventional time and stress management
techniques. These can become part of the problem, she argues, because they
create the illusion that the disease can be controlled and delay more
radical action.
One workaholic quoted by Ms Fassel went as far as pretending to join his
local golf club while using the time to make business calls. He was only
found out when his wife suspected he was having an affair. You may not have
let work take over your life to this extent but you might still benefit from
reviewing how you spend your time.

CORPORATE TAKEOVERS AND PRODUCTIVITY by Frank LichtenbergThe MIT Press
Pounds 26.95
CULTURAL, STRUCTURAL AND STRATEGIC CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS by Sebastian
Green and Dean F Berry Macmillan Pounds 45
ORGANISATIONAL CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE edited by Charles Harvey
and Geoffrey Jones Cass Pounds 24
IN SPITE OF the apparently diverse subjects suggested by the titles of these
books, corporate capability, productivity and change are their interlinked
themes, and all three books take a historical perspective.
Corporate Takeovers and Productivity revisits the question of whether
takeovers are worth the fuss. It examines the United States Census Bureau
and other data to investigate the effects of the explosive takeover activity
(in M&amp;As as well as LBOs) of the 1970s and 1980s on the productivity and
market share of manufacturing plants, on fixed investment and R&amp;D, on the
employment and wages of blue- as well as white-collar workers, and on
corporate diversification.
Lichtenberg finds that the least productive plants are the most likely to
change owners, that takeovers do not significantly reduce the employment and
wages of blue-collar and R&amp;D workers, but do significantly reduce the
employment and wages of white-collar workers; and that the effects of US
mergers and acquisitions are different from the effects of foreign mergers
and acquisitions, and different again from the effects of American LBOs.
Confirming Lichtenberg's findings, Green and Berry's Cultural, Structure and
Strategic Change in MBOs examines six case studies from different
industries, concluding that MBOs have succeeded as outstandingly as they
have principally because of the social, cultural, behavioural and strategic
changes which they were able to put in place. Most of the changes could
easily be implemented by any organisation which was so minded.
The puzzle, therefore, is not why MBOs did accomplish such changes, but why
do not the normal run of organisations manage it? Is it merely a question of
size, so that giantism defeats the best of its children, who need to be
liberated from its thrall in order to demonstrate what they can accomplish?
Berry and Green do not attempt to answer those questions. Organisational
Capability and Competitive Advantage does. And what a stunning collection of
essays it is, looking at managerial enterprises, marketing, industry
structure, the influence of the trademark on the rise of the modern
corporation, the relationship between corporate strategy and accounting
systems, the relationship between America's Graduate Business Schools and
American business, and regulatory responses to the market for corporate
control. The essays in this book help clarify and develop our understanding
of how firms and nations compete successfully or fail in an increasingly
competitive world.
If the message of the first two books is relatively simple and clear, the
message of the third is more difficult to summarise.
Though Porter's work has recently somewhat overshadowed Chandler's, his
concepts of organisational capability and Porter's concept of competitive
advantage are potent and valued tools in the analysis of modern business.
Chandler's conclusion regarding the British economy, which is described
elsewhere as 'the most unsuccessful advanced economy of the twentieth
century,' is that it is both short-termist and oriented toward financial
manipulation - and that this orientation has depleted the economic strength
of the country as well as of individual firms by directing attention away
from the underlying economic logic of corporate growth.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): Publishing - reading
between the lines / A look at mega-mergers and the Frankfurt Book Fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW FAR can the accelerating internationalisation of book marketing and
concentration of publishing go? Much farther, if the recent merger of the
UK-based Reed International with the Dutch publisher Elsevier, forming one
of the world's largest publishing and information groups, is anything to go
by.
The 1980's saw some mammoth publishing takeovers - Reed paying Pounds 540m
for Octopus, News Corporation Dollars 300m for Harper and Row, Hachette
Dollars 470m for Grolier, and Maxwell Communications Corporation the
(restrospectively outlandish) sum of Dollars 2.6bn for the US publisher
Macmillan - which, along with acquisitions in other media and advertising
areas, were more volcanic than fertile.
This year's Frankfurt book fair, is, according to some observers, likely to
be calmer than in previous years, reflecting the strains felt by consumer
book publishers everywhere. At the same time, its importance can only grow
as the European Community's single market becomes a reality and
transnational publishers generate more ways of selling a product across
frontiers. According to Paul Hamlyn, chairman of Octopus, part of the Reed
group: 'Book publishing will become more international and there will be
more hook-ups between America and Britain; we didn't do the Elsevier deal
because of books, but it helps.'
Of much greater, though less headline-grabbing significance, has been the
stealthy process by which English has become the international language for
educational, business and information publishers.
The Reed-Elsevier merger exemplifies the shift towards multinationalism via
the unifying factor of the English language. Although a Dutch company,
Elsevier has made itself a globally important English-language publisher
through its science publications. Its merger with Reed will smooth access to
other markets. The combined group would have revenues of Pounds 2.44bn and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 424m, based on forecasts for the year ending
December 31 1991.
Attempts to market books on a more global level are being made by other
publishers through means other than straightforward mergers. For example, an
international consortium of 16 publishers, led by Orion in the UK and Basic
Books in the US (a division of HarperCollins), announced at the start of
September a co-operative venture to publish scientific texts under a joint
imprint called Science Masters. The initial 12 texts will be simultaneously
marketed in more than 50 countries, initially in 16 large markets from the
autumn of 1994.
Within the EC, one issue which is currently on slow burn - though it may
heat up before the end of the century - concerns the levying of Value Added
Tax on books. Zero rating on books currently prevails in Ireland, Italy,
Norway, Portugal and the UK, but there is pressure to get those countries
into line with other EC members, most of which levy VAT at 6 per cent.
The global market for book publishing is still dominated by the US. While
the former Soviet republics and China are huge publishers, lack of reliable
statistics, political turmoil and absence of accurate means of financial
comparison means that the measure is still the US market.
According to a 1992 survey by Euromonitor, studying the performance of the
international book market in 1990, the US remains the largest book
publishing market, measured in terms of publishers' net sales, at Dollars
7.9bn (Pounds 4.46bn) annually, followed by Germany (Dollars 5.1bn), France
(Dollars 2.83bn), Italy (Dollars 2.81bn), the UK (Dollars 2.35bn) and Spain
(Dollars 2.15bn). But in terms of per capita annual spending on books, the
league table looks very different: Germany Dollars 64.79; Spain Dollars
55.74; France Dollars 50.32; Italy Dollars 48.86; UKDollars 41.40; and the
US Dollars 31.94.
In the US the recession has meant that publishers are being more cautious,
cutting the volume of new titles. According to Publishers Week, in 1990 the
number of titles published in the US fell by 27 per cent to 46,976, with
imported titles falling ever further, by 35 per cent. Particularly badly hit
were hardback and trade publications, falling from 53,446 in 1989 to 38,884
in 1990. Mass market paperbacks fared better, dropping from 3,722 titles in
1989 to 3,347 in 1990.
In value terms sales rose by 4.4 per cent in real terms over 1989, following
three years of real growth averaging 6.5 per cent. In the US consumer
expenditure on books and maps reached Dollars 12.5bn in 1990, up 3 per cent
in real terms but still less than 1 per cent of total consumer spending.
Euromonitor forecasts real growth in the US book publishing industry of 33
per cent by 1995, ahead of all other markets, with Germany (29 per cent) in
second place.
But there are still growth possibilities in children's books and in mystery
fiction, which almost 13 per cent of all adults purchased in 1990, making it
the best-selling category. The outlook for the immediate future in the US is
conditioned by at least one major demographic change; between now and 1995
some 3m school students will enter the market, which should encourage
educational specialist publishers.
In the UK the last decade has seen considerable growth. Publishers' revenues
more than doubled, from Pounds 907m in 1981 to Pounds 1.9bn in 1990, with
real annual growth of about 2.5 per cent. But 1991 was a very poor year for
the UK book trade; the number of books sold to the public - which account
for two-thirds of the Pounds 2.1bn overall UK market - fell by between 10
and 15 per cent on 1990. Euromonitor forecasts real growth in the UK market
of 5 per cent by 1995.
Publishers have been forced to cut costs by reducing the number of books
printed and publishing fewer new titles. Last year there were thousands of
job losses across the 18,000-strong industry, with 600 redundancies in one
month alone.
'It's a tough time for everybody and the US market is rougher than here.
There is a consumer resistance both in the US and the UK; the competition
for the leisure pound and dollar is getting greater. But it is an increasing
market; a lot of people do not buy books at all so the potential is there,'
says Paul Hamlyn.
In the UK the industry has polarised, between very large generalist
conglomerates and very small specialists, both in publishing and retailing.
Smaller publishing houses have been swallowed up by larger ones, so that of
the top ten UK publishers by turnover, only three - Macmillan, Oxford
University Press and Hodder &amp; Stoughton - are now not part of a large media
conglomerate. Specialist publishers of professional and educational books,
with more captive audiences, have done much better than publishers of
consumer books.
The dominant issue in UK book publishing is the future of the Net Book
Agreement, the mechanism which sets minimum prices for most books. A year
ago Dillons, the chain owned by the Pentos group, discounted the prices of a
range of books, following Reed's decision to publish its books outside the
NBA.
Were the NBA to disappear the multinationals could become more powerful,
able to exploit the competitive advantage of size. The NBA's abolition could
encourage book sellers to demand higher discounts from their suppliers'
publishers, thereby squeezing publishers' margins.
'I think the NBA is an absurdity now, only fit for dinosaurs. It should go
and people in the book industry should spend their time thinking about
selling more books. If the NBA disappeared book sales would increase by 10
to 25 per cent because they would be sold in places where the public is; in
the UK the public are not exposed to books now,' argues Hamlyn.

MACRO ECONOMICS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY by Jeffrey Sachs and Felipe Larrain B.
Prentice Hall
HOW DOES he find the time?
Mr Jeffrey Sachs is best known as the West's principle economic
fire-fighter, dousing various inflationary blazes across eastern Europe and
Latin America, but he is primarily an academic economist at Harvard
University in the US, a teacher and now a successful textbook author, too.
Macro Economics in the Global Economy is an impressive achievement. Sachs,
with his co-author, Felipe Larrain, of the Pontificia Universitidad Catolica
de Chile, has managed to instill much of his knowledge and experience of
policy-making into a readable textbook for intermediate undergraduates.
This is not of the usual textbook school - turgid, dry, parochial and
divorced from the real world. For scores of European students, who have been
forced up to now to study from US-centric economic texts, this book will
bring welcome relief.
It is innovative in three main ways:
from the outset it takes an international perspective, recognising that in
today's inter-dependent world of free-flowing capital and exchange rate
fluctuations, no economy can be studied in isolation from its trading
partners, even the US.
it focuses on the importance of institutional differences - in wage-setting
or the making of monetary policy - in explaining cross-country variations in
national economic forms.
rather than simplifying by excluding, it incorporates the most modern theory
and tackles difficult issues in an accessible way.
It is not an easy read - 750 pages, many of which contain algebra as well as
words and pictures, may put off readers who are not required to study it by
apparently over-zealous professors.
However, that would be a mistake. It is a book that repays effort. The bulk
of the text breathes life into the basic theory of international macro
economics, using many empirical and real world applications.
But it is in the final five chapters that it excels. Covering the making of
economic policy, financial markets, traded and non-traded goods, the
developing country debt crisis and stabilisation in high inflation
countries, they are superb examples of how to combine theory, evidence and
experience in explaining economics.

US reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
REVIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM by Alice M Rivlin The Brookings Institution
Dollars 15.95 190 pages
THERE IS no shortage of books and pamphlets arguing the case for US domestic
reforms. What makes Alice Rivlin's contribution unique and timely is her
focus on different levels of US government. She argues convincingly that
social and economic problems are likely to be solved only if far more
careful attention is paid to the division of responsibilities between
federal and state government.
The American dream of rapidly rising prosperity has faded primarily because
the growth of labour productivity has slowed sharply in the past two
decades. With output per worker no longer growing quickly, real wages and
the living standards of many families have stagnated.
Ms Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former
director of the Congressional Budget Office, argues that the federal
government should focus mainly on macroeconomic tasks. The most important is
to eliminate the huge budget deficits that absorb the greater part of the
savings of individuals and companies. Indeed, ideally the federal government
should generate regular surpluses. What Washington should not be asked to do
is oversee the microeconomic reforms that are so badly needed if workers are
to use capital more efficiently.
She argues that state governments - rather than distant bureaucrats in
Washington - should assume full responsibility for running programmes
designed to improve labour productivity. The 'productivity agenda' would
include the reform of education, the creation of new job training programmes
and the overhaul of crumbling infrastructure.
Ms Rivlin argues persuasively that such tasks are best entrusted to state
governments because they require 'bottom up' reforms and close attention to
local conditions. The skill training required in Louisiana, for example, may
differ sharply from that deemed appropriate in Maine or Montana.
Giving states responsibility for the crucial task of raising productivity
would allow Washington to devolve many of its responsibilities. It could
eliminate most of its programmes in education, housing, social services,
economic development and training. As a quid pro quo, says Ms Rivlin,
Washington should assume full responsibility for controlling health care
costs and guaranteeing access to care. At present, the soaring cost of
Medicaid, the joint state-federal health care scheme for poor families, is
putting state budgets under intense strain.
But even if states were able to escape financial responsibility for
escalating health care costs, the productivity agenda would represent an
intolerable burden.
Perhaps the most imaginative part of Ms Rivlin's plan is thus a radical
reform of state finances. She argues that the US has much to learn from
German federalism. In Germany, the central government collects most of the
taxes but shares much of the revenue with the Lander. For example, German
companies pay a value added tax whose proceeds are shared between the
federal government and the Lander, with disproportionate shares going to the
poorest regions. If similar shared taxes were introduced in the US, state
governments could be put on a permanently stable financial footing.
Starting in the 1930s, the role of the federal government expanded rapidly,
partly because state governments were frequently corrupt and inefficient. Ms
Rivlin points out that the quality of state government has improved sharply
since the 1960s: the most talented individuals and the most imaginative
reform plans are now often to be found in state capitals rather than
Washington. The time is thus ripe for a transfer of responsibilities back to
the states.
A redrawing of boundaries between state and federal government, Ms Rivlin
suggests, might help restore faith in government as well as enhance
productivity. People are cynical because modern presidents have repeatedly
promised action in spheres - such as education and industrial development -
where their ability to influence events is limited. If tasks were allocated
to the appropriate level of government, promises might be met and public
cynicism reduced.
As one of the more original contributions to the growing literature on US
domestic reform, Ms Rivlin's book deserves a wide readership. It is likely
to influence public policy whoever wins this year's presidential race.

RUPERT MURDOCH: RINGMASTER OF THE INFORMATION CIRCUS by William
ShawcrossChatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18.99, 616 pages
TREACHEROUS ESTATE: THE PRESS AFTER FLEET STREET by Michael Leapman Hodder &amp;
Stoughton, Pounds 18.99, 304 pages
THERE ARE many Rupert Murdochs, some real, some mythical. There is Murdoch
the dark soul behind an Evil Empire, Murdoch the inspired businessman whose
destiny it is to be one of the most important princes in the global village,
and Murdoch the gambler who almost forfeited his empire through high-priced
acquisitions.
Then there is the Murdoch who can charm the birds out of the trees (before
trapping them), not to mention the man who can be both generous and mean,
who can show great loyalty and yet who dumped many of those who helped him.
A man with a romantic side but with little imagination and, for good
measure, a complex mixture of modesty, shyness and enormous ego.
There are already a number of books about this complex and driven character.
Some condemn him, some predict his imminent demise, some are simply cuttings
jobs. With Rupert Murdoch: Ringmaster of the Information Circus, William
Shawcross has written the best, fairest and most comprehensive account which
comes to terms, as far as anyone can, with the perennial question: What
Makes Rupert Run?
It will not please those who have come to throw stones. Shawcross does not
judge, although he provides ample evidence on which judgment can be made.
Murdoch may be 'an entrepreneur of genius' but broken promises, plunges down
market and cruel personal decisions have been carefully catalogued.
It can also only be described as the best Murdoch book so far. At 61, 'the
Dirty Digger' is only getting into his stride. After mastering newspapers
and television stations, Murdoch, controller of one of the world's largest
media empires, is now learning the nuts and bolts of running Twentieth
Century Fox film studios.
He is also looking forward to the day - perhaps 20 years off - when every
home has a single integrated box giving access to an entire world of
pictures and information. Murdoch wants to be part of that process, even if
it is as an 80-year-old non-executive chairman of The News Corporation.
But as Shawcross graphically tells, Murdoch scarcely made it beyond December
6 1990, when News Corp's Dollars 7.6bn (Pounds 4.3bn) debt crisis came to a
head through a small loan owed to a small bank in Pittsburgh, US. Murdoch
owed money to 146 banks and all had to be kept in the refinancing or the
package would fall apart. The Pittsburgh loan officer was not prepared to
roll over the loan, even if it meant the liquidation of News Corp.
After failing to get the bank's president even to accept his call, Rupert
Murdoch made the most important 'phone call of his life ('I had to beg', he
said). The bank official agreed to roll over the loan and Murdoch had
survived. As always, he was prepared to do what it took to do that.
Apart from being balanced and comprehensive, two things stand out about the
Shawcross book. One is the way he has firmly tied Murdoch the man to his
origins and family history. The other is the way in which Murdoch the
businessman is placed firmly in the context of the information revolution -
even if sometimes this degenerates into a list of inventions.
Murdoch knew how to exploit lax tax and offshore rules in Australia, and
could often find his way around media regulations. But he also knew what
computers and communications could make possible at Wapping and Sky, and he
was bold enough to carry it out.
Shawcross describes the two quite different grandfathers: Patrick Murdoch, a
stern piller of the Free Church of Scotland, and Rupert Greene, a
'roistering, charming, half-Irish gambler.' You do not have to be too
fanciful an amateur psychologist to see the influences. 'He is a
complicated, often ruthless, often charming, usually effective but sometimes
uncomfortable mix of Patrick Murdoch and Rupert Greene. He has more than one
personality. He can be prim and yet he is 'larriken', an Australian
troublemaker. He sees himself as a radical, he likes to provoke. But he has
not always been careful of the consequences,' argues Shawcross.
Throughout the book there is the leitmotif of pain suffered by people sacked
or discarded. People such as John D'Arcy, managing director of the Melbourne
Herald, summoned to London - he thought to be promoted - and then sacked in
20 minutes over a glass of whisky. Or, after 50 years of friendship, the
curt note to News Corp. chairman Richard Searby, asking him to resign.
How should the achievement of Rupert Murdoch be judged? Shawcross offers a
pertinent question, and an appeal, rather than a condemnation. Why should US
culture be imposed on the older cultures of Asia, the Middle East and
elsewhere in an era when a handful of people can touch the lives of
billions?
Not only is this power awesome, the responsibility also is immense. 'It is,'
says Shawcross 'a responsibility which Rupert Murdoch, grandson of the
Reverend Patrick, great-grandson of the Reverend James, scion of the men and
women from the dour beaches and strict kirks of Aberdeenshire, can
understand. He only has to grasp it.'
Michael Leapman, an earlier biographer (Rupert Murdoch - Barefaced Cheek)
has just published a more general book on the transformation of the British
press since its exodus from the boozy camaraderie of Fleet Street to more
sober high-technology premises.
Murdoch of course makes many guest appearances throughout, not just in the
context of Wapping but also in chapters entitled 'Hounding The Royals'? and
'Shame and Scandal'.
Leapman conveys well the changing feel of newspapers in the years since the
publication in 1957 of Dangerous Estate by Francis Williams. And in spite of
the ever-present controversies over invasion of privacy and reporting of
sexual scandals he is surely right to take an optimistic view of the changes
since the 1960s for both readers and journalists. 'We have more and better
writers producing more and better newspapers - and doing their livers a
favour into the bargain,' he says.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals slide on economy fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL METAL prices fell yesterday on the London Stock Exchange amid growing
fears that the sluggish state of worldwide economic activity would continue
for some time.
There was relatively heavy selling of copper, zinc and nickel but traders
said the aluminium market, where prices were already very low, was very
quiet. 'There has been a bout of liquidation of metal in response to the
general economic situation,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at
Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.
Copper for delivery in three months fell by Pounds 25.75 to close at Pounds
1,399.50 a tonne last night and the price fell again in after-hours
dealings.
However, this price weakness merely represented a correction of the sharp
gains in June and July, suggested Mr Wictor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat
&amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. He expected the copper price to
rise strongly again in the final quarter of 1992, a time of seasonally
strong demand.
In a special report on the copper market, Mr Bielski suggested renewed
economic growth in the US and Japan next year should boost copper demand by
2.5 per cent in 1993. Consequently, he looked for a supply deficit of about
200,000 tonnes in 1993 following one of 75,000 tonnes this year. This should
trigger some sharp price 'spikes' through 1993.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana plan 'grossly

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY proposals to reform its banana import regime would
generate immense monopoly profits for importers, wholesalers and retailers,
and are grossly inefficient, a new World Bank working paper argues.
The study says the plans are 'deliberately and unnecessarily complicated' to
administer, and would give a large new bureaucracy 'tremendous power and
control over the market', which is forecast to grow to 3.6m tonnes by 1993.
The paper calculates that existing policies already cost EC consumers
Dollars 1.6bn a year, with a direct cost to the community budget of Dollars
575m. The consumer cost could rise as high as Dollars 3.5bn depending on how
the proposals are implemented, it says.
Targeting the quota system's gross inefficiency, the paper calculates that
even today for every dollar of aid generated for banana suppliers from
African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, EC consumers pay Dollars
5.30 - with about Dollars 3 of this going to importers, wholesalers and
retailers as monopoly profit.
The study has been circulated as members of the council of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, who meet in Geneva today, debate a fierce
challenge to the EC reform proposals from Latin American banana exporters.
Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela want the community
to scrap its complex plan, which would replace national banana import curbs
with a community-wide quota and licence arrangement aimed at protecting
traditional ACP suppliers under binding Lome Convention commitments.
The competitive threat from Latin American 'dollar' bananas would be further
limited by a 20 per cent tariff, with costlier bananas from ACP producers
entering duty-free.
The Latin Americans claim that the plan would cost them up to Dollars 500m
(Pounds 292m) a year in export earnings and flouts Gatt rules against
discrimination between trading partners. They say it runs counter to
proposed farm trade reforms in the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations that
would scrap all import quotas in favour of tariffs.
The World Bank study provides a powerful endorsement for the Latin American
case. It argues that there can be no objective basis for deciding the
correct levels of quota, and that as such, quota-setting will become highly
politicised, subject to intense lobbying by vested interests.
It also details opportunities created by the quota and licence system for
marketers to collude to maximise profits - even to the extent of destroying
bananas once they have been imported under quota: 'There is no concrete
proof that marketers would exploit their market powers created by quotas and
licences (but) incentives will be created to encourage and partly condone
such behaviour,' it says.
As an alternative, the report calls for a 17.3 per cent self-financing
tariff, which would fund direct deficiency payments to ACP banana producers,
and would provide a more efficient, and more transparent means of protecting
the banana producers' incomes.
'Excessive marketing margins of currently-protected marketers of both
non-dollar and dollar fruit would be eliminated,' the study says:
'Currently-protected marketers would be the only losers of self-financing
tariff operations.'
The report points out that while at present the lion's share of the costs of
the support for ACP producers comes from consumers in the UK, France, Spain,
Portugal and Italy, the EC proposals would shift the costs to Germany,
Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg.
In Germany, the only community market currently open to free competition,
consumers now pay about Dollars 1.50 a kilogram for bananas - which compares
with about Dollars 2 in the UK, and almost Dollars 2.60 in Spain.
It argues that unnamed 'vested interests' within the EC 'appear to be
blocking the consideration, let alone adoption, of sensible policies'.
Geest and Fyffes, leading importers of ACP bananas to the UK, would be among
the significant beneficiaries if the present restrictive proposals by the
commission were adopted. They have been lobbying hard in Brussels against a
tariff-based reform, arguing that such reform would provide no defence for
ACP suppliers against a concerted assault on the community market by US
multinationals like Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, which supply dollar
bananas from Latin America.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): UK sugar
beet shines out through the gloom - Sterling's devaluation is benefitting
growers of one of Britain's few remaining profitable crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEPTEMBER rain, which has caused so many problems for late-harvesting cereal
growers, has been just right for sugar beet. Indeed the combination of a
warm spring and a moist summer could hardly have been better for the crop
and it is probable that the overall yield of UK sugar beet harvested this
autumn will come close to the record set 10 years ago.
The 'campaign' as the annual battle to lift and deliver the roots to
processing factories is called in the trade, began in earnest last week with
the seasonal opening of the last two of British Sugars' 10 factories. The
other eight had opened for 'slicing' the previous week and the extraction
process was already well under way. It will probably be the middle of next
February before the campaign is completed.
If early indications are a reliable guide, and they usually are, the UK
seems set to produce over 1.3m tonnes of refined sugar from this year's
crops. In 1982 1.4m tonnes was produced. The A and B quota, for which the
European Community guarantees prices under the terms of its common
agricultural policy, is set at 1.144m. The excess will be classified as C
sugar and will be sold on to world markets next year without price support.
The basis for the yield prediction is the root samples taken by British
Sugar, the monopoly processor of all the UK's sugar beet. Last week's
figures show that average root weight across the country was 703 grams,
compared with a five-year average of 587 grams and last year's 532 grams.
Average sugar content was a little down, as could have been expected because
of the greater size of the roots, to 17.4 per cent, compared with the 17.43
per cent five year average and 18.96 per cent last year, which as you may
remember was hot and dry.
The all important figure for sugar per root, however, was well up at 122
grams, compared with 101 grams last year and the 102 grams five-year
average. This appears to suggest that the yield of sugar from this year's
crop may be about 20 per cent higher than last year's.
Furthermore this British crop will almost certainly mean that for the first
time for years the UK will be up among the highest yielders per hectare of
sugar beet grown in the whole of the EC.
Other member states that are expecting good yields are Holland and France,
where the weather has been equally favourable. But for Germany, Denmark,
Belgium and Ireland below average yields are forecast.
The importance of a bumper sugar crop in the UK this year is not just a
matter of pride, nor even of immediate profit. It also provides ammunition
for the battle to persuade the CAP-reforming European Commission and the
negotiators in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that Britain can
reliably produce in excess of its quota and should be allocated at least as
much, if not more, when those quotas are decided in coming months.
Moreover British growers and processors are determined to fight for a fairer
deal than they believe they have had in the past in any reform of the EC
sugar regime.
While readily conceding that there is a structural surplus of sugar in the
community, they point out that whereas most other sugar beet growing states
produce well in excess of their domestic requirements, the UK produces less
than 50 per cent of its domestic sugar consumption in order to make way for
imports of raw cane sugar produced in former colonies.
They believe that the UK should remain exempt from any cuts in EC sugar beet
quotas, which may well be necessary. Britain, the argument goes, is already
worse off than other sugar beet-growing member states and if anything should
have an increase in her quota.
In furtherance of this claim and in order to improve the image of the UK as
a sugar beet producer, British Sugar has even changed the basis of reporting
farmers' yields.
In times past the tonnage of sugar beet produced was simply divided by the
area on which they were grown in order to arrive at an official average
figure. This always left the UK at, or near, the bottom of the European
league table. Growers assumed that was because of the superior soils to be
found on the Continent.
Then British Sugar discovered that most other countries subtracted those
areas of fields which were not cropped, such as the hedges and strips
between the field boundary and the first row of roots together with those
parts of fields taken up by ditches. Depending on the size of a field these
pieces of land can add up to 10 per cent or more of its total area. Now that
British Sugar makes similar adjustments, UK beet farmers look like much
better growers.
It will be clear from all of the above that British sugar beet farmers,
myself included, value the crop very highly. Among all the cuts and
restrictions imposed on agriculture recently, sugar beet has so far escaped
relatively unscathed and, given a reasonable season, it is still possible to
grow it at a profit. This year as I have indicated, it will probably do
better than average.
Furthermore the devaluation of sterling will provide a bonus. Since the
pound fell out of the ERM so-called 'green' currencies have re-emerged. They
had almost disappeared during the period of relative currency stability but
now they are needed again to make up the differences in value of guaranteed
prices for farm commodities in different EC member countries.
The effect of this is to increase the sterling value of UK sugar beet by
about 30 pence for each percentage point the pound devalues. If sterling
settles at say 10 per cent below its previous ERM floor, UK growers could
receive an extra Pounds 3 a tonne for the sugar beet they deliver to their
local factory. It will amount to a welcome addition to the Pounds 30 or so a
tonne they thought they would get when they planted the crop.
Meanwhile, overshadowing the UK sugar beet industry hangs the spectre of
rhizomania, which literally means root madness and has been dubbed the
rabies of root crops. It was first found in this country in 1987. But it has
been creeping north across Europe from Italy, where it was first discovered,
since the late 1940s.
It is a serious soil-borne disease that stays active in soil for many years
and in severe cases reduces both yield and sugar content to uneconomic
levels. When it arrived in Britain, plant health authorities imposed strict
measures to try to stop it from spreading; measures which were punitive and
very expensive to the farmer victims.
At first it seemed the restrictions were working. Only a few further cases
were discovered over the next four years. But this year there has been an
explosion of 13 cases so far and it is reported that several more possible
cases are under investigation.
My view is that, unwelcome as it may be, the time has come for the UK to
declare rhizomania an endemic disease and to learn to live with it.
Rhizomania-tolerant varieties of sugar beet have already been developed on
the continent that yield virtually the same in the presence of the virus as
conventional varieties do in clean soil.
It is no longer acceptable to penalise a few farmers for something over
which they have no control and for which they are not to blame. Informed
sources suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture may be coming to the same
conclusion.

SILVER fell sharply on the London bullion market, weighing on the GOLD
market. Silver tracked losses on Comex where US funds, disappointed that the
metal had failed to pull back above the key 390 cents chart level,
liquidated long positions. December Comex gold futures were holding above
the key chart level of Dollars 349.30 a troy ounce by midday in quiet
trading because of Jewish New Year. However, one analyst said participants
were liquidating their recent long positions in gold because the metal had
failed to rise further on the back of Europe's currency crisis. Another
said: 'With the dollar down against the yen, you'd think gold would be
higher. But it isn't, and some are getting fed up with it.' London's robusta
COFFEE ended around the day's lows. Dealers said ICO talks had slowed the
market; news that delegates had agreed on basic principles for a control
system met with scepticism. 'The market is in need of hard facts and we're
getting no hard facts from this,' one said. London COCOA recovered from
earlier lows as manufacturer buying emerged. The December contract fell to
Pounds 624, possibly on long liquidation, before closing at Pounds 648 a
tonne.

</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN effort to internationalise its agricultural futures business, the
Chicago Board of Trade is designing a futures contract based on an index of
the prices of four of the world's most heavily-traded edible oils.
The exchange dominates world pricing of soyabeans and soya oil but has had
limited success drawing in other vegetable oil traders to its futures pits.
Oilseed traders say poor correlation between price movements in soya oil and
products like palm oil make hedging international oils in the CBoT pits
treacherous. Exchange officials also recognise that their soya contracts are
most efficient in domestic pricing, and say a worldwide maze of agricultural
tariffs and subsidies distort international prices and make CBoT futures
less reliable for managing risk for international users.
Mr William O'Connor, Chairman of the exchange, announced preliminary details
of the price index last week at the world congress of the International
Association of Oilseed Crushers. 'While we are hopeful of relief from
tariffs and subsidies, we know better than to count on it,' he said. 'A more
productive approach. . . is to design a market which is least affected by
the resulting price distortions.'
The proposed edible oils price index will be based on crude palm, soya,
sunflower, and rapeseed oils, which represent 85 per cent of the world
vegetable oil trade.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CBoT to administer sales of US
pollution permits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, has been
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as the administrator of
its annual sales and auctions of pollution permits or allowances.
The allowances, for sulphur dioxide emissions by electric utility plants,
are to be issued, starting next year, as part of the EPA's acid rain control
programme. The agency aims to halve the level of sulphur dioxide emissions
by the end of the decade.
The CBoT, aiming to be the world's first environmental exchange, petitioned
the EPA for the designation as sales and auction administrator because it
will trade futures in the pollution allowances. The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the US futures industry regulator, has already approved
the CBoT for trading futures and futures-options on the allowances.
The CBoT hopes that this innovative futures contract will begin a whole new
era in the futures industry. Mr Richard Sandor, a CBoT board member and
designer of the contract, said: 'When we've shown how it can be done
successfully in the US, I think the world will follow'.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: ANI reports ADollars 66.6m loss
after Spedley group collapse claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN National Industries (ANI), has reported a plunge into net losses
of ADollars 66.6m (USDollars 48.2m) for the 12 months to June, from net
profits of ADollars 77.5m a year earlier.
The figure included an abnormal loss of ADollars 76m, mostly relating to the
settlement of a ADollars 900m claim by the liquidator of the collapsed
Spedley group.
Mr Ted Harris, chairman, said ANI would pay ADollars 22m to the liquidator
following an out-of-court settlement. The group will also write off ADollars
28m in payments due from Spedley, raising the cost of the settlement to
ADollars 50m.
ANI also reported a tax bill of ADollars 81m, compared with ADollars 10m in
the previous year, after providing for the full cost of a dispute with the
Australian taxation office over the treatment of Spedley-related losses.
ANI, a heavy engineering and manufacturing group, owned 45 per cent of the
Spedley Securities finance group until 1989, when its holding was sold to Mr
Brian Yuill, Spedley's managing director. The group collapsed later the same
year.
Mr John Harkness, the Spedley liquidator, claimed ANI was partly responsible
for the collapse because of its failure to prevent alleged negligence and
dishonesty by Mr Yuill, who faces criminal charges in connection with the
collapse.
Mr Harris said ANI, which denied responsibility, had agreed to settle the
claim to bring an end to the uncertainty surrounding the group and the drain
on management time.
The settlement was within the range expected by the financial markets.
However, analysts were surprised by a reduction in the final dividend to 3.7
cents from 6 cents a year earlier, bringing the full-year payment to 9
cents, fully franked, down from 11.3 cents.
ANI said the reduced dividend related to economic weakness in Australia and
the UK. The group said there was no sign of a recovery in business activity
in Australia.
Sales fell to ADollars 1.16bn from ADollars 1.3bn. ANI's shares dropped by 4
cents to ADollars 1.71 on the Australian Stock Exchange.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: DKB moves staff to help
restructuring at Kankaku
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAI-ICHI Kangyo Bank, Japan's largest commercial bank, is planning to
dispatch staff to Kankaku Securities as part of a restructuring programme
begun by the troubled second-tier broker.
The move by DKB is an indicator of closer ties between medium-sized Japanese
brokers and their patron banks, which may receive approval next year to
enter the securities business. The banks consider that these links to
brokers will provide longer-term opportunities for expansion.
Meanwhile, Japan's Ministry of Finance yesterday announced a relaxation of
the formula used to calculate brokers' capital adequacy. It will allow
brokers to count subordinated loans as capital and has eased assessment
guidelines on publicly-traded shares and operating costs.
Most brokers have reported a sharp fall in their capital ratios over the
past year, and the ministry's decision will allow them to avoid
embarrassment for the first half, ending this month.
By the ministry's standards, warning signals are triggered when the capital
ratio passes below 200 per cent; brokers with 150 per cent or less are
forbidden from opening new branches; and the ministry is supposed to begin
daily monitoring of a broker at 120 per cent.
At the end of March, three of Japan's 14 largest brokers were below 200 per
cent - Sanyo Securities, Cosmo Securities, and Yamatane Securities  - while
Kankaku reported a ratio of 212 per cent, down from 240 per cent in the
previous year.
The ministry, attempting to restore public confidence in the industry, said
the new standard for calculating operating costs - 25 per cent of the
preceding 12 months' costs, instead of 25 per cent of the previous financial
year - would reflect the brokers' attempts to reduce expenses in recent
months.
None of Japan's top 14 securities houses expects to make a profit in the
first half, and several of the 10 second-tier brokers have announced
restructuring plans, including Yamatane Securities, which is receiving staff
and assistance from Sakura Bank.
While Kankaku has indicated that its 5,300 staff will be reduced by 20 per
cent, the company is still expecting a Y18bn (Dollars 146m) loss for the
first half. Like other second-tier brokers, it is burdened by heavy
investments in computer systems far beyond its requirements.
As part of the assistance package, DKB is likely to share the costs of a
Y45bn computer centre commissioned by Kankaku in the late 1980s, when the
company had visions of challenging the leading Japanese brokers. Badly
bruised by weak prices and turnover on the Tokyo market, the company has
dropped those ambitions and is now planning to close branches.
DKB is also considering a proposal to employ some of Kankaku's systems
engineers in its own subsidiaries, as well as sending managers to the
brokerage, possibly including a member of the bank's board, a move that
would strengthen the relationship between the two institutions.
Earlier this month, Kankaku announced the promotion of Mr Yoichiro Kato,
vice-president, to the presidency with effect from October 1, as part of the
brokerage's rationalisation plans. Mr Kato was sent to Kankaku from DKB in
June 1991 to take up the post of vice-president.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Baring subsidiary plans merger
in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian subsidiary of Baring Securities, the UK broking house, is to
merge with McIntosh Securities, a listed Australian broking group, in a
further working out of over-capacity in the Australian stockbroking
industry.
Mr Bruce Parncutt, McIntosh managing director, said the merger was subject
to ratification by both boards of directors plus regulatory and other
approval.
Mr Peter Meurer, managing director of Baring Securities (Australia), said it
was 'clear that the financial community was sending us a message by cutting
broking rates'.
The merger follows a number of closures and mergers which have reduced
employment in the Australian broking industry to about 4,000 from more than
7,000 in 1987-88.
Barings Plc, Baring Securities' parent, reported a fall in first-half
pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.8m from Pounds 24.3m.
Barings said its securities arm had reported a loss for the first time,
mainly because of losses in Japan.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Dice tumble in Kuala Lumpur over
whether Chinese will play
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is little the Chinese like more than a gamble. In Malaysia these days,
it's a case of a gamble on a gamble.
Two companies listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange, Magnum and Dunlop
Estates, have been involved in protracted negotiations with the authorities
in Guangdong province, southern China, to set up a joint venture lottery.
The people of Guangdong and elsewhere in China have been denied a legal
flutter for many years. If the Magnum/Dunlop venture comes off there could
be very handsome profits indeed.
But if is the word. Both Magnum and Dunlop are part of Multi-Purpose
Holdings, one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates, run by Mr Lim Thian Kiat,
a 32-year-old Malaysian Chinese entrepeneur, who controls one of Malaysia's
main lotteries through Magnum.
Investors were queuing up to take a gamble on Mr Lim's gambling venture in
China. This month, both Magnum and Dunlop requested a temporary suspension
from the KLSE, apparently to avoid widespread speculation in their shares.
Two weeks later, Mr Lim announced that, in principle, the Guangdong
authorities had approved the project and requested that the suspension of
the Magnum/Dunlop shares be lifted. In an unusual move, the KLSE refused. It
wanted to know more about the status of the Guandong venture.
Heavy rumours swept the Kuala Lumpur market about large blocks of Magnum and
Dunlop shares being traded off course - outside the KLSE. Mr Lim came up
with some guarded answers.
Mr Lim said that, while Guandong had approved the project, other relevant
authorities, presumably in Beijing, still had to give their endorsement.
Little else was given away as, according to a Magnum/Dunlop statement,
additional information could jeopardise 'corporate and business objectives'.
The KLSE relented and, in the middle of last week, allowed trading in Magnum
and Dunlop to resume. While analysts expected a drop in share price, the
opposite happened. Shares in both companies made gains, though traders were
somewhat mystified as to who was buying.
Yesterday, shares in both Magnum and Dunlop fell in heavy trading. The
gamblers are still there, still waiting to see whether their gamble on a
gamble in China will eventually come off.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: HSBC puts Dollars 100m into US arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG AND Shanghai Bank revealed yesterday it had suffered yet another
blow from its accident-prone US operations at a time when Marine Midland,
its New York subsidiary, appears to have made a firm return to profit.
The bank disclosed that it had been forced to make charges of Dollars 75m
(Pounds 43.8m) and also to inject Dollars 100m into Concord Leasing, its US
leasing subsidiary, after discovering that some of the assets in its
portfolio had been substantially over-valued.
The charge will be taken in the accounts of the quarter which ends today.
The move was accompanied by news of the resignation of the two top men in
Concord Leasing - Mr Michael O'Hanlon, president and chief executive
officer, and Mr Richard Parkes, executive vice-president.
A senior executive, so far unnamed, is being seconded from Hongkong Bank to
run the company for the time being.
Hongkong Bank said yesterday that the move followed a routine auditing
examination of Concord's assets in which nine ships in its portfolio were
discovered to be seriously overvalued.
Fraud is not suspected.
Concord Leasing was sold to HSBC Holdings, the group parent company, by
Marine Midland, its New York subsidiary, two years ago at a time when Mr
Keith Whitson, now the new deputy chief executive of Midland Bank, was
fighting to turn Marine Midland around after it chalked up losses of nearly
Dollars 500m in two years.
The company, which prided itself on operating in highly diversified products
in a wide range of markets, was regarded at the time of the sale as one of
the few bits of the Marine Midland empire which was consistently profitable.
Last year the company had total assets of Dollars 2.17bn and made a record
profit of Dollars 20.9m, despite the depressed state of the US economy.
Hongkong Bank said yesterday it remained committed to supporting Concord as
necessary and to ensuring it was able to fulfil all its financial
obligations.

An independent arbitrator has decided that Burton Group need not repay
Pounds 1m to Dickson Concepts, which last year paid Pounds 60m for Harvey

The disagreement went to arbitration after Burton and Mr Dickson Poon, the

Harvey Nichols' depreciation policy.
The two parties agreed beforehand that the decision of the arbitrators,

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Trust in funds deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN TRUST, the fund management group, announced yesterday that it will
take over from Invesco MIM the management of funds held by Century, the life
assurance group, worth Pounds 430m.
Invesco admitted that the news came as a blow, but added: 'This is not a
surprise to us, and the move has been factored into our calculations.'
Century includes the life funds of NEL, which was sold by Invesco to UNUM,
the US-based disability insurer, in July 1990.
UNUM sold the UK life, pension and mortgage business of NEL to Century in
January this year.
Invesco said that it had anticipated that NEL funds might move to a new
manager when it first made the sale.
However, the move comes at an unwelcome time for Invesco following the
announcement of sharply lower profits earlier this month, due to a Pounds 9m
write-off associated with the troubled Drayton Consolidated Investment
Trust. Lord Stevens of Ludgate stepped down as chief executive in July.
Aberdeen has agreed to pay Century Pounds 5.6m in respect of the fund
management contracts. Of this, Pounds 3m is payable immediately, and the
remaining Pounds 2.6m by December 31.
If the contracts are terminated, Century will be liable to repay Pounds 5.2m
to Aberdeen within seven days.
Mr Martin Gilbert, chief executive of Aberdeen, said the move was made to
secure new distribution channels for the group's funds.
The full details of the move have still not been settled, but it seems
likely it will significantly expand Aberdeen's funds under management, which
currently stand at Pounds 1.1bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tate &amp; Lyle, the worlds's largest sweeteners group, is paying Pounds 24m for
a further 23 per cent stake in a leading Portuguese sugar refiner.
The deal will bring Tate &amp; Lyle's holding in Alcantara Sociedade de
Empreendimentos Acucareiros to 97 per cent. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said he
intended eventually to buy the outstanding 3 per cent.
Alcantara claims more than 40 per cent of the Portuguese market for refined
cane sugar. Tate took its first stake in Alcantara in 1984. The Portuguese
refiner reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10m for the year ended September
1991, on sales of Pounds 85m.
On the question of European Community quotas for the import of raw cane, Mr
Nicholas Nightingale, company secretary, said Tate &amp; Lyle expected a
decision 'in due course'. The temporary arrangement agreed when Portugal
joined the EC is due to end this year. 'We are sure we will end up with a
satisfactory basis,' he said.
Alcantara employs 570 people and has two refineries. Mr Nightingale said
there would be no management changes.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs push How into Pounds
96,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTON MORAIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANCY payments and other severance costs brought about by severe
trading conditions pushed How Group, the Midlands-based building services
contractor, into its first interim pre-tax loss since joining the main
market in December 1987.
Exceptional costs involved in shedding 200 more workers from its 2,500 staff
in the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 591,000 (Pounds 226,000),
resulting in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 96,000 against a Pounds 507,000 profit
last time.
Mr Peter How, chairman, said trading conditions in the first half were the
worst since the group was formed in 1947. But if construction activity were
to pick up following withdrawal from the ERM and the subsequent reduction in
interest rates, the group would be among the first to benefit, he said.
Mr How said a sharp fall in turnover to Pounds 75.2m from a record Pounds
123m reflected the length and depth of the recession and a determination not
to embark upon uneconomic projects.
The fall in turnover was largely due to a 50 per cent decline to about
Pounds 50m in the engineering services division. Pre-tax losses in the
division amounted to Pounds 1.5m against a gain of some Pounds 1m from the
maintenance and distribution divisions.
Losses per share were 0.35p (earnings 0.51p). The interim dividend is
reduced to 0.75p (1p).

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Split capital restructuring at Jos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOS HOLDINGS, which is managed by Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, is
proposing to restructure into a split capital investment trust.
The ordinary shares will be replaced by equal proportions of three classes
of shares - zero dividend, income and capital. Shareholders will be entitled
to one of each class for every 250p of net assets attributable to their
ordinary shares.
The trust will last until January 31 2003. At that point the zero dividend
shares will rank before the others, and have a final capital entitlement of
249p. They will have no right to income. Kleinwort Benson calculates the
gross redemption yield at 9.3 per cent.
Income shares will be entitled to all the income from the trust, but qualify
for a capital entitlement of only 1p per share. Maiden gross dividend will
be 15.3 per cent, assuming an initial market value of 100p.
Kleinwort Benson does not intend to change the investment philosophy of the
underlying portfolio, which is to aim for income through investing in
international equities, with a bias towards the UK. However, managers hope
to achieve a slightly higher yield, of about 1.2 times that on the
FT-Actuaries All-Share index.
Mr Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management
said: 'It fills a gap in our range. Income shares and zeros have enjoyed
great popularity with both private and institutional investors, and
Kleinwort Benson does not have a traditional split-capital trust with three
share classes to satisfy this demand.'
It is also hoped that demand for the new shares will reduce the discount to
net asset value.

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Metsec losses increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Metsec fell 27p to 97p on news that the company, which makes
building, electronic and engineering products, suffered a difficult first
half, particularly in its electronic products division.
Pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 grew from Pounds 285,000 to
Pounds 868,000 as 'recovery from recession in many of the group's markets
was slower than expected', said Mr Keith Hirst, chairman and managing
director.
The USM-quoted group is passing its interim dividend, against 2.7p last
time.
Turnover shrank by Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 31.1m. That of the now sold Thomas
Vale Construction was deliberately reduced by some Pounds 5m, and the
disposal of the Muller group knocked off another Pounds 2m. The rest was
down to the recession, said Mr Hirst.
Electronic products were brought low by weakness in the UK, Australian, and
US markets, where the hospital sector was particularly hard hit.
Reorganisation has now moved the US side towards monthly profitability.
As a result of last year's rationalisation, all the building products
businesses traded profitably.
Profits were reduced by provisions of Pounds 550,000 for bad debts - a
problem Mr Hirst said should ease - though volumes were sacrificed to
maintain margins.
With the exception of James Trow, where the product range has shifted
towards the commercial office equipment market, all the businesses in the
engineering products division operated profitably.
Gearing grew from about 50 to 60 per cent and losses per share increased to
5.75p (1.51p).

FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Fudge-free accounting plans 'incompatible
with reality'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS TO introduce accounting standards which do not permit financial
information to be 'fudged' are not compatible with providing a true and fair
view of the underlying realities of a company, a circular from MAP
Securities warned yesterday.
Mr David Damant, chairman of MAP, the stockbroking and corporate finance
house which is part of Spanish insurance group Mapfre Mutualidad, also
called for a redefinition of the concept of earnings.
He said that many critics of existing accounting practice in the UK have
argued that standards are too flexible and depend too much on the judgment
of a company and its auditor.
Many called for 'unfudgeable' rules to guide good behaviour and provide a
firmer basis upon which auditors can work.
But, he argued, this would contradict the requirement for accounts to
present the true and fair view essential for the efficient operating of the
equity markets.
Reality is too complex and the figures often rely on careful case-by-case
judgments which cannot always be reduced to firm rules, he said.
Mr Damant also argues - in a separate paper - that a single definition of
earnings on the profit and loss account cannot be both correct and
unfudgeable.
The word 'earnings' is not neutral, he says, but rather implies a measure of
the operating performance of a company and should therefore reflect the
maintainable profit or loss.
Any other definition will make earnings too volatile and make limited sense
of price/earnings ratios.
Earnings may sometimes exclude both extraordinary and exceptional losses or
gains, but this will require careful judgments in each case, he adds.
Damant suggests that the word earnings should be replaced on the bottom line
of the profit and loss account with a phrase such as 'net income for the
year'.
At the same time, he says, there is a need for adequate disclosure of the
information required to to calculate a meaningful level of performance.
Earnings; Unfudgeability. MAP Securities, 2-3 Philpot Lane, London EC3M 8AQ.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW fund investing in unlisted Chinese companies is to be launched this
week by Kleinwort Benson Investment Management.
China Investment &amp; Development Fund is to be floated in London. Mr Robin
Fox, chairman-designate, said: 'We believe the greatest opportunity in China
is investment in unlisted China enterprises and not in B shares.'
The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets have excited interest among foreign
investors, who are allowed to buy B shares - A shares are reserved for
domestic investors. However, concerns include the high level of prices in
Shenzhen, volatility and absence of effective regulation.
Though the Communist party shows no sign of relinquishing political control,
reforms have opened up large areas of the economy to private investment.
The non-state economy accounts for 46 per cent of industrial production and
95 per cent of agricultural output. By the end of last year, more than
34,000 enterprises were using foreign funds, technology or marketing
expertise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday reaffirmed his commitment
to keep financial and budgetary policies under rigid control as a gloomy
report from the respected Ifo economics institute hit share prices.
The chancellor and Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had stressed the need
for strict policies at a meeting with industrialists in Mr Kohl's office
because they were important for the confidence of commercial and financial
markets, a government spokesman said.
Meanwhile, the DAX Frankfurt stock exchange index shed more than 2 per cent
following a report of a sharp downturn in business expectations for the next
six months.
The Ifo economics institute in Munich said expectations across a wide range
of companies taking part in its monthly survey had 'considerably worsened'
following a marked fall in new orders last month.
Many were planning to reduce production because cuts so far had failed to
reduce inventories.
The car industry is expected to be particularly hard hit. An industry trade
group said orders this year would be a quarter to a third lower than 1991.
Mr Achim Diekmann, director of the German Automobile Association, the
industry's main trade group, said employment in the industry, including
suppliers to the vehicle manufacturers, would fall by 100,000-200,000 from
the total 1.7m employed in the sector.
Mr Diekmann also said order backlogs for German car manufacturers to August
this year had fallen 'by half' compared with the same period last year.
Business conditions in the east have also deteriorated. Order intake among
manufacturers fell 20 per cent in July, according to the economics ministry.
Overseas demand fell by more than half.
The collapse which followed a 20 per cent rise in June reflects highly
volatile trends which have marked the progress of the east German economy
since the virtual disappearance of buyers from former markets in the
ex-Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Smith wins backing on Europe: Labour rejects Maastricht
referendum - Brown and Blair join NEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH won a double victory yesterday when the Labour conference
decisively rejected a referendum on Maastricht and his key lieutenants, Mr
Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, were elected to the national executive
committee.
The results of the voting will strengthen the new Labour leader's grip on
the party machine and help reverse the setback of Mr Bryan Gould's
resignation from the shadow cabinet over European policy on Sunday.
Senior party officials did not try to disguise their elation with the
election result, which saw Mr Gould humiliatingly ejected from the NEC on
less than half the vote he received last year.
That ballot, together with the defeat of Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran
leftwinger, after 14 years on the NEC, removed at a stroke two vocal critics
of Mr Smith's firmly pro-European policy. It also leaves Mr Tony Benn as the
sole hard-left anti-Maastricht rebel on the NEC.
Labour's 'modernising' faction - personified by Mr Brown and Mr Blair, the
shadow chancellor and home affairs spokesman respectively - was also
strengthened by the election of Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, who
topped the poll.
Describing the referendum vote and the rejection of a motion opposing
Maastricht as 'a humiliation' for Mr Smith's opponents, Mr David Hill,
Labour's communications director, said: 'It has been a very, very good
afternoon.'
Delegates at the Blackpool conference were plainly surprised by the NEC
ballot results. Speculation had concentrated on the possibility of Mr Benn
being ejected and the likelihood of a close battle between by Mr Blair and
Mr Gould. The scale of the former heritage spokesman's defeat was attributed
to growing irritation at his refusal to mute his criticism of Mr Smith's
European policy position.
Taken alongside firmer than expected opposition to a referendum on
Maastricht demonstrated by the conference, Mr Smith has substantially
increased authority in deciding tactics in the Commons when, or if, the
treaty returns for ratification.
It will also diminish significantly Mr Gould's efforts to rally opponents to
Maastricht. Yesterday, several former allies were openly critical of his
decision to resign, with many attacking its timing as politically inept.
Today, Mr Smith will attempt to capitalise on the clear desire for party
unity demonstrated yesterday by staking out Labour's claim to be the party
of Europe. In his keynote speech, he will condemn Mr John Major's
'inactivity' in the EC presidency and argue that the role of government is
actively to promote employment and growth.

FT  29 SEP 92 / National Savings cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Savings yesterday announced significant cuts in the interest it
offers on fixed-rate savings products. The cuts varied between 0.75
percentage points and a full percentage point.
The Building Societies Association said it would ease pressure further on
building societies' mortgage rates.
The launch in July of the First Option Bond, which offers a fixed rate over
one year with tax paid, caused wide protest from building societies, which
said it was impossible to match. The initial rate for the bond of 10.34 per
cent gross prompted the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society to raise
its mortgage rate, and this was followed by a cut in in the bond's gross
interest rate of 0.67 percentage points.
The gross interest on the bond has now been cut by a full percentage point
to 8.67 per cent. Similar cuts were made to National Savings' more
traditional products. The new 39th Issue Savings Certificates guarantee a
tax-free return of 6.75 per cent after five years; the 38th Issue paid 7.50
per cent. These certificates will now be sold in units of Pounds 100 rather
than units of Pounds 25, which should also lessen the pressure on building
societies.
Series E Capital Bonds, which offered 10 per cent gross, have been withdrawn
and replaced by Series F bonds which offer 9 per cent. The new Issue D of
Children's Bonus Bonds will also see a cut of one point, from 10.1 per cent
to 9.1 per cent.
Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society, the largest mortgage lender, yesterday
signalled that it is looking for high-value low-risk customers in the
housing market as it and Woolwich, the third largest building society, moved
their basic mortgage interest rates down to 9.99 per cent, David Barchard
writes.
In both cases, the reduced rates apply immediately to new customers and from
November 1 for existing borrowers.
Halifax's decision to trim its standard interest rate by 0.66 percentage
points to 9.99 per cent was a surprise as it means that many Halifax
mortgages are now slightly more expensive than those of Abbey National, its
main market rival, which last week cut its rate to 9.95 per cent.
However, Halifax has structured its charges to ensure that it undercuts
Abbey National for very large loans, if the borrower is seeking less than
three-quarters of the value of the property.
Halifax customers with mortgages over Pounds 100,000 will be charged 9.24
per cent, compared with 9.49 per cent for similar mortgages from Abbey
National. For customers with high loan-to-value mortgages, Halifax borrowers
will pay 9.70 per cent against 9.49 per cent from Abbey National.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK car market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the UK car market already resembling a multiple pile up, the
devaluation juggernaut just adds to the carnage. Some 50 per cent of cars
sold in the UK are imported, and Pounds 3bn of foreign components went into
UK assembled cars in the first half of the year. To maintain margins,
overseas manufacturers need to raise prices by 10 to 15 per cent in a market
where sales have declined by 24 per cent in three years. The UK market
weakness is only underlined by the government's decision to allow cars
without catalytic converters to be sold for another year. In such conditions
large price rises are impossible, but manufacturers will be hard pressed to
cut costs or to spread their overheads by increasing volumes instead.
As dealer and distributor margins were already badly mauled by the
recession, most of the pain will fall on manufacturers, with companies such
as Volkswagen, BMW, Renault and Peugeot the worst affected. But cost savings
can only partly offset the devaluation losses. Some price rises are bound to
seep through. To protect their market position, manufacturers will delay
rises, but that will only be a matter of months, especially if companies
trusted to the ERM and left their sterling exposures unhedged.
Of course, there are winners. Rover has substantial sterling costs and
should benefit in export markets. The Japanese investment in Britain also
looks increasingly smart. UK component suppliers such as GKN may win further
export business. But, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, in the UK car
market at least, devaluation will mean price rises without growth.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances Generales de France played a shrewd hand to win its 25 per cent
blocking minority in German insurer AMB without paying a premium for
control. But yesterday's 24 per cent fall in interim net profits bears the
scar of a less successful venture, its 48 per cent stake in Italy's MAA. As
with the FFr190m first-half provision for poor property loans made by Banque
du Phenix, the question is whether the FFr87m provided for pulling out of
Italy will be enough.
Given that the capital gains which sustained French insurance company
profits in the 1980s do not appear to have markedly slowed, investors are
likely to be most worried about when the domestic market will turn.
Yesterday's results from AGF suggest the company has been more picky about
new risks than some of its competitors, and that underwriting losses are
moving in the right direction. The process of recovery, though, promises to
be slow.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French franc's recovery leaves the Bundesbank under less immediate
pressure to cut interest rates. But it still has the unenviable task of
coping with money market distortions created by intervention of up to
DM100bn during the recent upheavals in the ERM. Money supply growth of 9 per
cent and a crop of disappointing inflation figures from the Lander dictate
an urgent attempt to drain liquidity from the money market. So it is no
surprise that the bank has cancelled its regular securities repurchase
arrangement for the second week running. But it also has to move carefully
to avoid upsetting the exchange markets. Short-term rates have thus been
left just under 9 per cent, well below the Lombard rate of 9.5 per cent.
The mistake for the financial markets would be to read any policy
significance into money market rates at these levels. More important is the
systematic way in which liquidity is being drained - DM 28bn this week alone
 -by the cancellation of the repurchase agreements. There is evidently a
strong body of opinion on the Bundesbank council still prepared to take a
tough line even in the face of a deteriorating domestic economy. The hawks'
determination has almost certainly been reinforced by domestic criticism of
the bank for supposedly bowing to political pressures in cutting rates on
September 14. Nor is it necessarily in Bonn's interest for the Bundesbank to
relax. That would only reduce pressure for a consensus on containing the
fiscal deficit.
Dwindling hopes of a rate cut this week doubtless contributed to falls of 4
per cent and 2.5 per cent in French and German equities yesterday, not to
mention London's 41-point decline. But that is by no means the end of the
story. Unless the Bundesbank moves, the mood on exchange markets will sooner
or later grow violent again.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Airline turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a clear lesson in the plight of Dan-Air for would-be liberalisers
of Europe's aviation industry. Here, after all, was a relatively low cost
airline which ought to have been a model beneficiary of the open skies
policy pursued by Brussels in recent years. Instead its parent company,
Davies &amp; Newman, now finds itself in apparently life and death talks with
Virgin Atlantic. The reason is largely the dire economic climate and delayed
hopes for economic recovery. But Dan-Air's failure to gather momentum as a
scheduled carrier highlights the difficulty of breaking into markets
dominated by the big national flag carriers.
The reality is that BA's hold over slots at Heathrow has provided it with an
inestimable advantage in developing its European network. Gatwick has its
attractions - and Dan-Air has made an impact with its service - but what the
business traveller most wants these days is not so much an extra half bottle
of champagne as the flexibility to change his plans. As a hub airport
Heathrow has this critical mass - a point which Virgin well understands and
which lies behind its growing efforts to expand international services from
there. For this reason the flirtation with Dan-Air seems a bit odd. The
rationale, though, may lie more in providing Dan-Air flights with customers
booked through Virgin Holidays, while the limited opportunities for
passengers to switch airlines may explain why Mr Branson apparently does not
want to put up much cash, and is not interested in a merger.
BA will be a more than interested bystander - not least because Dan-Air's
assets include several slots at Heathrow. But perhaps BAA is more concerned.
Stansted is one problem, but it would hardly do if one of its biggest
customers at Gatwick was allowed to go to the wall.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: Insider dealing law shows the strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J C NEWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Peston's article ('Tougher legislation on insider dealing
planned', September 9) was fascinating.
I always suspected that Treasury officials had different thought processes
from mine and now I have proof.
According to the official: 'If someone discovered that a company had closed
down and then sold the shares of that company's competitor, that would be
insider trading.'
To me that response would be foolish. My reaction would have been to sell
short the company that had closed down and buy shares of the competitor and
I would define both of these actions as insider trading.
However, I admit that I am a classic outsider, as I live in Toronto and
resigned as a director in the 1970s, therefore the official may classify my
trading as 'outsider trading'.
I hope I am mistaken, as if I am not, there must be a lot of muddled
thinking going on in official circles.
That does not augur well for making an intelligible tough new law to act on
insider dealing, especially in a market where insider dealing has been the
normal business practice for centuries.

Is society going mad or only the media? Ask any unemployed person which is

FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: True energy efficiency stymied by motor car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Miss J M PICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox reports on the slow progress of the Energy Efficiency
Office in setting up the Energy Trust ('Energy Trust slow to gain speed',
Business and the Environment, September 23) on the same day that you print a
letter from the Economics Editor (Europe) of the Mainichi Newspapers
('Withdrawal from ERM stylish and result unwittingly good, but resignations
an issue').
That letter lectures Britain on the virtues of economic efficiency, and
contains the quite extraordinarily unimaginative statement: 'If there is no
car, the fuel is no good.'
There are, of course, many better uses for fuel than using it, with
monstrous energy inefficiency, in the motor car.
Pumping fuel into motor cars to accelerate the engine of economic
development is simply one of the methods whereby the underlying global
energy economy tests the monetary economy to breakdown point.
In the global energy economy, the laws and limits governing supplies and the
efficiency of consumption are more or less fixed and known.
Anchoring the system of economic management to those reliable known factors
promises a less dangerous ride than trying to anchor it to a currency which
is subject to change by German bankers and sundry speculators.
It is hardly surprising that the Energy Efficiency Office is having such a
job to find an Energy Trust chairman to talk eyeball to eyeball with other
'high-status persons' about improving energy efficiency and evaluation.
The system remains locked to the grossly energy-inefficient motor car as its
status symbol, and any genuinely energy efficient person must accordingly
remain an outsider: an oddball.

Out of all South Africa's political prisoners released yesterday, Robert
McBride, a 29-year-old coloured man who spent 1,463 days on death row for a
Durban car-bombing, is perhaps the best known. Not only is he married to a
daughter of an Anglo American director, Peter Leyden, but he is also the
subject of a book.
Bryan Rostron, a Daily Mirror journalist who wrote 'Till Babylon Falls',
believes that he is the first journalist to get on to death-row in
Pretoria's central prison where there are over 300 inmates. He had the idea
for the book after reading a brief news report of the exploits of McBride
and his Zulu colleague, Gordon Webster, who had been involved in a series of
sensational propaganda bombings in Natal.
In the book, Webster gets injured at a roadblock and then McBride shoots his
way into a hospital to rescue him. If the background was not so tragic -
McBride bitterly regrets the deaths caused by his Durban bomb - the saga
might be worth comparing with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
No one is sure of McBride's forebears but one story is that he is the
grandson of one of the leaders of the Irish Brigade, one John MacBride,
described by Yeats as a 'drunken, vainglorious lout'. Such is the stuff of
legends.

Has the Institute of Economic Affairs, the grandaddy of right-wing
thinktanks, played too safe in the choice of its new director general -
40-year-old John Blundell?
Blundell's predecessor, 37-year-old Graham Mather, had upset the IEA's old
guard by cosying up to prime minister John Major. He was accused of allowing
the government to influence the IEA - rather than the other way round - and
had to go. Blundell is unlikely to make the same mistake, but will he be as
effective as Mather in getting the IEA's signals heard in the right places?
Blundell is an administrator, rather than a distinguished economic thinker,
who has spent the past ten years in the US working closely with the late Sir
Antony Fisher, founder of the IEA. Sir Antony made his fortune in Buxted
chickens and used it to promote IEA-style thinktanks in over 40 countries.
In his later years much of the work was delegated to Blundell as president
of Atlas Economic Research foundation.
Although he is not well known in the UK, Blundell has two big advantages. He
knows how to chat up prospective sponsors, always important for a
cash-strapped thinktank, and he has a vast network of contacts in academe.
'The market place for ideas is international,' says Blundell, who intends to
carry on being a big importer.

Will Rupert Murdoch - when the time comes for him to step down from News
Corp - hand over the reins as gracefully as has his old chum Sir Peter
Abeles at TNT, the company he's dominated for the past 25 years?
Sir Peter, a penniless refugee from wartime Hungary who started with one
truck in 1950 and ended up running a ADollars 6bn transport empire with
52,000 workers, is not bowing out completely. He will remain a deputy
chairman, but will be spending most of his time trying to sort out Ansett,
the troubled airline jointly-owned by TNT and News Corp.
Like Murdoch, Sir Peter is an impulsive entrepreneur whose company outgrew
Australia. He also borrowed too much and has had to retrench. However, he
differs from Murdoch in that he doesn't own a large chunk of his own equity
and he has always had a reasonably strong chairman - Fred Millar - to keep
him in check.
Sir Peter's departure kills two birds with one stone. It enables TNT to
introduce a more disciplined management style and means that Sir Peter will
be able to devote 100 per cent of his time to Ansett, perhaps the biggest
problem facing TNT and News Corporation. Although News Corporation has been
strengthening its board of non-executive directors, Rupert Murdoch is
chairman and chief executive. So who will tell him when it's time to go?

FT  29 SEP 92 / Letter: Reflections to allay investors' unease at venture
capital fund manager's fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R HOLLIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Norma Cohen's article, 'Investors query the rewards of risk: Unease
over fees for venture capital fund managers' (September 22), presents a
misleading view and is also unbalanced in that it does not contain any
meaningful response from the venture capital side. I hope you will allow me
to present that case.
I will not comment on the guidelines governing personal investment by
venture capital managers except to say that several venture capital houses
do adopt this mechanism. Indeed, it is sometimes favoured by investors as a
device to 'focus the mind' of the venture capitalist - who will benefit in
the case of successfully realised investments, but lose his money entirely
in the event of failure.
The position with fees and the widespread practice of 'carried interest' is
one where one is unlikely to achieve consensus, since it is an issue of the
pricing of a service. As an industry, we recognise that our comparatively
high management fees are an inevitable consequence of the specialised nature
of our investment activities.
As you rightly acknowledge, a venture capital fund nowadays typically
includes a hurdle rate, ie the carried interest benefit does not accrue
until all capital plus an agreed return is repatriated to investors. Again,
this long-established mechanism tends to encourage exceptional performance
on the part of the venture capitalist and is often insisted upon by
investors, since it creates a community of interest between the venture
capitalist and the investor.
Where I must take issue with your views is in the apparent lack of
understanding of the role of a venture capital manager, particularly in
management buy-out investments.
The comments from John McCrory reflect the skills needed: those of Mr Anslow
as reported are extraordinarily naive. Our industry recruits senior
executives from industry, as well as from the various professions, so that
we can effectively carry out the analysis, selection, completion and
realisation of investments. To complete any unquoted equity investment, be
it start-up or MBO, will take anything from one to three months' full-time
work on the part of the venture capital manager. The difference does not end
there; a high degree of skill and effort is required in the subsequent
monitoring of the investment.
It is true that venture capital has achieved good returns in recent years,
but it is a long-term business and is obviously vulnerable to the economic
cycle.
Premium returns are of course required to match the higher risk profile, and
at the BVCA we are endeavouring to compile accurate figures showing
aggregate returns for the UK venture capital industry covering a meaningful
period to assist investors.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The classroom moves closer to the workplace: John Gapper
examines experiments designed to improve US vocational education and equip
school leavers for employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beth Moore, an 11th grade school pupil in Boston, has learned a lot from
working in a hospital. 'It's good for growing up. Everything you do there
has to be right, because you can jeopardise someone's life if it's not,' she
says. Unlike her friends, she has discovered what she wants to do after
school. 'I think when they say they don't want to work, they mean they don't
know how to go about it,' she says.
Beth is fortunate for a US pupil who is not going to attend university.
Unlike many who drift through school without any clear goal, her education
is being directed to an end. She is preparing for two years of part-time
study at a community college. If she succeeds, she will qualify as a medical
technician and could earn about Dollars 25,000 a year.
Beth Moore is taking part in an experiment funded by the federal government
in Boston called Project ProTech. The aim is to fill some of the technical
posts in local hospitals by providing an alternative to academic education
for pupils who might otherwise drop out of school before 18. Many of the 90
in the experiment's first year come from public schools with high drop-out
rates.
These links between schools and employers are common in countries such as
Germany with a strong tradition of youth apprenticeship. But they mark a
profound change for the US, where most parents want their children to have a
university education. Only now is the scarcity of well-paid jobs for those
who do not enter post-secondary education forcing schools to rethink their
purpose and methods.
The result is a sharp increase in local experiments which try to provide a
coherent strategy for the 84 per cent of pupils who do not go to university.
The common aim of efforts such as Project ProTech is to help young people
gain enough education to perform the expanding number of technical and
professional jobs.
The need for such innovation is plain when one sees how vocational education
has been handled until now. The US has never had a European-style dual
education system in which academic and vocational schools are split.
Instead, the 15,700 comprehensive high schools - compared with only 220
specialist vocational schools - offer job-related courses as an optional
extra to core academic disciplines.
Such vocational courses are commonly second-rate. Many vocational teachers
are recruited from industry, with less training than academic teachers.
Their classes tend to offer narrow job skills rather than competencies
applicable in all forms of work. Thirty vocational programmes in
Philadelphia schools were stopped in 1988 after a business-led inquiry found
they were achieving little or nothing.
As a result, pupils not heading for college have resisted entering
vocational classes. They have preferred a less stringent form of academic
education, within schools, called 'general track'. General track classes are
widely blamed for lowering standards by allowing pupils within a single
school to choose between a dozen forms of maths or English courses of
varying rigour and content.
'The alternative to the college track has been general education which does
not prepare students for anything,' says Ms J D Hoye, Oregon's associate
school superintendent.
Ms Betsy Brand, assistant secretary at the US Department of Education, says
schools have treated average pupils as an afterthought. 'Our attitude has
been elitist, and we have got to start looking at different strategies,' she
says.
Current reforms fall into two groups: improvements to secondary vocational
education, and efforts to create a better path from school into work and
further education.
Most reforms of secondary vocational education attempt to broaden the
traditional view of preparation for work. Instead of encouraging pupils to
learn craft skills such as carpentry or hairdressing, they tailor academic
work to occupations. The aim is twofold: to motivate pupils to remain in
school by making lessons more relevant; and to give them a better range of
skills.
Some initiatives involve 'schools within schools', which split the large
public schools into small units where a group of teachers co-ordinates
lessons around a subject. The best known examples are the 'high school
academies' in Philadelphia which offer lessons based on sectors such as
health and horticulture. In the latter, pupils run a flower shop as well as
being taught landscaping and aboriculture.
The academies achieved graduation rates of between 88 and 100 per cent last
year, compared with about 60 per cent in other high schools. They were
founded in 1969, but have been expanding and are expected to cover 17 per
cent of the city's public school pupils by 1995. Ms Natalie Allen, the
academies' director, argues that they are 'the closest we are going to get'
to apprenticeships.
Other states such as Oregon and Indiana are attempting a more ambitious
approach. Indiana is creating a system under which 15 and 16-year-old pupils
will take an exam covering literacy, technology and mathematics. They will
then choose an area of study for their final two years of school from
curricula such as business, health or technology. In all cases, they will
study maths, science and language.
These sort of courses - often known as Tech Prep - have been encouraged by
amendments to the Carl Perkins Act, which provides federal funds for
vocational education. Ms Brand says such courses 'hold out a vision of
post-secondary education for many students who would not dream of it', by
guiding them towards skilled occupations in which they are likely to receive
further training at community college.
The second set of reforms goes further than simply changing secondary
education. It tries to link study at school and community colleges with
jobs. The ProTech effort gives pupils a day's work experience at a hospital
each week while they are at school. When they leave, they study part-time at
community colleges for two-year degrees while working as trainees at the
hospitals.
But there are two difficulties with such efforts. One is that they require
the kind of links between employers and schools common in Germany, but
unusual in the US. The second is that parents are reluctant for their
children to be selected for skilled employment rather than university at 16.
Thus the best hope for the reform movement is probably that enough pupils
such as Beth Moore gain well-paid technical jobs. Until they start to see
the value of an alternative to university education, many US parents will
remain loyal to a form of schooling that was built to serve the interests of
all but is increasingly failing the majority.
The author is a Harkness fellow of the Commonwealth Fund, New York. This is
the third in a series about US education and training. Previous articles
appeared on August 17 and 24.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Growth in executive earnings slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER slowing of executives' pay rises is shown by the latest quarterly
index calculated for the Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of
management consultants and actuaries.
Although the overall rate of increase for the 12 months ending tomorrow
remains above inflation at 7 per cent, it compares with 8.1 per cent for the
12 months to June 30. The increase between October 1990 and September last
year was 12.5 per cent.
The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well
as salaries and bonuses. The figures for the latest quarter are based on a
survey of 5,364 executives in 421 widely varied businesses.
Among the different categories of managers, the biggest rise over the past
12 months went to chief executives of companies with more than Pounds 600m
in sales turnover. They continued to pull ahead of their counterparts with
an increase of 8 per cent on average to a total package of Pounds 247,453.
The average total across all ranks of executives is now Pounds 79,889, of
which 71.8 per cent is made up of salary. Company cars and pension
entitlements each make up a further 10.5 per cent, bonuses 5.7 per cent, and
other benefits 1.5 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Pay gap 'widens'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAY GAP between the lowest and average earners in the UK this year is
the greatest since records began in 1886, the Low Pay Unit said yesterday,
Lisa Wood writes.
The unit, in its analysis of Department of Employment statistics, said the
poorest 10 per cent of men working in manual jobs this year earned just 62.8
per cent of median earnings for this group, compared with 68.3 per cent in
1979.
Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'Caught between the devil
of recession and the deep blue sea of government labour-market policy, the
working poor are increasing in numbers and declining in prosperity.'
He warned that if the government abolishes wages councils, pay inequality
would widen. That would especially affect women - who make up the majority
of workers protected by councils. Wages councils set pay in some low-paid
industries.
The analysis also shows that - excluding overtime pay - nearly 10m
employees, or four in 10 of the adult workforce, earned less than the
Council of Europe's 'decency threshold' of Pounds 207.13 per week or Pounds
5.52 per hour. The threshold is 68 per cent of full-time average earnings.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Tec offers loans for training
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A TRAINING and Enterprise Council is offering interest-free loans to
employers and employees making a joint investment in training.
Stockport and High Peak Tec, based in Greater Manchester, is offering the
loans to finance individuals in small companies who ask employers to
contribute towards off-the-job training.
Mr Trevor Jones, chief executive of the Tec, said the scheme was aimed at
companies employing fewer than 50 which often did not have much money for
training.
The Tec hopes the initiative will come from individuals who want to enhance
their skills. With the approval of their employer they would seek a
contribution of at least 20 per cent towards the cost of the training.
After an application has been approved by the Tec, the individual will
receive a voucher to pay the training provider for the course. The
individual and their employer would pay back the cost to the Tec over 18
months.
Mr Jones said that if successful the scheme had national relevance at a time
when the use of vouchers, or entitlements, was being extended.

FT  29 SEP 92 / N-dump plan will face long delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLANNING application for permission to build Britain's first underground
repository for radioactive waste is not now expected to be made before the
second half of this decade, Mr Michael Folger, managing director of UK
Nirex, said yesterday.
The slippage in the planning timetable for the proposed Pounds 2.5bn
repository at Sellafield in west Cumbria stems from the decision by Nirex,
the nuclear waste disposal company, to bring forward plans for an
underground research laboratory for the study of rock on the site.
When in July 1991 Nirex announced Sellafield as its preferred site for a
repository for intermediate and low-level nuclear waste, it expected to
apply for planning permission this year, with 2005 as the target date for
the facility to begin operating.
In June this year, after examining initial results from boreholes drilled in
the area, it announced a one-year delay in its timetable for the project
because knowledge of the site's hydrogeology was 'not sufficiently firm'.
Yesterday Mr Folger said that Nirex hoped the repository would become
operational in 2006 or 2007, but added: 'We are very conscious there's a lot
outside our control.'
Nirex will unveil details of the research laboratory proposal next month. It
hopes to seek planning permission for it no later than October 1993. Even if
granted without a public inquiry, it would take two to three years to
construct. Data would then need to be analysed before a final decision on
whether to seek permission for the repository.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Anxiety mounts as poverty traps more victims: Fears over
possible cuts to the social security budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANTI-POVERTY campaigners are facing the coming tight public spending round
with at least as much anxiety as ministers.
In the most difficult public spending climate for years, there are mounting
fears that the Pounds 70bn social security budget - by far the biggest
single area of government expenditure - will not escape cost-containment
scrutiny.
Anti-poverty groups are rallying to the cause of Britain's low-income
families with a spate of reports designed to demonstrate that the poor
deserve greater support. The Low Pay Unit said yesterday that the pay gap is
wider now that at any time since official figures were first collected in
1886. In another report published today the Child Poverty Action Group
argues that some unemployed families have suffered cuts of more than 40 per
cent in the real value of unemployment benefit since 1979.
The latest official figures on poverty were published by the government just
before parliament rose for the summer recess. They give ammunition to those
who contend that the relative position of the poor declined during the
1980s.
Even so, suggests Professor Peter Townsend of Bristol University, one of
Britain's foremost academic specialists on poverty, the true position may be
worse. 'The government's procedures for gathering the figures are highly
technical and bizarre, and I have a fair amount of suspicion that they try
to choose data which put the poor in the best possible light.'
Poverty statistics are rarely open to value-free interpretation. There is as
much argument over definitions of poverty as there was this summer over
whether it causes urban disturbances such as those on the Hartcliffe Estate
in Bristol. The government's figures for 'households below average income'
show beyond reasonable doubt, however, that some of Britain's poorest people
became ever poorer in the 1980s.
Incomes of the poorest 10 per cent of the population after housing costs
were 6 per cent lower in 1988-89 than in 1979, while their share of total
income declined and the proportion of people living on less than half
average income rose from 9 per cent to 22 per cent after housing costs.
One of the government's intentions in its reform of social security in the
late 1980s was to target support on groups, such as families with children,
whom ministers believe are in most need.
Figures published in a written answer a few days before parliament rose show
the effect this policy is having on groups considered to have a lower
priority. The annual income support entitlement for a single unemployed
adult declined, at 1989 prices, from Pounds 1,725 in 1986-87 to Pounds 1,394
in 1989-90 - lower than in 1979-80, when it was Pounds 1,542.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has emphasised that the
statistics for households below average income show a growth in ownership of
consumer durables among the poorest section of the population. Prof Townsend
dismisses this point as 'really rather absurd', saying changes in material
circumstances have occured throughout history and that definitions of
poverty must take this into account.
The issues which concern Prof Townsend and his colleagues at Bristol
university are debated with equal intensity at the Single Parent Action
Network in Eastville, a voluntary project in an inner-city district a few
miles away.
Poverty is not only a political or an academic issue here, it is a practical
one.
Maria, a single parent, brings up two daughters aged one and eight on social
security support of between Pounds 60 and Pounds 70 per week plus housing
benefit. She says she would prefer to work but that the high cost of
childcare makes this economically impossible.
Ms Sue Cohen, the project co-ordinator, says examples of single parents
going without proper nourishment to feed their children are not unusual.
Prof Townsend believes a mechanism to tackle 'extreme inequalities in the
wage structure' would have to form part of a successful attack on poverty.
He says: 'Politicians on all sides shrink from this, but the fact is that
pay developments have got out of social control. Extremes of inequality in
the wage structure have social outcomes which have enormous costs to the
quality of our lives. It is all very well trying to justify low pay and
unemployment as the necessary ingredients for competition, but I believe we
are losing some of the possibilities of being competitive by allowing
inequalities in the wage structure to become so extreme.'
Women at the Single Parent Action Network say an attack on poverty would
require strong, positive government policies to support the family -
recognising that families often contain only one parent. They regard the
government's plans to pursue absent fathers who fail to support their
families as a blind-alley approach which will increase pressures on some
mothers.
'Many women who come to the network display tremendous potential. But they
have little chance of realising it without adequate childcare and training
provision aimed at the particular needs of single parents,' says Ms Cohen.
'People very quickly get drawn into the culture of poverty. And the really
alarming thing is how quickly their children get drawn into it as well.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Teachers call for forcible opting out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL SCHOOLS in each local education authority area in England and Wales
should be obliged to opt out of its control once 75 per cent of pupils are
at schools which have already opted out, the National Association of Head
Teachers said yesterday.
This would prevent a local authority from 'withering on the vine' to the
detriment of the diminishing number of schools left in its authority.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed the proposal. 'They are being
more radical than the government. I think it's quite a constructive input to
the debate and I will consider it carefully,' he said.
The government's white paper on education, published in July, says the
proposed Funding Agency for Schools will have joint responsibility for
school provision with local education authorities once the level of primary
or secondary pupils in opted-out schools reaches 10 per cent. The funding
agency would take over completely when the level rises to 75 per cent. The
funding agency would take over payment of funds to opted-out schools as well
as a range of powers from local education authorities.
The NAHT urged a rethink to stop the confusion of town halls and the funding
agency being forced to share power. It said that the agency should control
provision of places once a 50 per cent threshold was reached, with all
primary or secondary schools opting out automatically once 75 per cent of
pupils were grant-maintained.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said the proposal was 'dangerous,
destructive and defeatist' and accused the NAHT of 'chucking in the towel
before the fight has begun'.
However, the NAHT yesterday attacked the white paper a free-market recipe
for 'confusion and uncertainty'. Plans for schools to opt for a new system
without local education authorities were 'fatally flawed', it said.
The suggestion that the cost of the new framework, including new
bureaucracies, could be met without extra cost showed a 'breathtaking
disregard of current underfunding', the NAHT said.
The National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, yesterday also
attacked the changes set out in the white paper, saying it was a 'charter
for political interference'.
It warned that the plan would take power away from town halls, which are
accountable to voters, and place it instead in the hands of the government
and bureaucrats.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, said: 'Instead of freeing children's
abilities through high-quality education, he (Mr Patten) intends to tie up
their future with red tape stretching back to Whitehall.'
Business should increase links with schools and make a 'blue-chip'
investment in well-educated young people, Mr Patten told a Confederation of
British Industry conference on the white paper.
He told the conference: 'We need to create an environment in the classroom
which actively promotes and encourages a positive attitude towards industry.
Industry can be exciting and rewarding. We must help young people to see
this.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Companies criticised over use of standard on leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE failing to follow the spirit of the accounting standard
dealing with leasing, according to the latest edition of Company Reporting,
the Edinburgh-based monthly monitoring service of annual accounts.
'While most companies have complied with the standard, in some cases the
spirit of the standard has not been maintained,' says the October edition.
SAAP 21, the leasing standard introduced in 1984, allows certain leases to
be excluded from the balance sheets in companies' accounts.
These include 'operating leases' by which the company is not expected to be
exposed to the risks and rewards of ownership.
The standard has been criticised by bodies including the financial reporting
and auditing group of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales.
Company Reporting says many companies have found a number of ways of
structuring transactions to avoid placing leases on the balance sheet.
It says some companies have interpreted as a strict rule the guideline
suggesting that leases can be excluded if minimum lease payments amount to
90 per cent or more of the fair value of the asset.
An analysis of 280 published company accounts shows that 88 per cent of
companies show evidence of operating leases. If these were placed on balance
sheet, the gearing - or ratio of debt to equity - would increase sharply.
Company Reporting says the majority of companies with operating leases
satisfy the minimum disclosure requirements of the standard, and some go
beyond the minimum requirement.
All but 6 per cent of companies with operating leases disclose commitments
payable in the following year. Three per cent provide no analysis of lease
expiry dates for those payable in the following year, and 3 per cent offer
no disclosure of future commitments at all.
However, from a sample of 570 companies only 1.4 per cent disclose evidence
of having engaged in sale and leaseback transactions in the previous year.
A sale and leaseback occurs when the original owner of an asset sells it and
immediately leases it back. This allows companies to remove the assets from
the balance sheet.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Retailers warned of rise in consumer cynicism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAILERS will confront a changed world once the recession is over, with
consumers being more sophisticated, more cynical and more cost-conscious
than ever before, Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of
Kingfisher group, told the first day of the Financial Times conference on
retailing yesterday.
He warned retailers that in the run-up to the year 2000 retailers would have
to take note of such changes if they were to survive, and predicted that
there would be no repetition of the consumer-credit boom of the 1980s.
Between 1982 and 1990 total consumer credit expanded from Pounds 15.5bn to
Pounds 52bn, but Mr Mulcahy said he anticipated much slower growth, to
perhaps Pounds 70bn, by the end of the decade.
Changes in lifestyles and attitudes would make customers far more demanding,
imposing additional costs on retailers. Mr Mulcahy said that, for example, a
higher percentage of women would be employed full-time and would thus have
far less time to shop, which would add to pressures for stores to have
longer opening hours.
By 1996 the number of people aged between 35 and 59 in the UK will outnumber
those in the 16-24 age range. This ageing of the population would lead to a
shift in demand for certain categories of products. He also predicted that
the growth of 'green' consumerism would increase pressure on retailers to
scrutinise the environmental impact of their products and practices.
Mr Mulcahy said successful companies would have to lift levels of
productivity to increase profitability by increasing sales volumes without
increasing the amount of floorspace they used.
Mr Andrew Wileman, a partner with OC&amp;C strategy consultants, part of the
accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, defined two types of retailer -
'proximity retailers', which operated near where consumers lived, and
'destination retailers', which relied on persuading consumers to travel to
them.
Mr Wileman predicted a considerable growth in both categories. He said
successful companies in destination retailing - such as Toys R Us - were
those that were 'geared to deliver high volume at low gross margins'.
Mr Malcolm MacLachlan, executive director and retail analyst with UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, the London investment banking arm of Union Bank of
Switzerland, said that among the main European economies Germany and France
were going to have the best economic prospects in the 1990s, and therefore
the best outlook for retail consumer spending. He added that the worst
prospects were in Sweden and the UK.

HARASSMENT at work makes poor economic sense for employers, according to the
Institute of Personnel Management, Lisa Wood writes.
Workers taunted over their sex, race, disability, union membership or even
age become inefficient and often leave their jobs, the institute said
yesterday. The institute is the main professional body for personnel
managers.
It has sent a booklet to its 50,000 members defining harassment and its
effects and outlining procedures to deal with bullying of all kinds.
The booklet says: 'Harassment exacts a high price for both the victim and
the employer because the stress, anxiety and fear it can impose on an
employee can cause absenteeism, illness and poor performance.
'Nor are the effects limited to the victim of harassment. Other employees
are affected to a greater or lesser degree. It all adds up to waste and
inefficiency as well as misery and it has to be stopped.'
Mr Roger Farrance, president of the institute, said: 'An environment in
which harassment occurs reflects as badly on the organisation as on any of
the employees within it.'

measure
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN THE fanciest electronic calculator will jibe at the quirks of the
world's systems for measuring and quantifying. When is a billion a milliard?
What is a trillionth? The answers depend on where the questions are asked.
Thank goodness, then, for The Economist Desk Companion (Century
Business/Economist Books Pounds 20, 272 pages), which takes over from the
World Measurement Guide and goes a megametre forward. It gives an
authoritative description of the metric system, arguing that it will be
standard by the end of the present decade.
A series of chapters gives industry definitions and terms of everything from
shoe sizes to shotgun bores. The sections on weapons and space are
particularly fascinating. The danger of such information is that employees
will spend time reading the book rather than simply finding what they were
looking for. Managers should keep it locked in a desk drawer.
The last third of the book consists of conversion tables. There are even
tables for calculating mortgage payments and APR interest rates. All in all,
this is a thoroughly useful book and worth every penny.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): At last, the real
history of banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL BANKING 1870-1914 edited by Rondo Cameron and V I Bovykin
Oxford Pounds 68, 655 pages
BANKING IS an industry remarkable for its lack of history. Not in the sense
that the activity of banking has no history: Professor Rondo Cameron reminds
us that there were multinational banks as early as the 13th century. By the
time of the Medici bank 200 years later, financiers had discovered the
advantages of holding companies for controlling sprawling networks of
international branches.
Rather, the history is curiously unwritten, particularly in its later
stages. Banking, after all, has long been vital to and inseparable from the
trading impulses which move goods and services around the world. Yet we
remain largely ignorant of the way in which banks responded to a demand for
capital that became ever more international and intense after 1870.
As Professors Cameron and Bovykin point out, in the period to the outbreak
of World War One, international commerce grew at the unprecedented rate of
more than 3 per cent per annum for the world as a whole, and much faster
than that for the leading commercial nations.
International investment forged ahead in similar fashion. Britain was singly
responsible for 40 per cent of total foreign investment, but other western
European nations also provided huge credits to borrowers such as the US, the
Russian Empire, Latin America and Oceania. The market for capital became
more integrated and international than ever.
But what role did banks play in the process? And what were the reciprocal
effects of nations' progress towards industrialisation on the banks
themselves
In an impressive attempt to address these questions, Cameron and Bovykin
have orchestrated an army of scholars. They set out with the view that
international activity was crucial to an understanding of the mechanisms by
which banking structures in individual countries were formed into shapes
recognisable as the precursors of today's systems.
In 1870 Britain, for example, had the largest foreign investments and the
best developed banking system. However, UK domestic banks were scarcely
involved in international activity before 1890. Foreign investment was
handled mainly by the private banks, which exploited their extensive
overseas connections through the London Stock Exchange. Even when the
domestic banks did become involved, they tended to do so indirectly, placing
deposits at the disposal of bill brokers and discount houses for the
short-term financing of trade.
By contrast, Cameron suggests that in Europe there was a closer identity of
interests between the private and joint stock bankers, with the result that
the latter played a greater role in the mobilisation and deployment of
capital for foreign investment.
Obviously, however, there were considerable national differences and these
are usefully explored by the various contributors. So too is the way in
which the formation of national banking systems was influenced by the
experience and activities of the international lenders.
The single conclusion for which this volume will long be remembered concerns
banks and those other conduits of capital, the multinational corporations.
Contrary to their expectations, Cameron and Bovykin found that banks were
not responsible for the emergence of multinational industrial enterprises.
The banks certainly facilitated their expansion, mainly by providing
short-term working capital and by financing the international movement of
commodities. But their foreign investments were mostly undertaken in direct
transactions with governments or in the form of social overhead capital,
especially railways.
With minor exceptions, banks did not take the initiative in organising
trading concerns, nor did they control large volumes of equity capital. By
and large, industrial companies grew by self-investment.
Indeed, the final section of the book examines the rise of multinationals
across a series of industries, from oil to electrotechnologies, and gives
plenty of evidence for the bankers' reticence. One proposed chapter on the
chemical industry was abandoned when the author showed that there was simply
too little bank involvement to be of interest.
Cameron posits a straightforward explanation. In both its private and joint
stock forms, international banking had already developed into a highly
specialised business. Its leaders recognised their risk-taking as quite
distinct from that of industrial entrepreneurs, and where they paid too
little heed to that central observation, they usually regretted it.
By any standard, Cameron and Bovykin have put together an important volume.
In the impoverished context of banking history, the book stands out as a key
work which will form the basis of much future study.
If there is a criticism, it is that the project has been too long in the
making - it was conceived a decade ago, when it was remarkable for its
cooperation between then Soviet and western historians. Inevitably, that
seems less extraordinary today. Although there is a neat circularity about
descriptions of bankers to the Russian empire, the reader cannot help
noticing ideological confusion among some contributors which obscures
important questions.
There is, for example, an unhelpful debate on the connection between
international banking and capitalist imperialism. It is a relief when
Cameron dispatches the subject in a telling but diplomatic conclusion.
Britain, which had both the largest empire and the most money to lend, made
more than half of its foreign investments in independent countries.
As for France, less than 10 per cent of its investments went to French
colonies. The notion of a systematic connection between foreign investment
and imperialism fails the simplest examination.

THE EAST EUROPEAN OPPORTUNITY by Marvin Zonis and Dwight Semle John Wiley
Dollars 49.95, 438 pages
ANYONE DOING business in Eastern Europe knows that accurate statistics are
hard to find. Sources, even good ones, quickly turn obsolete. Here, hot off
the press, is a new, thick resource book by Professor Marvin Zonis and Mr
Dwight Semler of the University of Chicago, which should help fill the void
for this season, at least.
The East European Opportunity is a compendium of facts (historical,
demographic, economic, cultural, legislative) for each Eastern European
country: Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia.
The book's main strength is that if provides detailed statistics for
countries like Bulgaria and Romania, where very little information exists.
For example, in Bulgaria, 30 per cent of households own vacuum cleaners;
installed electricity-generating capacity is 11.31m. kilowatts. The main
weakness of the book is that, alas, the section on Yugoslavia is a painful
reminder of what that country used to be.
The authors have written something akin to Fodor's Europe - a general guide
to the region with 60 to 70 pages devoted to each country.
Anyone who is working in one of the countries would require far more
detailed information, of the sort published in weekly newsletters and
textline updates. But as a primer, and a factual sourcebook for the region,
this must be one of the best new volumes on the market.

TEDDY GOLDSMITH'S book is readable only if you share certain beliefs with
him. First, that 'if current trends persist, the planet will cease to be
capable of supporting complex forms of life'. Second, that science, economic
growth and individualism are undesirable. Third, that these messages are so
important that they justify considerable repetition.
Goldsmith, brother of financier James, has found inspiration in the 'Gaia'
philosophies of the maverick British scientist James Lovelock. According to
Gaia, the planet and its oceans, rocks and life, form a unifed system which
regulates the conditions that sustain life. Goldsmith maintains that 'there
is thus a single law which governs the behaviour of the whole cosmic
hierarchy'. He adds 'our modern society has quite clearly set out
systematically to deviate from the Way' - the path that allows this
stability.
Goldsmith's 66 chapters, which assert principles such as 'Ecology seeks to
establish the laws of nature' and 'Gaia is alive', by the end become
claustrophobic, defining his philosophy by the things he rejects. He is
contemptuous of birth control as an aid to the population problems of the
Third World. He dismisses the use of medicine to cure 'individual sufferers'
because 'it will always serve the interests of industrialists and their
political allies (through pharmaceutical profits) but it will do nothing to
reduce the incidence of the disease', which is a symptom of the world's
divergence from the Way. This shows little regard for people and less for
accuracy - what about smallpox?
Peter Marshall also finds a solution to the world's problems in Gaia. A
broad though shallow survey of ecological thinking, his book is full of
ill-expressed aphorisms such as 'The Indians went down with the the buffalo.
Ecocide was followed by genocide.' His technique is to award points to the
world's religions, poets, philosophers and scientists for ecological
soundness. Thus he compliments Plato for 'anticipating Gaia' in describing
the world as a 'living being', but criticises Benedictine monks for
dominating nature by 'stealing' honey from bees.
When he turns to musing on Gaia he becomes tangled in its incoherence: how
to describe a system that regulates its 'organs' to sustain life without
personifying the planet - a vocabulary to which he eventually surrenders. He
concludes with relief that something bigger than mere humans is looking
after the planet's fate and that 'Gaia offers almost a new pagan religion in
a secular age'.
Guilt as well as fear appears to be the impulse behind How Much is Enough?,
one of a series from the environmentally-pessimistic Worldwatch Institute in
Washington. Like Goldsmith, Alan Durning believes that economic growth is
undesirable, and he is similarly trying to find 'a path of development that
does not lead to ruin'.
He blames advertising, commercial television and shopping malls for creating
'needs' in people where none existed. He sees the growth of material desire
as the corruption of morality: 'Sadly, hard-pressed developing nations sell
their ecological souls all too often in the attempt to make ends meet'.
Material goods, beyond a basic level, do not make people happy and their
production damages the environment.
These propositions can be contested, as can his pessimism. He does not
distinguish between growth and the environmental damage it produces, which
can often be reduced by forethought or regulation, so he has no prescription
for reducing that damage except reducing growth. Mistrustful of science, he
does not believe it can offer solutions to the expanding population and - as
he sees it - fast vanishing resources of the planet. But the past few
decades have multiplied the yield of many cereals, and estimates of the
planet's reserves of oil and gas have risen eightfold in the past 40 years.
Without justifying the reasons for pessimism more solidly, the book seems
puritanical in its equation of material desire with guilt. These authors
share a longing for a simpler, more spiritual or more innocent life. They
are dismissive of other people's desires, which include material goods, and
of the ingenuity that people devote to achieving them.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING DEREGULATION: THE GREAT BANKING EXPERIMENTby Richard
Dale Blackwell Pounds 40, 211 pages
SHOULD BANKS be allowed to get into the securities business? To some the
question may seem absurd. No one asks whether a tobacco company should be
allowed to diversify into, say, food processing. The only relevant question
is whether experience and analysis suggest that such a move would be in the
long term interest of the company and its shareholders.
Banks, however, are special. Failure, or the threat of failure of one bank,
can weaken rather than strengthen its competitors. Because of their central
position in the financial economy, what happens to banks can have serious
knock-on effects. So banks are regulated in a way other industries are not.
On mixing banking and securities businesses, regulatory and institutional
practice has varied widely. In Germany and Switzerland it has always been
allowed. In the UK it has only prevailed since 'Big Bang' in 1986. In the US
it was common in the 1920s but has been illegal under the Glass-Steagall Act
since 1933 because it was thought to have contributed to the Great
Depression. In Japan, a law analogous to Glass-Steagall has been in force
since the war under a US legal code.
Richard Dale's study is a model of clarity in exposition and fair-mindedness
in argument. The central chapters describe the position in half-a-dozen
countries, analysing the underlying dynamics: how and why did matters come
to be as they are and what are the pressures for change?
Framing these chapters is an excellent discussion of the arguments in
principle for and against the merging of banking and securities activities.
Banks have usually argued in favour, citing potential economic benefits for
themselves and their customers in terms of greater competition, cost savings
and the convenience of 'one-stop' banking. Dale is prepared to accept the
force of these arguments (though experience in London since Big Bang might
argue for scepticism).
Regulators and legislators tend to have been cautious on two main grounds:
potential conflicts of interest and the dangers of contagious risk.
Conflicts of interest can arise when the roles of principal and agent or
adviser are combined - the possibilities of 'stuffing' clients with
particular securities; of all kinds of insider information; and of
distortion of securities markets by the lending power of banks. Again,
however, Dale is not too worried by these problems believing, perhaps
reasonably, that a regime of Chinese Walls, properly policed and legally
enforced, will minimise the dangers.
Dale's over-riding concern is with increased risk. Although later work
appears to absolve universal banking in the US in the 1920s from most of the
blame for exacerbating the Depression, and although securities activities do
not appear statistically more risky than banking, there remains for Dale the
crucial point that 'they do provide opportunities for additional risk-taking
for aggressively managed institutions'. The behaviour of the US Savings and
Loan institutions provides him with an awful warning.
If a bank is allowed to do securities business, how can we avoid the danger
that losses in that business may threaten the individual bank and thus -
potentially - the system? First, we need adequate supervision. But the
securities industry needs its own regulators. So a conglomerate bank will
have at least two (often more) supervisors, with attendant dangers of
divided responsibilities. Dale is critical of the UK's pragmatic solution to
the problem by means of establishing for each institution a lead-regulator
with arrangements for passing information between regulators. It is untidy,
but probably works better in practice than Dale allows.
But not even a perfect supervisory regime can (or should) prevent losses.
If, in spite of all efforts, a securities subsidiary of a bank runs up
losses that are substantial in relation to the bank's balance sheet, how is
the bank to be protected?
One solution, canvassed in the US in the current debate on whether to repeal
Glass-Steagall, is to make it legally possible (or even required) for the
parent to walk away from the subsidiary. Dale argues forcibly (and surely
rightly) that this would in practice prove impossible, or dangerous - or
both.
The opposite solution is, while accepting that the parent must take
responsibility, to require that the subsidiary is fully, separately
capitalised. But, Dale argues, to be effective this approach is likely to
make it economically pointless for the two activities to be combined.
So Dale believes the circle cannot be squared. In this, he is perhaps too
tidy-minded. But he is right to warn of the risks of experimentation,
especially in the present state of the world's financial system - risks of
which those in Brussels charged with developing the prospective regime for
the EC appear to under-rate.

FT  29 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts strike at ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SAVAGE downgrade and sell recommendation on ICI shares by Hoare Govett,
joint broker to the blue chip chemical group, sent the stock tumbling and
had other brokers reaching for their red pens. The company appeared to have
hinted at a poor third quarter's trading.
BZW, ICI's other broker, and Goldman Sachs revised forecasts down to Pounds
660m, and James Capel to Pounds 650m. Other houses are expected to follow
suit today. The downgrades raised questions over whether ICI would maintain
its dividend, which on Hoare's figures would barely be covered.
Hoare cut its 1992 profit forecast by 21 per cent to Pounds 620m - with
1993's forecast reduced from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 875m. It also moved from a
hold to an overvalued stance, and analyst Mr Martin Evans believes that the
shares are some 10 per cent overvalued. Yesterday's fall left the shares
down 63 at 1145p.
ICI was believed to have told analysts that third quarter trading had been
'bleak', with European bulk chemicals business particularly badly hit and US
trading not helped by weakness in the dollar.
Drug stocks ease
Pharmaceutical stocks remained under pressure as US buyers continued to
respond to 'take profits' advice amid worries about a Democratic party win
in the US presidential elections. Not even positive trading news for two
stocks could reverse the downward trend. Glaxo, still suffering from its
comparison with US drugs group Merck, revealed good news for one of its
leading products in France, but closed 24 off at 746p. Wellcome, which
received US approval for one of its second line products, retreated 41 to
909p. The company was also endorsed by Merrill Lynch yesterday as 'the best
UK drug stock', despite a small downgrading by the US-owned broker.
Taking a different tack yesterday, Mr Andy Porter, drugs specialist at
Nikko, advised clients to take advantage of a 'classic UK buying
opportunity' in the drugs sector. Mr Porter argued that the current US
selling is prompted by currency worries and that the US political concerns
are already in the price. He said that when the currency situation
stabilised, UK drug stocks would need to be upgraded by around 10 per cent.
Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) remained in the firing line as worries about
increased competition in international traffic were followed by a report
that talks aimed at forging a link between C &amp; W and US West, the US
telecoms group, had been terminated.
C &amp; W shares have been very active this year as the market has reacted to
reports of imminent links with either AT&amp;T or US West.
Analysts said the market had overreacted. 'The merest hint of a shift in
strategy by C &amp; W will get the shares on the move; what the market needs to
remember is that C &amp; W is a strong, well-managed global company with a
rapidly expanding earnings profile.' C &amp; W shares opened sharply lower at
555p but quickly rallied to close only 9 off at 573p after turnover of 3.2m.
Utilities responded to a series of recent brokers circulars suggesting that
the water and electricity sectors had been oversold since the withdrawal
from the ERM, a move that triggered an upsurge in interest-rate sensitive
and cyclical stocks.
London Electricity rose 7 to 390p, while Wessex outperformed the water
sector, closing 20 higher at 510p.
Very large turnover in Guinness followed French group LVMH (Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton) increasing its stake in the drinks company to 24 per as part
of a complex cross-share agreement between the two.
Yesterday's share purchase was caused by the take-up by Guinness in June of
a batch of conversion shares which reduced LVMH's holding slightly below the
agreed level. SG Warburg bought 11m Guinness shares at 555p for the French
group in a move which had been anticipated for some weeks and had helped to
maintain Guinness's share price.
It is thought the French group was waiting for some stability in the
currency markets before making its purchase. Guinness shares closed at 540p,
off 12. Turnover reached 26m.
Banks shares stumbled after recently outperforming the market, upset both by
press comment suggesting the sector had been overbought and also by hints of
profit downgrades.
TSB, still burdened by market worries over the performance of its Hill
Samuel merchant bank, drifted back 4 to 132p although turnover was an
unremarkable 2.2m. Barclays drifted off 12 to 362p and Lloyds 14 to 452p.
HSBC fell 55 to 406p on 6.2m.
Currency factors helped to lift Unilever, as dealers reported fund managers
switching out of the Dutch NV and into the UK plc on a belief that that
funds would benefit from faster earnings growth in sterling. The food group
was also benefiting from talk in some quarters that it was relatively cheap.
The shares rose 13 to 1062p.
Among brewery stocks, Grand Met slipped 26 to 423p after a large line of
stock overhung the market and BZW downgraded the group; just before the
close a block of 2m shares changed hands at 423p.
In a weak stores sector, Boots suffered along with the other drugs stocks,
the shares retreating 14 to 483p. Kingfisher lost 20 to 515p as fears of a
price war in the DIY business reappeared and the chairman was reported to
have warned that prices may have to rise in the whole group as a result of
sterling devaluation. Ladbroke also fell on DIY worries, the shares down 13
1/2 at 160 1/2 p. Pentos declined 6 to 77 after SG Warburg was said to have
crossed a block of 6.2m shares at 75p. Turnover reached 12.7m.
Kenwood Appliances, the electrical goods manufacturer, slumped 42 to 245p.
Albert E Sharp, the stockbroker, visited the group and was said to have
joined other broking houses in shifting its current year profits forecast to
below Pounds 10m.
Holders of British Aerospace continued to sell the stock at every
opportunity in the wake of last week's disappointing figures. The shares
fell a further 9 to 116p in heavy trade of 5.9m. The company has invited
analysts to a presentation this morning for what one observer called 'an
attempt to steady nerves'. Suggestions that BAe could receive a bid offer
from cash rich GEC, 3 up at 248p, continued to circulate.
Shares in motor components group T and N were heavily traded and volume rose
to 11m, mainly due to one trade of 5.9m. Part of that block continued to
overhang the market and the shares gave up 5 to 147p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the derivatives reported a dull session as the weekend worries
over the outlook for the UK economy continued yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo.
Bear closing early in the session saw the December contract on the FT-SE
advance from its starting position of 2,638 to 2,643 within the first hour
of business.
The worries over the economy along with the profits downgrade in ICI by its
joint broker sent a chill around the market and December fell back to 2,619
at around 10am.
For the next few hours, December traded in a range of 2,620 to 2,635 before
the weakness in other European markets and another bout of selling over the
lunch time period caused it to fall to 2,615, the low point of the day.
December remained volatile during the afternoon and closed at 2,621, down 29
on Friday's close and around 20 points above its fair value premium to cash
of about 40. Turnover was poor reaching only 7,364 lots.
In the traded options, total turnover was just 20,382 contracts, of which a
mere 7,483 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Barclays bank was the most
actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,334 trades.

FT  29 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy profit-taking hits share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW found confidence of the UK stock market was tested yesterday as
uncertainties surrounding Britain's future relationship with the ERM
combined with caution over the outlook for Wall Street. A heavy brokerage
downgrade of ICI, still a core stock of the London market and of most
institutional funds, struck a blow at an international blue chip sector
already unsettled by a weaker US dollar.
Strategists noted uneasily that defensive sectors, such as the utilities,
had returned to fashion and that some sizeable lines of stock had come on
offer, although failure to attract buyers kept these potential deals from
featuring on the Seaq trading screens.
The FT-SE Index, in retreat throughout the session, closed virtually at the
day's low, with the fall of 41 points giving a final reading of 2,560.
London was discouraged by a lacklustre opening to the new session on Wall
Street, itself seen as overshadowed by President Bush's election campaign.
The deeper damage came on the domestic front, however, and reflected
developments last weekend which indicated that both the UK Conservative
government and the Labour opposition are in disarray over policies towards
Maastricht and the ERM. Also, suggestions that Britain might be sidelined to
a mini-ERM system unsettled City confidence in further cuts in UK base
rates; such confidence was not helped by yesterday's rise in Irish interest
rates.
These uncertainties were sufficient reason for some investors to take
profits without waiting for the end of the equity trading account on Friday.
The account will also ring down the curtain on the third quarter of the year
for fund managers' portfolios.
The one point cut in base rates which followed Britain's temporary
withdrawal from the ERM generated substantial profits among the retail and
consumer-orientated stocks. Many fund managers have evidently decided to
take such profits now and put the money into cash for the final two days of
the third quarter.
Trading volume eased off somewhat yesterday, and the day's Seaq-recorded
total of 487.6m shares compared with 693.3m on Friday, when retail of
customer business remained high at a worth of Pounds 1.3bn. The value of
retail-based equity business has now exceeded the Pounds 1bn daily benchmark
level for the past eight trading sessions for a total of Pounds 14.4bn.
The strongly bearish review of ICI hurt the market and inspired a general
review of the bullish economic view expressed in the City since sterling was
effectively devalued. The consumer sectors were challenged by a strong
warning from the chairman of Kingfisher, the leading store group, that the
fall in sterling could mean higher retail prices.
However, share traders stressed that most of the damage to prices yesterday
reflected an unwillingness by investors to buy any more stock at the moment.
On the wider questions of strategy, fund managers appeared inclined to wait
for clarification of the UK government's new economic policies.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Japanese paper lifted by continued
strength of yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE continued strength of the yen against the US dollar helped lift Japanese
government bonds, which ended the day above Friday's close.
Bonds rallied as the dollar fell below Y120 in Tokyo, since a strong yen
means it is easier for the Bank of Japan to lower interest rates. The US
currency traded at around Y119.45 in London.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.78 per cent and moved to
4.77 per cent on yen strength. It ended the day at 4.785 per cent, against
Friday's close of 4.80 per cent. Volume in the cash market was average, with
dealers accounting for most of the activity.
The strengthening of the yen is partly accounted for by the flight of
Japanese capital out of Europe and back to Japan ahead of the end-September
book-keeping.
Mr Ian Rosser, economist at Nomura International, points out that it is
'unlikely that this flow will be reversed until the situation in Europe
becomes clearer and the US presidential election is out of the way -
consequently the yen should strengthen further.' Tomorrow, the Ministry of
Finance is due to auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds. Traders expect a
re-opening of the No 151 issue, with a coupon of 5 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds drifted lower, with dealers complaining the market
had been overbought on Friday on talk of a two-speed Europe whereby Germany,
France and the Benelux countries would move more quickly towards Emu. EC
finance ministers were quoted last night as firmly rejecting the possibility
of a two-speed Europe.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 90.69, close to the high of the
day of 90.71, and drifted down to a low of 90.28. The futures contract ended
at around 90.34, and volumes were below average.
Dealers said the market ignored fairly favourable inflation figures from the
state of Bavaria, where the cost of living climbed 0.2 per cent in the month
to mid-September, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.9 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds ended lower in spite of a strengthening of the
French franc. Wholesale money market rates remained high, even though the
franc recovered to reach 3.3690 to 3.3700 per D-Mark, closer to its EMS
pivot of 3.35386 than the 3.4305 floor.
SPANISH government bonds ended lower as the peseta continued to hug the
floor of its fluctuation band in the ERM.
Dealers said the Spanish market spent yesterday waiting for the outcome of
the EC finance ministers' meeting in Brussels.
The 10-year government bond fell from 85.50 to 84.90. Dealers said
foreigners continue to shun the Spanish bond market following the
introduction of capital controls last week. They were intended to hit
currency speculators, but increased funding costs for buyers of Spanish
bonds.
HOPES of a base rate cut helped to support short-dated UK government bonds
yesterday, while inflation fears pushed long-dated gilts lower.
Among short-dated issues, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 firmed from 102
27/32 to 102 7/8 to yield 8.13 per cent.
At the long end of the market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 fell from 98 3/8
to 98 3/32 to yield 9.23 per cent.
Index-linked issues continued to gain from doubts about the government's
anti-inflation resolve with the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked issue climbing
from 99 3/32 to 99 21/32 .
US Treasury prices firmed yesterday on hopes of an interest rate cut in the
wake of last week's bad economic news.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 98
7/8 , to yield 7.337 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer at
the halfway mark, up  1/32 at 100 13/32 , yielding 3.771 per cent.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: US futures exchanges poised
to compete with swaps markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FUTURES exchanges could soon be competing with the over-the-counter swaps
markets, following a long-awaited decision last week on the regulation of US
futures markets. A US House and Senate conference committee approved
legislation stating swaps fall outside the remit of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC), the futures regulator.
The resolution, expected to be approved by the full House and Senate this
week, is part of a bill defining the powers of the CFTC and toughening US
futures industry regulation.
The regulatory exemption removes a significant threat to the OTC swaps
markets, as well as creating opportunities for futures exchanges. Mr William
O'Connor, Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) chairman, said his exchange was
poised to begin trading swaps electronically on an in-house daytime trading
system: Project A. The system, which goes on line in mid-October, is a
testbed for products which might not otherwise attract enough interest to
warrant pit trading. Other exchanges are satisfied that OTC trading
contributes substantial volume to their futures contracts, and are not
anxious to enter competitive products. 'We have no plans to begin swap
trading,' the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) said. Nymex extended
delivery periods for its crude oil futures contracts to 36 months to meet
demand from hedgers. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) says billions of
dollars of currency and interest rate swaps are priced in the CME Eurodollar
futures pit every year. Like the Nymex, the CME has extended Eurodollar
futures delivery, although to five years to accommodate the swap industry.
Meanwhile, last week's decision removed a potential problem for the
burgeoning swaps industry. US futures exchanges had argued swaps were a type
of future, and should be subject to CFTC regulation. Under current rules,
futures traded outside US futures exchanges are illegal and unenforceable.
Swaps comprise a market in excess of Dollars 4,000bn a year according to the
International Swap Dealers Association. The business has exploded since
1987, when companies discovered they could exchange interest rate and
currency risks through long-term contracts and trading firms found a niche
as market makers.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Equity Issues: Danish Dollars 500m issue
offers another test for unsettled fixed-rate dollar sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest test of the unsettled fixed-rate USDollars sector of the
international bond market is expected as early as today, as Denmark steps in
to borrow Dollars 500m.
After the difficulty with which the market has digested large dollar issues
from Spain and Ontario in the past fortnight, the reception accorded
Denmark's issue of five-year bonds could provide an important pointer for
what other borrowers can expect in the weeks ahead.
Late yesterday, bankers in London said that the Denmark issue had been
aggressively bid for, with the mandate likely to be awarded to a bank which
quoted a spread of close to 30 basis points over US Treasuries, compared
with the 55 basis points paid by Spain for its seven-year issue.
The Danish deal has exposed widely different opinions among bankers about
the current state of the market, with bids reported to have ranged from
under 30 basis points to over 45.
The pessimists claim that Italy's decision to apply a 12 1/2 per cent
withholding tax to repurchase agreements (or repos) involving bonds issued
by supranational agencies such as the World Bank will have a big long-term
impact on bond prices.
According to one banker in London, some Dollars 20bn to Dollars 30bn of
bonds is currently tied up in such repos.
As these repos mature over the coming 12 months, Italian banks may try to
dispose of many of the bonds, pushing yields up which will have an effect on
the spreads on other issues.
Optimists, on the other hand, point to Spain's problems as merely the result
of bad timing, rather than any substantial increase in yield spreads in
recent days.
'It is difficult to see a consistent move of more than about 5 basis points
for the quality issuers,' one banker said yesterday. 'There's a readjustment
going on, but it's not a bloodbath.'
Meanwhile, the flow of collared floating rate notes continued yesterday with
some signs of more generous pricing in the wake of the aggressive batch of
deals from top-rated borrowers last week.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Ministers bid for places in
single currency fast lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN finance ministers yesterday publicly rejected the idea of a
two-speed approach to monetary union, but governments are placing bids to
participate in the 'fast track' towards a single currency.
However, as Mr Bertie Ahern, Irish finance minister, yesterday reminded his
continental European counterparts, Ireland was one of only a few EC members
to meet the Maastricht targets. The Maastricht treaty envisaged a period of
economic convergence leading up to formal currency union by the year 2000.
Only countries which met the criteria would proceed to a single currency.
Yet most of the economies tipped to participate in a closer monetary union -
not least Germany - are running annual budget deficits well in excess of the
3 per cent of gross domestic product laid down by the treaty.
Belgium's budget deficit is likely to total 5.5 per cent of GDP this year,
almost twice the Maastricht limit.
In contrast, Denmark's participation in any core group is uncertain, even
though economic convergence on many measures has been achieved. Inflation
averaged only 2.4 per cent last year, and the current account shows a
healthy surplus. However, the Danish electorate's rejection of Maastricht in
June leaves the country in an awkward position.
'There is no illusion about Denmark having much independence from Germany in
terms of monetary policy already, but there is no political mandate for
moving to currency union,' said Mr Kit Jukes, economist at Warburg
Securities.
The Danish government is expected next month to unveil a revised plan for
winning electoral approval of the Maastricht treaty. The country's
participation in any future moves toward European integration, let alone a
fast track a single currency, will turn on the result.
However, analysts are cautious about predicting windfall gains in the bond
markets of any countries which do embark on the fast track towards monetary
union. Yields will probably converge with the German bund market, but in
many cases from very low levels.
Moreover, some premium over German yields may still be necessary. In
particular, investors may demand a 'liquidity premium' from bond markets
smaller than the bund market. This does not imply that the smaller markets
are difficult to trade. Belgium reformed its bond market two years ago
precisely to improve liquidity.
However, big international investors are likely to allocate cash to bunds
ahead of smaller European markets and bund yields may be consistently lower
as a result, even if currency risk is removed by currency union or system of
fixed exchange rates.
If international investors do still favour the bund market, the smaller
markets may suffer from the failure of their own governments to meet the
Maastricht criteria on public sector borrowing.
For example, the yield spread of Dutch bonds over bunds, which tends to
fluctuate between 20 and 30 basis points at the 10-year maturity, often
widens in periods of high government borrowing.
The Dutch government's deficit is likely to be around 3.75 per cent of GDP
this year, proportionately higher than that of Germany.
Analysts also warn that high government borrowing in Germany could still
damage the returns from bond markets tied to the German market in currency
union.
While the Bundesbank is expected to cut short-term interest rates as the
economy slows, longer-term bund yields are sensitive to concerns about
inflation and supply of new bunds.
Lower yield spreads over the German market could come about through higher
bund yields.

600m takeover

<TEXT>
WESTCOAST Energy of Vancouver is set to become Canada's biggest natural gas
utility with its proposed CDollars 600m (USDollars 487.8m) acquisition of
Ontario-based Union Energy. Westcoast yesterday unveiled an offer of
CDollars 16 cash or one Westcoast share for each Union share.
Union's present controlling shareholder, Union Holdings, has already agreed
to tender its 60 per cent stake in the utility.
The addition of Union will give Westcoast over a million customers, putting
it ahead of Consumers Gas, the Toronto-based utility controlled by British
Gas.
Westcoast said its offer was conditional on at least two-thirds of Union's
shares being tendered. It plans to acquire all remaining Union shares 'as
soon as possible' after expiry of the offer. Regulatory discussions are
expected to be completed within a week.
The planned acquisition marks a major expansion by Westcoast into the
central Canadian market. Its business is presently centred on the west
coast, mainly in the form of a pipeline network which carries gas to British
Columbia and several US states.
Union's customers are centred in south-western Ontario close to the US
border. Mr Michael Phelps, Westcoast chief executive, said yesterday that
one of Union's attractions was its location at the inter-connection of
several Canadian and US gas pipelines.
Westcoast, which is a widely-held company, said that it had arranged a
two-year bridging loan with two Canadian banks.
More permanent financing for the Union acquisition is expected to come from
CDollars 200m in asset sales, mainly by disposing of part of its stake in
wholly-owned oil and gas producer Westcoast Petroleum. Westcoast said it
also planned to issue equity 'as market conditions permit'.

5.1bn in underwriting fees

<TEXT>
WALL Street securities firms earned Dollars 5.1bn in underwriting fees
during the first three quarters of the year as corporations rushed to take
advantage of low US interest rates by issuing record amounts of new debt and
equity.
The explosion in underwriting business means that Wall Street has earned
more in the first nine months of this year than the record Dollars 5bn it
made in the entire 12 months of 1991.
According to preliminary data released yesterday by Securities Data in New
York, US securities houses underwrote a total of Dollars 658bn in domestic
debt and equity from January to the end of September, Dollars 70bn more than
in all of the previous year.
A total of Dollars 236bn of straight corporate debt was sold to the market
in the first three quarters, of which the most striking aspect was the
extraordinary growth in junk bond issues.
More than Dollars 30bn of high-yield debt was sold during the period, and at
some time over the next few weeks the record set during the height of the
junk bond boom, the Dollars 31.9bn issued in 1986, should be shattered.
Companies continued to raise large amounts through stock issues. More than
Dollars 56.5bn has been issued to date, the bulk of it via initial public
offerings (IPOs) of stock.
The IPO market, however, may have peaked. Of the 432 companies that have
gone public this year, only 18 came to the market in September, the lowest
total since March 1991.
Moreover, almost half of the 90 IPOs launched in the past three months were
eventually priced below their initial filing ranges, an indication that
investor-demand is waning.
Issues of mortgage-backed securities, the fastest growing segment of the
debt market, reached Dollars 303bn by the end of September, easily beating
the annual record of Dollars 251bn set last year.
The issuance of asset-backed securities, however, slowed to Dollars 32.6bn.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Abeles hands over helm at TNT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday said Sir Peter Abeles had
resigned as managing director after 25 years at the helm of the company he
co-founded in 1967. He will be replaced by Mr David Mortimer, finance
director.
Mr Fred Millar, chairman, said Sir Peter wanted to concentrate on running
Ansett Transport Industries, the loss-making Australian airline group
co-owned by News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group.
However, officials said Sir Peter, 68, was 'immensely tired' after guiding
the group through a difficult period in which it has reported two
consecutive annual net losses of almost ADollars 200m (USDollars 145m).
Analysts said the surprise announcement would help remove uncertainty about
the group's operational and financial strategy. Mr Mortimer was widely
regarded as Sir Peter's most likely successor.
Sir Peter said six months ago that he planned to resist pressure from the
markets for a change of top management, which began after the group's shares
slipped to a low of 75 cents in January last year.
The shares recovered to nearly ADollars 2 early this year but have fallen to
around ADollars 1 recently as concerns about the group's debts and recovery
prospects have re-emerged.
Mr Millar said Sir Peter would retire from the boards of all TNT's overseas
companies and associates, including GD Net, the express mail joint venture
formed this year with a number of European post offices. He will remain
deputy chairman of TNT and joint chairman and managing director of Ansett.
Mr Millar said Sir Peter had spent 'an immense amount of time and effort'
during the past 18 months attempting to steer TNT through economic recession
in its main markets in Australia, North America and the UK.
Sir Peter played a key role in refocusing the group's activities around
express deliveries and commercial distribution, which required significant
rationalisation and the disposal of non-core activities, including
significant stakes in Foster's Brewing Group and Normandy Poseidon, the
Australian resources group.
Sir Peter was also involved in negotiations on the formation of the GD Net
joint venture, which the group hopes will stem losses incurred by its
European air express operations.
TNT lost a net ADollars 195m in 1991-92, but claimed it was 'in a strong
condition to return to its previous profitability', in spite of the gloomy
international economic outlook.
Sir Peter, who emigrated to Australia from Hungary after the Second World
War, started his first transport business with one truck in 1950, and was
appointed managing director of TNT when the group merged with his company in
1967.
The group grew rapidly during the 1980s, from revenue of ADollars 1.7bn in
1984 to a peak of ADollars 6.6bn on an equity accounted basis last year. It
employs 52,000 staff in 182 countries.
However, the group ran into trouble in 1989 when investors began to worry
about debts incurred to finance expansion. There were also concerns about
the group's entrepreneurial nature and its close relationship with News
Corp, which was then struggling to cope with severe financial problems.
Sir Peter made several dramatic moves into new markets such as express
delivery and logistics.
In his most spectacular deal, Sir Peter bought five years' production of the
British Aerospace 146 Quiet Trader, amounting to 72 aircraft at ADollars 30m
each, effectively cornering the market in the aircraft, regarded as most
suitable for European air express operations.
Sir Peter was also happy to take risks with political and labour relations -
TNT's biggest breakthrough in the UK came when the group's trucks carried Mr
Murdoch's newspapers through the picket lines at News Corp's non-union
printing plant in London.

PACIFIC Enterprises, the US utility group, has completed the sale of all of
its retailing operations, which comprise its Thrifty Corp unit and Big 5
Sporting Goods chain, to investment groups led by Leonard Green &amp; Partners,
AP-DJ reports.
The company said the sale of Thrifty and Big 5 would result in net proceeds,
together with related tax benefits, of about Dollars 275m. Thrifty and Big 5
have combined revenues of about Dollars 3bn.
Leonard Green &amp; Partners is an investment firm based in Los Angeles that
specialises in management buy-outs.
In addition to the sale proceeds, which are to be used to pay down Pacific
Enterprises' debt, the company said it received warrants that will allow it
to participate in future increases in the value of certain of the retailing
operations.
Pacific Enterprise said the sale of the retailing operations was part of a
strategic plan to refocus on its core utility business. The restructuring
calls for the removal from non-utility businesses and refocusing on Southern
California Gas, a natural gas distributor.
Pacific Enterprises said its next priority was to quit the oil and gas
exploration and production business.

<TEXT>
APPLE Computer slashed US prices for its Macintosh personal computers by up
to 36 per cent yesterday in a bid to increase its share of the market and
keep pace with rapidly falling prices in the IBM-compatible segment.
'This year Apple has seen solid gains in market share, unit share and
overall revenue growth while many of our competitors have struggled to
maintain their position,' said Mr Bob Puette, president of Apple's US
division.
'We intend to continue our offensive posture by attracting new customers
through aggressive pricing,' he added.
The sharpest price reductions are on low-end desktop versions of the
Macintosh. Apple lowered the price of its entry level Macintosh Classic II ,
for example from Dollars 1,699 to Dollars 1,079. Prices on other models were
lowered by 11 to 35 per cent. Apple did not, however, reduce prices on its
Powerbook portable computers.
The prices published by Apple are 'suggested retail prices' but in practice
actual 'street' prices are substantially lower. Even before these price cuts
the Macintosh Classic II, for example, was selling at CompUSA, the largest
US computer superstore chain, for under Dollars 1,000.
Industry analysts noted that Apple's price reductions follow those of
several competitors and that Apple needed to act to keep its computer prices
competitive. Apple said recently its strategy of going after increased
market share by lowering prices would probably reduce gross profit margins
to below 40 per cent of net sales in fiscal 1993.
Although yesterday's price cuts apply only in the US, the company generally
keeps international prices to within 10 to 15 per cent above those in the
US. Taking currency fluctuations into account, price reductions in Europe
will probably be smaller than in the US.

<TEXT>
TOTAL, the French oil company, remains cautious on the outlook for the
second half of 1992 in view of continued low demand for oil, declining
refining margins, over-capacity and currency fluctuations, Reuter reports
from Paris.
Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, said he could not predict the performance for
the remainder of year, but he indicated that third-quarter refining margins
showed no improvement from the second quarter and were well below the level
recorded in the same period last year.
Mr Tchuruk said the outlook for the rest of 1992 was 'unpredictable' in view
of the high level of capacity utilisation in Europe and a 5 per cent decline
in demand for oil products.
Other factors accounting for Total's weaker first-half performance -
half-year net profits tumbled 47 per cent to FFr1.9bn (Dollars 395m) - were
the impact of freight losses on trading and the weakness of the dollar.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: AGF falls 24% on weak
international performance
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), one of France's largest
state-controlled insurers, suffered a 24 per cent fall in net profits during
the first half of this year due to the poor performance of its international
insurance interests and a banking activity.
Michel Albert, chairman of AGF, said the decline in interim net profits  -
from FFr1.83bn (Dollars 366m) in the first six months of 1991 to FFr1.4bn in
the same period this year - should be seen in the light of the slowdown in
the French economy and the 'catastrophic' situation in the UK and
Scandinavian insurance sectors.
The profits fall from AGF, the first of the big French insurers to have
published its figures in the current interim results season, comes at a time
when the French insurance industry is under pressure because of the sluggish
state of the domestic market which has depressed demand for insurance
products and also affected the value of the insurers' industrial investments
and property holdings.
AGF managed to increase consolidated sales by 11.5 per cent to FFr30.2bn
during the first half due to strong growth from its interests outside France
and from its reinsurance business.
Life insurance in France saw sales grow by 6.4 per cent to FFr9.5bn but made
static profits of FFr1.05bn. The non-life insurance division saw net profits
slip to FFr127m on sales up 9.9 per cent to FFr8.3bn. AGF has been one of
the leaders among the French insurers in raising non-life tariffs to try to
alleviate the pressure on profitability. Mr Jean Daniel Le Franc, chief
executive, said AGF should benefit from the tariff rises in the second half.
AGF's activities outside France went into the red with a loss of FFr191m,
against net profits of FFr8m, after sales growth of 17.2 per cent to
FFr9.9bn. The group, which recently won its fight to exercise its voting
rights on its stake in AMB of Germany, fared well in Belgium and the Irish
Republic but suffered in Spain and Italy.
The reinsurance business moved back into the black with net profits of
FFr44m from a loss of FFr1m, on sales that rose by 15.7 per cent to
FFr2.5bn. But AGF's banking and financial activities fared badly, moving
from net profits of FFr104m into a loss of FFr58m mainly due to heavy losses
of FFr245m from Banque du Phenix.

in sales

<TEXT>
SME, the Italian public-sector foods group which is a leading privatisation
candidate, raised net profits after minority interests to L41.8bn (Dollars
33.6) in the first half of this year from L33bn in the same period in 1991.
Sales rose by 8.5 per cent to L2,961bn, with an increase of over 12 per cent
in food production and catering. Turnover in food retailing, SME's biggest
single activity, grew by 5.2 per cent to L1,295bn.
The company warned that sales in the early months of the second half had
indicated a downturn in consumption, implying that year-end earnings might
not maintain the growth in the first half. Last year, SME's net profits rose
by 4.8 per cent to L125.6bn.
Turnover in food production had been swollen by acquisitions, notably in
fresh milk, an activity into which SME intends to expand. Catering sales
benefited by the opening of new outlets, while retailing suffered from
greater competition and a slight fall in consumption towards the end of the
first half.
Parmalat, the private-sector milk and dairy products group, raised group
sales by 24.3 per cent to L803.3bn in the first half of this year from
L646.2bn.
Net group profits after minority interests jumped by 47.6 per cent to L31bn
from L21bn in the previous period, while operating profits rose by 18.8 per
cent to L103.1bn from L86.8bn. Net group debt rose to L450bn from L428bn in
the first half of last year, but fell as a proportion of group sales, while
net financial charges fell by L600,000m to L33.1bn.
Parmalat forecast operating earnings for the full year should maintain their
current pace. At the net level, it warned higher interest rates and special
taxes could have an impact currently difficult to foresee. Turnover was
lifted by organic growth and acquisitions, which contributed around L50bn in
new sales in the first half.

FORGES de Clabecq, the Belgian steel group, plans a restructuring exercise,
having failed to reach agreement in its partnership talks with
Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel company, Reuter reports.
Clabecq, which ran up higher losses for last year, said the board approved
the restructuring measures as 'absolutely indispensable' provided they could
be implemented without delay. But the board added it was necessary to make a
further study of certain facts on which the plan was based. Clabecq said its
financial situation would not improve without the measures it planned to
take.
For the year to end-June, Clabecq made a net loss of BFr1.9bn (Dollars 62m),
up from BFr836m in the previous 12 months. The company said the performance
was due to lower productivity in the first-half and weak global steel
prices.
Clabecq said stoppages for modernisation and upgrading at its blast furnace
hit production during the first half of the year. But the situation improved
slightly during the second half with prices rising.

BANCO Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector bank,
yesterday had its second brush with Consob, the country's stock market
watchdog, after continuing speculation about the sale of a significant stake
by one of the bank's biggest shareholders.
The bank has still not formally admitted that a group of four co-operative
banks from the Veneto region, which together form one of the five members of
the shareholder 'pool' which controls the bank, is planning to pull out. The
disposal could upset the balance within the pool, which includes Gemina, the
investment company dominated by Fiat, and Credit Agricole of France. Each of
the five main shareholders has 12 to 13 per cent of the bank and have right
of first refusal should a pool member choose to sell.
Speculation of a sale by the Veneto banks have been circulating for weeks,
but have been consistently denied by Ambroveneto. Meanwhile, the Veneto
banks themselves have refused to comment. However, Mr Giovanni Bazoli,
Ambroveneto's chairman, recently confirmed indirectly he had been made aware
of their intentions. Mr Bazoli is believed to be in contact with other big
shareholders about revising the pool.
Matters are complicated by the high price the Veneto banks are believed to
be seeking for their stake. While their 13.6 per cent holding could be
appealing to several of the current pact members, the cost is a marked
disincentive.
Last week, Mr Antonio Pedone, the chairman of Crediop, a pool member,
indicated his interest in the stake. Crediop was bought last year by
Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, which may see the stake as an
indirect way of widening its branch network.
Credit Agricole could also be a buyer, though an expansion of its stake may
be subject to informal approval from the Bank of Italy.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: First-half fall at Publicis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE slowdown in the European advertising industry has taken a toll on
Publicis, one of France's largest marketing services groups, which yesterday
announced a fall in first-half profits.
Publicis, which owns the French advertising agency of the same name and has
been expanding its interests across Europe, saw net profits fall by 13 per
cent from FFr73m (Dollars 14.6m) in the first six months of 1991 to FFr65m
in the same period this year. Sales rose by 5 per cent from FFr10bn to
FFr10.5bn.
Publicis, in common with other French advertising agencies, has been
affected by the slowdown in media expenditure reflecting the sluggish state
of France's economy.
The French advertising scene has also been clouded by controversy over the
government's review of the media buying system. Mr Michel Sapin, finance
minister, faced criticism from within the industry for his plans to regulate
media buying and later unveiled a revised package.

FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: A case of bad blood at the KIO -
The Kuwait Investment Office has publicly criticised its former managers
about operations mounted in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE war of nods and winks being waged by the new management of the Kuwait
Investment Office (KIO) against operations mounted by their predecessors in
Spain has broken out into the open.
In Madrid last week, the KIO publicly accused its former managers of failing
to provide the Kuwaiti government with proper information on KIO investments
in Spanish industrial companies and of breaking long-standing house
investment regulations.
The accusations have a political edge. Kuwait faces a general election next
week which pits the ruling Al-Sabah family against its merchant class
critics. The KIO's new managers are sponsored by members of the Kuwaiti
elite and the government, who accuse the Al-Sabahs of being wayward
custodians of Kuwait's oil fortunes.
Soon after assuming power in May, the new managers stopped transfers of cash
 -Dollars 1bn was expected this year - to the Spanish companies, saying it
had discovered they were in a far weaker financial condition than previously
believed.
Last week, in a dramatic U-turn, the KIO leadership announced it would,
after all, pump Dollars 1bn in cash into its troubled industrial empire in
Spain and also convert Dollars 1.4bn owed by the KIO holding company in
Spain, Grupo Torras, to KIO itself, into capital.
The capitalisation of this debt was first recommended to the Kuwaiti
authorities last year by the international accounting firm, KPMG Peat
Marwick. The same report, which has been treated with suspicion by the new
managers because it was prepared before they took office in May, also
recommended a Spanish cash injection of Dollars 1bn.
In the three months it has taken the new KIO management to arrive at the
same broad conclusions as Peat Marwick, the Torras empire has been thrown
into turmoil. Spain's biggest chemicals group, Ercros, of which Torras owns
at least 40 per cent, is in receivership, along with a textiles affiliate.
And the property developer Prima is close to collapse, with total debts of
nearly Dollars 700m.
Announcing the Dollars 1bn rescue - the funds will be concentrated on the
papermaker Torras Papel, the foods group Ebro and the Amaya insurance
company, with Prima's debt still to be negotiated - Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, a
Kuwaiti consultant advising the KIO management, openly attacked the previous
managers.
'The money the KIO manages is like a pension fund and should be invested
conservatively. In Spain, our investments have in some cases been
speculative. We have taken management control of industrial operations,
something which has not occurred in other countries.
'The government of Kuwait did not know what it had in Spain,' Mr al-Nouri
declares.
This is contentious. The KIO has owned the big UK property group, St
Martins, since 1974, going far beyond, even then, orthodox pension fund
investment. It also owns Autobar, the UK vending-machine maker, and once
owned the Hays storage and transport group, also in the UK. The Kuwait
Investment Authority (KIA), the KIO's supervisor, owns Georgetown
Industries, a US steel group.
It was only in the second quarter of this year, Mr al-Nouri explained, 'it
became apparent that the health of the Torras was not just lightly
indisposed. . . as the Kuwaiti government had been led to believe.'
Mr Fouad Jaffar, general manager of the KIO until early 1990 and the man
responsible for the Dollars 3bn invested in Spain, is a prime target of the
KIO's accusations. But Mr Jaffar says: 'We were very successful in Spain. We
made huge profits.' These were mostly taken offshore as stakes built up in
Spanish targets.
'Kuwait was fully informed of what was being done in Spain. We sent monthly
and quarterly reports to the Finance Ministry and the KIA. There were
endless briefings. In no way was the Spanish venture a departure. I find the
accusation strange and probably insulting to the Kuwaiti Finance Ministers
who knew what we were doing. Mr al-Nouri obviously doesn't understand the
regulations very well,' Mr Jaffar declares.
According to a Torras spokesman, Mr al-Nouri had meant that the weight of
the KIOs industrial investments in Spain was greater than elsewhere.
However, the bad blood continues to thicken. The KIO's lawyers, Stephenson
Harwood, are understood to be investigating the actions of the former KIO
management in Spain. Also, Mr Salah al-Maousherji, who resigned from the KIO
last year after leading a much publicised and bitter rebellion of 11 Kuwaiti
nationals in the agency's London headquarters against the policies of the
old management during the Gulf war, has returned. He has just been appointed
chairman of Grupo Torras' strategy and policy management committee.
It seems probable that the KIO's Spanish crisis will be comprehensively
dealt with and that worried creditors, especially banks, will be paid off.
But not, perhaps, until the new management has its pound of flesh.
At the same time, it is quite likely that Torras' future in the longer term
will depend on the result of the Kuwaiti election. If the Emir believes that
he has won sufficient support to name a new finance minister, there could
yet be further management changes at the KIO.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Dan-Air hopes name-dropping will reap hard cash: Virgin's
possible relationship with ailing airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing is a key word in the talks between Mr Richard Branson, owner of
Virgin Atlantic Airways, and Mr David James, company doctor at Davies &amp;
Newman Holdings which owns the struggling UK airline, Dan-Air.
Just as the Virgin name is being held out as a way of enhancing Dan-Air's
customer appeal, Mr Branson's is being used to help promote another
refinancing of Davies &amp; Newman.
The bottom line is that only a year after Davies &amp; Newman was recapitalised
with a Pounds 49.3m share issue, it needs to line up another injection of
cash. A press release from the company last weekend made clear that fund
raising was necessary to secure the future of Dan-Air.
Davies &amp; Newman says co-ordination of marketing and operational activities
between Virgin and Dan-Air are an integral part of the fund-raising.
But Mr James will have to answer a question about how much cash Mr Branson
is prepared to put in. One fund manager said yesterday: 'We want to see hard
cash on the table to warrant us going back to beleaguered funds saying we
know this is risky but it is still a reasonable bet because x, y or z
partner is sitting alongside Dan-Air.' The partner's contribution could come
through an equity injection and the taking on of some of Davies &amp; Newman's
debts.
Virgin has so far said it is mainly interested in supplying its brand name
and marketing expertise to match the cash input from institutional
investors. In other words, it would pay mostly in kind, rather than cash,
for a 51 per cent stake in a new company called Virgin European Airways. For
instance, it would supply the Virgin name for no royalty payment. Investors
would stump up hard cash for Davies &amp; Newman's 49 per cent.
Virgin European Airways would be based on Dan-Air's network of scheduled
routes. It would be repackaged to attract more business-class passengers.
'Two extra business-class passengers on each of Dan-Air's flights would add
Pounds 20m a year to turnover,' says Mr Branson.
Such a boost is sorely needed because projections made by Davies &amp; Newman at
the time of the last refinancing have proved too optimistic. The 1992
pre-tax profit projection was for Pounds 20m; a recent broker's forecast was
for a Pounds 7m loss.
Although the group says its overdraft is less than Pounds 3m, this is the
peak post-summer season for cash; funds drain out through the winter. One
fund manager said: 'If you are not in a strong cash position at this time of
year, the position will be awful in six months' time.'
Davies &amp; Newman's bank facility is Pounds 35m, but the company's declared
need to refinance suggests this will not be sufficient to see it through the
winter. It also has a bank covenant linked to the level of profitability in
1992. Although the facility runs until the end of 1993, a possible breach of
this covenant means that the banking agreement needs to be renegotiated.
To solve the long-term financing need, some investors had hoped that Davies
&amp; Newman would either be bought by another airline - British Airways looked
recently but walked away - or find a partner prepared to put in a large
amount of money, which does not seem to be what Mr Branson is offering.
Some shareholders believe the group's strong position at Gatwick and its
handful of Heathrow slots might be attractive to a US or Asian airline
seeking access to Europe, to feed passengers into its long-haul flights.
Yesterday, investors said they were disappointed at the lack of overseas
interest so far, and complained that Davies &amp; Newman had not taken prompter
action to raise cash by other means. One suggested that the group could have
sold aircraft, renegotiated leases or sold its 50 per cent stake in one of
Gatwick's two baggage handlers.
The institutions do not like the idea of coughing up further cash so soon
after last October's rescue, especially as the share price has fallen well
below the 50p rights issue price. In August the price fell to 11p.
Yesterday's suspension price was 23p, at which the group's market value is
Pounds 26m.
Whatever the financial element of Mr Branson's offer, Mr James can argue
that the two airlines fit well together: Virgin specialises in long-haul
routes and Dan-Air operates in Europe.
Some of Dan-Air's problems stem from the fact that it has no in-house tour
operator to soak up its charter aircraft capacity. Virgin has its Virgin
Holidays tour operator subsidiary. Both have bases at London's Gatwick
airport so costs could be cut in reservations, administration, engineering
and baggage handling.
But the reason that the two companies have little overlap is because Mr
Branson's philosophy of how to run a profitable airline has so far avoided
short-haul routes.
Virgin once flew from London to Dublin and to a then-obscure town in the
south of the Netherlands called Maastricht. It stopped those services in
1988 to concentrate on long-haul.
The costs of flying short-haul are high: landing fees must be paid more
often for each kilometre flown and the extra fuel used in more frequent
take-offs and landings adds to overheads.
Some of the world's most successful airlines concentrate on long-haul. Hong
Kong's Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines are among the world's most
profitable carriers while the elaborately constructed 'hub and spoke'
networks in the US domestic market have not prevented airlines there
suffering badly from over-capacity in the recession.
If the Virgin deal falls through, there is still hope that another airline
would be interested in the feeder opportunities offered by Dan-Air's
Gatwick-continental network. Slots at Heathrow are always highly sought
after - BA would be particularly concerned to see these six slots go to its
rival Virgin.
It would strengthen Mr James's bargaining power with Mr Branson if BA
renewed its interest. Anything that could help him squeeze more money out of
a potential partner would also strengthen his chances of persuading
institutional investors to back a new plan - or the rescue of the rescue, as
one put it.

FREIA MARABOU, Scandinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and
snacks group, yesterday accepted a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 870m) takeover from
Kraft General Foods International (KGF), part of the Philip Morris group of
the US.
Hershey Foods of the US, which has an 18.6 per cent shareholding in Freia
Marabou, has had several offers rejected by the Norwegian company. The offer
is believed to be one of the biggest ever made for a Norwegian company by an
international group. It will be made through Jacobs Suchard which is owned
by KGF. The deal is conditional on approval by the Norwegian authorities.
Freia Marabou had sales last year of Dollars 900m and an operating profit of
Dollars 90m.
Norsk Hydro, Freia Marabou's biggest shareholder, plans to take up the
offer. Together with its pension fund, Norsk Hydro owns 44.1 per cent of
Freia Marabou. Jacobs Suchard is putting up NKr450 a share for each of Freia
Marabou's A and B shares. Trading in the company's shares was suspended
yesterday on the Oslo and Stockholm bourses.
Hershey Foods purchased its stake in Freia Marabou at the end of April for
NKr1.16bn (Pounds 105m). Yesterday Hershey said it had made an informal
offer of more than NKr400 a share for Norsk Hydro's Freia stake.
The deal when accepted will yield Norsk Hydro a profit before tax of around
NKr2.4bn and Norsk Hydro's pension fund will receive NKr500m.
Ms Natalie Bailey, a Hershey spokeswoman, said reports that the company was
unwilling to sell its stake in Freia Marabou were premature. 'As I
understand it, once the Kraft offer is finalised and extended to all
shareholders, we could tender our shares or remain a shareholder.'
The deal is relatively small for Philip Morris, whose second quarter
revenues stood at Dollars 15.2bn, with the food division contributing
Dollars 7.33bn. Mr John Maxwell, managing director at Wheat First
Securities, the US stockbroker, said: 'As far as Kraft is concerned . . .
this type of acquisition has been their strategy for some years now.'
On Wall Street, shares in Hershey hit a 52-week high of Dollars 45 1/2, up
Dollars 1 1/8, on news of the Philip Morris bid.

FT  29 SEP 92 / French approve use of Imigran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's biggest drugs group, yesterday received authorisation for
Imigran, its new migraine treatment, to be used in France.
The authorisation follows tense negotiations between Glaxo and French
ministries about the safety, effectiveness and cost of the drug. Analysts
believe the medicine, which had worldwide sales of Pounds 43m last year,
could become a 'block-buster' with sales of more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds
578m) a year.
The French ministry of social affairs had previously proved unwilling to
agree the prices for Imigran required by Glaxo. The company has been anxious
to secure a common price for Imigran throughout Europe, to avoid parallel
importing by wholesalers from low-price countries to high-price markets.
The price agreed is understood to be FFr390 (Pounds 44.72) for a box of two
injections. That compares with Pounds 41 for the same product in the UK.
Glaxo refused to confirm the price, but said it was very pleased with the
progress during price discussions. The French government has traditionally
set low pharmaceuticals prices to compensate for the large number of
prescriptions issued there.
The ministry of social affairs has agreed an accord with Glaxo to control
state expenditure on Imigran. Patients' bills for the drug are to be
reimbursed by the state at 70 per cent.
The aim of the accord is to ensure those who need the drug receive it, but
that there is no explosion in the drug's use that might worsen the social
security deficit. Some analysts have predicted the potential French market
at more than FFr1bn. France is the world's fifth largest market for
pharmaceuticals.
The licence is for the injectable rather than oral version of Imigran. The
product, said the ministry of health, was not a miracle drug, but was
superior to existing therapies. It was to be used when other treatments had
failed.
The drug will be launched in January, when Glaxo will conduct a study of the
first 10,000 French patients using Imigran.
Earlier discussions between Glaxo and the government over Imigran had been
difficult. In April, Glaxo's president of French operations left the company
after negotiations collapsed.

FT  29 SEP 92 / PowerGen prepares step into German electricity supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the UK privatised generator, is preparing a bid to buy part of
east Germany's lignite mining industry, with a view to generating power
there.
The move would be PowerGen's first step into the German electricity supply
industry.
The generator has signed a letter of intent with NRG Energy company, a
division of Northern States Power of the US, to take over the Mitteldeutsche
Braunkohle company (Mibrag) - one of two lignite producers being offered for
sale by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatisation in eastern
Germany.
'We are still at an early stage,' PowerGen said, but added that it expected
any bid to be made 'fairly soon'.
The Treuhand has said it hopes to sell east Germany's huge lignite industry,
which employs 65,000 people, by the middle of next year.
PowerGen and NRG are understood to be looking at acquiring at least part of
Mibrag's open-cast mines in the Leipzig area, with a view to constructing a
two-block power station at Lippendorf with a capacity of 1,600 MW.
Although the size of the bid is undisclosed, German press reports have
referred to likely investment of DM5bn (Pounds 1.98bn) in the power plant.
Lignite, or brown coal, has a high sulphur content requiring costly
pollution control equipment to be fitted to plants which burn it.
PowerGen/NRG is expected to face competition in its bid for Mibrag from a
consortium of German energy companies RWE, Bayernwerk and Preussenelektra.
The German consortium has already lodged a letter of intent to buy Laufitzer
Braunkohle, the other lignite producer being sold by the Treuhand.
German electricity suppliers had initially ignored Mibrag because of its
poor-quality coal. But a study carried out for PowerGen's partner NRG
concluded that at least two of Mibrag's open-cast mines could be competitive
even taking into account the high cost of desulphurisation of the brown
coal.
A successful bid by PowerGen for Mibrag would strengthen the presence of
privatised UK energy companies in eastern Germany. British Coal, the former
monopoly supplier, already has stakes in gas distribution companies in
Leipzig and Halle, and in a regional gas transportation company.

FT  29 SEP 92 / ICI shares fall 63p after downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' shares fell 63p yesterday to 1145p following a
profits downgrading by Hoare Govett, one of the company's brokers. The
decline contributed to a 41 point fall in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed
at 2,560.
Hoare Govett downgraded the stock from a 'hold' to 'overvalued'. It is
unusual for analysts to advise investors to sell shares in companies for
which they are brokers.
Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at Hoare Govett, said ICI's third quarter
had been poor and there was limited room for improvement next year. He had
downgraded ICI's full-year profits for 1992 from Pounds 780m to Pounds 620m
because of continuing poor demand. He had expected ICI to make Pounds 1bn in
1993, but now forecast Pounds 843m.
These downgrades were in spite of apparently favourable currency movements,
said Mr Evans. ICI was dollar neutral, because although earnings from US
operations were improved from a higher dollar, its dollar expenses were
considerable, particularly for the raw materials of naphtha and oil. A fall
in British interest rates had little impact on ICI because much of its
turnover was outside the UK.
ICI had said demand was slow in July and very weak in August, said Mr Evans.
Anecdotal evidence from September suggested little improvement.
ICI had been affected by poor demand for its petrochemicals businesses,
particularly polypropylene and PVC. Volume and prices had both fallen. ICI
uses BASF's polypropylene technology, and the German group said recently it
was looking at acquiring ICI's polypropylene businesses.
In the group's life-sciences areas, the pharmaceuticals business was
suffering competition to Tenormin, its best-selling heart drug whose US
patents expired last year. Demand for agrochemicals tended to be weak in the
second half of the year, but would be in loss for the third quarter, said Mr
Evans. Speciality chemicals were also under pressure, he added.
He forecast that third-quarter pre-tax profits would be only Pounds 100m,
compared with Pounds 196m last year for the same period. The downgrading
follows a similar note by Credit Suisse last week, according to ICI.
However, this is the first recent downgrade by one of its own brokers. ICI's
third - quarter results are due on October 29.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Louise' in Geneva - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Louise, the teenage dressmaker from Montmartre who defies her parents to
follow her lover into the Paris of the 1900s, lost the power of pulling in
the public? I never thought, in the well-behaved Grand Theatre at Geneva, of
all places, to see so many people fail to return after the interval or steal
quickly out during the performance. Stranger still, many of them were of the
age when one would expect to enjoy this well-tried tear-jerker, offering as
it does operatic slumming on a luxurious scale. Have the attitudes of
Louise's parents and their daughter's once-scandalous reactions become
incredible? Has the pendulum swing to the other extreme and stuck there?
It can hardly have been the staging and performance, which with a few
reservations were on the serious, intelligent level one expects in this
theatre. Gustave Charpentier's 'musical novel' has shown a surprising
capacity to split opinions through succeeding generations. But, though I
remember seeing the late Peter Heyworth white with barely suppressed rage
during the ENO production some years back, such a general show of
thumbs-down, as one saw the other evening in Geneva, came as a shock.
Christian Aeby's production is set in a striking decor by a young French
designer new to opera, Elsa Pavanel. A three-sided metal gallery is
suspended behind and above the low, brown walls enclosing the parents'
depressing apartment. Louise's writer friend Julien has a vantage point from
which his serenades can be seen as well as heard. In the scene on the Butte,
a central staircase leads up to the platform. On it, halfway to heaven
against a starry background, Louise sings 'Depuis le jour' and her
passionate duet with Julien. The revellers, bringing lanterns, flags and
streamers in bright primary colours, swarm over gallery and stairs for the
crowning of Louise as their Muse. The effect, though it might as well be
Peking as Paris, adroitly freshens a potentially embarrassing episode. Down
the staircase, a few minutes later, advances the accusing figure of the
mother.
At the end of the opera, when Louise runs away for the second time, the
apartment walls vanish, carnival figures dance in silhouette on one platform
and there is a glimpse of Julien already chasing another bit of skirt. The
last (silent) word is mimed by the insufferable Noctambulist who has flitted
on and off during the previous act. Charpentier, his own librettist, chose a
simpler, less melodramatic, more pathetic ending.
The American soprano Mary Mills was making her European debut as Louise. A
pretty, pouting, puppy-face with a promising voice of considerable power
when required, Miss Mills has still to learn how to project the short,
conversational phrases which for this role are just as important as the long
lines. The producer wisely refrained from making Julien anything more than a
cheerful proletarian playboy. Gregory Kunde dealt ringingly with his opening
solo and with the duet. Unfortunately, having some of the best music doesn't
make Julien a believable person.
Jean-Philippe Courtis is really too distinguished in manner for the father,
but he is a fine, cultivated singer. His physical portrayal of the man's
illness in the last scene was exaggerated. The mother was Maureen Forrester,
a senior artist of great experience who coloured her phrases with subtle
indications of the woman's dreary past and future, and her bitter jealousy
not only of Louise's chance of happiness but of her husband's slightly
ambiguous love for the girl.
The excellent chorus singing almost made up for the under-singing,
under-playing and under-lighting of the minor roles in the tedious scene of
the dawn street cries. Near-inaudibility here was not the fault of the
conductor, Armin Jourdan, who drew velvety but discreetly balanced playing
from the Suisse Romande Orchestra - one can see why Mahler enjoyed
conducting this score. Jordan enjoyed himself so much that the pace became
soporific at those sticky moments when Charpentier shows that, whatever else
he learned from his teacher Massenet, it wasn't knowing when to move the
drama on.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: Op Art thirty years on - William Packer hails Bridget
Riley's latest work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bridget Riley woke up one morning, nearly 30 years ago, to find herself
famous. There she was, the leading exponent of what we still call
'hard-edge' painting or 'post-painterly abstraction', which, by its
insistent linear and rhythmical repetition teased the retina into an active,
even neurotic response. But we are all too easily made the prisoners of our
labels, and Op Art, travestied to banality in the 1960s, has dogged Miss
Riley's reputation ever since.
The point, however, is not that she is not an op artist, in the sense that
she is still centrally concerned in her work with the retinal frisson that
may be stimulated by close and particular combinations of tone and colour,
but only that Op Art itself still stands in its 1960s character, the
trivial, dated, ephemeral concern of an art-historical moment. That moment
passed, but she went on working, slowly and consistently over the years,
developing and extending her formal ideas and the scope of their expression.
She exhibited regularly through the 1970s and '80s with the Rowan Gallery,
which is now sadly closed and which gave notable support to current British
abstraction through difficult times. But the last gallery show was five
years ago, and since the 1980s she has had little group shows or major tours
other than a handful of retrospective and study exercises. As she moved into
her own 60s, Miss Riley found herself in the position, unusual for her but
common enough, of having a substantial body of recent work that few had
seen.
This exhibition, which comes to the Hayward from Germany, where it was shown
at Nurnberg and Bottrop, is therefore both timely and useful. In all we have
heard, these 10 years past - of conceptualism, post-modernism and the
revival of figuration - the tacit assumption has been that abstraction, if
not yet dead exactly, has become academic and irrelevant. It was not so, and
will never be true so long as serious artists stick seriously to what they
believe they should do.
This survey of the work of the past 10 years marks the transition from the
simple abutment of narrow vertical stripes across the canvas, to an imagery
more obviously active and complex. The vertical stripes remain, but are
broader, and are no longer of a single colour but disrupted by a system of
diagonal multi-coloured stripes. It is in the nature of the diagonal to
inform the composition with speed and movement, counter and complement to
the essential stability of the vertical. The device that here fuses the two
elements together is the simple modular parallelogram, in an infinite number
of combinations, actual or implied.
To put it so baldly is perhaps to make it sound little more than an arid
technical exercise or trick, but the reality is so much more than that. The
viewer is drawn in to a complexity of visual choice, contradiction and
reconsideration - now see it this way, now that. For, flat as these
paintings are, their essential subjects are space and light, and the play of
the one in informing the other.
Should we choose to see them so, the vertical columns move forward optically
a little, or back as the case may be, in relation to each other and the
shafts of light stream through the shallow space between them, as through
the trees of a forest or the pillars of a church. Or again we might choose
the diagonal emphasis, and the space opens out as in a schematic, isometric
perspective, seen from above, tilting towards us. It is no landscape in any
direct sense at all, and yet the forms begin to move before and behind each
other, and the eye is drawn in to an ever shifting yet coherent space.
And over all there is the colour, moving across the canvas in its several
elements like clouds or shadows, the emphasis given now to the more airy
colours, the blues and greens, now to the weightier, denser pinks, browns,
blacks. From such differences each composition gains its character, yet a
character not of obvious and direct disposition, one mass of colour here,
another there, but rather of mutual infiltration, balance and adjustment. As
in music, tone, pitch, chromatic variation, the weight and presence of the
piece overall, are a matter of single notes.
Admirable and beautiful as this exhibition is, especially so in the more
natural light of the Hayward's upper floor, I have one practical criticism
to make, and one suggestion to offer the visitor. For all the apparent and
disarming simplicity of imagery, these are dense and complex works which
work slowly on the eye and mind, and reveal their true qualities and
mysteries only after particular and close attention. As it is presented
here, it requires of the visitor more time perhaps than it is reasonable to
expect. Culled by about a quarter, or a third perhaps, it would be no less
comprehensive and impressive a demonstration, and certainly less daunting a
commitment.
The pairing of this exhibition with The Art of Mexico downstairs is not at
all so arbitrary and unsympathetic as one might think, but each requires so
different an order of concentration and attention that a considerable mental
adjustment is needed between the two, to do either exhibition justice. The
shift is from the figurative, symbolic and anecdotal to the purely visual
and abstract. It is usually a good idea to move from the general to the
particular, and so, should both shows be the object of a single visit, my
advice would be to see the Bridget Riley first.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Arts: Babi Yar &amp; Busqueda - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Steve Martland and James MacMillan (both b. 1959) are two of the most
prominent and assertive young voices of British music. On two successive
evenings, last weekend, each was the figurehead composer to launch two
important and exciting new musical initiatives at the Festival Hall. Such
juxtapositions, no doubt coincidental, encourage the making of too-easy
critical comparisons, convenient but unnatural linkages; nevertheless, there
are similarities in the use of these two compositional voices which seem
both elating and disturbing.
Both insist on the social dimension of their music, on its popular-culture
roots, on their abhorrence of the ivory-tower composer remote from 'real
life'. These two London premieres made all those points. Martland's Babi
Yar, given on Sunday by the BBC Symphony under Andrew Davis (and also
broadcast on Radio 3), was first heard - amid strong controversy - in
Liverpool in 1985. It is a 35-minute assault on polite audience
sensibilities, by a composer whose enrage image is carefully cultivated (by,
for instance, his appearance on the Festival Hall platform in braces and
bovver-boots), and whose stated belief is that 'one of the functions of art
is confronting reality. Maybe that's why this music is often so aggressive -
and loud]'
Indeed. The idiom builds hard-piled sonorities (including synthesizer and
vast batteries of brass and percussion) into chordal battering-rams. After a
long-sustained start their attack proves increasingly violent, as their
pounding impact is developed into a kind of machine-process that grinds on
unrelentingly. (Although the orchestra is divided into three ensembles, the
effect for much of the way is essentially of unison.) Eventually, the
machine winds down, and in its aftermath four horn players - who take up
stations ever further from the orchestral platform - regularly sound out
fanfares possessed of an 'individual-voice' (though hardly lyrical)
character.
Babi Yar, Martland's first (and so far only) composition for large
orchestra, has no artistic relationship with either the famous Yevtushenko
poem or its symphony-setting by Shostakovich. The title is used as 'metaphor
for . . . infamy'; and the music is intended as a disquisition on human
iniquity and violence with the affirmation of a 'fragile hope' as its
epilogue. The rebarbative denseness and monotony of the scoring were
admitted by Martland (in a disarming pre-performance podium conversation
with Nicholas Kenyon, Radio Three chief); he has learned to restrain his
forces since then.
The strongest assets of the work are a large-scale vision, starkly dramatic,
and a deep-rooted musicality which enables so much of it to be established
in purely musical terms. The general weaknesses - repetitiveness, monotony -
seem to result from Martland's belief that impassioned vociferation,
emotional slamming-home of points, can legitimately take the place of
reasoned argument.
A similar general criticism may perhaps be permitted of MacMillan's
music-theatre piece Busqueda (1988), given the previous evening by 17
players from the Philharmonia under the composer himself. Using a speaker
(Diana Quick), an octet of supporting actors and a trio of female singers,
he laces together poems written by the mothers of the Argentinian
'disappeared ones' and quotations from the Latin Mass ordinary; the text is
layered above a continuous musical form drawing on various 'popular' sources
(including Scottish folk) subjected to various kinds of transformation.
MacMillan has a native gift for musical drama. The most affecting parts of
Busqueda - apart, that is, from the poems themselves, heart-rendingly direct
in their impact - are the quietly and beautifully tender interweavings
between small groups of instrumental and human voices. But the louder and
more forceful dramatic gestures seem not the less obvious for being
heartfelt: the climax of the piece combines ugly amplified group shouting
and triple-fortissimo in the manner of poster art.
Babi Yar was the first item in a concert (also including Britten's Four Sea
Interludes and Vaughan Williams's Fourth Symphony) that was itself first in
the BBC Symphony's new 'British Line' series. The tickets are single-price
(low), the seats unreserved, and the presentation betokens a new
user-friendly attitude that may well succeed in boosting audience numbers
for the BBC Symphony's South Bank concerts. Busqueda formed an early-evening
overture to the Philharmonia's Dream of Gerontius (movingly conducted by
Yevgeny Svetlanov, and superbly played and sung); it also formed the first
of the orchestra's excellent new 'Music of Today' series, of which MacMillan
is artistic director.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Making a mark in
currencies / A look at how companies can reduce the risks of foreign
exchange fluctuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The foreign exchange dealers have taken their profits; the politicians
appear to have survived the debacle; but what are businesses to make of the
ruins of Britain's exchange rate policy?
British Technology Group, the technology transfer agency which makes 80 per
cent of its Pounds 25m-plus revenues abroad, says it now takes much greater
care to hedge any surpluses or deficits which emerge in cash flows within
Europe.
'While the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was in force, currencies
varied within a very narrow band so it didn't make much sense to 'fix' our
surpluses,' says Rusi Kathoke, finance director.
Designers Guild, which makes 60 per cent of its Pounds 15m furniture,
fabrics and wallpapers sales outside the UK, says it used the relative
stability of the ERM to shift its borrowings to the currencies of countries
with low interest rates.
'We could keep some of our liabilities in D-Marks because the interest rate
was lower and there was little currency risk,' says Mark Naughton-Rumbo,
financial controller. 'Now we can't do that. We have squared our positions
off and if we have to borrow more in a high-interest currency, we just have
to bear it.'
In the short term, the suspension of Britain's membership of the ERM and
sterling's fall may require companies to adjust their price lists. But in
the longer term, the principles of sound foreign exchange management will
still apply.
The difficulty is in getting businessmen and women to understand the
fundamentals of a subject which many regard as arcane. 'People often don't
know what questions to ask,' says Michael Pearce, founder of a
Hertfordshire-based treasury consultancy.*
Business owners often only take into account their currency exposure on a
particular sale to a foreign customer. Will they get as many D-Marks when
the customer pays in three months time as they would today? But the
transaction risk is only one of three areas where a business can be exposed.
A company may also face translation exposure if it has assets or liabilities
 -a factory overseas, the balance sheet of a foreign subsidiary - priced in
a foreign currency which it must reflect on its sterling balance sheet.
The third and least obvious risk is economic exposure. This may affect a
company which does no foreign business just as much as one which does, says
Pearce. If its competitors buy supplies from overseas and sterling
strengthens, then the competition will enjoy a cost advantage selling into
the UK. The creation of the single European market will increase the
economic exposure of many businesses.
Because companies face a combination of foreign currency exposures, they
need to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with them, advises Pearce.
British Technology Group makes handling its foreign currency exposure a key
part of its cash flow management, explains Kathoke. The company took the
decision to reduce its exposure to high UK interest rates and took out
long-term dollar and yen-denominated loans, matched to its expectations of
revenue flows from these two currency areas.
'We don't have to hedge because our debt is matched by the cash flows we
expect over time,' says Kathoke. 'We don't look at our foreign exchange
exposure in isolation.'
Once a company has identified its foreign exchange exposures, it must then
decide whether it needs to hedge them. If a company's sales, profits and
competitive position will be unaffected by changes in the value of its home
currency, then it need do nothing. But very few companies are so protected.
An alternative is to hedge everything but this ignores the cost and the
possibility that some hedges can put a company at a competitive
disadvantage. A company which bought foreign currency forward to hedge the
value of, say, wine shipments from France would be locking itself into a
particular rate and a particular cost structure.
If sterling strengthened against the franc and the company's competitors had
not hedged the value of their purchases, they would be able to buy the wine
much more cheaply. 'The importance of the competitive environment can often
get overlooked when foreign exchange policy is being developed,' warns Derek
Ross, partner in charge of treasury management at accountants Touche Ross.
The third, and most commonly chosen, option is to hedge selectively. All of
the companies contacted for this article did this and said they adopted a
defensive approach to hedging. However, companies are sometimes tempted to
speculate. Since this implies that the company believes it has a better
insight into the future value of a currency than the dealers and economists
whose job it is to take a view of the markets, it is better avoided.
Once a company concludes that it needs to hedge its exposure to currency
fluctuations, it will need to decide on which method or methods to use:
A natural hedge may be available if assets and liabilities in the same
currency can be matched. British Technology Group aims for a long-term match
of overseas loans with revenue flows, while Designers Guild sets purchases
of raw materials in foreign countries against sales to those countries.
'Fifty per cent of our cash flow has a natural cover,' says Naughton-Rumbo.
The advantage of natural hedges is they can be 'fail-safe' and once in place
are often simpler to manage.
Forward contracts are a commonly used method of 'fixing' an exchange rate
until delivery and payment are made months or even two or more years later.
Thermomax, a Bangor, Co. Down-based manufacturer of solar heating equipment,
frequently uses three or six months forward contracts to fix the value of
foreign shipments. 'We are happy to lock ourselves in at an acceptable
price,' says Ralph Keir, finance director of the 120-employee company.
A drawback of such contracts is that they require the company to deliver or
take delivery of the currency involved when the contract matures,
irrespective of whether the delivery has gone ahead and even if the company
has to buy in the currency at a less favourable rate.
Currency swaps are similar, though usually cover longer periods, and are
usually only available in larger amounts. A company will swap its debts
through a bank with another company. The swap agreement sets a rate at which
the currencies will be exchanged at a date in the future and until that
time, each company pays the interest on the other's currency debt. The aim
is to give the two parties a debt in their desired currency.
Option forward contracts are similar to a standard forward contract but,
rather than setting a single settlement date, provide a range of dates. This
can be useful for the company which does not know when a bill will be
settled but such contracts are very expensive because the bank will price it
at the worst point in the range of dates covered. It is usually better to
take a standard forward contract and, after it matures, put the funds on
deposit until they are needed, advises Ross. Option forwards must not be
confused with:
Currency options. These confer the right but (unlike forwards) not the
obligation to buy or sell the agreed amount of currency up to or on a set
date in the future. If a deal falls through or currencies do not move
adversely, then the company buying the option can simply let it lapse.
Unlike a forward contract, where the 'price' is concealed in the rate
offered, the cost of an option is a premium. The level of the premium
depends on how close the exercise rate is to the prevailing exchange rate
and the time to maturity.
The workings of the foreign exchange markets are often confusing to the
outsider. But there are techniques to reduce a business's currency exposure.
Doing nothing is certainly not a risk-free option.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Middle-size companies go
abroad for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-sized companies have more extensive international operations than is
frequently recognised, according to a survey* by accountants Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, writes Charles Batchelor.
Forty-nine per cent of middle market companies - typically with sales of up
to Dollars 100m (Pounds 58.4m) and most without a stock market listing - had
established manufacturing operations abroad while 86 per cent sold abroad.
The most common reason for going international was to exploit growth
opportunities (cited by 84 per cent), followed by a desire to reduce
dependence on the home market (39 per cent), customer demand (34 per cent)
and an attempt to reduce costs (24 per cent).
'It is interesting that the cost factor is relatively unimportant compared
to the more positive market-oriented factors,' the survey noted, though in
high-wage countries such as Germany and in Scandinavia, cost was a more
important reason.
The common reasons for not establishing foreign operations were that the
risks were too high and likely profits too low (23 per cent), or that
companies could not find a suitable business partner (16 per cent).
Almost 400 companies 'below the level of multinational' in 20 countries were
questioned.

UK residents who do not receive any other government assistance awards can
claim a discount on training towards National Vocational Qualifications and

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (6): Rewards for ingenuity -
The tricky process of obtaining start-up cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID BLAYLOCK is one of the lucky ones. From an uncertain start with a
relatively unknown franchisor providing courier services nine years ago, he
has built a growing operation which ranges across Saffron Walden and
Colchester.
But - in common with many franchisees - obtaining finance was not easy.
Blaylock, managing director and owner of the Interlink franchises for the
two regions, had to resort to unusual sources to help him build up his
business.
'I used my family and not bank support,' he says - blood ties allowed him to
borrow Pounds 3,000. Since that time, he has been able to use Lombard North
Central, the credit finance and leasing subsidiary of National Westminster
Bank, to fund the purchase of a number of delivery vans. He has also
obtained support via the bank through the government's small firms' loan
guarantee scheme.
Mr Ian Harvey of Stoy Hayward's franchising consultancy says the main source
of finance for franchisees remains the clearing banks - particularly those
which have a reputation for work with small businesses. For franchisors,
venture capital and equity routes may also be available.
Mr Tony Ellingham, franchise manager for NatWest, stresses that three
elements remain essential for any potential borrower: a business plan, an
operating budget and a cashflow forecast.
'No matter how big or small you are, we still expect you to go through the
discipline of putting these statements together,' he says. 'We expect
customers to have prepared them in advance of seeing us. It saves a lot of
time.'
For businesses interested in becoming franchisors, he recommends using a
franchise consultant, preferably affiliated to the British Franchise
Association, to help carry out a feasibility study. Both franchisee and
franchisor will also need an accountant to help develop projections. A
typical outlet might typically expect a return on investment within two to
five years.
He says that one frequent obstacle for businesses trying to raise finance is
that the individuals applying do not have sufficient security to back their
loans. That is where the small firms' loan guarantee scheme, which is backed
by the Department of Employment, can help.
It is available in addition to - rather than in competition with - normal
commercial finance, and offers the lender guarantees for 70 per cent of the
total loan in return for a 2.5 per cent premium to be paid by the borrower
on the sum guaranteed.
Eligible businesses must be small, with fewer than 200 employees and limits
on turnover. Certain activities are not covered, such as agriculture,
betting, banking, tied pubs and bars and estate and travel agents. All
applicants must submit a thorough business plan and have a clear idea of how
much finance they need and to what purpose it will be put.
Ellingham remains optimistic about the future for the financing of
franchises. 'More and more people are considering franchises, and we are
certainly still committed to them,' he says.
David Blaylock goes one step further back, and stresses that the best
preparation for financing a franchise comes in the selection of the
franchise itself in the first place.
'There are a lot of franchises on the market at the moment,' he says. 'You
should check them out thoroughly and speak to the people involved.'
His start-up problems illustrate the fact that it is never easy to obtain
finance. Yet he had much in his favour. He had held a bank account with
National Westminster since before he was 16. He ran a newsagents shop before
decided to apply for a franchise. He also now plays football with his local
bank manager.
For Jenny Allen, owner of a Cullen's franchise in London, it was trickier
still. 'Obtaining finance?' she says. 'It was incredibly difficult. I think
frankly the fact that I was 27, single, a woman and with no equity, seeing a
40-year old bank manager didn't help.'
She was managing a Cullens shop three years ago when she decided to buy the
franchise. But the turnover was too large for her to be eligible for the
business development loan.
But there is an optimistic end to the story. She was helped by a sympathetic
policy of support from Cullens itself. She then managed to obtain bank
support and go ahead with a five-year loan. She has paid it off within 18
months.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (4): Resilient in a recession
 -The Americans who have had a good year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DIFFICULT year for US businesses, one of the few bright spots has been
the franchise industry.
During a difficult period of post-recession stagnation, the franchise
industry displayed one of its greatest strengths - resilience in tough
times.
According to the International Franchise Association, a Washington-based
industry body, franchise sales exceeded the growth of the US economy by more
than 500 per cent in 1991, rising 6.1 per cent from Dollars 713.8bn in 1990
to Dollars 757.8bn last year, in spite of the near stagnation in the wider
economy. Today, 542,000 franchises employ more than 7m people in more than
60 different industries.
The outlook remains bright, in spite of modest expectations of growth in the
economy as a whole. A study by Arthur Andersen published this month forecast
that the number of franchises will grow by 15 per cent in 1992. Total sales
are expected to rise by a similar amount to Dollars 812bn, to account for
more than 35 per cent of all US retail sales.
Ironically, the franchising industry is drawing its strength from the very
economic weakness that is troubling the rest of the country. Experience
shows that franchising is a counter-cyclical business. During recessions
unemployment rises, and large numbers of newly unemployed workers, including
many with management experience, are forced to look for new work. In the
present recession, unemployment in the US has risen to its highest levels
for eight years.
Increasing numbers of the newly jobless, particularly those disaffected by
life as a regular employee in a large company, have turned to franchises as
the best hope of gainful, and relatively secure employment, and become
franchisees. For them, a franchise business offers a large degree of
independence and potential for profit, a business backed by the financial,
marketing and psychological support of the group that owns the franchise -
the franchisor.
Franchising has done especially well out of this latest economic slump
because the rise in unemployment has been unusually marked among
well-educated managers in white-collar, service industries. These are just
the sort of people that traditionally supply fresh blood for franchises,
partly because they take substantial sums in redundancy payments from their
jobs, money that can be invested in franchises.
Furthermore, many franchising operations cover certain businesses that
profit most from providing consumers with quality goods and services at
relatively inexpensive prices - which is exactly what people look for when
belt-tightening is the economic priority in households.
Other factors help franchises prosper in difficult economic times.
Co-ordinated marketing and advertising programmes provided by national
groups help franchises respond quickly to changes in consumer habits,
especially regarding growth in the demand for 'value' goods and services.
Demographic trends are also in franchises' favour: as more women work,
franchises can fill the gap by taking on tasks normally done at home.
Mr Leonard Swartz, a former managing director of Arthur Andersen's franchise
consulting services division, says: 'Corporate workforce reductions, shifts
in human and financial resources, changing consumer needs, and the rising
appeal of entrepreneurship are fuelling franchise growth in the US.'
Despite the rosy outlook for franchises, there are some clouds on the
horizon. Tensions between some franchisors and franchisees over the terms of
contracts have been building, particularly between older, more experienced
franchisees operating multiple franchises in a mature market.
Growing numbers of these 'multi-unit' franchisees, many of whom have become
millionaires from decades of success, are concerned about transferring the
ownership of their franchises to family members and about the renewal of
long-term contracts.
Mr John Reynolds of the International Franchise Association in Washington DC
explains: 'Some of these multi-user franchisees are in a tug-of-war with
franchisors over what their relationship is going to be like over the next
10 to 20 years. They want a deal for the next 10 or 20 years that is at
least the same as, or preferably better than, the one they signed 20 years
ago.'
It is not just the more experienced franchisees that are getting involved in
disputes. Younger ones are just as unhappy with some current contracts,
which they claim limit their rights and opportunities for personal financial
success, while others claim to have been defrauded by franchisors but,
because of their contracts, cannot take up their grievances in the courts.
On the other side of the fence, however, franchisors want to maintain
control over the franchise system, and ensure any contracts they sign will
keep them competitive in the marketplace. The result has been a growing
number of contract battles, some of which are resolved privately, some of
which go to arbitration, and some of which go to court.
To no-one's surprise, government legislators have stepped into this battle,
eager to provide better protection for 'David' franchisees against 'Goliath'
franchisors.
At a state level, the most dramatic change has been in Iowa, where
legislation was passed in mid-July that John Reynolds of the IFA describes
as a 'radical departure' from the general body of laws and regulations
regarding franchise contracts. 'Under the Iowa law, in the contractual
relationship the franchisee gets more leverage at the expense of the
franchisor's control over the organisation,' says Reynolds.
The Iowa statute bars termination of franchisee contracts without advance
notice, requires franchisors to accept sales of franchises to relatives and
qualified buyers in some circumstances, and voids all contracts between
parties that call for legal disputes to be resolved outside Iowa.
Franchisors were quick to respond. MacDonald's and Holiday Inn, two of the
country's biggest franchise groups, have filed lawsuits in Iowa to challenge
the constitutionality of the law's provision regarding pre-existing
contracts, and industry observers believe the suits have a fair chance of
success.
Franchisors, however, face a fight not just in Iowa. Many states are
currently considering some form of new legislation for franchises, and at
least five are reported to be considered following Iowa's radical route.
At the Federal level, Congressman John LaFalce, chairman of the House Small
Business Committee, has filed two pieces of legislation that travel much the
same legislative path as Iowa's.
To counter the new regulations, franchisors have been lobbying at the local
and national level, arguing that the new laws could discourage franchisors
from creating new franchises because the strict legislation make expansion
economically unviable.
Despite the rash of contract disputes and threats of tougher legislation,
industry observers do not expect the problem to prove a major hindrance on
franchise growth in the US. John Reynolds of the IFA is confident about the
future: 'Franchisors and franchisees will eventually realise that there is
more to be gained by avoiding costly contract disputes, legislative battles
and litigation, because both sides lose when that happens.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (3): Where image counts most -
France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE is not best known as a nation of small shopkeepers, but the
traditional spread of local retailers is one of the main reasons why it
became the largest franchising market in Europe and the second largest in
the world.
The number of operators may have slipped in the past two years to 500
franchisors at the beginning of 1992 from 600 in 1990, and to 30,000
franchisees from 33,000, but this is partly because the definition of the
sector has been tightened up here.
Despite the economic slowdown, annual turnover rose over the same period to
FFr145bn from FFr143bn and still represents about half of such sales
throughout Europe.
Even so, franchising is suffering from the slowdown like the rest of the
economy and is unlikely to repeat for a while the brisk expansion of 15 per
cent a year reported among franchisors until 1988.
Meanwhile, the mix of sectors has shifted. Until a couple of years ago,
property and non-specialised food retailing were the two big growth areas.
But property is suffering from the economic downturn, and small
non-specialist food outlets have been squeezed by supermarket groups.
Nonetheless, the gap is closing between retailing and services. The split
now stands at about 55/45 per cent, having narrowed from 60/40 in 1990.
Fast food, printing, theme restaurants and quick car exhaust change outlets
have led the way. US chain MacDonalds is still the main exponent of fast
food, and now has about 100 outlets throughout the country.
It is one of only a handful of American groups. In France, about 95 per cent
of franchisors are French, whereas in the UK about 70 per cent are American.
'This was a logical first target for US groups in Europe,' commented Chantal
Zimmer-Helou, director of the French Franchising Federation (FFF) and
general secretary of the European Franchising Federation. She explains
Macdonalds' success here by 'its great professionalism and ability to create
a new market'.
Other factors distinguishing France from its neighbours are the importance
of image for practitioners in France, and a financial management approach
which differentiates between assets and operations. 'It is impossible to
calculate the return on investment without breaking down the two,' Ms
Zimmer-Helou said.
The federation has been promoting the approach since last year, but of the
two main banks that finance franchising, Societe Generale has embraced the
principles and Credit Lyonnais has not, she explained.
It is not surprising that image is so important. prominent. Big brand names
have always been more important in France than in either Germany or the UK,
she pointed out.
The business world does not always hand out accolades to governments, but
Michel Micmacher, chairman of the Pronuptia bridalwear group and FFF
president, points out that the French authorities were the first in Europe
to recognise the role of franchising in healthy commercial competition, and
to back the demands for exemption for the sector from some of the European
Community competition regulations.
On the distribution side, the economic ills of recent times have had an
impact on the type of new entrants to the franchising industry. In the past,
most were new to retailing, but now many are already in the business and are
finding life as an independent too tough, Mr Micmacher said.
'In the past two or three years, we have seen more and more retailers in
difficulty joining franchise groups,' he added.
As for bridalwear, the Pronuptia group, which is now in 17 countries, is
holding up to the crisis in Belgium and Germany.
Surprisingly it is also doing well in Poland, because, Mr Micmacher points
out, France has long been a cultural role model for the Poles, and that
includes young 25-year-old women preparing for marriage.
In France, small ready-to-wear seeking to diversify have nibbled away at the
bridalwear specialists, but many of them have not succeeded, he said.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (5): Self-employed instructors
/ Case Study of BSM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the type of incident every driving instructor fears; as Bob Gilchrist
sat with his pupil at a red traffic light a car ploughed into his dual
control vehicle, leaving him with whiplash injuries.
Knowing that the accident was not his or his pupil's fault, and that there
was nothing he could have done to avert it, was little comfort to Mr
Gilchrist, who is self-employed; what did ease the pain was the Pounds 239 a
week he received, for the month he was off work earlier this year, from the
British School of Motoring.
Although most people in Britain have heard of BSM, far fewer are aware that
Mr Gilchrist and his 2,000 fellow BSM driving instructors are not employees
of the company, but self-employed franchisees.
Each week they give BSM a substantial chunk of the fees paid by their
pupils; they also have to buy petrol for the lessons and pay their own
National Insurance and tax.
But, in exchange, the company provides them with a new dual control Rover
Metro every 18,000 miles, services, repairs, taxes and insures the car,
backs them up with training materials, shoulders the administrative burden
and provides a flow of learners, attracted by the BSM name.
Since last year it has also introduced a franchise fee repayment for up to
26 weeks in the event of injury or sickness, the arrangement from which Mr
Gilchrist benefited.
BSM, Britain's dominant motoring school, occupies a curious position in a
sector in which lone operators take a substantial slice of the market. Each
year it trains more than 1,000 instructors; many of those who qualify and
are registered with the Driving Standards Agency, a wing of the Department
of Transport, subsequently set up in competition to BSM.
Mr Gilchrist, who has been with BSM since becoming an instructor eight years
ago, has seen a number leave to go it alone. 'I've known people who think
they're going to earn thousands and in six months they've disappeared. The
grass is always greener on the other side, but it doesn't always work out
like that.'
BSM, which estimates it has an 18 per cent market share, operates 130
branches from Aberdeen to Plymouth. Acquired in a management buyout in 1990
for Pounds 40m from the Jacobs family, it has 450 employees. Of these, 300
man the branches, in clerical, administrative and sales roles, 50 give
instructor training and 50 are based at the company's national vehicle
preparation and repair complex in the Midlands.
The 2,000 instructors, who between them give lessons to 200,000 people each
year and drive 1m miles a week, can elect to pay BSM either a fixed fee or a
variable, hourly fee.
Mr Gilchrist has opted for the fixed fee, currently 16 hours tuition fees' a
week; in Newcastle upon Tyne, where he is based, and other parts of Britain
outside London and the Home Counties, that means 16 times Pounds 14.95 -
Pounds 239 a week. On top, he calculates he spends about Pounds 50 a week on
petrol for lessons and commuting from his home to work.
Under the variable, hourly fee, an instructor in a Pounds 14.95 per lesson
area, working 27 hours a week, would end up with Pounds 131.90, before
petrol; on 35 hours it would be Pounds 201.85 before petrol.
The recession has temporarily dented instructors' earnings; Mr Gilchrist
would like to teach 40 hours a week, which would bring him about Pounds 300,
net of the fixed fee and petrol, but at present he is working around 30
hours a week, leaving him with about Pounds 150 after fee and petrol.
But even though he quite often recruits his own learners for BSM he still
believes he is better off under the company umbrella. 'All the benefits I
have here would be a lot to give up.'
Richard Glover, BSM's managing director, says it has stuck to a franchise
arrangement for its instructors both because of the flexible nature of the
work and the ethos of a business dominated by the lone operator. But within
the franchising terms, instructors' payments to the company are being
gradually reduced, and their benefits enhanced, to persuade more to stay
with BSM.
To see the work at first hand, Mr Glover has sat in on some lessons. 'I have
a healthy respect and admiration for driving instructors,' he says. 'It does
require a certain type of person.'
Mr Gilchrist is affable and calm. 'I don't shout, it's pointless.' The job
has moments of great satisfaction, like the time a 72 year-old first-time
learner, desperate to take his terminally ill wife out for rides, passed his
test.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (2): It's hard work all the
way - The opportunities and the pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY SHOULD an established business want to hand over responsibility for
developing new outlets to people who are not employees and who may have a
strong streak of independence? And why should an individual keen to set up
in business on his own account accept the constraints of working to a
formula devised by someone else?
Franchising works because it represents a compromise which provides enough
benefits to both sides to outweigh the limitations it imposes.
The franchisor does not have the same control as he would have with employed
managers but franchised outlets are often more profitable because the
franchisee is more strongly motivated. The franchisee, in turn, may want to
set up on his own but not be willing to run all the risks of complete
independence.
An important advantage to the franchisor is that he can expand more rapidly,
using the capital and business skills of his franchisees, than he would have
been able to on his own. For a company concerned that rivals may steal a new
business idea, franchising allows it to exploit its markets more rapidly.
One London company which offered a service cleaning commercial vehicles
started to get orders from the Midlands and the North which it could not
handle economically. Lacking the funds to set up a large number of branches
it grew by taking on franchisees.
Franchising also helps solve the problem of motivating branch managers since
the franchisee has the carrot of working for himself. It is less clear,
though, whether franchising provides an easier means of finding good branch
'managers' than the traditional recruitment route. Recruitment remains a
perennial problem for the industry and only one in 100 of the people who
approach franchisors actually takes up a franchise. The British Franchise
Association (BFA) estimates that the average cost of recruiting a
franchisee, including attendance at exhibitions and advertising, is Pounds
2,500.
Yet selecting franchisees is crucial to the success of any franchise. Some
new franchisors have been tempted to cut corners to get their network up and
running or to collect the up-front fees from franchisees. This inevitably
leads to higher costs later on if franchisees have to be replaced.
One of the biggest worries of a company which takes on franchisees is that
they will not maintain the standards it has built up in its company-owned
outlets. Wimpy, the fast food chain, was forced to buy back some of its
franchised outlets a few years ago because of slipping standards while Tie
Rack had to end some franchise agreements because the franchisees had
breached the terms of their contracts.
Before deciding whether franchising is suitable, a prospective franchisor
should run at least one pilot operation for between six months and a year to
test whether his business is franchisable.
Companies considering franchising should not under-estimate the resources
needed, a recent study by the NatWest Centre for Franchise Research stated.
Out of 12 franchises studied three had built up networks relatively easily
but four had faced teething problems and five had experienced significant
difficulties.
The franchisors surveyed stressed the importance of having company-owned
outlets in which to train franchisees and to monitor and develop their
businesses.
For the would-be franchisee, the issues to be considered are no less
daunting. Firstly he (or she) needs to be sure he has the commitment and the
stamina to build up a business. Despite the support provided by the
franchisor, the early days will place great demands on the individual.
Secondly, the prospective franchisee must be sure that he is not too
independently minded for franchising. The industry wants people who are
self-reliant enough to run their own business yet willing to accept the need
to work within an existing framework.
He must then consider what would be the most suitable type of business to go
into - a fast-food outlet open all hours and serving the general public or a
business with more regular hours and serving the business customer. The
range of franchising systems on offer is so broad that most people should be
able to find a niche.
But can the hopeful franchisee afford the business of his choice? The
average cost for setting up a franchise is Pounds 45,900, the BFA
calculates, while ongoing annual fees work out at an average of 8.9 per cent
of sales. The franchise fee and required outlay on equipment and stock vary
from sector to sector.
Fees for a quick print franchise are an average of Pounds 15,OOO, twice the
industry average, while quick print and catering and hotel equipment charges
are also well above the average. Taking up a professional services franchise
such as an employment agency, a training consultancy or estate agency is
relatively inexpensive because the main asset is the individual's time and
expertise. Few individual franchisees can afford to pay for any but the
cheapest franchises from their own resources and the banks are usually
willing to lend up to two-thirds of the cost of an established, viable
franchise.
Once the newcomer has chosen a business sector he must look closely at the
individual franchises on offer. If it is a new concept, has it been piloted?
Does the franchisor have the backing of the main banks and does his
prospectus list all the start-up costs?
The would-be franchisee should examine the franchisor's accounts and have a
lawyer look at the terms of the contract on offer. He should check the
franchisor's sales forecasts and carry out his own research into the
prospects for that business. How strong is the competition and what is it
saying about market prospects?
For all the advice that is showered on the new franchisee some still manage
to sign up for poorly-managed or unpiloted franchises which fail. Sometimes
a franchising format so catches their imagination that they do not carry out
the necessary checks.
But franchising is not a quick route to riches, nor a guarantee against
failure. Franchisees calculate that it takes on average nearly two and a
half years to start trading profitably and four years to recover their
outlay while 7 per cent of franchised outlets fail in a year. If any
business idea was an easy route to riches why would the franchisor want to
share it with others?

FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (1): Expanding prospects -
Franchising is weathering the recession with varying success in the UK,
France and US.  It also seems well suited to develop commercial skills in
eastern Europe and to stimulate business in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK franchising industry has not escaped the impact of the recession but,
looking beyond the short term, franchisors have ambitious expansion plans
for the rest of the decade.
Internationally, franchising appears well suited as a means of developing
business skills in eastern Europe and has also proved a popular means of
business expansion in under- developed markets such as Spain.
In Europe, France heads the franchising league by a comfortable margin while
the US remains the largest single market worldwide.
In spite of a recent increase in the failure rate of franchised businesses
in the UK, franchising appears still able to justify its claims to be a
safer method of going into business than the independent start-up. It does
not offer a 'quick fix', however, for either franchisor or franchisee and
the economic downturn has highlighted the need for both sides to work hard
on the relationship.
Franchising, sometimes referred to as business format franchising, involves
the new business owner, or franchisee, signing up to use the brand name and
established method of doing business of an existing company, the franchisor.
The franchisee usually pays an initial fee and a continuing royalty, most
commonly a percentage of sales, and may also be required to buy his raw
materials from the franchisor. The closeness of the franchising relationship
distinguishes it from other forms of cooperation such as licensing
arrangements, distributorships, agencies and tenancy agreements.
Franchising has enjoyed a mixed reputation over the past decade. The
industry's code of self-regulation has not been able to prevent abuses -
though it has recently been tightened up.
The industry continues to be concerned over untried franchises and business
propositions masquerading as the real thing but which fail to offer proper
safeguards.
The most serious recent dent to the industry's image came with the failure
last December of Alan Paul, a USM-quoted hairdressing chain. Following the
suspension of Alan Paul's shares receivers were appointed and it
subsequently emerged that Fraud Squad inquiries had begun.
Franchisees voiced complaints about the company's practice of jointly
managing franchisees' bank accounts - a method which the British Franchise
Association (BFA), representing 75 per cent of franchised outlets, described
as 'unusual'. The banks, for their part, were believed to be uneasy about
loans made by the company to franchisees.
The fall-out from the demise of Alan Paul would have beengreater but for the
fact that other companies took over large parts of the business and many
franchisees were able to continue trading.
The overall failure rate of franchised businesses rose from just under 6 per
cent to just over 7 per cent in the year ended June 1991 (the latest period
for which detailed figures are available) and may have risen slightly over
the past 18 months.
The impact of the recession was also felt in a decline in total franchise
sales in the UK from Pounds 5.2bn in 1989-90 to Pounds 4.8bn in 1990-91, or
roughly 3 per cent of total retail sales. This compares with franchising's
retail share of about 6 per cent in France and 35 per cent in the US though
international comparisons are complicated by differing definitions of
franchising activity.
In the US, where franchising includes sectors such as car and truck
distributorships, petrol stations and soft drink bottling, 1991 sales
amounted to Dollars 758bn, 6 per cent more than in 1990.
But while UK franchising turnover was lower the numbers of franchised
outlets and franchising systems increased. The number of outlets (some
franchisees own more than one outlet) rose from 18,260 to 18,600 while the
number of systems (franchisors) rose from 379 to 432. The number of people
employed in franchising rose by 6,000 to 189,500. Looking to the future,
franchisors say they plan to double the number of outlets by 1996.
Inevitably, during a recession, tensions between franchisors and franchisees
increase. 'Franchisees question the quality of the service they are getting
while some may delay or refuse to pay the agreed fees to the franchisor,'
says Mr Martin Mendelsohn, franchise partner at solicitors Jaques &amp; Lewis.
The strains have been most marked in the less profitable sectors and among
newer franchisees who have not yet built up trading volumes or paid off
their bank loans. The better franchisors have responded by increasing their
assistance for franchisees, increasing marketing support and training, notes
Mr Peter Stern, senior franchise manager at National Westminster Bank.
Unlike the US, in the UK the banks play a close role in vetting franchisors
and in funding franchisees. But faced with the general downturn and losses
and provisions in other areas of their business they have taken a tougher
line on franchising proposals.
The banks will still lend twice the sum invested by the franchisee compared
with their normal lending ratio of 1:1 for other businesses. But they are
taking a stricter line on more marginal propositions and business sectors
which have had particular problems.
If franchising is to achieve a significant breakthrough from its present
small share in retail trade it must open up new sectors and attract big
company players. There are signs that both of these are happening.
The number of vehicle servicing franchisors, including activities such as
car valeting and tuning, more than doubled in the two years to mid-1991
while the number of outlets increased by 50 per cent. In retailing, numbers
of both systems (franchises) and outlets doubled due partly to a move by
established companies such as Cullens, Levi Strauss and Rymans to expand by
means of franchising.
Retailing accounted for 29 per cent of franchising systems and 25 per cent
of outlets while other leading sectors were buildings services (13 and 11
per cent respectively) and commercial and industrial services (10 and 5 per
cent).
Franchising is increasingly seen as a mainstream activity by large
companies, according to some specialists. 'It used to be seen as a strategy
for small and medium-sized companies which wanted to grow or as a peripheral
part of big organisations,' says Ms Amanda Griggs, director of Stoy Hayward
Franchising Services.
'But now we see a lot of major corporations looking at franchising. In the
1980s these large organisations became very centralised. That was all right
in boom times but now they want to give more autonomy to their operating
units.'
Shell, the oil company, has launched its Shell Share scheme to franchise the
operation of its petrol forecourts while several other petrol companies are
also looking at franchising. Large dairy groups such as Unigate and Dairy
Crest have been turning their milk rounds into franchises while the Post
Office has begun franchising the operation of some of its larger offices
(not just sub-offices) to retailers such as Rymans and Safeway.
The BFA, in its latest annual review, reports that public houses, petrol
stations and motor distributors, at present regarded as 'licensed
distributors', are increasingly taking on the character of franchises with
longer-term agreements between the licensees and licensors. If pubs and
motor distributors were included in the franchise industry statistics, as
they already are in the US, they would boost turnover to nearly Pounds 21bn,
the BFA calculates.
Converting licensed outlets into franchises is not always easy, however.
Many tenants are reluctant to pay large up-front fees for the privilege of
becoming the franchisee of a business they are already running.
The move by large companies into the industry has helped to improve its
image but the BFA, which has no wish to see legislation introduced, has been
forced to tighten up its own rules.
The association has dropped its 'early development' category of membership.
This involved no checking of members' status and they were not allowed to
advertise themselves as association members anyway.
About 20 franchisors did not renew their membership when this category was
abolished, says Mr Brian Smart, BFA chairman. The association has also
introduced formal standards for franchisors wishing to take part in the
industry's twice-yearly exhibitions, which are an important means of
recruiting franchisees.
If the franchising industry can make its tougher codes stick it can expect a
bright future. It could ask for no sterner judge of its methods than the
continuing recession.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Brown calls for action on
speculators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN yes-terday underlined his status as a pivotal figure in the
shadow cabinet with a sharp attack on Mr John Major's economic management
and a call for international action to end the turmoil in currency markets.
Speaking hours before his comfortable election for the first time to the
party's ruling national executive committee, the shadow chancellor said the
Conservatives had created a 'vacuum at the heart of government instead of
putting Britain at the heart of Europe'.
The carefully managed conference debate on the economy - designed to
emphasise Labour's commitment to buttress rather than supplant the market
economy - saw calls from some delegates for a return to more aggressive
interventionism and for a stronger commitment to universal welfare benefits.
But in the event it passed a series of uncontentious motions calling for a
targeted public investment programme, tax incentives for capital spending by
manufacturing industry and European-wide action to reduce investment.
Foreshadowing the central theme of Mr John Smith's first leadership speech
later today, Mr Brown characterised the recent sterling crisis as a failure
of leadership by Mr Major.
In a combative performance which focused on exploiting the disarray in the
cabinet, the shadow chancellor said that sterling's departure from the
exchange rate mechanism had left the government directionless and isolated.
Mr Major had now 'retreated from the challenge of Europe to the squalid
pursuit of Thatcherism in one country'.
Mr Brown accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of refusing to support
the prime minister 'leaving him floating downwards to find his own level'.
But he eschewed any commitment by Labour to immediate re-entry to the ERM,
calling instead for 'a new internationalism' in economic strategy designed
to limit the power of speculators.
The conference subsequently endorsed the statement agreed by the NEC last
week backing closer economic and political co-operation in Europe and a
managed system of 'fixed but adjustable' exchange rates.
Mr Brown blamed the devaluation of the pound on the weakness of the economy,
demanding a national recovery programme targeted at increased investment,
training and an immediate boost for the construction industry.
Later he told journalists that Labour support for sterling's eventual return
to the ERM was contingent on reform of the system.
The party wanted an extension of the Basle-Nyborg agreements to expand the
scope of intra-marginal intervention in the ERM, an increase in the
resources available to central banks to combat speculation and the creation
of a common pool of those resources. He also urged a summit meeting to try
to find an international means of curbing speculators.
Mr Brown sidestepped questions on whether Labour would back a call at the
conference from Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union
for a 'windfall' tax on currency speculators.
In a speech which won warm applause from delegates, Mr Edmonds said that the
City had become Britain's 'biggest casino', where more than Pounds 500m had
been won by 'cocky young men' betting on a certainty.
But for his part the shadow chancellor implicitly acknowledged that such a
tax might simply drive foreign currency dealing offshore.
He said that action to end the turmoil in currency markets should be
considered at a summit of the G7 group of leading industrial countries.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Passionless divisions written
in sub-clauses - Little flag-waving over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is an old Labour tradition that party conferences should begin with a
blazing row.
But compared to the heroic scale of past displays of disunity, Mr Bryan
Gould's resignation over Maastricht has proved but a nostalgic encore.
A trawl of conference opinion in the listless atmosphere of Blackpool
yesterday revealed more about how Labour has changed than about its largely
passionless internal European debate.
Undoubtedly, opinions on Maastricht and the leadership's approach to
parliamentary Euro-tactics are divided. But they are split so diversely  -
pro-Maastricht, pro-Maastricht but insistent on UK inclusion in the social
chapter clauses, pro-referendum, anti-Maastricht - that the divisions appear
not written in blood, but in sub-clauses.
There is precious little of the flag-waving and fire and brimstone that the
issues provoke among the Conservatives.
An intimation of that was given by Mr Gould himself in his Sunday night
address to the Labour Common Market Safeguards Committee - the tiny rump
grouping, aptly anachronistic in name, that represents the party's diehard
anti-Community rump.
Bemoaning the 'gag and straitjacket' imposed on debate behind the closed
doors of the shadow cabinet, he predicted: 'I have no illusions about how
rapidly I will be disowned and marginalised about my decision to speak my
mind.'
Yesterday, the disowning and marginalising was already under way with many
Gould sympathisers expressing ill-disguised irritation with the timing and
lack of consultation behind his decision.
Mr Peter Hain MP, secretary of the pro-Europe but anti-Maastricht Tribune
group, suggested that outright anger was a more appropriate description of
many MPs' reactions.
'Bryan acted unilaterally. He did not consult any of the people who backed
him for the leadership. He's alienated a lot of people,' Mr Hain said,
adding that the manner of his going had turned the debate into a discussion
of the importance of unity.
Even seasoned leftwingers like Mrs Maria Fyfe MP, now a Scottish
spokeswoman, acknowledged that the days of conference bloodletting appear to
have gone forever. 'It is not so much the party drifting to the right, it is
that principles without power aren't very useful,' she said.
'Ten years ago there would have been mayhem. The party has changed.'
Indeed, so much so that it can even joke about the past. Mr Robin Cook got
the biggest laugh at a fringe meeting when he suggested tongue-in-cheek
that, perhaps, Labour should have a referendum after all.
'It will be six months arguing amongst ourselves . . . we are good at that,'
he said.
If truth be told, one lasting legacy of the Kinnock years is that Labour has
lost the habit. Delegates and MPs alike differed on whether Mr Ken
Livingstone was right in his claim that 100 Labour MPs will oppose the
Maastricht bill when it returns to the House. Many accepted that it would be
more than the 59 who defied the party whip in May.
But even among those ready to defy the leadership, there is little acrimony.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, a one-time EC opponent, now a pro-Maastricht federalist,
concluded that Mr Gould had hoped to create a wave of resistance to the
party line but had signally failed to do so.
'There is no stomach for a fight over Maastricht, either in the
parliamentary party, the constituencies and certainly not the trade unions,'
he said.
Confirmatory evidence followed soon after in the conference European debate
where even Mr Tony Benn failed to stir any real inkling of a populist
reaction.
Although Mr Smith would still have preferred that Mr Gould's sense of timing
were more tactful, some of the consequences of his coup de theatre are
encouraging for the leadership.
With the leading opponent of the policy gone, the shadow cabinet will now
toe the line yet more rigorously than before and may yet adopt a less
cautiously pro-treaty stance. The possibility of putting more space between
Labour and the hesitant Conservative leadership has emerged.
Within six months, the prospect of promoting Labour as the fast-lane
Europeans and the Tories as the party that let Britain slip behind the
leaders offers an attractive prospect.
But that will require a gamble on a more explicitly pro-exchange rate
mechanism stance than the Smith-Brown axis has thus far advocated.
Furthermore, yesterday's crushing conference-floor defeats of those
advocating a referendum will serve as powerful ammunition should the
parliamentary party again attempt to persuade the shadow cabinet to pursue
that route.
In the end, whatever the size of the MPs rebellion in the Commons, Labour -
just as Mr Smith wants - will not join the Tory right to defeat the
ratification process.
Undoubtedly the Conservatives will do their best to project Labour as
hideously split on the European issues. But yesterday proved that the charge
carries little real weight. The real disputes are about tactics.
Much more worrying for the party leadership, however, is the lacklustre,
downbeat mood that suffused the first day of conference. It is that air of
defeatism, not the European questions, which Mr Smith must reverse when he
rises to address the party today.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Maastricht rebels fail to
dent leadership's resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GRASSROOTS rebellion in favour of a national referendum on the Maastricht
treaty was halted in its tracks yesterday when Mr Gerald Kaufman was joined
by senior trade union leaders to argue against a plebiscite.
The outcome was an overwhelming vote against two motions - one which opposed
ratification of the treaty, the other which pressed for a referendum.
Senior party officials pointed out that the defeat for the opponents of
Maastricht was not merely due to the union barons, but also sprang from
overwhelming support for the leadership from constituency parties.
They pointed out also that the show-of-hands vote so clearly backed the
platform that the rebels waived their right to demand a card vote which
would have shown the exact scale of their defeat.
As a result, Mr John Smith, the party leader, can expect to see his hand
substantially strengthened when he presents his tactics to the members of
his parliamentary party, many of whom are clearly more critical than the
conference of his stance.
In his speech, Mr Kaufman, who stepped down this summer as shadow foreign
secretary, warned that a referendum would help the Conservatives out of
their difficulties on Europe and threatened to split Labour.
He urged the party to campaign for greater powers for the European
Parliament, greater EC aid for the regions and use of the EC as a 'force to
redress Tory domestic policy'.
He said the Community was far from perfect but Labour had much to gain from
'getting the best possible out of the EC'.
The centrepiece of the government's Europe policy had become a vacuum, he
said.
'Maastricht is the Tories' problem,' Mr Kaufman said. 'We should not turn it
into Labour's problem.'
A referendum would 'create unnecessary divisions in the Labour party, in
every union, in every branch, in every constituency Labour party, in the
parliamentary Labour party,' he said.
Similar views were advanced by Mr Gavin Laird, the engineers' and
electricians' leader, and Mr Alan Tuffin of the communications workers.
For the rebels, Mr Tony Benn, the former cabinet minister and veteran
leftwing MP for Chesterfield, argued forcefully that it was wrong that
Labour should oppose a democratic vote on the Maastricht treaty when the
French and Danes had held referendums.
He added: 'We pride ourselves on one member, one vote to elect the leader
(of the party) but not one member, one vote to decide the future of this
country.'
But in spite of a warm reception, the conference voted overwhelmingly
against him.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: MPs and activists speak out
against electoral pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTORAL PACTS between Labour and the Liberal Democrats were firmly ruled
out at a fringe meeting on the prospects of a political re-alignment
delivering electoral success for the centre-left.
Labour's fourth successive election defeat raised the question of whether an
anti-Conservative pact is the only way the party will ever emerge from
opposition, but the idea has been rejected by the leaderships of both the
parties.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Citizen's Charter minister, said: 'Electoral
pacts are not on the agenda. It is not for us to make the decision for
voters or for party activists.' But she said that where there was common
ground with other parties it should be acknowledged.
Sharing a platform at the meeting was Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat
MP for Fife North East. Last month's Liberal Democrat conference also ruled
out formal pacts, but left the door open for informal contacts.
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, warned that the party may have to
accept that there is a 'glass ceiling' to its support, above which the
electorate will not let it rise. He said: 'We do not know what the
circumstances will be when the next election is called . . . It would be
wise at this stage to keep our options open.'
He urged joint membership of the proposed Commission for Social Justice,
which Labour suggested should look for solutions to poverty.
Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, spoke against closer links
with the Liberal Democrats, saying it would be a further obstacle to moving
Labour back to the left.
'It is not just about getting an anti-Tory government. The mere fact that
you can look at the Liberal (Democrat) manifesto and see so much common
ground with Labour is a matter of distress,' he said.
Speakers from the floor demonstrated deep suspicion of Liberal Democrat
opponents. A delegate from Tower Hamlets, east London, attacked the election
tactics of the Liberal Democrats, which have led to bitterness in the area.
Dame Barbara Castle, the former Labour cabinet minister, said her first
memory of the Liberals was as 'the Tories' natural allies'.
She said: 'There have been and still are some great Liberal spirits with
whom we naturally ally. But they won't ally with us unless we have got some
great revolutionary spirits left in the Labour party.
'I believe the only alliance that can possibly exist between Labour and
Liberals is with individual Liberals on the basis of a great strong
reforming policy by the Labour party.'

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Election post-mortem kept
short - Delegates want to avoid dwelling on the defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR conference's post-mortem on the election took less than an hour
yesterday, squeezed between a European policy debate and the drama of
National Executive Committee election results.
Some delegates might have preferred it not to have taken place at all.
The media, voters' distrust, a lack of appeal to women, misleading opinion
polls, and campaign strategy mistakes were identified as the main culprits
for what Mr Larry Whitty, party secretary, admitted had been 'a crushing
disappointment from which we have yet to recover'.
But conference delegates appeared unwilling even to discuss whether a fourth
successive election defeat justified a more wide-ranging re-think.
The shadow Budget or links with trade unions did not figure. The shadow
communications agency - hated by the Labour left - was only mentioned
obliquely. The only decision was to instigate a study of attitudes of women
voters.
'The feeling is that the tide has come in and gone out again; it (the
election result) is no longer relevant,' said Mr Phil Cole, a London
regional organiser. He has just completed an analysis of Labour's difficulty
in winning in prosperous areas of London.
A lunchtime fringe meeting, 'Did proportional representation lose Labour the
election?', offered hope of a more considered appraisal. PR was a focus of
campaigning in the last week of the election campaign.
But Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader and the main speaker, was
dismissive. 'Of course PR didn't lose us the general election. We lost the
general election for a number of other reasons,' he told the thinly attended
assembly.
A frontbench spokesman, drinking late at night in the Imperial hotel, spoke
as if the election result had been a personal bereavement; he had
re-appraised his life but decided he had to go on as before. All this fuels
the impression that the 'One more heave-ers' - those believing only a little
more effort is needed for Labour to win the next election - are in the
ascendancy. But there are many willing to play on what is perhaps the
subconscious fear of many delegates: that the review of strategy, policy and
organisation has to be far-reaching.
Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP, warned in a Fabian Society pamphlet this
week that the party needed a radical shift in policy if it was to achieve
the breakthrough in the south-east needed to defeat the Conservatives.
'There is a general view that we don't want to look back. Looking back is a
dangerous thing for a political party - but I believe it is necessary,' he
said.
The lack of open debate is partly a product of the conference format. Mr
Radice describes it as a 'sentimentalist' occasion, rather than an
institution for careful analysis. Avoiding recriminations is also a good
short-term tactic; too much introspection would only distract from turmoil
in the Conservative party. Labour's standing in opinion polls is rising,
boosting confidence and reducing the apparent need for change.
At the same time there has yet to emerge a coherent programme for
institutional or policy change that can command support among more than a
handful of members.
Even the voice of the left wing is marginalised - restricted in yesterday's
debate to one complaint that the party manifesto had been just 'capitalism
with a nice Labour face - it was political suicide,' from the Wirral West
delegate.
For many supporters of the leadership, Mr John Smith's election in July was
a change in itself. As he left the conference platform last night, it must
have been clear that the form and pace of reform will be largely up to him.

FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Smith tightens his grip on
NEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY BLAIR, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, were elected for the first time to Labour's national executive
committee yesterday as Mr John Smith took an unshakeable grip on the party's
ruling body.
Mr Neil Kinnock - Mr Smith's predecessor as party leader - was also elected
to the 26-member committee, scoring the highest vote in the constituency
section.
Senior party officials hailed the result as a crushing endorsement of the
leadership by grass-roots supporters. In line with a rule change implemented
last year, delegates cast their votes in accordance with the results of a
ballot of constituency party members.
Following the result - which saw the ejection of Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for
Bolsover, and Mr Brian Gould, the unsuccessful challenger to Mr Smith in
Labour's leadership election earlier this year - Mr Tony Benn will be the
lone voice of left-wing dissent.
This may severely restrict the ability of the veteran Chesterfield MP to act
as a thorn in the leadership's flesh, as he may lack the routine seconder
needed to table motions.
In other respects, the result will make no obvious impact on the running of
the party, because the once left-wing NEC has long been closely identified
with the leadership.
With Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, also returned and
Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, free to continue as an ex-officio
member, Mr Smith has secured what amounts to a kitchen cabinet of senior
Westminster colleagues within Labour's ruling body.*
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, and Mr John Prescott, shadow
transport secretary, completed the line-up of constituency representatives,
while Mr Gerald Kaufman, ex-shadow foreign secretary, did not stand for
re-election.
Mr Gould, who resigned as shadow heritage secretary on Sunday over his
opposition to the Maastricht treaty, blamed the sharp decline in his vote on
adverse reaction to his leadership challenge.
Facing the end of a 14-year NEC stint, Mr Skinner vowed to remain 'the voice
of the left in parliament'. He blamed his demise partly on not appealing to
'yuppies in the south'.
Mr Kinnock pledged to 'sustain the impetus' for democratic change within the
party. 'It is a very, very strong National Executive Committee and, most
important, a committee with the authority that comes from one member, one
vote,' he said.
In other sections, Ms Hilary Armstrong, Mr Smith's parliamentary private
secretary and another loyalist, takes Mrs Beckett's place on the women's
slate, while Ms Judith Church of MSF becomes the first woman to win outright
in the trade unions section.
With Mr Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader, as ex-officio
members, the NEC comprises:
Trade union section (12 members): D. Duffy (TGWU), W. Connor (Usdaw), C.
Kelly (Ucatt), T. Sawyer (Nupe), G. Colling (GPMU), V. Hince (RMT), J.
Church (MSF), T. Clarke (UCW), D. Ward (NCU), N. Harris (AEU), R. Rosser
(TSSA), C. O'Kane (Cohse).
Constituency Labour parties (seven members): N. Kinnock, D. Blunkett, G.
Brown, J. Prescott, R. Cook, T. Blair, T. Benn.
Women (five members): J. Lestor, C. Short, D. Jeuda, H. Armstrong, B.
Etchells.
Also elected was Mr Tom Burlison of GMB as treasurer.

FT  29 SEP 92 / Abta warns of flaw in new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSED government rules for package tours could result in disreputable
companies basing themselves in European Community countries with weaker
regulations, travel industry representatives warned yesterday.
The government has proposed that the regulations, due to come into effect
next year, should apply to packages sold in the UK, except when the company
offering them is established in another EC country.
Mr Keith Betton, for the Association of British Travel Agents, said: 'If the
contract is concluded in the UK, then UK legislation should be the basis of
customer protection. We think otherwise the system will be abused by
companies searching for the weakest link in the European Community chain.'
The proposed regulations are designed to implement an EC directive requiring
travel companies to ensure that they repatriate holidaymakers and return
their money if the operator collapses.
The directive leaves it up to each government to decide how the regulations
should be implemented. However, Abta is concerned that implementation of the
directive will be weaker in some member states than in others, allowing
companies to shop around until they find the least restrictive European
country in which to base themselves.
The latest version of the government's proposals, published yesterday,
offers companies three options: arranging a bond with an approved trade
association; taking out insurance in the form of policies issued to
individual customers, giving them the right to claim themselves; and opening
a designated account into which all the deposits would be paid.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said yesterday: 'The
implementation is designed to enable each operator - and there are up to
20,000 of them - to choose which of the several options are appropriate to
their needs.'
However, Mr Betton said the regulations would be inadequate because the
government had rejected Abta's suggestion that all companies be licensed.
Mr Betton also criticised the government's proposal that companies should
only have to help tourists to return home when they are stranded while they
are taking a holiday abroad.
He said that a Scottish holidaymaker in Cornwall could find it just as
difficult to return home as someone from the south of England on holiday in
France.
