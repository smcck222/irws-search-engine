FT  14 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Tales of disaster and
salvation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR those who like life to be simple, there are too many possible
explanations for the unexpected surge in the dollar at the end of last week.
Only the least likely of them could be construed as offering any kind of
consolation for the British government for the fact that the dollar's rise
left sterling more than ever stranded - the idea that the markets were
giving Mr Major's friend President Bush a vote of confidence after his
latest tax-cutting speech.
The more plausible explanations are sadder.
In the US, the most significant change was marked not by Mr Bush's speech,
but by remarks from Governors Angell and Parry of the Federal Reserve. Both
indicated that the lastest US interest rate cut should be the last for some
time, which suggests that the Fed is now becoming more worried about the
dollar than about the continued weakness of the economy. This postpones any
remaining hope of European salvation from rising American demand.
This news might have weakened the dollar still further, on what is now the
normal market rule - that it is strong economies which have strong
currencies. However, the sad fact is that while optimism about the US simply
remains anaemic, hope is rapidly disappearing everywhere else.
It was surely the news of crisis in Scandinavia and Italy, riots in Germany,
slump in Britain and falling industrial confidence in Japan which drove the
dollar up. The US may look waterlogged, but if you know a better hole. . .
The stalest of all bull markets is that in European integration. Though it
is easy to forget, it is not very long since the US business press was full
of learned discussions of the European disease. Then the US economy went
sour, the Japanese market looked overdone, and 1992 loomed. For a couple of
years, Europe was seen as a nascent superpower; but now we have crisis, and
what was seen as a source of strength looks like a fatal weakness. Indeed,
for a rapidly growing minority of market analysts, European disintegration
looks not so much a disaster as a prospective relief.
The markets should have foreseen the pains of convergence. All systems
become brittle if they are too rigid; and in any case, we have been this way
before. The Bretton Woods system, now remembered as a paradise of low
inflation and steady growth, was denounced in its time as a deflationary
plot. When the IMF finally achieved convergence, the world went into a
simultaneous boom and blew the lid off the system.
Regional convergence should not be so accident-prone, because floating
exchange rates outside the system allow for some automatic adjustment; they
are now supporting US growth as Europe slows down.
All the same, convergence is painful to achieve, and requires careful
management even when it is achieved. Watching the mess we are making of the
first stage (partly because the Germans no longer seem to want it much) it
is hard to hold much hope for stage two; and the markets have clearly lost
all faith in the whole business.
All this looks like a catastrophe for Britain, and especially for Mr John
Major; but I am not so sure. Pessimists might try to find a copy of Richard
Hughes's prophetic inter-war novel In Hazard. This concerns a ship (very
obviously the ship of state) in a storm. Every effort by the skipper to meet
the crisis makes things worse; but every apparent disaster proves a
salvation. At the climax, the bridge and funnel are carried away in a huge
wave; so the ship does not capsize.
Mr Major behaves ominously like Mr Hughes's skipper; and he will certainly
look silly if the ERM superstructure is battered to bits.
Yet Britain might have a very promising long-term future in a more flexibly
constructed Europe. The present slump would still damage the economy and the
currency, but it would kill inflation for a long time. Thereafter Britain's
long-term competitive advantage could promise a prolonged growth boom.
It is just a matter of not drowning first.

RESULTS DUE
Kingfisher, the retailing group, is likely to add its voice to tidings of
depressed consumer spending when it releases its interim results on Tuesday.
The B&amp;Q chain has faced pressure from a price war in the DIY trade, but
Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug should have benefited from productivity
gains.
Kingfisher has a knack of exceeding expectations and may report pre-tax
profits above the Pounds 61m consensus forecast and last year's Pounds
62.5m.
Dalgety today reports profits for the year to end June. Forecasts centre on
Pounds 115m pre-tax, up from Pounds 110.9m, with petfoods and snacks leading
the way. Tougher trading conditions in milling, baking, food ingredients and
animal foods are expected though.
Inchcape, the international motor distribution, services and marketing
group, is today expected to announce interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds
110m, compared with Pounds 91m. The figures are helped by the inclusion for
the first time of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor company acquired with
the help of a Pounds 376m rights issue last December.
Tomorrow sees interim results from MB-Caradon, the building products and
cheque printing group which has a quarter share in CarnaudMetalbox. Pre-tax
profits are expected to have risen from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 60m, helped
by the use of the rights issue money raised last year and substantial
cost-cutting measures.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, also reports on
Tuesday. Estimates for interim pre-tax profits range from Pounds 92m to
Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 135.5m. Analysts will ask about the extent
to which AWA, a pulp buyer, has suffered from rising pulp costs and falling
paper prices.
First-half results from Guinness on Thursday are expected to reflect
economic weakness in its international markets. Analysts have trimmed
forecasts of pre-tax profits to between Pounds 360m and Pounds 365m, an
increase of 4 per cent on the 1991 interims. Full-year profits are still
expected to top Pounds 1bn for the first time.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Market focus on Maastricht: Economics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SPECULATION about the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty, to be held on Sunday, will dominate the week. Mid-month UK economic
statistics are expected to show that the economy staggered through the
summer, with virtually no signs of growth.
A flicker of activity in manufacturing output in the first half encouraged
some economists to suggest it had 'bottomed-out' in the first half of the
year. However, the latest forecasts suggest economists believe the growth
may not be sustainable

FT  14 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Cut and rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALING in all the major currencies will be affected by the extent of
today's cut in the Bundesbank's official interest rates, writes James Blitz.
If the Germans had not pledged to cut their official rates, the unilateral
devaluation of the Italian lira could have led to a run on sterling and
other weaker currencies in the exchange rate mechanism this morning.
However, the Bundesbank's promise to cut its official rates for the first
time since 1988 could trigger a rally for the dollar and sterling in
European trading today.
Early operations in Australia and New Zealand showed how wild markets could
be today. In New Zealand, the dollar surged as high as DM1.51, after opening
in New York on Friday at DM1.4503. Sterling was at a high of DM2.81, two
pfennigs above its close in London. The French franc was trading as low as
FFr3.2923 against the D-Mark, having been at around FFr3.40 for the last few
weeks.
Even if the Germans cut rates, however, the outcome of Sunday's referendum
on Maastricht could still create tensions for European currencies. France
must hope that a cut in German rates will be followed by a cut in French
rates and that this will increase the Yes vote on Sunday. If it does not,
trading next Monday could be no less intense.
The day will also bring the first test of whether devaluation can save the
Italian lira from further interest rate rises. The experience of Finland is
that devaluation, far from stopping the rot, only brings more pressures on
the currency. Some dealers think that a 7 per cent devaluation is far too
small, and that the lira was already overvalued against the D-Mark by around
15 per cent until last night.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Bosses give the ERM a mixed rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST big company bosses still support Mr John Major in his defence of
sterling within the ERM, but a significant number are beginning to have
doubts. Several express outright opposition.
The most outspoken opponent among several chairmen and chief executives of
the UK's 100 biggest companies contacted by the Financial Times before last
night's currency alignment was Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the
industrial conglomerate.
'I think we ought to go in for a free float and be done with it,' he said.
'Then we'll know where we are.' It would be no good just devaluing against
the D-Mark, he added, because 'that still ties us to a country which has
several years of structural change ahead of it. I don't understand the
general apprehension about free floating.'
BTR has just announced a profits rise for the first half of the year. But
Sir Owen said in his statement that the political focus on the extinction of
inflation was helping to create market conditions 'resembling an economic
desert'.
Other opponents were less forthright and less willing to be identified. The
chief executive of a textiles group said that although he thought sterling
should stay in the ERM, there should be a realignment against the D-Mark.
'The key thing our industry needs is a 3 per cent reduction in interest
rates and sterling at Dollars 1.75 or lower,' he said. 'I don't think we
could get interest rates down on our own, but a realignment would help us
out on the dollar.'
The chief executive of a food group said: 'Inasmuch as the ERM helps us get
inflation down, that's terrific. I wouldn't come out unilaterally. But on
the other hand, I can't see the ERM surviving. What's finally going to make
it crunch, God knows, but something will. The system is inflexible, and
everything we do in trade and commerce needs flexibility.'
The point was echoed by the chief executive of another consumer group. 'As a
businessman, I don't like being boxed into a corner. I've come to the
personal conclusion that we've got to realign.
'Devaluing might push the inflation rate up a bit, but I don't mind 3 or 4
per cent inflation if it gets growth back into the economy.'
Even some supporters of government policy expressed reservations. A company
chairman said: 'I would advocate sticking to the present ERM parities,
because somehow or other we need to get credibility for sterling . . . but
the price being paid is enormous, and it's not at all clear that the Germans
are right in their monetary policy.'
There remains a hard core of businessmen who believe that there is no
alternative to the present policy. Mr Chris Haskins, the chairman of
Northern Foods, has not always seen eye to eye with the government. On this
issue, though, he said, the UK had to stick with it.
'The alternative is just too horrible. It must surely be just a question of
time before German rates come down, because they can't stick it out either.
It may be a horrible mess at present, but it would be crazy to make a move
before the French referendum or the US elections.
'If by the end of the year the dollar is still as low and German interest
rates are still as high, that might be a different matter. But in that case
we'd all be in a mess. It's an illusion to think that this is just a
domestic problem any more. Things are not as dire for us as they are for the
Scandinavians or the Italians.'
The chairman of a manufacturing multinational said: 'I wasn't a supporter
originally. But having gone in, I see no alternative to slogging it out.
Otherwise we would just return to the old days of boom and bust.'
Mr David Lyon, chief executive of the packaging group Bowater, said:
'Getting in at the level we did provided us with a rod for our own backs.
But looking out 10 years or more, I believe that is necessary and can be
lived with. If you have a business which is highly exposed and is a long way
from being competitive with its peers in Germany and France, that's tough.
But if we want to get into Europe and into world markets, it's a good
discipline. If we were to devalue by 10 per cent or so, we would all heave a
sigh of relief and stop making progress.'
The point about European competitiveness was picked up by Mr Barrie
Stephens, chairman of the engineering group Siebe. 'I think it's screamingly
painful, and it's going to be, but we have to stick to it. That's what the
other ERM countries are doing, and we've got to keep pace with them. I don't
think retiring into insularity is an option.'
Indeed, one or two bosses took a harder line again. Sir Owen Green's
counterpart at the opposite end of the spectrum is the chief executive of a
consumer group. He said: 'I would put up interest rates if need be. If they
went up by 2 or 3 percentage points, I think sterling would really bounce.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Top pay 'unrelated to performance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP directors' total pay is generally unrelated to their companies'
performances, according to a review published today by Incomes Data
Services, the research organisation.
The analysis considered total remuneration of the 69 highest-paid directors
in the country's largest FT-SE 100 companies with financial years ending
between September 1991 and March 1992.
Last week Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, told the Trades Union Congress conference in Blackpool that senior
management's pay should be linked to the same market and productivity forces
as the rest of the workforce.
According to IDS, the median increase in annual total payments for the 69
highest-paid directors was 7.9 per cent. Total pay packages ranged from
Pounds 1,728,000 to Pounds 148,000.
As in the previous year, IDS said, there seemed to be no discernible
relationship between the earnings growth of individuals and the company
performance, although long-term incentive schemes had increased. Of the 26
companies whose profits and or earnings per share fell substantially, 23 of
the highest-paid directors received pay increases.
The review said some companies were now giving more information about the
make-up of remuneration at the top, reporting salaries and bonuses
separately, in line with the Cadbury committee's advice.
The Institute of Directors said last night: 'We have always said there is
nothing wrong with high pay as long as it is justified by performance and

FT  14 SEP 92 / Warning over audit guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIANCE on the present guidelines for auditing housing associations is
'dangerous and unprofessional', Mr Arthur Merchant, a partner with Robson
Rhodes, the accountancy firm, says in a letter to Mr Bill Morrison, chairman
of the Auditing Practices Board.
The guidelines were issued in 1984, and Mr Merchant argues that since then
changing conditions including new legislation permitting the use of a wider
mix of finance to fund housing associations have rendered the guide 'clearly
out of date'.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Sobriety returns for Mideast talks: Roger Matthews sees the
euphoria subsiding ahead of today's negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE EAST peace negotiations should settle back into a more sober mood
today after the public, long-distance diplomacy of the past week. As the
five teams representing Israel, Syria, the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon
return after a 10-day recess to the State Department in Washington they will
be well aware that it will be impossible to maintain international
expectations at the levels encouraged by some of their political masters in
the past few days.
The underlying cause for celebration during the sixth round of negotiations
which opened on August 23 has been the defeat of the Likud government in
Israel in June. The Labour victory transformed the atmosphere at the talks
and opened a door that had been slammed shut on substantive issues involving
a trade of land for peace as demanded by UN Resolutions 242 and 338.
At one level this has led Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, to refer,
beamingly, to 'our Palestinian friends' and to admit to no more than 'slight
frustration' after a fruitless day at the negotiating table. At a less
visible level, it has led to the formal exchange of negotiating documents
for the first time since the process opened in Madrid last October. Both
developments are encouraging, but have to be seen against the sterility of
the last five rounds rather than as a guarantee of future progress.
Onlookers will increasingly have to be aware of at least three sets of
negotiations and the extent to which public utterances are tailored for
particular audiences. First, there are the Washington negotiations; next,
the public statements designed to influence domestic and international
public opinion; third, and most important, are the direct discussions
between government leaders such as the recent private dinner between
President George Bush and King Hussein of Jordan.
The past week has been dominated by public statements, primarily by Israeli
leaders in apparently euphoric mood about signs of Syrian flexibility over
the issue of the Golan Heights. Syria's position is now more evident: return
all of the Golan, every last square centimetre, and in return there can be a
peace treaty like that between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Senior US officials
do not doubt such a deal is possible.
The question in their minds is less whether Syrian President Assad would
sign on those terms but whether Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister,
will go beyond his stated readiness for 'territorial compromise' and can
carry the majority of public opinion sufficiently to offset the backlash
from settlers and his extreme right-wing opponents.
Talking up the prospects of a deal with Syria has another useful purpose for
Mr Rabin: it helps to unsettle the Palestinians, who always fear Syria, like
Egypt under President Sadat, could abandon them by signing a separate deal.
The problem is exacerbated because the Palestinian-Israeli talks are far
more complex and do not address the final status of the territories occupied
by Israel in 1967. The purpose of the negotiations is to agree only on a
five-year interim self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza. After
the first three years of that period negotiations will begin on the final
status of the territories.
The Palestinians are adamant that an elected self-governing authority cannot
be only the administrative arm of an occupying army: it must have some
legislative role and a start has to be made in checking the procedures
through which Israel is completing another 11,000 homes, which will push the
Jewish population to over 150,000.
Israel refuses to contemplate any legislative function for the Palestinians,
saying this would give them the taste of statehood, which is not on offer.
The first concrete step towards bridging that divide needs to be taken
before the sixth round ends on September 24 if a negotiating momentum is to
be achieved.
It is likely to come through agreement by the two sides on an agenda, which,
though in part a procedural document, also has political substance.
The signing of the first-ever agreed document by Israelis and Palestinians
would, say the optimists, make subsequent deals that much easier. 'I am not
an optimist,' said an Arab diplomat close to the Washington negotiations. 'I
am not a pessimist. I am a fatalist. When you look around at everything that
has happened in the world in the last few years it is obvious that these
people have to make peace. Everyone else wants them to. It's their fate. And
that's what we need to cling to when the going gets really rough.'

FT  14 SEP 92 / Instability sends Zairean currency into free fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZAIRE'S currency is in free fall as a result of continuing political
instability and economic mismanagement in Africa's second biggest nation.
The nose dive of the zaire reflects the inability of Zaire's feeble central
authority to resuscitate the mineral-rich economy and restore political
stability after army-led looting wrecked Kinshasa and other towns in
September and October last year.
This month alone the zaire has fallen by more than 30 per cent against the
US dollar from Z690,000 to Z1m. The increasingly rapid depreciation of the
zaire followed a move by the Central Bank to inject Z8bn into the system at
the beginning of the month. Exactly 12 months ago the zaire was trading at
Z18,000 to the dollar.
Given the scale of the currency crisis the Bank of Zaire has been constantly
printing bigger-denomination notes and earlier this month was forced to
introduce a Z1m one million zaire note.
At the moment there appears little sign of a recovery and the return of
several thousand western businessmen who fled the violence last year until a
stable political authority is installed. Western donors are also waiting for
guarantees of economic reforms and discipline before restoring aid flows.
A government created in August by a pro-democracy conference and led by Mr
Etienne Tshisekedi, a seasoned opponent of President Mobutu Sese Seko, has
been paralysed. Leaders of the mineral-rich province of Shaba, which tried
to secede from the country during the Katanga crisis of the early 1960s,
have said they will not recognise it.
The new government has promised to call early multi-party elections and
President Mobutu, widely viewed as personally responsible for the chaos of
the country, has said he will stand as a presidential candidate.

FT  14 SEP 92 / 'Iraqi principle' for Africa: UN and aid agencies are under
pressure to develop a new long-term relief strategy in the Horn of Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations and international aid agencies are under pressure to
develop a new long-term relief strategy in the Horn of Africa amid mounting
criticism of relief efforts in Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia.
The highest-level UN team to visit the Horn of Africa, led by Mr Jan
Eliasson, under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs, and Mr James
Grant, executive director of UNICEF, is touring the region. They have been
told that the UN must address the crisis in the Horn in a new way.
'Year in, year out we come back to square one - innocent civilians starving
and at the mercy of evil governments and ruthless rebel leaders who use food
as a political weapon for military ends,' said Mr Abdul Mohamed, an expert
on humanitarian relief in the Horn. 'The whole way the UN does business in
the Horn must now be dramatically revised to search for long-term
solutions.'
The critical issue under review is sovereignty. Relief efforts in Sudan,
Somalia and Ethiopia have traditionally been hampered by the international
aid community's respect for sovereignty, which has allowed dictatorships to
veto and manipulate relief efforts. The Islamic fundamentalist military
regime in Sudan, for example, stopped all relief flights to southern Sudan
in March to strengthen their most successful military offensive against
rebels in the nine-year civil war.
The campaign for a review of sovereignty mounted by African relief experts
has been boosted by the UN-approved intervention in Iraq, Yugoslavia and
Somalia.
'If the UN can say that the humanitarian imperative of saving the lives of
Kurds and Shias in Iraq overrides the claims to sovereignty of President
Saddam Hussein, then why shouldn't that principle be extended to Sudan and
other African countries where governments have lost their moral right to
sovereignty by failing to feed and protect their people?' asks Mr Kosti
Manibe, deputy general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches.
In Somalia the arrival of the first armed UN troops to protect relief
supplies from banditry and looting, expected today, is being heralded by
relief experts as the first extension of the 'Iraqi principle' to Africa.
But the exercise is still constrained by what many observers term the 'old
way of doing business'. First there is the problem of relations with the
warring factions. The UN and non-governmental agencies continue to negotiate
with the warlords on deployment of troops and relief operations. The UN and
NGOs have also, under the authority of the warlords, employed several
thousand gunmen. They say it is necessary for the short-term goal of
distributing food.
Mr Murray Watson, a Somalia specialist, says that by dealing with the
warlords as if they were governments the agencies are legitimising their
position, which will make matters worse in the long term.
'These guys are criminals and butchers and should not be encouraged nor
treated as legitimate authorities,' he says. 'It's a
protection racket and this cycle of criminality has to be broken if relief
is going to reach those in need and if a climate of peace and order is going
to be restored.'
The second big problem is the continuing lack of co-ordination among the
agencies. UN agencies and NGOs continue to squabble among themselves and fly
their own flags. 'If humanitarianism is their objective, rather than
grabbing publicity and boosting their donor appeals, the UN and NGOs should
urgently form a single, coherent relief administration following a single
integrated programme,' says Mr Watson.
Experts also say the agencies have yet to produce a comprehensive assessment
of needs and establish a monitoring system to ensure that relief is actually
getting to those in need and not producing a vicious spiral of food aid
dependency.
Furthermore there still appears to be no strategy for the long-term
rehabilitation and development of Somalia. The re-establishment of the
economy and the institutions of civil society, such as a police force and
judiciary, will require the international supervision of a process of
political dialogue leading to an interim administration. So far this has not
received any serious attention.
'If delivery of emergency aid is not accompanied simultaneously by a
political process the entire effort will go to waste,' says Mr Mohamed.
Similar issues are being argued in southern Sudan. In a paper presented to
the UN team Mr Lam Akol, one of the leading Sudanese rebel officials,
presses for a review of relief efforts.
Mr Akol says the situation is southern Sudan is now worse than it was three
years ago when Mr Grant launched 'Operation Lifeline Sudan'  - an ambitious
relief programme designed to arrange the delivery of food and medicine to
the war-ravaged civilian population.
The operation has been consistently undermined by both the government and
the rebel faction led by Mr John Garang. In the past eight months the
government has banned UN flights to certain towns in an effort to deny food
to rebel supporters. Meanwhile, a UN airlift of food to the besieged
garrison town of Juba, where up to 300,000 people are in critical need of
food, has been halted several times because of rebel threats to shoot down
relief aircraft.
The UN estimates that at best it is able to reach 10-20 per cent of the
southern population displaced by the war and desperately in need of food and
medicine.
In his paper Dr Akol calls the actions of both the government and Mr
Garang's rebel faction 'criminal'. He says observing sovereignty is
'unrealistic'. 'The UN must use to the fullest extent the new strong role it
has acquired since the collapse of the east-west polarisation to enforce the
respect of human rights,' he says.
Among the measures Mr Akol is pressing on the UN is the establishment of an
'exclusion zone' in southern Sudan, blocking government bombing raids and
allowing UN use of force to deliver relief, and involvement in negotiations
to end the civil war.
Many of these issues challenge the UN and NGOs to travel down new roads. But
Africans on the ground say that without a new initiative the world will be
forced to continue feeding the starving next year and the year after.

THE Israeli government faced a chorus of protest over the weekend over its
willingness to exchange occupied territory on the Golan Heights for peace
with Syria as its team of negotiators flew to Washington for the resumption
today of Middle East peace talks.
For the first time since it lost power to the Labour party and its
left-liberal allies in the general election in June, right-wingers, led by
the Likud party of former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, mounted a high
profile demonstration against the new government, massing thousands of
protesters at Ben Gurion airport as the negotiating team departed.
Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria, said he hoped
progress would be made in Washington over the next 10 days on agreeing a
'joint document of principles' with Syria.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, said he wanted hitherto unscheduled
further talks with Syria and the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon in
October, instead of waiting until after the US elections in November.
However, Mr Rabinovitch said progress in the talks was bound to be slow.
'Breakthroughs and also painful concessions are of a sort that they will
come, if they will come, later and not at this point.'
Israel yesterday issued a formal public protest against the decision by US
President George Bush to sell up to 72 F-15 warplanes to Saudi Arabia,
saying it would continue to make its view know 'to those in power and the
public in the United States'.

FT  14 SEP 92 / Third world debt crisis continues, OECD warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and governments may be getting the upper hand over the third world
debt crisis but it has not gone away and poor countries will have to fight
hard to win more funds in coming years, the OECD said today Reuter reports
from Paris.
'The debt problem has certainly not been resolved nor has it at all gone
away in any global sense,' the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) said in its annual aid report.
The Paris-based think-tank for the world's richest countries noted that
while the crisis had eased in Latin America, where most of the main debtors
are, the problems for sub-Saharan Africa had worsened.
Since government lenders were now looking much more closely at issues such
as human rights and democracy when deciding which developing countries to
help, political reforms must continue.
At the same time, the third world will need to persevere with economic
liberalisation to attract private finance, since a big increase in official
aid is unlikely in the near future.
The OECD praised bank and government creditors for reaching landmark deals
with certain developing country debtors. 'There have been clear improvements
in a number of countries, which are now implementing better economic and
structural adjustment policies, assisted by debt agreements. Nevertheless,
the situation remains critical for many others.'
The OECD applauded the debt deals reached with commercial banks by several
Latin American countries  - including Mexico, which set off the third world
debt crisis a decade ago  - saying these had played a part in turning round
their economies. Against that, 'the low and declining volume of private
flows (to sub-Saharan Africa) remains a cause of continued concern.'
The Paris Club of government creditors has helped to bring a solution to the
debt problem closer, notably by offering more favourable rescheduling terms
since December 1991 to countries deemed serious about reforming their
economies.
More important, the OECD said, is the Paris Club's new policy of offering a
deal on a country's total debt stock  - in effect, a promise to write off at
least half of its debt  - on condition that economic adjustment plans are
adhered to.
The OECD estimated total third world debt at the end of 1991 at Dollars
1,480bn (Pounds 751.2bn) up slightly from Dollars 1,440bn in 1990.
Partly as a result of the various debt deals, debt service payments made by
third world countries fell to Dollars 150.9bn in 1991 from Dollars 159.1bn
in 1990.
Funds received by these countries from all sources  - governments, banks,
multilateral agencies, financial markets  - rose to Dollars 137.5bn in 1991
from Dollars 137.2bn in 1990.
The third world thus paid back more than it got from the rich world in 1991,
though the OECD put a rosy gloss on that.
Funding in 1991 was higher than the record level of 1990, it said, adding:
'This situation is particularly heartening in view of the economic and
political situation prevailing in 1991.'
It found little evidence that the countries of central and eastern Europe
and the republics of the former Soviet Union had siphoned off more of the
development funds available.
On the other hand, the transformation of the ex-communist states saw aid
from eastern Europe collapse to about Dollars 1bn in 1991, less than a
quarter of the levels of the late 1980s.
Total lending from non-official sources rose in 1991 to Dollars 55.4bn from
Dollars 52.6bn in 1990, but the OECD said official flows from its member
countries and the multilateral agencies would remain the main source of
third world development funds.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government's decision to lift the ban on political parties
outlawed after the 1980 military coup has thrown up the first serious
challenge to Mr Suleyman Demirel's parliamentary majority, with the revival
of the centre-left Republican People's party (CHP).
Turkey's conservative-led coalition had long hoped the CHP would be quietly
absorbed by the former CHP prime minister Bulent Ecevit and his Democratic
Left, arguably the real inheritor of what is the country's oldest political
party. But the election last Wednesday of the maverick social democrat Mr
Deniz Baykal as CHP leader raises the prospect that up to 20 Social
Democratic Populist (SHP) deputies, now members of the coalition, may leave
to form a new party as a first step to joining the CHP.
Such a move would reduce the coalition's majority to just two seats, a fact
Mr Baykal, a skilful politician, will exploit. Mr Baykal says he will not
seek to bring down the coalition. However, his group could wield
considerable influence over a conservative-led government, which hitherto
has shared few of the CHP's old-fashioned leftist ideals.
Mr Baykal, a 54-year-old lawyer, has three times unsuccessfully challenged
the deputy prime minister, Mr Erdal Inonu, for leadership of the SHP. His
parliamentary group is known to be critical of government policy on a number
of issues, including the Kurds, where Mr Baykal favours lifting the
emergency rule in Turkey's south-east. He is also opposed on nationalist
grounds to extension of the allied air operation over north Iraq to protect
the Kurds.
Over the weekend, party officials said Mr Baykal already had support from
four deputies who represented the CHP before the coup. Mr Baykal can also
expect backing from 16 of the SHP's 70 parliamentary deputies, reducing the
coalition to 228 seats in the 450-seat parliament.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED Nations monitoring of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo yesterday
gave the Bosnian capital a relatively quiet day, Reuter reports.
But the UN commander in the city, General Hussein Ali Abdul Razek, called it
'only one step on a long road to peace'. Elsewhere in the republic the guns
fired on.
Serb forces yesterday fired heavy artillery and mortar shells at Bihac for
the fourth consecutive day in spite of the deadline for the monitoring of
heavy weapons, the town's Moslem defenders said.
UN sources confirmed that Howitzers and tank cannon pounded the outskirts of
the north-west Bosnian town and shells landed in the deserted centre after
sirens sent frightened civilians scurrying for cover. Eyewitnesses heard no
artillery being fired from Moslem positions in Bihac.
Four hours before Saturday's noon deadline, Serb infantry were also said to
have mounted a three-pronged attack on the village of Golubic, just 5km to
the south-east.
'It was a long-planned attack with the aim of taking Bihac,' said Mr Ramiz
Drekovic, commander of the Bosnian Defence Force in one of the last pockets
of territory in western Bosnia still controlled by Moslem forces. 'The Serbs
are given one deadline, then a second and no action is ever taken,' Mr
Drekovic said.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said at the weekend that all his heavy
artillery was now being watched and monitors would be able to confirm that
Serb forces never started firing first. Military sources said UN observers
had visited some weapons sites in the Bihac area but co-operation in some
places depended on the character of the Serbs in charge. Building up trust
was essential, they said.

HANDEL could have handled it. In the idiom of today's entertainers George

But who will fill the starring role now that the 40-year-old, whose birthday

blue-collar battler from Dade City Florida who looks like a grown-up version

denim shorts, a plaid shirt and tousled fair hair? The 22-year-old was a
finalist here 12 months ago and has already claimed this year's Grand Slam
titles in Australia and France to make himself the world No 1.
Or will Pete Sampras, his stylish opponent in this afternoon's semi-final,
become the next object of worship? The 21-year-old from Florida became the
youngest winner of this title in 1990 with a spectacular display of power
tennis that had crushed in succession Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Andre
Agassi. But the shy 19-year-old had not been physically or emotionally ready
to bear the burden of national expectation and had seemed almost relieved
when Courier removed his crown last year at the quarter-final stage. 'At
last the monkey is off my back', he had said.
That was the only occasion in six previous meetings that Courier's
awkward-looking topspin game has prevailed against the smooth-stroking
Sampras. Courier's is a physically demanding game and ever since his second
French win last June, he has looked emotionally drained, unable to commit
himself fully to the punishing training sessions that have brought him his
success. Here, for the first time in three months, Courier has looked as if
he is enjoying his tennis again. He can thank his coach Brad Stine and his
tactical adviser, the former Spanish No. 1 Jose Higueras, for his renewed
zest.
Sampras now looks more like the champion we all thought he would become. He
has filled out to become a formidable figure physically and hits those
crisp, flat drives and pounding serves with much more consistency. He came
here with victories over Boris Becker, Courier, Stefan Edberg and Lendl that
brought him the recent titles in Cincinnati and Indianapolis and has now won
his last 15 matches. You cannot buy the sort of confidence that such
successes bring and Courier's objective will be to dent it early in their
encounter today.
But wait a minute. What about the other young American in action today?
Perhaps it will be the diminutive Michael Chang who will inherit the
Connors' mantle. Certainly no-one will question the 20-year-old's courage.
Standing only 5 ft 8 in and weighing a mere 145lbs Chang is a dwarf in a
land of giants. But he compensates for his size by taking the ball on the
rise to use his opponent's pace and covers the court with electrifying pace.
His fighting qualities have never been in question, ever since he won the
French Open so dramatically at the age of 17 in 1989. He has been outgunned
in his last two matches here this year against fellow American MaliVai
Washington and the improving South African Wayne Ferreira but in each match
he found a way to turn things his way in the fifth set.
The quarter-final against Ferreira had been scheduled as Thursday's night
match but because of the storm that hit New York early in the afternoon it
was moved to the Grandstand Court just before 6pm. This was necessary so
that Stefan Edberg's match against Ivan Lendl could follow the interrupted
doubles semi-final on the Stadium Court in which Jim Grabb and Richey
Reneberg eventually gained revenge 3-6 7-5 7-6 4-6 6-2 against John McEnroe
and Michael Stich for their defeat in the Wimbledon final.
The Chang v Ferreira battle was a marvellous affair, full of spectacular
forehands and expensive losers from the South African (he committed 104
unforced errors altogether), whose thigh injury at the start of the fourth
set was bravely ignored as he won the tie-break that levelled the match. In
the closing stages, however, Chang realised that his opponent's movement was
slightly impaired and he maintained his consistency to win 7-5 2-6 6-3 7-6
6-1 after four hours and 17 minutes of great entertainment. Thus, for only
the second time in his career, Chang would play in the semi-finals of a
Grand Slam Championship. You can be sure he will give a good account of
himself.
'It is important for me not to go into the next match satisfied. I have to
keep my head down, keep working at it give myself the best chance to win
this tournament' he said.
Edberg, the title-holder, took three attempts to finish his business against
the three-time former champion Lendl. Just after midnight, with three hours
of actual play behind them, spread over two sessions that were interrupted
for 50 minutes, the rain returned with Edberg leading 6-3 6-3 3-6 5-7 2-1.
He will not have slept easily, but back on court, the defending champion
took 59 minutes to win the final set tie break 7-6 for victory.
Lendl, a newly naturalised American, drew inspiration from the fervent
support of the crowd to produce some of his finest serves as well as two
crucial volleys. Another match point was saved with a virtual ace and the
despondent Swede then surrendered his own serve and watched helplessly as
Lendl won the set.
So will it be Courier, Sampras or Chang - or will all three have to give
best to a foreign-born adversary? If one of the young Americans does bring
home the Championship you can be sure that 20,000 voices will be ready to
join together in a rendering of 'Hallelujah II'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Sport: Lord Shelburne's elegant answer - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Shelburne was worried. The noble brow was furrowed. His family had
owned Bowood House and farmed it successfully for nearly 300 years, but now
the yield from a parcel of land laid out to arable farming was appalling.
Profits were plummeting faster than ripened apples.
He looked at the figures for 1985-86. There would be a profit of Pounds
7,000 on a turnover of Pounds 1.2m. 'It was as clear as can be that if we
continued like that we'd had it,' he says.
Something had to be done with the unprofitable 1,500 acres on the estate
near Calne in Wiltshire. Several suggestions were made; the one that was
followed was to build a golf course. Golf courses were in vogue.
At first, the proposal was as grand as the house itself, where Joseph
Priestley discovered oxygen in 1774. It has rooms designed by Robert Adam,
and grounds laid out by Capability Brown. There would be an hotel, a country
club, a championship golf course. Nothing but the best would do.
The Savoy Group was coming in as a partner to run a 120-bedroom hotel.
Planning permission was granted. A sum of Pounds 8m would be raised by
debentures to cover the total cost of the project, which included a 40,000
sq ft clubhouse built on American country club lines with swimming pool and
tennis courts.
Now came the first stroke of luck for Bowood. The hotel group pulled out of
the venture. On the other hand, the project was going ahead and the golf
course, designed by Dave Thomas, was untouched.
The Gulf War is not a pleasant memory for many people, but it has its appeal
for Lord Shelburne. By October 1990 he realised his scheme was still too
grand. The sale of debentures was not going well, not only because of the
Middle East crisis but in part because a new golf club at Castle Combe
barely 10 miles away was competing for the same sort of rich investors. He
cancelled the debenture scheme altogether. 'I was depressed,' he says. 'I
had now made two changes in five years. I began to wonder whether I was ever
going to get this off the ground.'
Other changes were made. The clubhouse was scaled down from 40,000 sq ft to
12,000 sq ft. Instead of being a purpose-built project, it was decided to
convert an old farm and its associated out buildings. Most significant, it
was also decided to make Bowood a pay-as-you-play course, with a small
number of memberships available, what the Americans call a semi-private
club.
It was a case of third time lucky. There were no further hitches. Bowood
Golf &amp; Country Club, laid out on 200 acres in the western corner of the
park, opened this summer. It has 200 of its desired 250 members. It is
averaging 50 rounds each day; during the summer, an average of 1,500 rounds
each month were played.
The course is long and testing, quite capable of staging a championship. It
sprawls comfortably within its distinguished surroundings and is pleasing to
the eye, although I find the lake on the side of the 4th an eyesore. In
addition to the course, there are three practice holes, known as the
Academy, where Nigel Blenkarne and his assistant professional do most of
their teaching, and a driving range.
The conversion of the old farm buildings into a clubhouse that looks like a
large Cotswold house with outbuildings has been achieved with taste. Exposed
beams are everywhere. The men's locker room, which is too small, is in a
building erected in the mid-18th century. Corridors are floored with
200-year-old flagstones. The shop and office for the professional have been
converted from a barn, which also contains a self-service restaurant. The
driving range is made out of cedar, the wood coming from an elderly and
extremely large tree that was blown down in the storm of 1989.
The surprises at Bowood do not end there. Golf clubs, being dominated by
men, are almost always managed by men, often retired service types. Bowood
is managed by a sparky woman who once sold non-ferrous metals and later ran
two engineering businesses.
Sally-Jane Coode, currently a regional business woman of the year, was
appointed chief executive in April 1991. If her appointment was a surprise
to everyone else, it was not to Lord Shelburne.
'It is all new to her and new to me but she had a proven track record,' he
said. 'Running any business has a structure. So long as you learn and listen
and get the structure right one business is very similar to another.'
With the welcome briskness of one who is not bound by tradition, Coode has
swept aside some typical golf club shibboleths. Men and women are treated
exactly the same - same rates, same rights.
She has no truck with pompous signs for the captain, lady captain and so on
in the car park. Her feminine touch ensures the visitor receives a warm
welcome. There is no joining fee. Dress in the dining room, so often a
thorny problem, is relaxed. 'Men spend all week wearing a jacket and tie. I
see no reason to make them dress the same way at the week-end.' She has even
met and defeated the greatest challenge of all - that of maintaining the
quality and quantity of soap in the men's changing room.
Bowood is a young venture and it has cost a lot of money. Buildings had to
be dismantled, sheep and cattle replaced, existing buildings converted. The
course cost nearly Pounds 2m and consultancy fees from the start were
considerable. In all, the venture cost nearly Pounds 6m.
To my mind it is an object lesson in the way to build golf courses in the
1990s. Apart from anything else, it represents good value for money. You can
pay Pounds 500 annually and Pounds 10 for each round or Pounds 875 annually,
for which you become a card holder or a member by any other name. It
deserves to succeed.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Motoring: The cheap new Bentley: just Pounds 91,000 - Stuart
Marshall enjoys a brief taste of the Brooklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU COULD, I suppose, describe the new Brooklands saloon as Bentley's entry
model; an upper-crust equivalent of a Vauxhall Cavalier or Ford Sierra L.
And, compared with the Pounds 168,294 tag on the Bentley Continental R, the
Pounds 91,489 list price of the Brooklands is quite modest, even though it
is more than Pounds 6,000 dearer than the Bentley Eight it replaces.
Rolls-Royce Motors, which makes Bentleys, believes the Pounds 91k price will
not frighten off the punters. It says the Brooklands is 'squarely targeted
to appeal to luxury car buyers who may not have considered purchasing a new
Bentley before.'
If they are tempted, and the money is available, what will they get?
Probably the best combination of refinement, performance and value
Rolls-Royce Motors has offered.
In the past, I have criticised Rolls-Royces for their soggy handling, and
the firmer-sprung Bentleys for their tyre thump on less-than-perfect roads.
I take none of it back. But a brief drive of the Brooklands suggested that
the newly-developed suspension damping, controlled by micro-computer, has
achieved the best of both worlds. The big car rides silently and
shock-absorbently but drives with a new and rewarding crispness.
Of course, covering only a few miles in rural Surrey and Hampshire, with
four people taking turns at the wheel, is a taste, not a test. Even so, I
reckon its handling and roadholding would satisfy many a well-heeled
business motorist who previously has driven only Jaguar, BMW 7-Series or
Mercedes-Benz S-Class saloons.
No one, though, would seriously consider buying a Bentley Brooklands just
because it goes and handles well. Its appeal is more subtle. The hand-built
interior, trimmed (and perfumed) by Connolly hide, Wilton-carpeted and
decorated liberally with flawless wood veneer, is what sets it apart even
from the cream of volume-produced motor cars.
The Brooklands, named after the famous old circuit on which cars raced for
the last time in 1939, looks much better from the front than the Bentley
Eight. It has a vertically slatted radiator grille, not one looking as if it
were made from silver-plated wire netting.
Bentley aficionados (although probably no one else) will notice the
Brooklands has a seamless bonnet instead of one with an apparent hinge down
the middle. The selector for the four-speed automatic transmission  - bought
from General Motors in the US but with Bentley's own control system and as
smooth as you would expect - is on the centre console, not the steering
column.
The 15-inch alloy wheels, shod with sensibly proportioned 70 series Avon
tyres that make their own contribution to the Bentley's nimbleness, are also
new. Otherwise, nothing really has changed. The engine remains a 6.75-litre
V8 of undisclosed output; the detailing, as always, is as good as
painstaking craftsmen can make it; and the car is still a heavyweight at
2.35 tonnes.
Rolls-Royce Motors can never hope to match the sheer technology of producers
like Daimler-Benz with Pounds 1m a day research and development budgets. It
does, though, take small but continuous steps in product improvement. They
show in the Brooklands, which is a significantly better car to drive than
the Eight.
Bentley (and Rolls-Royce) brand loyalty must be the envy of many lesser
marques; eight in 10 owners expect to buy another. 'We shall have to work on
the other 20 per cent,' says Michael Donovan, the managing director
(commercial). There are some signs of growth in the luxury car market and he
says it has benefited from the appearance of 'powerful new entries at the
bottom of the sector from Japan' as well as 'moves up-market by other mass
producers such as Mercedes.'
Rolls-Royce, which makes more Bentleys than Rolls-Royces, delivered 160 cars
in Britain last month (including 21 Continental R coupes worth Pounds 3.5m
retail) against 138 last year. While the Brooklands - which replaces the
Mulsanne S as well as the Eight - might not overtake the Pounds 116,265
Turbo R as the marque's best seller, I would put my money on it as
runner-up.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Cookery: What's good for the goose - Seasonal accompaniments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST December, I received a parcel by special overnight delivery from
Worcestershire. Opening it was as much fun as unwrapping a Christmas
present. Inside was a neatly trussed bird from Goodman's Geese, nestling
under folds of waxed paper between fragrant layers of rosemary and sage -
fistfuls of them, not a few puny sprigs.
Rarely has meat looked more appetising. The skin of the bird was not clammy
but dry, not sickly white but pale honey, sure signs of a healthy outdoor
life ranging free in grassy pastures, guzzling corn and pecking at straw.
And alongside the bird were two little boxes, one containing the giblets,
the other filled with solid wodges of rich and delicious goose fat.
The proof is, of course, in the eating. This bird tasted every bit as good
as it looked. Killed in its prime and hung properly it was rich, firm,
gamey, and exactly as Christmas goose should be, nicely matured after
feasting on grain and having put on its 'liberty vest,' a little layer of
fat between skin and flesh to protect against winter chills.
Slightly younger goose, the autumn bird which is said by some to be goose at
its peak, is flavoured a little more delicately. It is less gamey and the
meat is juicier. This so-called Michaelmas goose, once even more popular
than Christmas goose, was the bird that many tenant farmers traditionally
presented to the landlord when paying their quarterly rent in the hope that
they could perhaps dissuade him from increasing it.
I have never eaten Michaelmas goose but I will this year: the memory of last
Christmas's goose has convinced me that this is a bird worth feasting on
more than once a year, and I like the idea of tasting it at different
stages.
Judy Goodman, of Goodman's Geese, has been at the forefront of the
resurgence of interest in geese, a vital fighting force in reinstating goose
on our Christmas menus. Having achieved a good level of Christmas sales, she
now aims to put Michaelmas goose back on the culinary calendar as well.
This year is her 10th growing geese. She began in 1982 after a
gastronomically sad Christmas (in other words, one without goose on the
menu), by growing just a few birds for family and friends. This year,
Goodman's Geese will grace 2,000 tables.
Judy Goodman is the most practical, down-to-earth and business-like farmer
you could hope to meet, a homely, middle-aged woman fairly fizzing with
energy, good humour and marketing ideas.
She admits to a surge of pride at the sight of her geese in the food halls
of Harrods and the Army &amp; Navy stores, and in top-notch butchers such as
Millhouse of Clifton in Bristol; and she rejoices in a gratifying ratio of
repeat purchases and standing orders among personal customers who buy at her
farm gate or by overnight delivery.
The date of Michaelmas seems to be a moveable feast, so why not choose
whatever suits you. September 29 (or the Saturday after) is popular in many
areas; October 11 remains traditional in Norfolk; while the goose-eating
autumn feast in northern Europe is celebrated on Martinmas, November 11. Or
perhaps Hallowe'en or bonfire night commends itself to you.
Given that goose has different eating qualities at different stages of the
season, I like the idea of varying the accompaniments accordingly. Early
autumnal fruits would seem the most appropriate choice for goose in
September - and nothing is flourishing more furiously this September than
plums.
So, I shall probably serve my Michaelmas roast goose at the end of the month
with sloe and apple jelly or perhaps a compote of prunes - the smallest and
bitterest of the plum family, or the largest and sweetest.
The other thought that appeals to me is making a goose-neck pudding. I have
sometimes considered doing so at Christmas but there never seems to be
enough time then. Michaelmas, minus the same pressures, seems a good
opportunity to have a go.
When I mentioned this to Goodman last week she agreed, obligingly, to supply
the goose I was ordering with the whole goose neck in one piece and still
encased in its skin. (It is said to be best to delay stripping the skin from
the neck until you are ready to use it.)
She also expressed willingness to supply Weekend FT readers with whole goose
necks in the same way if so requested - providing she is given good notice
and the orders are for geese to be sent by overnight delivery in September,
October or November. In December she is, unsurprisingly, too busy to prepare
necks in this way.
SLOE AND APPLE JELLY 2 1/4 -2 1/2 lb sloes depending on how plump and juicy
they are;  3/4 lb crab or cooking apples (windfalls will do providing soft
spots are cut out before weighing); granulated sugar; a few bay leaves.
The traditional thing is to delay picking sloes until after a frost, or to
prick them with a silver fork. Modern cooks simply freeze the fruit briefly:
the skins will split as they thaw and so encourage the release of the
juices.
Put the sloes into a pan together with the chopped apples, a couple of bay
leaves and just enough water to cover. Simmer gently until fruit is very
soft. Tip the contents of the pan into a jelly bag suspended over a bowl and
leave to drip overnight.
Measure the juices and reheat them gently, adding warmed sugar at the rate
of 1 1/2 lb per 1pt of juice. When the sugar has melted, fast-boil until
setting point is reached. Pot in small jars adding a bay leaf to each one.
COMPOTE OF PRUNES
When fresh chestnuts are available a little later in the year, 1 lb of them,
roasted and peeled, make a splended addition to this compote - but do not
mix them in until ready to serve.
14 oz large prunes; 1 pt tea (Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong for preference);
2 star anise; 3 allspice berries; 2 cinnamon sticks; 5 cloves; curls of peel
shaved from an orange; 5 tablespoons of rum or armagnac.
Bruise the spices. Put them into a pan with the tea and bring to a simmer.
Away from the heat, add the prunes, orange peel and spirits. Stir well and
push the fruit well down into the liquid. Cover tightly and leave in a cold
larder for 48-72 hours, stirring occasionally if passing.
When the goose is roasting, strain the prunes, discard the spices and bring
the prune liquor to boiling point. Boil for one minute. Pour the scalding
liquor over the prunes, cover and place in the plate warmer so the fruit is
gently and thoroughly warmed through by the time the compote is served.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Drink: A vodka or two in Tbilisi - Nicholas Woodsworth falls
victim to Georgian hospitality - and wonders how they manage to live so long
when they drink so much vodka and eat so much spicy food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES are as hard for cooks as they are for everyone else these days in the
former Soviet empire, and it is not always easy to get something to eat. So
when I found a small restaurant on Pushkin Avenue, in the Georgian capital
of Tbilisi, actually open and serving food, I went in and sat down
gratefully.
It was not much of a place; just a few tables covered with plastic
tablecloths and laid with bent and tinny cutlery. A fluorescent tube
flickered on the low ceiling and a cold draught blew in under the door. In a
kitchen behind a self-service counter, greasy pots sat on a sauce-spattered
cooker. It was not the world's most cheerful establishment.
It was much more cheerful, though, than the world that lay immediately
around it. Just outside the door, soldiers of the Georgian National Guard
patrolled the streets, Kalashnikovs cradled on their chests. Store-front
windows were smashed, buildings were pock-marked with bullets, and many
shops and offices were closed.
Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union, Georgians had been swept
up in a spiral of economic chaos and political violence. Arriving in a lull
between bloody demonstrations, and street battles, I found little sense of
pleasure or relaxation in Tbilisi.
Great was my surprise, then, when I noticed a party of five elderly Georgian
men celebrating in a small alcove at the back of the restaurant. None
appeared to be under 80. Dressed in baggy suits and flat caps, their
stubbly, unshaven faces flushed with drink and emotion, they were carrying
on as if in advanced warm-up for a bacchanalian orgy.
In front of them lay a table scattered liberally with the remains of grand
over-indulgence: kebab skewers, chicken bones, empty cigarette packets,
scraps of food, the gnawed stems of pickled peppers, bowls of spicy sauces
and condiments, a dozen empty pots and serving dishes, and countless wine
and brandy bottles. The feast had been a large and protracted one.
The main meal over, the party had turned its attentions to drink, and was
well along its way to inebriation. There were long, loquacious and emotional
speeches, whiskery kisses and bear-hugs of comradeship, and many, many
up-endings of tumblers brimful of brandy. By the time I had finished eating
and was getting ready to leave, the old gents were preparing their voices
for a round of five-part Georgian counterpoint. As far as they were
concerned, it seemed, the world had never been a more convivial place. The
incident so impressed me that it was the first query I put to Nino, my
Georgian guide, as we rattled out of Tbilisi on our way to a tour of the
high Caucasus mountains.
Nino laughed. Such a thing, she said, was not so strange as it might seem.
'We Georgians have a reputation for good living. For us, friendship,
generosity and hospitality are the most important things in life. We love to
get together, to talk, to sing, to eat and to drink; probably a little too
much, sometimes.'
That was all very well, I replied, but even the most enthusiastic of bon
vivants tend to find tear gas and riot truncheons something of a damper to
any celebration. But, once again, Nino found little out of the ordinary in
this.
'What you saw last night,' she said, 'was not so much celebration as
commiseration. Georgia has been a land of violence and suffering through
much of its 3,000-year history. In the past 1,500 years alone, Tbilisi has
been invaded and sacked 29 times.'
'When we get together to eat, it is often to share not just food but our
suffering. When we toast each other over brandy, it is not in congratulation
but to ask for peace, security, fraternity and all the other things we need
so much and rarely have. Tbilisi is a sad place right now. I hope we will
have a chance to see Georgians when they are really happy.'
And so, a little while later, we did. What Nino did not mention, but what I
was soon to find out in the mountain village of Ushguli, was that the
Georgian code of hospitality extends not only to friends and family but to
complete strangers as well.
The inhabitants of the isolated villages of the Caucasus may no longer
believe, as once they did, that guests come from God, but they continue
nonetheless to reserve a heavenly welcome for them. Nowhere is Georgian
hospitality demonstrated more effusively than at the dinner table.
Protected behind a high wall of mountains, Georgians are something of an
anomaly among the many peoples of the former Soviet Union. Gregarious,
emotional, sensual, jealous of their traditions and and ferociously proud of
their fertile land, they have far more in common with the Mediterraneans
than their cousins to the frozen north. As in character, so in food. Ask any
Russian in Moscow where you can get the richest, most lavish meal in town
and chances are that he will point you to one of the capital's
highly-popular Georgian restaurants.
While much of Russia's daily cooking revolves around cabbages, beets,
potatoes and turnips, that of Georgia, taking advantage of productive soil
and a warm climate, is a far more exotic affair. Italians, Turks, Greeks,
Moroccans and Frenchmen might all be excused for finding elements of their
own cuisine in the area's rich fare.
Georgian cooking is, however, unique. Georgians are great meat-eaters but
their classic dishes, based on lamb, pork and chicken, are enlivened by
additions of great variety and contrast. Georgians are not afraid to combine
many different tastes in one individual dish. Take, for example, the popular
dish pkhali - minced spinach mixed with ground walnut paste, vinegar, garlic
and spices, the whole topped with tart pomegranate seeds. The result,
incongruous as it might seem, is delicious.
Nor do Georgians shirk from serving highly different dishes at the same
table at the same time. Ground hazelnut stuffings; delicate spicings of
basil, coriander or tarragon; meat dishes set off by pomegranates and plums;
fiery sauces of chilli peppers and garlic; cooling preparations of yoghurt
and mint; mille feuille pastries dripping with honey - typically, all will
be found at one time at the same Georgian meal.
Individual courses, in fact, have no place in Georgia. What is crucial - an
expression of the Georgian exuberance for abundance, generosity and sharing
 -is that the table is covered from one end to the other.
Loaded with serving bowls, platters, tureens, heaped plates, bottles of all
descriptions and glasses that are never empty, it must creak with the sheer
weight of food and drink.
More than 7,000 ft high in the mountains and a 14-hour, spine-rattling Jeep
ride from Tbilisi, Ushguli largely is cut off from the rest of the world
and, on the whole, remains as self-sufficient in food as it does in
everything else.
Snowed-in for most of the year, and with only the shortest of summer growing
seasons, the village cares as little for such normal Georgian delicacies as
stuffed baby aubergines as it does for communist theories of collective
production; neither has much role in this rude and demanding climate where
families rely on their own efforts to survive. What counts instead in these
high mountain valleys, and has counted since the bovine religious cults of
pre-Christian times, is cattle breeding and the products that come from it.
Stocky cattle farmer Kolia Nijaradze did not slaughter an entire cow when we
pitched up, tired and hungry, in Ushguli; such an operation is reserved for
special festivals and involves the whole community. But visits to Ushguli
are rare, and guests honoured there. Shortly after we were taken into the
warm kitchen of Kolia's solid, stone-built house, his daughter disappeared
out the back door with a long knife and a large tub of boiling water.
The terrific, high-pitched squealing that broke out a minute later ended in
a sudden, ominous silence; before long, a good-sized baby pig, its skin
scalded of bristles and its throat sewn-up neatly with thread, was baking in
a cast-iron stove that was stoked until it glowed red.
Suckling pig, wild mushrooms fried with mountain herbs; a fresh,
mint-sprinkled, mozzarella-like cheese swimming in a bowl of warm milk;
various pork organs simmering in a hot pepper stew; newly-baked bread with
yet more cheese cooked and melted inside - this is only some of the fare
that appeared on the table when, along with Kolia's brothers, cousins,
father, uncle and friends, we sat down to dine.
I remember discussing mountain trout-fishing with Kolia's cousin, and wild
goat-hunting with his father. But at this point my recollection of the
conversation, and the meal itself, grows somewhat hazy.
By the time the second bottle of vodka had been opened and we had toasted St
George, patron saint of both Georgia and England, I was feeling elated and
ready to give up life in the West, marry Kolia's red-cheeked daughter, and
settle down in Ushguli.
After we had finished the fourth bottle and elaborated numerous toasts to
international friendship, I realised what I was up against - not only
eaters, but also drinkers of epic stature. A permanent life in Ushguli, I
saw, might prove strenuous.
Some time after the fifth bottle of vodka, when we had moved on to toasting
our genes and future generations and were beginning to limber-up our voices
for a little counterpoint, I had to admit I was no match for the Georgians,
and conceded.
Stumbling upstairs and falling into bed, I found myself thinking of the five
lusty octogenarians singing in that little Tbilisi restaurant. How, if this
was the kind of life they had led one decade after another, had those
elderly gentlemen survived so long? Was it possible to over-eat, over-drink
and over-smoke oneself into vigorous old age?
The secrets of Georgian longevity have yet to be revealed, and more
investigation is needed. But given the boundless nature of Georgian
hospitality and the pleasures of the table there, there can be no lack of
researchers. Having barely recovered from my first bout of inquiries, I
drifted off in happy contemplation of further intensive study just a short
night and a sunrise away.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Drink: A wee, fruity dram - The delights of the Jura
distillery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BREAKFAST at the Jura hotel is nothing special but I enjoyed the tea, which
tasted of peat. While I ate, my mind turned to the nearby whiskies of Islay,
in the Inner Hebrides. Often, these are characterised by their peaty
flavour. Many assume - quite wrongly as it turns out - that the taste must
be caused by the same water that was having so much effect on my tea. A
pungent, peaty malt is something whisky drinkers love or loathe, and it is
associated traditionally with Islay, Jura's neighbouring island across the
sound to the south.
Oddly enough, however, when you call for a dram at the hotel bar, or saunter
across the narrow road which separates the hotel from the Invergordon
distillery and sit down for a drink with Willie Tait, the manager, you
discover that the Jura malt has no noticeable peaty taste. Peat flavour
comes from the smoke drying of the malt. You have to want the whisky to
taste of peat and Tait and Trevor Cowan, Invergordon's chief blender, are
adamant they do not.
Inside the largely modern distillery, Tait will point out his tall, copper
stills. These, he tells you, are there to give elegance to the whisky. A
squat, dumpy still would give more flavour, perhaps, but it might end up by
making the whisky coarse.
Opinions vary considerably on why the flavours of whiskies differ so greatly
when the techniques and materials used to make them are so often the same.
Many distillers will point to the stills as the origin of style; all of them
stress the water, too. It is the presence of trace elements in the mountain
streams which imparts the character to so many different malts.
Something also must come from the sea. The Jura distillery is on the strand
in Craighouse, the island's answer to a metropolis. Whisky loses about 2 per
cent of its volume in cask each year. The air that replaces the liquid is
impregnated with sea smells. There are even traces of iodine in the spring
water which runs down into Craighouse from up near the Paps of Jura.
But Jura is a well-mannered malt. The basic 10-year-old in its double
bass-shaped bottle has just a touch of iodine overlaying its fruity, nutty
character. A real treat is the 26-year-old, which is released under the
Stillman's Dram label. Only 1,800 bottles were made of this delicate, almost
floral whisky with a slight whiff of crystallised fruit on the nose. It is
one over which you can pore for hours, exploring its varied nuances.
Moreover, all the flavour is derived from the whisky: very little sherry
wood is used here.
Across the Jura sound, Bruichladdich also is part of the Invergordon group.
From an architectural view, it is rather more exciting than Jura; its
whitewashed distillery buildings are substantially as they were built in
1881. Another surprise is to find many of the old machines still in use.
The malt continues to be ground in what looks like the original grist mill,
while the distillery floors are supported by cast iron Doric columns and the
wort is made in a mash tun dated 1881. Out in the courtyard, there are
warehouses with earth floors. Their absorbency is meant to make a
considerable difference to the ageing of the spirit.
Bruichladdich is run by Ian Allen, a quiet man in comparison with the
waspish Tait. As his distillery is situated on Islay, you might be excused
for thinking it is part of the Laphroaig or Lagavulin school which have
between 40-45 parts per million of peat. But you would be wrong: Invergordon
maintains the same peating policy at Bruichladdich as it does at Jura: two
parts per million.
Proof of this came with the wonderful 21-year-old Bruichladdich, one of the
fruitiest whiskies I have tasted. It is a flavour which deserves to be known
better, being in stark contrast to the wilder character of the more
widely-distributed Islay malts. Many would find the Bruichladdich style far
more their cup of tea.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Top Tory may be invited to TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, or even Mr John Major, the
prime minister, may be the central attraction at next year's Trades Union
Congress in Brighton.
Yesterday, as this year's congress closed, several union leaders were
floating the idea of inviting a senior cabinet minister next year. The most
memorable moment of this year's congress came when Mr Howard Davies became
the first director-general of the Confederation of British Industry to
address the TUC.
A controversial invitation would stave off the growing public indifference
towards the annual congress and serve to underline the unions' increasing
independence from the Labour party.
Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, welcomed the idea of
inviting a senior member of the government.
The two events that had attracted the most positive attention for the TUC in
recent years were the address in 1988 by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, and that by Mr Da-vies this year, he said.
'It would have many advantages,' Mr Edmonds said. 'We are confident of our
own ideas and values and I don't feel threatened by hearing contrary views.'
Mr Tony Young, leader of the NCU communications union, said an address by a
cabinet minister was a good idea. Governments and unions should have more
dialogue, he added.
The AEEU craft union is already planning to invite Mrs Shephard to address
its executive later this year, but Mr Gavin Laird, the union's general
secretary, said that such an invitation to the TUC might be a 'step too
far'.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Nupe, the public-services union, struck a
cautious note. 'I would like to see more change in the government's position
on trade unions before giving it more serious consideration,' he said.
Mrs Shephard might find an invitation to the TUC hard to resist. Although
she is pressing ahead this autumn with another round of tough legislation -
inherited from her hardline predecessor Mr Michael Howard - she has also
announced that the 'war' with the unions is at an end.

A FINANCIAL crisis in a grant-maintained school in Dorset has led to the
suspension of the head teacher and the redundancy of seven teachers.
Woodroffe School, Lyme Regis, has a deficit of more than Pounds 80,000,
forcing the governors to suspend the head teacher last week after a vote of
no confidence by the staff and an audit.
Grant-maintained schools are not allowed to run deficits, and the Department
of Education has the power to close them. Woodroffe, an 850-pupil
comprehensive, opted out a year ago.

came to the end of an era yesterday with the announcement of its sale to
Barder and Marsh, another Lloyd's agency, Andrew Jack writes.
An official said Mr Outhwaite's 'personal support in the market was not

The sale includes Lloyd's syndicates 317, 1047 and 1081 for the 1993 and
later years of account, as well as the Outhwaite Members' Agency. The
present chief executive will not move with the business.
Mr Outhwaite will continue to administer the run-off of the existing

<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of qualified science and engineering graduates including hundreds
with first-class degrees are unable to secure state funding for postgraduate
work in the coming academic year.
According to this week's Times Higher Education Supplement, more than 8,000
applications have been lodged for 5,000 studentships offered by the Science
and Engineering Research Council (SERC).
More than 400 students with first-class degrees will not secure SERC
funding.
The Natural Environment Research Council will be able to fund only 5,000 of
7,800 applicants.
Applications for taught master's courses and research programmes have
increased significantly this year. It is more than a reflection of the
recession, as the proportion of graduates remaining at university to take
higher degrees has been rising steadily in recent years. University
statistics released this week indicate that more than a quarter of the
graduates from older universities are staying on to undertake further
research.
State funding for taught courses and research studentships has remained
broadly static, however.

FT  12 SEP 92 / PM's pragmatism hardens into conviction: Government worth
pegged to that of sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS time to take much more seriously Mr John Major's commitment to the
value of the pound. It can no longer be dismissed as the ritual pledge of a
prime minister in the heat of battle with speculators on foreign exchange
markets. Instead, it marks the return of conviction politics.
When Mr Major declared this week that he would not devalue sterling, he
meant it. He staked the political authority of his government on his
capacity to stick to the pledge.
He may yet be overwhelmed by the financial markets. If the French vote No to
the Maastricht treaty on September 20, it may be that no amount of central
bank intervention can protect weaker currencies in the exchange rate
mechanism. Nor might higher interest rates be enough to hold sterling's
value against the D-Mark.
Even if France backs the treaty on European union, it is far from clear that
the markets will be tamed. As long as the recession persists and the Tory
party retains a penchant for self-inflicted wounds, the doubts in the
currency markets about Mr Major's resolve will remain.
Talk to enough Whitehall mandarins and it is not difficult to find
experienced hands who laud the prime minister's intentions but mutter darkly
that the policy may be doomed. Talk to enough ministers and there are
reminders of the cardinal rule that everything must bend to political
reality.
It is much harder to find any doubt over Mr Major's determination. He is as
adamant in private as in public that he will not bend - he will defeat
inflation and the ERM will provide the framework to do it.
It is partly personal. It was Mr Major who, as chancellor, persuaded the
then Mrs Margaret Thatcher to lift the veto on ERM membership that had led
Mr Nigel Lawson to storm out of her cabinet. It took Mr Major nine months to
win her round. He rightly regarded it as a triumph. Two years on, he is not
willing to devalue that along with the pound.
However, Mr Major is also a pragmatic politician. He outflanked more
experienced rivals in the leadership race by persuading those from the right
and the left of his party that he was One of Them. In Downing Street, he has
displayed the same mastery of the politically possible.
But inflation is an issue on which pragmatism has hardened into conviction.
Long before he entered No 10, Mr Major blamed Britain's long-term economic
decline on its poor inflation performance. The destruction wrought by the
inflationary boom of 1988 confirmed his judgment.
He believes inflation is as destructive socially as it is economically. It
wrecks business profits and investment, impoverishes those on fixed incomes
and - crucially for a politician with Mr Major's humble background - those
struggling to climb the economic ladder by building up their savings.
So if the now Lady Thatcher saw her mission in politics as the defeat of
socialism, Mr Major is bidding for a place in history as the prime minister
who tamed inflation.
He is aware of parallels drawn with predecessors who forfeited authority in
attempts to resist the markets. The most common comparison is with the then
Mr Harold Wilson, whose government was torn apart by the devaluation of
1967.
The lesson Mr Major draws, though, is not that Mr Wilson was unwise to take
on the speculators - rather that subsequent events demonstrated it was
impossible to steal a competitive edge through devaluation.
Some in Whitehall have been urging Mr Major to leave an escape hatch: to
keep open the option of covert devaluation in a general ERM realignment and
to put some distance between himself and Mr Norman Lamont. This week Mr
Major did the opposite. He dismissed realignment and deliberately praised
his chancellor.
He is not a masochist. He will do all he can to defend the pound without
raising interest rates. Next month's Conservative party conference already
promises to be rough. The prime minister does not want to court open
rebellion.
Now there is no going back. If the pressures intensify, Mr Major will be
forced to raise borrowing costs or abandon the political authority won only
five months ago in the general election.
Mr Major denies that the economy will remain mired in recession so long as
sterling is tied to its present rate against the D-Mark. He acknowledges
that recovery will be slow but insists it will come. If he rides out the
storm, his authority will be unassailable. If he loses to the speculators,
it will be shredded. But then, conviction politics always were a gamble.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Nalgo workers resume strike after court victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS at Newham Council in London went back on strike yesterday after
their union won its appeal against a High Court order to call off the
industrial action.
The legal move was the first by a Labour-led council against a trade union
using Conservative employment laws. The High Court's order, made earlier
this month, would if upheld have had important implications for what a trade
union could do before a ballot on industrial action.
Mrs Justice Ebsworth, in granting Newham Council an injunction against the
union, said it was 'clearly arguable' that the union promoted the strike
call before the ballot and was in breach of Section 7(3) of the Employment
Act 1990.
The act says there must be no call for or authorisation of action before a
ballot.
Nalgo, the public-services union, had promoted localised strikes against
compulsory redundancies before balloting its whole membership.
Nalgo said the judgment meant that unions would be prevented from balloting
on whether to escalate action during the course of a dispute - an outcome it
said that parliament could never have intended when drafting the act.
Three Court of Appeal judges set aside Mrs Justice Ebsworth's provisional
ruling.
Lord Justice Woolf said Nalgo, while demonstrating that it wanted industrial
action to be extended, was not calling on members to strike.
Workers at Newham decided to renew the indefinite action which has cost
Nalgo more than Pounds 1m in strike pay.
The union was awarded costs for the original High Court action and for the
appeal.
Newham Council was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords, but is
applying to the Law Lords for leave to appeal.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Water meter trials fuel debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one household in 10 with a water meter has difficulty in coping with
water bills according to a study published yesterday by Ofwat, the water
industry watchdog. The findings are likely to inflame debate over the
benefits of water metering.
The report into the social impact of water metering also finds that 41 per
cent of homes fitted with a water meter make no effort to curb use.
Ofwat, together with the Department of the Environment, has thrown its
support behind wider household metering to help cut demand for water in
regions suffering shortages.
Consumer groups say that poor families would pay more.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, pointed out that 91 per cent of
those surveyed had no difficulty in affording their metered water bills.
He said: 'Overall, the trials do not appear to have caused difficulties for
many customers, and this is encouraging.'
Advocates of metering will also derive support from Ofwat's finding that 35
per cent of households used less water under metering.
Nevertheless, the National Consumer Council said the results bolstered its
opposition. Ms Wendy Toms of the council said: 'The hardship of saving water
will fall most on the poorest people.'
The survey was based on more than 6,000 homes in England and Wales where
trial meters have been fitted. Only 3 per cent of the 21m homes in England
and Wales have a water meter.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Major told of Scottish fears on decentralisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR said yester-day that he had been told of concerns over
decentralisation in the public and private sectors during a meeting in
Edinburgh with 14 prominent Scots. He added that the concerns about
government and administration in Scotland had not extended to devolution.
The three-hour meeting was part of the prime minister's general election
pledge to 'take stock' of Scotland's constitutional position in the UK.
He said the debate had put a different perspective on some constitutional
questions. He declined to be drawn on what he described as 'rather
surprising points' made during the meeting.
He said the guests had been chosen for personal capabilities rather than
public positions. 'I'm trying to gauge the instincts of people and what they
believe needs to be done to enshrine and secure the distinctiveness of
Scotland and its place within the union.'
Opposition parties condemned the discussions as a sham, claiming that people
advocating real political change had not been invited.
Some of Mr Major's guests said the underlying presumption of the debate had
been that the union between Scotland and England should be strengthened, and
that a Scottish assembly - favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats -
was not the way forward.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Winners and losers in the generation game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW SET of long-term contracts for British Coal seems likely to be agreed
as early as next week. They will lead to a big shake-up in the coal and
electricity industries.
The contracts - between British Coal and the electricity generators - will
set out the volume and price of British Coal's sales over the next five
years, clearing the way for privatisation of the state-owned corporation.
The contracts will be based on market prices, ending coal's long-running
subsidies. One crucial issue is how the benefits of lower coal prices will
be shared out.
It already looks as if the negotiations have turned out even worse than
feared for British Coal, judging by an outline deal put forward by
Rothschilds, the merchant bankers advising the government on privatisation,
and approved by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
According to proposals being considered this week, coal deliveries to the
generators will fall from their 1990-91 level of 69m tonnes to 40m when the
new contracts start in April. After three years, they would fall a further
10m tonnes to 30m. Both those numbers are below forecasts made in a report
last year by Rothschilds, and imply shrinkage of pit numbers and payrolls.
They will probably lead to a further 15,000 job losses in British Coal's
60,000 workforce, which has been halved since 1987.
British Coal has been in a very weak bargaining position. The two generating
companies in England and Wales, National Power and PowerGen, account for
more than three quarters of British Coal's market, and they have been
determined to drive a hard bargain.
The price at which coal will be delivered is believed to be Pounds 1.50 a
gigajoule, compared with Pounds 1.85 in existing contracts. The question
that still has to be resolved is how that lower cost will be passed to the
consumer. Talks were taking place yesterday between the generators and the
regional distribution companies at the offices of the Electricity
Association in Millbank, London.
The cynical view is that the government will allow a sizeable portion of the
new profits to stay with the generators to increase the value of the 40 per
cent stake it still holds in those companies. Meanwhile pressures - not
least the competition that electricity faces from gas, where prices are set
to fall sharply next year - are encouraging the generators to pass benefits
to the customer. As coal's role in the generation market shrinks, that of
competing sources such as nuclear power and gas will grow.
The average contract price for electricity is about 3.3p a unit, but one
regional company said yesterday it had been offered a deal by the generators
at 3.25p a unit. The company said it was determined to negotiate that closer
to 3p.
Mr David Morris, the chairman of Northern Electric in Newcastle upon Tyne,
has given a public pledge that his company will pass on the entire benefit
of cheaper coal.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will also have to
give his blessing to the new arrangement. It might all still fall apart if
he disapproves.
It is less clear how the large industrial consumers will fare: they buy
electricity direct from the generators in an unregulated market. Mr John
Topliss of the industrial company GKN and a member of the Major Energy Users
Council said yesterday: 'We expect to see all the benefits passed on to big
users who are suffering sharp price increases.'
Mr Heseltine is pushing the deal in order to get coal privatisation moving
in the next parliament, but he may still face a stormy ride. The numbers
imply that British Coal's sales might halve in the next five years.
He also risks accusations of handing the electricity industry a profits
windfall.
COLLIERY managers who may make a bid for the mining industry have pressed
the government for money to fund redundancies and retraining before
privatisation. Mr John Meads, general secretary of the British Association
of Colliery Management (Bacom), said: 'It does not make sense to privatise
the industry and then make the new owners run down the business. The
government needs to recognise its obligation to provide sufficient funding
for retraining and redundancies before the business is put up for sale.'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Ashdown backs caution on a pact with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrats have 'everything to lose and nothing to gain' from
national pacts with other parties according to a pamphlet launched yesterday
with the blessing of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party's leader.
Mr Simon Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey and one of the authors of
the pamphlet, said that pre-election pacts should be ruled out, but
co-operation with Labour after the next election would be worthwhile if it
delivered proportional representation.
Senior party figures are keen that the party conference in Harrogate, which
begins tomorrow should not be overwhelmed by the question of electoral
pacts.
However, the difficulty of achieving this was demonstrated again yesterday
by the interest shown in the backing among party members for Mr Ashdown's
proposal for dialogue with members of other parties. The pamphlet published
yesterday says that: 'To encourage and advance the Liberal Democratic
agenda' individuals and groups from within the party should hold discussions
with people in Labour and other parties.
But it says also that for the 'foreseeable future' the task of Liberal
Democrat campaigners is to maintain the party's clear and separate identity.
The conference will debate strategy in an informal session tomorrow and in a
more formal debate on Wednesday.
The sending of British forces to Bosnia was still not a reason to recall
parliament, Mr John Major said yesterday, dismissing a demand from Mr Paddy
Ashdown for MPs to be able to debate the move before the troops receive the
order to set off as part of the United Nations mission.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: The good, the bad, the artistically free - Time flies
for Nigel Andrews, as a vintage Venice Film Festival moves towards its close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
IF a large bomb had dropped on Venice's Lido last Sunday, it might have
wiped out European cinema. Some 50 famous film-makers converged on the
festival island to take part in a talkathon about artistic freedom. All day
long, in several languages, they jawed and jawed or earnestly listened: the
Rosis, Taverniers, Jordans, Costa-Gavrases; even Sean Penn as Hollywood's
envoy, wearing UN-style headphones and a look of dazed mental overload.
But artistic freedom, as film festivals teach us, is a mixed blessing even
when available. The worst Venice movies, as we approach Golden Lion hour,
have been cinema's equivalent of free verse or tennis without a net. Peter
Handke's Absence from Germany won the international walkout prize, with its
audience-scattering tale of four travellers journeying through a series of
enigmatic landscapes and incomprehensible 'poetic' dialogue scenes.
Luis Puenzo's The Plague came a close second, with its OTT Camus update,
transposing poor Albert to a South America of juntas, rats and overblown
co-production dialogue. William Hurt, Sandrine Bonnaire and Robert Duvall
are among those going down with the ship, shortly after it is vacated by the
rodents.
The best films at Venice have been those that stood up, fastened their top
shirt-buttons and played by the rules. Daniel Bergman's Sunday's Child,
scripted by father Ingmar, is an immaculately-laundered memory trip from the
screenwriter who gave us Best Intentions. Time, 1926; hero, an
eight-year-old Ingmar already learning about death, feuding with his pastor
father and wondering why his older brother Dag's bed shakes shortly after
Dag has been looking at artistic photos of nude women.
Visually, the film has the summer-kissed beauty of Elvira Madigan and even
borrows its star Thommy Berggren to play Ingmar's Dad. But like Best
Intentions, it conceals torments inside the nostalgic trappings. The
father-son quarrel is emotionally amplified by a daring flash-forward in
mid-film - to Papa's deathbed in 1968 - and also by an inspired story within
a story about a demon-possessed watchmaker. This eerily symbolic sequence
allows Ingmar's own son Daniel, in his feature directing debut, to ape the
Master at his grand guignol best.
The two other palpable hits at Venice were Sally Potter's Orlando from
Britain and Zhang Yimou's The Story Of Qiu Ju from China. The prospect of
Potter's film had me quailing. A feminist film-maker hitherto known for such
aesthetic torture sessions as The Gold Diggers (Julie Christie going gnomic
in the Yukon) here adapts Virginia Woolf's ur-feminist novel about a
sex-changing, century-hopping adventurer. But Orlando the movie is so
lightfooted that it skates - literally in the early Elizabethan scenes on a
frozen Thames - over both the frigid tundras of message cinema and the thin
ice of picaresque allegory.
Traversing 400 years, we meet Quentin Crisp as Elizabeth I, Ned Sherrin as
Dr Johnson, and John Wood, Dudley Sutton and Heathcote Williams as assorted
historical crazies; we warm to Tilda Swinton's hero(ine) with her
perpetual-sunrise look of intelligent surprise; and we applaud the witty,
jewelled, picture-book tableaux, which borrow a leaf or two from the
Greenaway book of period recreation.
Where Potter's film took Venice by surprise, the entire population of Italy
seemed to be in the queue for Zhang Yimou. Trailing prizes and flurries of
controversy for Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern (banned in China),
Yimou now startles us with a film that seems like a piece of party-line folk
propaganda. The Story Of Qiu Ju is the simple, dimpled tale of a peasant
woman who seeks justice after her husband is kicked in the testicles (sic)
by the village headman.
Off she traipses to find that justice, selling more of her modest farm
produce (chili peppers) the further she has to go on each expedition
(village, town, Beijing). Let us add that she is worthily pregnant; that the
film is shot plainly without any of Zhang's subversive camera flourishes;
and that the whole thing reeks of Chinese political correctness.
Astonishingly it still works. Any sermonising on the virtues of Chinese law
or the steadfastness of the country's peasantry is gradually upscreened by
the story's comic setbacks and ironies - even legal satisfaction brings
fresh mishaps in its wake - plus the uningratiating strength and charm of
Gong Li's performance. And if Yimou is on a tight stylistic rein, he still
composes like a master. The multi-layer shots place the potentially preachy
tale inside a larger, vibrant fresco of human life.
In Otar Ioseliani's La Chasse Aux Papillons, a pair of white Russian sisters
living in a French chateau are overrun by will-seeking relatives and
property-eyeing Japanese. (The medium is the message: a Paris-based Georgian
director makes a comedy about the world becoming a diaspora culture).
In Ivan Dichovichny's endearingly dotty Moscow On Parade characters keep
bursting into song all over 1939 Soviet Russia, as if F. Lehar had been
appointed Kremlin composer by J. Stalin. Lots of newsreel-plundered parades
set to stirring march tunes; lots of interchangeable male leads warbling at
our heroine, a beautiful aristo with an eye patch and a champagne bottle
permanently tilted throatwards.
I could not work out if this film was meant to be serious. Mind you, it was
not the sole contender in the mad hatter stakes. Compare Italy's The Mines
Of Sulphur, concerning the sex habits of Sicilian miners, and China's Blood
Morning, which is Marques's Chronicle Of A Death Foretold dramatised in
multi-decibel Mandarin.
There was always America. There always will be America, if Venice's
Hollywood-friendly new festival director Gillo Pontecorvo is to be believed.
Though none of the US films is a Golden Lion favourite, nearly all set
audiences purring. Brian De Palma's riotous thriller Raising Cain I wrote
about last week. Keith Gordon's A Midnight Clear sets William Wharton's
anti-war tale in a poetically snow-flurried 1944 Ardennes.
Don Scardino's Me And Veronica is a tangy, rough-weave comedy about two
sisters (Elizabeth McGovern, Patricia Wettig) coping with love and death in
the Philadelpia boondocks. And Glengarry Glen Ross is only a filmed play,
but what a play (by David Mamet) and what a piece of filming (by James
Foley).
Jack Lemmon in person took the audience cheers at Venice, for his playing of
Mamet's seedy real-estate salesman caught with fingers in till. But the
whole cast is a sensation, from Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris in the
barnstormer roles to Al Pacino weaving hilarious inflections around Mamet's
poker-faced staccato recitative. I looked at my watch at the end, astonished
that 100 minutes had gone by.
But then I am looking at my watch again now, astonished that a vintage
Venice festival has gone by, with only 36 hours, three films and a bunch of
prizes to go.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Classic FM's chatty debut - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY morning, I reckoned I had stayed too long with Classic FM's debut
 -there was nothing amiss with the broadcast, but it lacked variety. The
trail of short classical-music extracts, mostly familiar, had no theme.
Yet reflection reveals this as intrinsically an advantage, for the new
classical music channel is not to be thought about, simply listened to. If I
had been driving, I might have liked it; though, then I could not have
entered the mini-competitions that peppered the morning.
There was news hourly, on the hour, a racing tip, relatively few
commercials. Henry Kelly's chatty presentation is not my cup of tea, and his
announcing less informative than the BBC's. At midday he gave way to
Susannah Simons, not so consciously unsophisticated. She had a brief
everyday talk with Jeremy Isaacs about programming and casting at Covent
Garden.
Subsequent mornings have tended to follow a similar pattern; we may settle
down. My main complaint is one's ignorance of what is coming, though the
Radio Times gives an outline of the programmes.
On Sunday, Sir Roy Strong's fiery first of four talks on Radio 4 about
Ministering to the Arts recalled, among much else, how the Arts Council's
missionary fervour under Keynes, and Jennie Lee as the first arts minister,
subsided into later policies of official restriction rather than
encouragement.
The Arts Council, under a Tory squeeze nobly restrained by Lord St John of
Fawsley, had to slide support over to new Regional Arts Associations, each
Pounds 1 of bounty required to be matched by Pounds 1 of local authority's.
Other things being equal, Sir Roy reckoned that David Mellor at the
department of the national heritage might prove likely to boost the
government's concern with arts welfare. Meanwhile, he still has much to tell
us.
Radio 3 this week marks the end of the Proms, the cricket and the drama
Summer Season. The drama season included I always take long walks, that I
spoke for here lately, as the better of Sunday's two plays - a monologue for
a keen cricketer's wife (Judi Dench), who finds better things to do than go
to his matches. I need say no more, save that Peter Tinniswood's script is
as moving as it is amusing, and Dame Judi's performance beyond criticism.
John Tydeman directed.
I do try to enjoy Radio 5's young people's programmes, but it is not easy.
On Monday, STARS, adapted by a quartet from Russell Hunter's books, deals
with sixth-formers and their families. The first instalment (of 20) told us
who they are and how they live. Plot was signalled at the end. Dexter
Fletcher plays the lead, direction is by another quartet.
Then came a reading of Anne Fine's Crummy Mummy and Me, a schoolgirl's diary
of life with her slapdash Mummy and respectable Gran. Mummy's boyfriend is
called Crusher Maggot, and a dispute with Gran arises when she dyes her hair
royal blue - solved when rain washes the dye out. They all came back each
night of the week. I did not.
Young people of another kind are only in the title of Radio 4's Frenchmen
Desire Good Children on Wednesday, a tour round the French quarter of New
Orleans. Some folk declared it the most desirable place on earth, some
thought it shabby. The Italians were taking over, complete with Mafia.
Amateur female wrestling was on, and 'miracle cures' from voodoo priests.
But the good French children were moving away, to Atlanta. There was no
presenter, you heard what you heard, and Piers Plowright, the producer,
offered no conclusions. 'We're not exactly where we started from,' said our
occasional guide finally, 'but this is where it ends,' and maybe that is the
conclusion. It was fun, yet I doubt if I would find my way on that side of
Canal Street.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Lovely modern Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1992 Promenade Concerts come to an end tonight, and the best was kept
almost to the last. There is no doubt that Pierre Boulez's concert with the
Vienna Philharmonic on Thursday was the season's outstanding event, and in
many ways its most unlikely one: who would have imagined, even five years
ago, that the Vienna Philharmonic, most conservative of the world's great
orchestras, would come to the Albert Hall with a programme entirely composed
of 20th-century works, including a piece by Boulez himself?
In their first of their proms on Wednesday, the orchestra had been heard on
more familiar territory, conducted by Claudio Abbado in Haydn's Military
Symphony and Mahler's First. By the Vienna's exalted standards that had been
a run-of-the-mill affair. Slicked down, big-band Haydn, without a crescendo
out of place and everything confined within a narrow, middling dynamic
range, was followed by Mahler in which the sum of the beautifully executed
parts - luscious, refined string tone, crystalline, characterful wind solos
 -offered little more than the sketchiest portrait.
Abbado is too perceptive a conductor to be uncaring or meretricious but this
seemed nowhere close to the searching, gritty texture of his finest London
performances, which promised to set new standards for Mahler interpretation.
All such disappointments were vanquished the following evening. Boulez is
not the first conductor to bring contemporary music to the Vienna
Philharmonic; Abbado's own activities when he was the orchestra's musical
director included the inauguration of the Wien Modern festival, to which the
Philharmonic was called upon to make a contribution.
Yet the exceptional standards produced here - in works that surely are no
part of their regular repertoire - had the kind of presence and authority
they conventionally bring to the classical staples. It was overwhelmingly
convincing.
Boulez too seemed galvanised by the occasion. The vivacity that launched the
orchestra into Stravinsky's Chant de rossignol, bundling together all its
febrile strands, teasing out the lyricism, was at the opposite pole from the
tender care with which Debussy's Nocturnes were unveiled, its layers of
strings peeled away to reveal yet further perspectives, further exquisite
detail.
The Vienna wind were outstanding through the evening; they came into their
own in Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, long one of Boulez's most
uncompromising performances, with surreal clarinet solos, tumescent
trombones and hard-revving trumpets, the whole thing propelled on a writhing
body of string tone.
Boulez's own Livre pour cordes demands that same kind of high tensile
strength. It is one of the most concentrated of his orchestral works, full
of proliferating lines, dense-packed chords, explosive pizzicatos. Here it
emerged as an immensely passionate piece, bursting with lyrical strength and
woven out of rapturous string cantilenas. Concerts like this need to be
treasured.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Love's labour's well spent - Andrew St George enjoys a
production in Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM Hazlitt kept Love's Labour's Lost in a fitful exile from the stage
by saying: 'If we were to part with any of the author's comedies, it should
be this.' The Royal Exchange Theatre Company has called this difficult play
back to life in a simple new guise. The mood is everything: winter or
spring. But this production is too sombre for farce, and too light for a
meditation.
The 1594 Love's Labour's Lost is no frothy comedy. The cost of countering
Hazlitt was a modish search for the gloom in the play. Peter Brook's 1946
Royal Shakespeare Company revival found out the sadnesses and compromised
the mirth, making Don Armado a faded Grandee rather than an Andalusian
Falstaff. Modern productions know that the frozen laughter at the end should
start to chill even in the first scene.
James Macdonald's production opens on a circular grass field; the four men
arrive to begin their celibate retreat. All parts but Berowne's are a
thankless matter of waiting, like a bell in a peal, to strike and then fall
silent again. The women arrive, and the 'civil war of wits' begins.
The characters are surprisingly cruel with each other, a fact that the
direction fails to exploit. The women mock and the men bluster; the pedants
look pathetic; and the token foreigner, the faded Don Armado, everywhere
finds his confused gentility misunderstood.
Don Armado is lugubriously and finely played by Bernard Bresslaw. He has
that 'mint of phrases in his brain', but lacks the discipline of an exchange
rate mechanism, for he, like everyone else in the play, is hell-bent on the
conspicuous consumption of words: 'I am for her, volumes in folio.'
The other wordsmiths, the pedants, Holofernes (David Ross) and Sir Nathaniel
(Roger Delves-Broughton) are a quidditative delight, all intellectual
ostentation met with simpering admiration. Linus Roache as Berowne spinning
'taffeta phrases and silken terms precise' keeps the action moving by the
energy of his verse-speaking.
But the women, ably led by Patricia Kerrigan's arch Queen, could be cooler
and less flighty, since they call the whole thing off at the end, and must
make this look plausible. Their ambassador is the 'honey-tongued' Boyet
(John Bennett), inward with the women and haughty with the men. He needs
more attention than Macdonald's direction gives him; he links the two
courts, and his attitude - cruel or playful - makes the mood of the play.
Ace McCarron's lighting, with a lovely change of state at the end, realises
that the heart of the play beats in its final lines: 'The words of Mercury
are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You this way, we that way.'
This is a wonderful theatrical moment, about what it means to watch a
comedy, especially one that finishes with a death and not marriages. One is
elated to think that life is seldom this bad, but dispirited to know that it
is rarely this good. Out of this division, for an instant, Shakespeare's
ending creates its own community in the theatre.
At the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester (061) 833 9833, until October 17

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme - The history of
flowers on film
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is almost no limit to the purposes for which photographers have
pointed their cameras at the vegetable kingdom and clicked. Flora
Photographica. Masterpieces of Flower Photography admirably belies what
could sound a slightly fusty title - fusty if you have momentarily forgotten
such ripe masterpieces of kitsch as Bert Stern's portrait of Marilyn Monroe
clasping huge roses to her naked breasts. An Arts Council touring
exhibition, Flora Photographica is at the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington
until 20 September.
What we find is some 100 photographs which add up to a survey of the uses of
flowers in photography, from the pioneers of the last century until the
present day. It includes pictures by many of the best known names of
photography, ancient and modern, from Fox Talbot, Robert Fenton, and Julia
Margaret Cameron, to Cecil Beaton, Andre Kertesz, Edward Steichen, and
Robert Mapplethorpe.
The exhibition is divided loosely according to the different types of flower
photography. It shows how photography became part of the tools of the
botanist, though not without early opposition from the botanical
illustrators, alarmed at the prospect of this devilish invention elbowing
its way on to their patch.
Nonetheless, botanists soon added cameras to their exploration kit. One of
the funniest photographs in the show is an unknown botanist's record of an
extraordinary plant in Sumatra, towering some 10 ft tall and descriptively
named Amorphophallus Brooksii.
Many photographers took up the challenge of emulating the achievements of
the immortal Pierre-Joseph Redoubte and the great Dutch floral artists. In
black-and-white, the effect was obviously rather odd. Texture was hard to
convey, so that peaches in Robert Fenton's late studies, could resemble
bread-rolls or suede.
However, there are also many lovely studies such as those by the Alinari
Studios. Nor was photography less able to capture the kinds of association
which the Dutch masters achieved. Edward Steichen's studio arrangement of
roses, caught at the moment when they start to exhale the aura of decay,
conveys the foreboding of a Frenchman in 1914.
Death, oblivion, virginity, fragility, fruitfulness, and vice. . . The
associations of flowers are wonderfully rich, and as this fascinating
exhibition shows, over the past 150 years photographers have crossed the
same ground over and over again, exploring what the Victorian founding
fathers of their craft called the language of flowers. For a still more
extensive survey, you need the elegant book by the originator of the
exhibition, William A. Ewing, Flora Photographica, Thames and Hudson, 223pp.
Pounds 25.
Flora Photographica is sponsored by BT. It will move to the Royal Botanic
Gardens in Edinburgh (3 October-22 November), then to Manchester (28
November-17 January) and Coventry (23 January-7 March)

FT  12 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Publisher to the English
eccentric - A man who specialises in odd books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1962 John Rotheroe founded what has become one of Britain's notable minor
institutions - Shire Books, of Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire.
As the company celebrates its 30th anniversary Rotheroe gains modest
satisfaction in knowing that there is scarcely a bookshop in Britain that
does not stock at least one of the 850 titles published so far.
Similarly there cannot be a single English eccentric who is not familiar
with at least one of these titles, that range from dummy boards to
dovecotes, from Egyptian coffins to East Anglian village signs.
'If the subject is sufficiently offbeat or obscure we will consider it,'
said John Rotheroe, 56 who owns and runs the company with his wife
Jacqueline, though he admitted that with an average of three to four books
offered to him every working day the majority of aspiring authors are
disappointed.
Rotheroe spent two years working in a London advertising agency after he
left the London School of Economics with a degree in medieval economic
history, even so he is not a man given to seeking publicity.
'We did once achieve fame - in a Guardian fourth leader that enthused about
a book we produced in the late 1960s on ancient hill figures,' he said.
His favourite way of promoting his staunchly independent seven-person
company is to spend many days - including weekends - 'on the road', visiting
some of the 6,000 accounts in this country, most of whom he knows
personally.
'They range from very large branches of W H Smith to museums, stately homes
and small parish churchs - Orford church in Suffolk is our oldest account,'
he said.
'Visiting the customers regularly not only results in sales, but returns,
which, strangely enough, I do not mind,' Rotheroe said.
'A lot of our titles are so obscure that booksellers find they can't sell
them, so it is our policy to buy these back at the price we charged for
them. Some people think this is odd, but it is only common sense really. It
does nobody any good having old tatty unsold paperbacks hanging around.
Besides, returns total only about five per cent, and we build this figure
into our costings.'
The best selling titles might sell as many as 3,000 of the 500,000 books
Shire expects to sell in a year. Titles such as John Bly's Hallmarks in
English Silver, Heraldry, and Your Family Tree have been reprinted many
times. The Bly book has gone through 13 reprints.
For the effort in selling this number of books - and often in mailing a
single book worth under Pounds 1.50 after the retailer's discount is taken
into account - Shire turns over a mere Pounds 650,000 a year. Profit this
year could well be as low as Pounds 40,000 before tax.
Most of this figure will be ploughed back into the company. It is many years
since Rotheroe borrowed money.
This partly explains why, even if the Rotheroes wished to sell out, no large
publisher would be keen to acquire the company.
'Our low figures keep the big boys away. We have had one or two nibbles, but
not for many years,' Rotheroe said.
'We should probably be a lot more profitable if we restricted our number of
titles (500 are in print), but that would take away a lot of the fun.
Warehousing for small books such as ours is not expensive and I like to be
able to supply the odd unusual title, if that is what a customer wants.'
'I am particularly proud of our Shire Ethnography series. To say they were
loss making would be a kind way of putting it. But nobody was doing cheap
ethnography - our titles cost Pounds 3.50 - and there was a need. We have
some of the best names in the subject between our covers. They include 80-
year-old Harry Beran, who has just produced a volume entitled Betel Chewing
equipment of Eastern New Guinea.
Shire Books has only one outlet in New Guinea and only 10 per cent of its
sales are overseas. This is an area Rotheroe would like to expand, though
probably not yet, its Australian distributor recently went down leaving them
with an Pounds 8,000 debt.
Even so, Rotheroe says the recession has affected Shire far less than bigger
publishers.
'I think this is because we are so widely spread,' he said 'Invoices average
around Pounds 10, so although this is very labour intensive it rarely means
we are owed great deal by a single customer.
'Nevertheless this year we are not really expecting to make much more than
the previous year. The recession has affected the tourist trade, which has
in turn affected us. Also with so many museums now charging for entry we
find people are less inclined to buy a book in he shop at the end of their
tour.
'They often used to do this automatically as a sort of thank-you gesture.
'However we always try to take a long-term view. We look upon the
ethnography titles as a 15 year project. It will probably be that long
before people start taking notice and buying them in numbers.
'We have also had some success in producing books ahead of demand. A good
example was the Comics title in our Discovering series.'
Another keystone of the Shire policy is updating whenever a title reprints.
'We try hard to keep our subject matter current,' he said. 'Although we pay
our authors an advance of only about Pounds 600 for a 5,000 word Shire Album
title and a royalty of 5 per cent, through regular updating and a low
selling price we keep them in print for years. So many books have a small
print run, a high cover price and a very short life.'
To keep prices down - books in the Shire Album series for example have cost
Pounds 1.95 for the past three years - the company does nearly all the
design in its 17th century town house headquarters in the centre of Princes
Risborough. Only the photographs are added to the page at the company in
Wales that has printed nearly all their titles for the past 20 years.
'Low prices are our creed,' Rotheroe said. 'When we started we were selling
books at the price of a gin and tonic. Now I say that some of our titles
cost no more than the price of a pint of beer.
'Very often a Shire book is an impulse buy - it is the 'ooh' factor we so
often sell on. And you can only achieve that by keeping prices low.
'It means we don't make huge profits. But we manage to survive and enjoy
ourselves on all the obscure topics we do. It would be flattering to be
imitated. But nobody would want to. Our books are too slow selling.'
Shire Books free autumn catalogue is available from Cromwell House, Church
St, Princes Risborough, HP27 9AZ, Tel: 08444-4301.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Risky step into the rug trade - A
man who sold his travel agency to take an Oriental carpet ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ORIENTAL rug trade has earned for itself a rather tacky image.
Allegations of pitifully-paid weavers labouring in near-slave conditions
making carpets sold for bloated margins in Western department stores. Small
shops in London's West End permanently displaying 'closing down sale'
stickers and offering bogus reductions on artificially-inflated prices.
Spurious Sunday warehouse sales advertise low-cost wholesale deals that are
nothing of the sort.
A minefield waits the ordinary buyer. The saving grace is that many types of
Oriental carpets are gorgeous and can be good value. In many supplier
countries the weavers work in conditions embedded in tribal and village
culture.
In the perhaps surprising setting of Norwich, the very English couple, John
and Kate Wright, entered this unusual market six years ago. With virtually
no background knowledge of the rug trade, they opened a shop in the Norfolk
city and now earn their living buying and selling Oriental carpets. Last
year, the business sold Pounds 170,000 of rugs on which it made a net
pre-tax return of about 10 per cent. This rather modest return is calculated
after the couple extracted a salary of well over Pounds 20,000. Not
surprisingly, Oriental Rugs of Norwich is feeling the uncomfortable heat of
recession which has left the industry's warehouses piled high with unsold
carpet.
Wright was the managing director and a shareholder in a local travel agency
when the couple bought a large Victorian house in the mid-1980s.
'We started looking for Oriental rugs but there was really nowhere in
Norwich. I thought specialist organisations were going to be the thing of
the future. I thought we could make a business out of carpets.'
While still retaining his holding in the travel agency, Wright found a
two-floor shop in the centre of Norwich at the end of 1986 and began renting
it at Pounds 8,000 a year (the rent is now Pounds 12,000). Persistent
questioning of people in the trade unearthed some names of carpet importers
and the remarkably modest sum of Pounds 15,000 bought enough carpets to
stock one floor.
The customer base and rationale of the business is the same now as it was
then. Almost all the Wrights' customers are 'local' with about one-fifth of
them tourists. Wright claims to offer carpets at prices lower than those at
most outlets. 'We don't add anything on to the price to take off in
bargaining. The price we show is what you have to pay.' The gross margin -
the difference between what Wright pays and what he sells to the customer
for - is about 30 per cent.
Wright's average retail price is Pounds 350, relatively low mainly because
more than one-quarter of sales are of generally cheaper Chinese rugs. Prices
range from Pounds 70 for a small open-back Chinese rug to Pounds 6,000 for a
15-feet Persian Kashan. Pakistan-made Bokharas start at around Pounds 200, a
geometric-patterned Melas from Turkey at Pounds 1,200 and a silk Qum from
Iran at Pounds 1,500.
Though Wright has visited a large number of weaving centres in Asia, he buys
virtually all his stock from Asian importers in the UK. 'You cannot compete
on price unless you do. An importer might be buying Pounds 1m or maybe
100,000 square metres of carpet at a time. He gets the benefits of quantity.
A big importer might be able to get carpets at 25 per cent less than we
would.' Wright believes the importer is making a similar 30 per cent margin.
How does Wright know he is getting a reasonable price from the four or five
main importers that he uses in London? 'It is a matter of trust. I haggle
down to the last half per cent. It's part of the job I enjoy. You can
establish the lowest point. I know we get the same price as other buyers.'
The Wrights choose each carpet they purchase. 'Kate does most of this
because I think she has a particularly good eye for it.' Much of the shop's
stock is hauled up from London in the Wrights' estate car. The company
employs two shop assistants. One, Claire Carrington, has a fine arts degree
and commands the kind of knowledge a lot of customers like: knot counts (an
extremely fine carpet will have between 300 and 800 knots per square inch);
the desirability of Persian carpets from Qum, Isfahan and Kashan; the
horizontal looms used by nomadic tribal groups and the vertical looms of the
village; the differences between an Indian Kaimuri, a Persian Sarouk and a
Turkish Melas; the tribal designs from Afghanistan; the use of extensive
flat-weave Kilim on the edge of Belouch rugs.
The recession hit the company late but when it did - at the end of last year
 -the impact was immediate. It has cut the company's shop sales by close to
one-third. 'It is the more expensive carpets, above Pounds 1,500, where
sales have been hit,' says Wright. A significant drop in the cost of
purchasing carpets from Iran has not helped much, even though Wright says he
is passing on these reductions to the customer. The retail price of Chinese
carpets has fallen 40 per cent over the past five years, partly because of a
glut.
Some importers in London have also begun to offer substantial reductions on
Persian carpets in the wake of the twin impact of enormously-distorted black
market currency and Iran's need to earn more foreign currency.
To try and build new trade, Wright has begun showing carpets in potential
customers' homes. 'The other day, I went to five houses and sold at three.'
He is also keen to take contracts on commissioning the making of carpets for
private organisations. He has just completed one for a huge carpet for
Sidney Sussex college, Cambridge, and is talking with one or two of the
university's other colleges. Wright is also looking at the possibility of
opening a shop in Cambridge, though the recession has worried him and he
remains anxious about its length and depth. He knows that his business could
be seriously harmed if another specialist carpet shop opened in Norwich.
Having sold his stake in the travel agency, Wright is glad to have made the
switch. 'No matter how many times you go through the pile of rugs with a
customer you never get tired of talking about them. It is an enjoyable way
of earning your living.'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Scream's tops - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECORD of the year is Screamadelica by the Scottish band Primal Scream.
That's official. It was chosen by experts from a short list of 100 albums,
in the record industry's attempt to match the Booker Prize with a serious,
incorruptible competition to find the best album of new music released in
the UK and Ireland in the past year.
Sponsored by Mercury - the communications company not the dead Freddie  -
the idea has taken a firm hold in year one. The 10 short-listed albums were
wonderfully eclectic, ranging from the multi-million selling contributions
by such big guns as U2 and Simply Red (who would have regarded the Pounds
20,000 prize as small change) to the intense spiritualism of John Tavener's
The Protecting Veil (Virgin Records), a cello piece inspired by a miracle of
the Greek Orthodox Church, and the soulful jazz of the South African, London
based, pianist, Bheki Mseleku (World Classic) on the album Celebration. If
the Mercury prize had no other plus than making these two albums available
in High Street stores, it would have justified its existence.
Primal Scream was the obvious choice to lift the award. Its music manages to
be both trendy and reassuring. The tracks range from the sprightly,
uplifting, melodic 'Movin' on up', a natural hit single; to the right-on,
ethnicity of 'Slip inside this house'; to the even more black 'Don't fight
it, feel it'; to a nod towards psychedelia in 'Higher than the sun'; and so
on.
The entire Mercury shortlist sampler of 10 representative tracks, a
wonderful bargain at Pounds 3.99, offers a crash course in contemporary
music, and Primal Scream condenses it all into one album. It is all very
clever; very accessible; beautifully produced; and enjoyably fronted by
singer Bob Gillespie. No new worlds are explored, indeed there is more than
a hint of Simply Red in the slower numbers, but 1992 is neatly captured. The
judges plumped for a 'no risks' winner, for a band which could still use the
prize money.
Apparently, Primal Scream, saw off strong challenges from U2, John Tavener,
Bheki and The Young Disciples, whose genuinely black, funky soul,
pulsatingly danceable album Road to Freedom (Talkin' Loud) would have been a
bolder choice for the winner. Here again, the debt is palpably owed to
American Soul, but there is a commitment, especially on tracks like 'Move
on', which makes this album particularly enjoyable.
Apart from Simply Red, the other shortlisted albums were Rising Above Bedlam
(Oval) by the idiosyncratic Jah Wobble, which takes you smoothly to Africa
and beyond; Fox Base Alpha (Heavenly) by the dance band favourites Saint
Etienne; Honey's Dead (Warner) by the American-influenced Jesus and Mary
Chain; and one completely oddball outsider Barry Adamson, whose Soul Murder
(Mute) takes a Laurie Anderson approach, with the man talking mysteriously
over late night urban jazz music. Of these my fancy would have been Jesus
and Mary Chain, if only for the deathly vocals of brothers Jim and William
Reid and the drained out punk feel, a cross between Lou Reed and The Pixies.
But if you discount Primal Scream as the marketable choice for the winner,
what of the two also-rans? The Protective Veil is a 45-minute challenge for
cellist Steven Isserlis, whose continuous, austere solo seeks to portray the
transcendental power of the Virgin Mary.
Moving through various stages of her earthly and heavenly life, the cello
maintains a haunting lyrical strain, seeing off interruptions from the
strings. There is no development towards a finale, but the evocation of a
mood is beautifully sustained. It is instrumental plainsong as far removed
from Radio One as Purcell is from Prince.
There is something equally hypnotic about Bheki's Celebration. Intense,
introspective, building up from simple melodies into finely textured jazz
rhythms, Mseleku is well served by such British musicians as Courtney Pine
on soprano sax and Eddie Parker on flute, but the inner force comes from the
American bass and drums team of Michael Bowie and 'Smitty' Smith. There is
nothing new here, but it is very classy stuff.
The judges have selected probably the best two new albums of contemporary
classical music and jazz for praise. It would have been perverse to make
either the winner of a popular competition.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Massenet reappraised - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Massenet: Cleopatre. Kathryn Harries, Didier Henry, Danielle Streiff,
Jean-Luc Maurette etc./ Massenet Festival Chorus, Saint-Etienne Orch./
Patrick Fournillier. Koch Schwann 314 064 K3 (two CDs)
Debussy: Pelleas et Melisande. Francois Le Roux, Maria Ewing, Jose van Dam,
Jean-Philippe Courtis, Christa Ludwig etc./ Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna

Strauss: Die Frau ohne Schatten. Julia Varady, Hildegard Behrens, Reinhild
Runkel, Jose van Dam, Placido Domingo etc./ Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna
State Opera Chorus/Georg Solti. Decca 436 243-2 (three CDs)
MASSENET'S last operas were given their first performances posthumously: the
comedy Panurge in 1913 (a year after his death), the romantic tragedy
Cleopatre the following year. Neither was a success. Don Quichotte apart,
this had been the fate of most of his works in the last decade of his life.
His star was on the wane. A public introduced in 1902 to the brave new world
of Debussy's Pelleas became perhaps impatient thereafter with the
'well-made' aspects of Massenet's idiom, and unable or unwilling to
distinguish with what subtlety he continually renewed it. From that time
until quite recently the critical formulation has tended to go unchallenged
that late Massenet - Don Quichotte, again, apart - comprises a tired,
formula-bound series, little worth the bother.
That is changing. In particular, the annual festival launched a few years
ago at Saint-Etienne, the composer's birth-place, is stirring up received
opinion. Cleopatre is the latest of several feats of Massenet re-discovery
undertaken there: the 1990 festival production was recorded 'live' and is
now published on one of the more adventurous small-company labels.
It is endlessly fascinating: an opera of chamber-drama intimacy (for all its
gestures in the direction of spectacle) executed with peculiar mastery, and
so economical in its treatment of Louis Payen's workmanlike libretto that
within the first 15 minutes all the basic elements are laid in place.
There is an unwasteful quality about the musical treatment, an underplaying
of melodic curves and a touching-in of ceremony and show that betoken the
confidence of a mature artist in his craftsmanship. More than ever - because
now the strokes are so lightly and pointedly made - the word-setting skill
is breathtaking.
Whether it be the introductory Roman fanfares ('generic' rather than
musically original, but briskly introduced and summarily dismissed) or the
infusion of Egyptian low-life exoticism (with its gentle back-references to
Thais), Massenet squanders not a note on scene-setting.
What interests him most are the erotic pull of the work's pivotal
relationship and, above all, the titular heroine. From her first monologue
Cleopatra (mezzo) is pictured in the round, as a mature sensualist, complex,
quick to calculation - she has set out to captivate a brashly sceptical
Anthony (baritone), and easily accomplishes the ploy - and prone to sudden
caprices, yet capable of grand, unfettered passion in the end. (The fact
that the role was written for Lucy Arbell, the composer's own amitie
amoureuse of his last years, throws revealing sidelights on the
characterisation.)
Subplots involve Octavia (soprano) and Spakos, the freed slave with whose
affections Cleopatra cruelly toys (tenor). But everything is intended to
reflect back on the 'infinite variety' of Cleopatra herself, and does so
with effortless directness. The fallibilities of lovers, tenderly and
uncensoriously described (especially the female ones), was always the
central concern of Massenet's artistic vision. Here, in the final product of
that vision, his arts of description are distilled to a fine essence.
Part of the secret of Massenet's final-period economy lay in his intimate
understanding of fine singers, in his knowledge of all the ways they could
be counted on to 'make the difference' to the drama - a plain vocal line
becomes a bewitching one when fragrantly uttered. The Saint-Etienne
recording does not command singers of quite that calibre: only Kathryn
Harries in the title role, at her most liquidly and duskily appealing
(because not taxed by strenuous high notes), possesses a proper measure of
distinction.
For all that, this is a highly enjoyable performance, briskly kept on the
move, a 'real' rather than a studio-bound experience. It's curious to move
from it to the latest Pelleas - DG's all-star, studio-glossy version - not
only because one notes with heightened awareness Massenet's influence on
Debussy, but also because the over-studied, over-calculated atmosphere
created by Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic seems the opposite of
Saint-Etienne down-to-earth-ness.
Beauty of sonority, which the DG offers in abundance, is no bad thing in
this opera, but when dramatic muscle-power goes be missing beneath its
surface, it can appear a strangely qualified virtue. In addition, Francois
Le Roux and Maria Ewing in the title roles give the impression that Debussy
and Maeterlinck have pitted a pair of youthful sophisticates, mannered to
the last degree, against a castle-full of sincere older people, led by Jose
van Dam's magnificently unforced Golaud and Jean-Philippe Courtis's quietly
eloquent Arkel.
The extreme refinement of the reading is not to be scorned; but the
greatness of the opera is somehow diminished thereby.
Van Dam is the Barak on Decca's new Frau ohne Schatten - uncut,
long-awaited, high-profile in its cast, and disappointingly flawed. It is
not without its great points. Julia Varady glows with inimitable and
glorious lustre in the monumental title role; Van Dam sings nobly, though
the character's bluff warmth does not come easily to this most fastidious of
bass-baritones; and Hildegard Behrens throws her all - searing passion,
pinpoint high notes and middle-register wobbles included - into the dyer's
wife. The many smaller vocal elements in this vast, rich, wildly overblown
fantasy are nicely touched in; the Vienna Philharmonic play with native
authority.
But Solti, who writes in the programme book of a lifelong devotion to the
work, is still only half a Frau conductor - the craggily monumental half,
not the candidly diatonic, chorale-like, which he nags forward impatiently.
(The recording was made over a period of two-and-a-half years, which may
account for its lack of 'consecutive' line.) And the casting of Domingo as
the Emperor proves an embarrassing failure: he hashes up the text, breaks up
the phrases, and sounds worryingly uneasy with the tessitura.

PIERRE BOULEZ relinquished his post as director of IRCAM in Paris at the end
of last year to concentrate on his composing and conducting. In the long
term, one may hope that there will much more of the former than the latter,
but at any rate the first fruits of his return to the concert hall and
recording studio are now appearing. The two releases for Deutsche Grammophon
mark the start of what is promised as a long-term and substantial
association, during which he will re-record much of his repertory.
In the 1960s, Boulez began to put on record for CBS the 20th-century works
with which he had made his reputation as a conductor. Those performances of
Debussy, Stravinsky, Bartok and the Second Viennese School set new standards
of clarity and structural integrity which have influenced interpreters ever
since.
As Boulez has seemed to mellow in the past two decades, he has added more
flexibility and natural expression to his conducting. Anyone who heard his
performances of Pelleas et Melisande for Welsh National Opera earlier this
year will have heard how much warmth he can now bring to that score, without
sacrificing any of his rigour or lucidity.
The new discs of Debussy and Stravinsky with the Cleveland Orchestra offer
the first evidence of this new breadth. The opening of 'Gigues' in the
orchestral Images is magically done, with string textures exactly graded,
woodwind figures etched sharp against them and each paragraph individually
shaped. It is a ravishing performance; the triptych of 'Iberia' sparkles
with rhythmic life, 'Rondes de printemps' presents a kaleidoscope of
changing orchestral colours. But the Prelude a l'apres-midi is disappointing
 -stiffly jointed, unrhapsodic, rather conventional in its articulation and
unsensuous in a way that even Boulez's 1960s version managed to avoid.
The same mixture of the routine and the exceptionally fine pervades the
Stravinsky disc. Petrushka opens tepidly indeed, with only the occasional
flashes of rhythmic assertiveness to a give a hint of its conductor and
though it gains gradually in vitality, there is something over-civilised
about it all, despite the responsiveness and the drive. Le Sacre, though,
does deliver the goods in the end. Boulez is an old hand at delineating its
instrumental strands, precisely pointing its accents. He still makes the
second half of the work more monumental and remorseless than any other
conductor, and no one drives the final pages home with such savagery.
There are no weaknesses either in his new account of The Nightingale, the
conte lyrique in three short acts, which Stravinsky began in 1908 but did
not finish until 1913, the year of Le Sacre. It is a work Boulez has
conducted in London several times but never before on record and he offers
here a perfect balance between analytical exactitude and fairy-tale
enchantment, relishing each of its virtuoso orchestral effects (derived in
equal measure from Rimsky and Debussy) and bringing every episode to vivid
life. The text is sung in the original Russian (though the accompanying
tri-lingual booklet never reveals the fact) and the cast is led by Phyllis
Bryn-Julson's limpid, ecstatic Nightingale.
For Stravinsky from a conductor whose generation must have profited
enormously from Boulez's example, Virgin Classics' bargain set is thoroughly
recommendable too. For the cost of a single full-price CD, one gets a
thoroughly worthwhile performance of Le Sacre, couched in Kent Nagano's
characteristically lithe, perceptive terms and most efficiently played by
the LPO, and an altogether outstanding account of the melodrama Persephone,
which seems more and more to be one of the supreme masterpieces of
Stravinsky's neoclassical period.
In terms of recording and performance, this is by a long way the best
version in the catalogue, graced by Anthony Rolfe-Johnson's beautifully
polished singing, and Anne Fournet's impassioned narration; the playing of
the LPO and of its solo woodwind especially is exemplary.
Esa-Pekka Salonen's Stravinsky series for Sony has contained some fine
performances, though his Oedipus rex is not one of the best instalments.
Vinson Cole's Oedipus is rather tiresome and Simon Estes' s Creon laboured,
but is well worth hearing for Anne-Sofie von Otter's meltingly seductive
Jocasta, the collector's curiosity of Nicola Gedda's Shepherd (a bit
effortful in all honesty) and Patrice Chereau's exemplary narration,
perfectly judged and unaffected.
Salonen is at his most disciplined in Stravinsky, and the playing of the
Swedish orchestra and chorus are kept on a tight rein. Somehow, though, the
remorseless terror of the piece just eludes him.

FT  12 SEP 92 / All eyes on the Nazis: As They Say in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a rule now. If you cannot write yet again about the horrors of
Yugoslavia, or indulge in yet more catatonic speculation about 'what if the
French vote No,' you turn to neo-Nazi attacks on refugees.
Events in eastern Germany have been a godsend. Corriere della Sera of Milan
can run off the typical editorial: 'Germany finds itself in grip of the
Nazis. There grows fear of a people's uprising against the 'human flood'
from eastern Europe. Neo-Nazi violence spreads throughout the eastern Lander
like an oil slick . . . the Germans have lost all feeling of national
solidarity . . .'
In Poland, the considered contempt for east Germans of last week has turned
into something more apocalyptic. The editor of Gazeta Wyborcza is the old
Solidarity activist Adam Michnik, who contributed the following personal
comment: 'What is happening in Germany must be understood as an alarm bell.
'Germany - a stable and democratic state - has become a region of the
explosion of hate. One-time nationalistic fringe groups are now starting to
alter the spiritual and political landscape of the state. The moment of
truth for German democracy nears . . .'
As usual, the story seems less sensational the nearer you are to it. Thus
Tagesspiegel of Berlin, after a particularly awful night of anti-refugee
mayhem a few miles away, ran as its front page lead a story about the choice
of architect to redesign the Potsdamer-Platz.
If alarm bells are ringing in Germany, it is over the state of public
finances and the fragility of the government rather than the ghosts of the
past. People are getting worried about the qualities of Chancellor Kohl, who
seems to be able to tackle almost anything except problems.
And if the Germans have got things the wrong way round, it could be the
result of their peculiar tendency to focus on the ramifications of an issue,
rather than the issue itself, in the belief that they are really getting to
grips with it.
A few years ago, a Munich weekly ran a cartoon which said it all: a group of
Germans, near the pearly gates, were passing a signpost which pointed left
to Heaven and right to Lecture on Heaven. The Germans were going to the
lecture.
It could be that west Germans still do not care greatly about what goes on
in the east. It is difficult to know how surprised the readers of the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung were last week when they read a page of
letters from children in the east.
From Plauen, Sylvio Flugel wrote: 'Suddenly, everything is quite different -
in Germany, in the world, in me. My name is Sylvio and I am in the third
form. Our teacher has told us much about united Germany.
'I am specially happy about the many beautiful toys that there are now. I
have many wishes and dreams. But unfortunately they cannot be fulfilled, for
both my parents have no work any more and most toys are very dear. I can't
really understand why mummy and daddy have no work.'
Another small boy wrote to say how nice it was to see so much of his mother
when she lost her job - but then father lost his, too. The letter continued:
'Grandpa is very dear to us, but he swears at everything. First he swore at
the GDR (the former East Germany), now he swears at the new government.
'Grandma is always calling him a whingeing fool. She says what's best about
unity is the jam and the coffee. I don't know if things are better now or
not.'
On the same day, the Suddeutsche Zeitung carried an interview which started:
'When the (east German) pop star Inka Bause thinks back to her first
confrontation with the western music business, she immediately recalls that
evening in Munich.
'It was a meeting with enormously important music industry people and such
types, says Inka, 'make me nervous, anyway.' They sat in an expensive
restaurant, spoke about recording contracts, charts, competition strategy.
'As the main course was ordered, a music executive turned jovially to the
young East Berliner and asked: 'Now, little one, what's it like to get
something nice to eat for once'?'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Gardening: My Frenchman is a blackleg - Robin Lane Fox
encounters a foreign bird in the bushes, and is deeply suspicious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the past three months, I have been sharing the garden with a
Frenchman. He appeared one early evening, took the measure of my terrace,
and stood, looking lost, until he scented Heliotrope White Swan and was
reminded of bedding-out in France.
In a fluster, he vanished, down towards a nearby border from which he kept
up a guttural incomprehensible harangue.
I am used to sharing the lawn with a hedgehog, the neighbour's collie and a
love-struck mallard who has fixated on me since I first gave her some stale
breadcrumbs. The trick never worked with women.
My Frenchman is another matter; Alectrois rufa, the red-legged partridge
seems to be using my home, the Old Vicarage, as a safe house.
French partridges in English eyes have French habits. They have no idea how
to be sporting and when Englishmen chase them out of cornfields, they refuse
to fly over guns but they run sideways instead.
They are grounded red-legs, black-legging English sport. They must believe
that they are far too grand to talk to pheasants: otherwise, they would have
shared the secret of life. In a garden, they are bewildering.
For a moment, my Frenchman looks as if he might, after all, be impressed by
white cosmos daisies a la bagatelle and old-fashioned roses with superior
French names. Then, with a scurry, he is off to the lilacs, moving fast,
keeping low and eluding all attempts to corner him on the way past.
During the summer, certain French habits have become clearer. Swimming pools
are regrettably of no interest to them and so far as I can judge, they only
come to life at 6pm. Nightly, when it is time for a Pernod, my Frenchman
reappears on the terrace, calls for attention and then does his usual bolt
when hard choices have to be made.
Safe among the Lavatera Barnsley, at first he maintained a long Gallic
monologue. He began it at the time when the dons of Cambridge were wondering
whether to deconstruct themselves and give an honorary degree to that enemy
of meaning, Jacques Derrida, the French academic, I began to think that I
had been chosen for canvassing, Right from the damask roses came nightly
broadcasts which destroyed all signifiers and referred to nothing except
themselves. A bird in the bushes was worth 20 French texts in the hand.
By July, I knew I was wrong. It was no longer one Frenchman, preaching
deconstruction. There was a Frenchman and two French henpersons, drawn to
the bushes by the sound which my Peter Scott bird-book describes rather
kindly as the noise of a scythe whose blade is being whetted. Were they,
perhaps, on a financial mission, minority shareholders fleeing from
Printemps or simply on a world-wide dodge, trying to scape from tax?
According to my Peter Scott book, the French Partridge has the status of
'resident.' A change of domicile would be no help. Scott also remarks that
its habits are 'catholic.' Here, perhaps, lay the answer: A catholic mission
to old English vicarages, conducted in twilight with two tame females in
tow.
Perhaps it began as something of the sort, but by late July the three had
become five. Scythe-whetting sounded stridently and I watched the manoeuvres
with apprehension. While Derrida grated on among the lilacs, the four would
fan out in twos, keeping low, hugging the ground, and obeying that truly
French rule in a country which might mind: let the woman go first.
In English gardens, twilight during summer is supposed to be a hint of
heaven. In mine, throughout August, it was a time for combat manoeuvres,
conducted by ornithological walkie-talkies being held out of sight. I was
brought up never to shoot in the garden and never to shoot birds which
refused to fly. When they trampled on the tobacco plants and roughed up the
agapanthus, I did wonder if a catapult would kill a moving target.
Suddenly, they have gone. Or, rather, the four combat-trainees have
vanished, leaving Derrida on the look-out for another captive audience in
the lonely, deconstructed world. Whatever they have practised, they know how
to execute: vicarage-trained agents are out there, somewhere, back on the
run among their fellow Frenchmen.
I cannot help noticing that three days after they left, the French polls for
the Great Vote took a nasty lurch towards Non. Perhaps the ground-workers
are now in position, risking nothing flighty but running the legs off the
opposition. In the half-light, among the first autumn asters, I may be
over-interpreting, but it is easy to hear a word like Maastricht in a sound
like a scythe being sharpened along the blade.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Gardening: Believing in life everlasting - Arthur Hellyer
considers plants grown primarily for drying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS HAS been a remarkable year for everlasting flowers. In part, this was
because there was a very large trial of these in the Royal Horticultural
Society gardens at Wisley, Surrey - a total of 274 species and varieties,
many new to me. But I also found them much in evidence when I visited trials
by some of the seed firms, including Unwins and Suttons. This, I was told,
was because of increasing interest by home gardeners.
Flower arrangers already are seeking much greater variety. At Wisley, there
were 10 varieties of nigella, the pretty, cornflower-like Love-in-a-Mist of
which the old favourite, Miss Jekyll (now available in separate colours of
blue, rose and white) is still the best. There was also the popular mix of
colours sold as Persian Jewels.
I would have regarded all of these normally as mainly flowers for the border
and for cutting fresh, not drying; but evidently they are very good for
that, too. The same goes for the seven varieties of annual larkspur on show.
But the true everlastings, the plants that always have been grown primarily
for drying because of their chaffy petals, were still on view most widely.
There were 64 varieties of helichrysum, filling several beds and making a
most impressive display. I particularly liked Bright Bikini Mixed, which is
a fine mixture of most of the available colours, but I would award even
higher marks to Hot Bikini, which is entirely dark red and a little shorter
in height.
There was also a very pretty pale sulphur-yellow variety called Frosted
Sulphur, which is in some of the seed catalogues, plus a big selection of
other separate colours from white through lemon-yellow and orange to silvery
rose and rose pink.
Until I saw this trial, ammobium had been no more than a name to me. It
turns out to be a rather odd-looking plant, around 2 ft high with winged
stems and small yellow and white, daisy-type flowers.
At first sight I thought it rather gaunt, but it improved on acquaintance
and is certainly a plant that will bring an unusual element into any flower
arrangement. It is a perennial but usually is raised annually from seed and
will survive mild winters outdoors. Ammobium alatum seems to be the only
species, and Grandiflorum the best variety to grow.
I can understand the enthusiasm for gomphrena, popularly known as the Globe
Amaranth. This is a bushy annual, up to 2 ft high with small, globe-shaped
clusters of flowers which, at a short distance, look rather like those of
clover. There are two species: Gomphrena Globusa, which is a true annual,
and G. haageana, which is a perennial grown almost invariably as an annual.
As plants for cut flowers, there does not seem a lot to choose between them.
Colours include pink, red, apricot-orange, purple, violet and white, and
most flower arrangers probably will be suited best by a mixture of all these
shades.
What gardeners usually call statice is, in fact, limonium. There were many
varieties of these at Wisley, mainly forms of Limonium sinuatum which is the
commonest annual kind. What struck me was the number of unusual colours,
especially in shades of pink.
One was called Apricot, which describes it fairly well, but another called
Peach was named less happily (still, breeders must be allowed some latitude
in this respect). A third that I rate highly was called Roseum Superbum and
there also was an excellent variety of the odd-looking L. suworowii, named
Pink Pokers, which was a good, deep, rosy pink.
What I liked most, though, was a very small white-flowered plant called L.
sinense Confetti. The second name does not seem to be recognised by any
authority, but Confetti should be sufficient for identification and I have
come across it in the Unwin seed trials. It is very free-flowering, and the
effect is rather like that of a single-flowered perennial gypsophila.
There was also some confusion at Wisley in the naming of amaranthus,
different species of which are known by gardeners as Love Lies Bleeding and
Prince's Feather. Both types are popular for summer bedding, the first
having long trails of catkin-like flowers, the second with erect branch
spikes of flowers.
Once again, it is safe to bypass the second botanical names and go direct to
the garden name since, by the internationally approved rules governing such
matters, each of these can apply only to one distinct variety.
Using this shorthand form of naming, I have no doubt that the three best
varieties of Prince's Feather at Wisley were Oeschberg, which is deep
crimson, grows 4 ft high and makes a bushy plant; Red Cathedral, which is
very much like Oeschberg; and Bronze Standard, an unusual colour described
as grey-bronze.
The best Love Lies Bleeding was Viridis, with long trails of green flowers;
but for those who lack room for such a large plant, there was Green Thumb,
with erect 12in spikes of green flowers. I had not seen this before and
thought it very distinctive.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Is sunset still a golden sea, and is there honey still for
tea?: Teresa McLean spent a summer day watching cricket in Madingley. The
scene looks as it did when Rupert Brooke wrote of the village in his poem
The Old Vicarage, Grantchester. But the sport has changed subtly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PHILISTINES commenting on cricket reduce its subtleties to complexity.
People commenting on village cricket, however much they like it, can see its
existence from only one of two viewpoints.
Either village cricket today is just a romantic hangover from a golden age
which will never return, or it is still going strong, as it always has done,
on the village green, complete with dilapidated pavilion and bespectacled
vicar.
The facts of village cricket life do the sport proud by being both subtle
and simple. On the whole, village cricket is flourishing; but, strictly
speaking, it is also fading. I went to Madingley, a village near Cambridge,
to learn about its cricket at first hand and was richly rewarded.
The match was between Madingley and a pair of villages called Swaffham Prior
and Swaffham Bulbeck which joined their two teams into one, Swaffham, about
10 years ago. 'We'd have gone out of existence otherwise,' their captain
told me cheerfully.
He and a couple more Swaffham stalwarts declared themselves to be 'all going
over the hill together.' They are in their early 40s, generous and
liquid-loving in appearance.
Hardly any of the team live in the village but pretty well all of them
originally came from it. The captain, like most of his troops, keeps cricket
as his chief connection with the village and regards himself as a Swaffham
man.
Many modern village teams are local rather than village sides, with players
from nearby estates, industrial and factory settlements and from
neighbouring villages unable to support an XI. Amalgamation is common,
especially where villages have shrunk to shells of their former selves.
Where they have become weekend homes for people working in towns, they use
their weekend villages for weekend cricket.
This means the romantic tradition of the blacksmith bowling hell for
leather, the vicar leaving in mid-spin for vespers and the lord of the manor
turning up when least wanted is becoming a more pragmatic tradition, bent on
survival.
Madingley's scorer, Dennis Teversham, a man of few words but great thoughts,
is a fund of detailed information on the club's history. For him, changing
cricket populations are nothing new.
He sat on the pavilion balcony with an extinct pipe and a panting dog,
releasing little flurries of facts during quiet patches of play. After 30
overs, with Swaffham 150 for two, I had learnt a bit. Two overs later, with
Swaffham 168 for six, Madingley's morale had risen and scoring was busy. I
had time to reflect on what I had been told.
Madingley cricket club was founded in 1913, died in the Great War, was
re-founded in 1933, died in the second world war, was re-founded in
conjunction with nearby Dry Drayton village, then refounded yet again, on
its own, in 1958.
Swaffham's green-capped top scorer was caught by Teversham's son for 103 and
Teversham Snr neared a smile. Forty years of playing and 20 years of scoring
have taught him that it is better to be philosophical than to be pleased.
The game bore him out. The Madingley ground is gorgeous, snuggled in hills,
surrounded by meadows, trees and undergrowth. It is overlooked by farms, the
village church and the village pub. It boasts a surface which is a force of
nature in favour of bowlers and - presumably - of those most familiar with
its dangers.
It is a steeply tilted set of medieval ridges and furrows, the only
consolation for batsmen being that these are parallel to the wicket, not
across it to detonate bouncers.
A constable bowler made his way slowly up the hill and reached the crease
just about fit enough to deliver the ball, mildly. A thin young bowler tore
down the hill and bowled furiously, then followed through with unstoppable
momentum, almost as fast as the ball.
He was one of three generations of Tevershams involved in the match. In
Madingley at least, village cricket's time-honoured feature of family
dynasties is in good form. The youngest, fastest, 14-year-old Teversham was
playing alongside his brother and his father, the captain, while his
grandfather (71) scored and his mother and grandmother did the teas.
The teens are a surprisingly fertile age for village cricketers, thanks to
determined programmes of encouragement from organisations such as the NCA
(National Cricket Association) and the Lord's Taverners. Parents from 40
upwards rejoice in their role as the bastions of experience. Often it is 20
and 30-year-olds who are the scarcest, with a sense of village cricket only
as a rare and distant entertainment.
One of the nicest things about village cricket is that it is still an
entertainment. Its gloriously informal atmosphere does not seem to have been
stiffened by the advent of the regional leagues. These organise almost all
village cricket now, making for more regular and more evenly-matched
fixtures.
Madingley had lost their last game by one run to Fulbourn village. But they
made a more substantial job of their defeat in the game we saw: Swaffham
191; Madingley 112.
'We was walloped,' said Teversham, but he regards the North Cambridgeshire
League, in which Madingley play, as neither here nor there.
For local women, village cricket is, as it always has been, regular,
entertaining and, almost always, non-playing. The glories of the pavilion
range from trimmed sandwiches and cups of tea, with paper napkins alongside,
to the more unpredictable sort.
The huge six that redistributed the kitchen window into the food recently
was not unusual. The cows that wandered into the pavilion the evening before
the game two weeks ago were more of a challenge. The lady with 20 years'
Madingley tea service to her credit smiled grimly. 'You never seen such a
mess in your life.' There is no trace of it now. She shook her head in
tandem with her mother-in -law, a veteran of 30 years' tea service.
Their efforts were worth it. Every tea needs its pavilion and Madingley's is
a paragon of cricketing initiative. It used to belong to Queen's College,
but when Queen's built a new one in the early 1960s, Madingley Cricket
Club's secretary, Ron Martin, zoomed in as from the covers and bought it for
a snip.
He organised his team into a convoy of tractors and a trailer to move the
dismantled bits and pieces to the Madingley ground. Every piece was numbered
and on arrival they were fitted together like a jigsaw.
Madingley are a friendly lot and drink with anyone who wants to join them in
the pub after the match. When I asked Dennis Teversham what was his golden
age with his village cricket, he didn't escape into the past.
'Well, it's got to be now . . . I'm retired . . . here I am in the sun,
watching cricket with friends from my village and from the other villages.
What better?'

FT  12 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: Gadgets and gizmos for the techno-freak -
The latest electronic offerings to make the most of a push-button life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GARDEN parasol is back in the shed, the photographs from Paradise Isle
have long been filed, or stuffed into boxes, and many people will be in low
spirits as they come to grips with post-holiday blues.
Not to despair. This autumn promises a number of sophisticated electronic
gadgets to carry anyone away on a flight of fantasy, or at the least, to
inject a buzz into the routine of everyday life.
In all sectors of consumer electronics, manufacturers have been inventing
gadgets to rekindle some spark in demand after what has been, for them, a
lacklustre few years. In the months to come we can expect to see a number of
exciting new products, as well as a range of improvements to familiar ones
that will make life a lot more entertaining . . .
AUDIO
Top of the list must be the range of portable audio products being
introduced by Philips and Sony this autumn. These will feature compact disc
quality hi-fi sound and have caused something of a stir in the industry.
Digital Compact Cassette - or DCC, as it is more commonly known - is a
digital audio cassette developed by Philips which should replace
conventional analogue cassette tape recorders. The rival to DCC being
launched by Sony in November is the MiniDisc, best described as a small CD.
Both formats will enable CD enthusiasts to carry the crisp and clear sound
of CDs with them when they are out and about without worrying about 'sound
skipping', the jogs and jumps that can occur with conventional portable CD
players. They can also be used to record CD-quality sound.
The DCC tape will be enclosed in a protective case, so those with children
need not worry about little sticky fingers pulling their favourite Mozart
tape out all over your living room floor. The MiniDisc is also in a
protective case for easier portability.
The benefit of DCC is that it will also play conventional analogue
cassettes, as well as the new digital ones. As for MiniDisc, the biggest
advantage it has over DCC is that it offers random access - the ability to
skip from any one track to another.
The crucial question for both, however, is whether there will be sufficient
recorded music to play on the new equipment when it is launched, although
both Philips and Sony are confident that there will be 'hundreds' of titles
available on each format at the launch date.
The digital tapes and MiniDiscs are expected to retail at prices similar to
CDs but Philips and Sony have not announced European prices for the portable
units.
For the home-based audio enthusiast, the most exciting product on offer in
the coming season is the wide-imaging stereo loudspeaker manufactured by
Canon. Unlike conventional stereo speakers, Canon's WIS speakers provide
stereo sound regardless of where you physically are in the room. With
conventional speakers, the stereo effect is only available within a limited
area, known as the 'hot spot,' where sounds from each speaker overlap.
Anywhere else, what you hear sounds as if it were coming only from the
closest speaker.
Canon says that its wide-imaging speakers give a stereo effect over an area
at least six times larger than conventional box loudspeakers. It is
introducing a new consumer model at the consumer, rather than professional,
price of Pounds 149.95.
Those who are perfectly happy with their existing CD player might however
fall for a useful little accessory: a CD lens cleaner.
CD players are fitted with tiny lenses which focus the laser beam that reads
the signals off a compact disc. When the CD player begins skipping or
stuttering most people assume that something is wrong with the machine, but
it is more likely that the CD lens has become dirty. A lens cleaner can
solve the problem.
The latest product offering from a Japanese company called Tarsun an
ordinary CD, but with what looks rather like a tiny brush on one side of the
disc.
It is known affectionately by its UK distributors, Strong UK, as the 'rens
creaner.' When played, a sweet female voice explains how it should be used.
The language, which is undeniably English, sounds strangely like Japanese.
TELEVISIONS
Portable TVs have proved very popular among those who want to watch their
favourite football match while en route to the next meeting.
Citizen, the Japanese company better known for its watches, will launch a
portable colour TV and video monitor with a 4 in liquid crystal display
(LCD) screen later this month in the UK. Citizen's model will have a
built-in hood to keep light - either sunlight or artificial - from
reflecting off the screen, which can make it impossible to see anything. It
will retail for Pounds 249.99.
Another handy portable TV is Toshiba's multi-standard LCD TV, due to hit UK
stores next month. This handsome portable can receive pictures in almost any
country except France, which has a unique TV broadcasting system called
SECAM-L. Although at Pounds 599.99, more expensive than the Citizen, the
Toshiba will be attractive to the business executive who travels outside the
UK.
CAMCORDERS
TV compatability problems aside, the French, like many of us, have taken to
home movie making in a big way - as anyone who spent the summer on a French
beach will have noticed.
For the coming season Akai, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, is
bringing out a camcorder - or rather a palmcorder, since it fits your palm -
that is even more intelligent than the hi-tech models already on the market.
Akai's new model has a horizontal shape which makes it easier to use with
both hands in order to minimise picture shake. An auto-chase focus function
focuses the camera on the chosen subject even if it strays out of the centre
of the viewfinder. It is priced at Pounds 599.
Meanwhile, Sony has taken the amateur moving-making industry a step further
with the introduction of its colour video printer, which can take still
photographs from a home movie. The printer, which will produce pictures from
a camcorder, video recorder or even a TV broadcast, is perfect for sending
Granny those wonderful shots of the new baby wrecking her cot, although at a
cost of Pounds 999.99 in the UK it is largely for the enthusiast.
CD SPINOFFS
One of the most promising growth areas in consumer electronics is in the
field of CD spinoffs. To most of us, compact discs are merely a music
recording medium. But manufacturers have been busy finding different
applications for the versatile discs which can hold vast amounts of
information, from sound, text and graphics to video.
Sony created the Data man, essentially an electronic book, which was
launched in the UK this summer. The Data Discman gives the user instant
access to a vast quantity of visual information stored on a CD-sized disc.
So, if you are travelling on business to Tokyo, do not burden yourself with
a phrase book, a book on Japanese table manners, a guide to Japanese
restaurants and another on Japanese country spas. Just take a Data Discman
and a few slim discs, each capable of holding the equivalent information
contained in 200 telephone directories, which should provide you with all
the information you will need. The Discman, which costs Pounds 349, can also
play ordinary audio CDs.
Philips's offering is the CD-I, a heftier machine which resembles a computer
games machine, electronic book CD-player and computer all rolled into one.
The CD-I, which hooks up to the TV and audio set, allows users to manipulate
material on screen, ranging from text, animation and video. The UK price of
Pounds 599 is likely to fall since Philips has recently reduced the price
from Dollars 900 to Dollars 600 in the US.
Kodak, meanwhile, has its photo-CD machine which allows you to store your
pictures on a CD-disc and look at them on television. It may be about time
to say good-bye to all those boxes full of old, crumpled photographs. The
Photo-CD costs Pounds 299.
MOBILE PHONES
If greater convenience, rather than enhanced entertainment, is your goal,
consider Sony's new mobile phone handset, due to be launched for use on
Cellnet's consumer cellular phone service this autumn for Pounds 299.99.
The first handset targeted at consumers, rather than business users, it is
an attractive, easy-to-use mobile phone that would fit easily into a
handbag, It will be sold by high street retailers rather than through
specialist service providers which currently handle all mobile phone sales.
PERSONAL ORGANISERS
At the more business-oriented end of the market, or for those who just like
to keep things organised, electronic personal organisers are just the thing.
Sharp's IQ range, for example, with its choice of software from the Bible to
video games, is an attractive product.
Sharp's range costs from Pounds 179.99 for a standard model which can take
1,070 telephone numbers to Pounds 259.99 for a more powerful one that can
hold over 5,500 telephone However, unless you are the organising type to
begin with, and unless you are happy to deal with a tiny keyboard, it might
be best to wait until the much-publicised personal organisers that will
allow you to use a pen, rather than a keyboard, become available next year.

FT  12 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: Restaurants hit back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLOOM that was settling earlier this year over that privileged group,
professional restaurant reviewers, seems to be lifting.
Many restaurateurs are responding to the need for smaller bills by offering
more Italian food. Although the Forte group has installed Nico Ladenis in
Nico at Ninety (tel: 409-1290; all numbers should be prefixed with 071) at
the Grosvenor House, revamped the Criterion Brasserie (925-090) on
Piccadilly Circus with Bob Payton, and appointed Helmut Berger as the head
chef at the Cafe Royal (439-6320) it has also launched what it calls a
family of Italian restaurants around London which includes Tutto] W2
(724-4637), Scarto] SW1 (222-3338) and Issimo] EC3 (623-3616).
Other restaurants offering good value include a new brasserie at 190
Queensgate, SW7 (581-5666) specialising in fish instead of the former
expensive restaurant; Calzone in NW3 (794-6775) and W11 (243-2003) The
Boulevard in WC2 (240-2992) Brasserie Lott, SW3 (584-4484); and Wagamama,
WC2 (323-9223) offering reasonably priced Japanese food.
Two pubs have sensibly decided to put small dining areas to more profitable
use: The French Dining Room has opened above the French House in Dean
Street, WI (437-2477) and The Lansdowne operates as a sister to Farringdon
Road's Eagle in Gloucester Avenue, NW1 (483-0409).
New and prospective restaurateurs are being encouraged not so much by any
upturn in consumer spending but rather by the weakness of the property
market. High premiums have always been a new restaurant's first financial
hurdle and the rent is the highest of any restaurant's fixed costs. Today,
however, it is a buyer's market, at least for the brave.
The Argyll (352-0025), which opened earlier this year on the Kings Road,
managed to pay no premium at all and keep refurbishment costs to Pounds
120,000.
Banks and receivers, not normally known as a restaurateurs' best friends,
are now taking a more kindly attitude as they try to dispose of sites that
have succumbed to the recession. Hence, Lexington will soon reopen on the
old Soho site of Sutherlands, and Beauchamp Place in place of the old Menage
a Trois.
Martin Lam, formerly head chef at L'Escargot, will together with his wife,
be opening his own restaurant at Ransome's Dock, Battersea (223-1611) on the
site of the former Le Chausson.
The restaurants' future success will depend on how and whether they can pass
these financial benefits on to their customers. The most dramatic example of
how the British restaurant goer may benefit comes from New York.
Faced with empty tables over a long hot summer, some 50 New York
restaurants, including some of the top names, such as Le Perigord, Gotham
Bar and Grill and Bouley, came together at the instigation of Tim Zagat,
restaurant guide publisher and Joe Baum, restaurateur, and offered
three-course lunches at a fixed price of Dollars 19.92 (Pounds 10) excluding
tax and service.
The campaign, launched in mid-July ,brought restaurant madness back to New
York and was continued at some restaurants until early this month. It filled
tables and, although it may not have generated substantial profits, created
a lot of goodwill.
According to Bryan Miller, food critic of The New York Times, the long-term
legacy may be more creative marketing by restaurants - discounts, pre- or
post-theatre or ethnic themes - and repeat customers in the quiet months
after Christmas. But, in the short term, the event has reminded New York
restaurateurs of something fundamental: restaurant goers are voracious for
bargains. A maxim, I would argue, equally valid on both sides of the
Atlantic.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Fashion: Down and out in London but not in Paris - Whatever
you wear in the French capital make sure it's immaculate, says Alice
Rawsthorne, who has been scouring the city for bargains
</HEADLINE>

WHEN Dan Walker was a solicitor in London he had no choice concerning what
he wore to work. 'It had to be a suit, darkish, with a quiet tie. If I'd
worn anything else I'd have been sent straight home.'
Now he works as a film lawyer in Paris. 'It's completely different. I wear
linen suits in summer and a blazer with trousers in winter. If I don't have
client meetings I go the office in jeans. I also wear lots of colour -
greens and reds - that I'd never have worn in London.'
Style is something that Parisians take seriously, very seriously, much more
so than their London counterparts. Everyone, male and female, is expected to
take an intelligent interest in the way they look. The difference in dress
is probably most marked for men.
There is no gallic equivalent to the sober-suited City of London uniform, as
a glance at the male members of the French cabinet - Jack Lang, the Thierry
Mugler-clad arts minister, or Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the
Socialist party, in his chic linen jackets - attests.
France's female politicians - Elisabeth Guigou, minister for European
affairs, in Chanel and Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, in Torrente
 -are just as colourful. Although the dress code for women is probably more
rigid in Paris than London.
'Women here are far smarter,' says Lady Sara Fergusson, who has lived in
Paris for five years since her husband, Sir Ewen, became British ambassador.
'But they are often less imaginative. There is definitely a uniform.'
The uniform for the haute bourgeoise ladies who lunch at the glossy
restaurants along Avenue Montaigne, La Maison Blanche and L'Avenue, is a
Guigouesque combination of Chanel suits with short(ish) skirts and the
sheerest tights. They may gossip about the new long skirts they saw at the
fashion shows, but they would not dream of wearing them.
But short skirts are out in Bohemian Paris. There was barely a shin in sight
at the Marais art gallery openings last Saturday that marked the start of
the autumn arts season. Any legs which were not hidden behind long hemlines
were swathed in black leather.
Whatever you wear in Paris it must be immaculate. One day I went to cut some
ivy from the riverbank beneath my apartement on the Ile Saint-Louis. I
dressed for the task - an old catsuit, Levi jacket and fashionably, or so I
thought, battered Gucci loafers. I stopped off at a cafe for a coffee and
croissant only to I realise that I did not have enough money. The patronne
brought the coffee and croissant explaining - with a sympathetic smile
presumably saved for paupers - that it was free as I looked 'thin and
hungry'.
When my colleague, Will Dawkins, moved to Paris from the FT's Brussels
bureau, he took a favourite tie to his local dry cleaner. He returned to
find it torn into pieces. The cleaner said he could not possibly have
cleaned it as the tie was 'dead' and he had done Will a favour by
dismembering the corpse. Dan Walker remembers his Parisian girlfriend
howling with horror at his shoes. 'She said they were filthy. She was right.
No one had noticed in London."
The consolation is that it is easy to dress well in Paris. The city is
crammed with dry cleaners, cobblers, seamstresses and couturiers. 'What I
miss most of all are the seamstresses and cleaners,' says Natalia Fawcett,
who recently returned to London after five years in Paris where her husband,
Edmund, was correspondent for The Economist. 'Paris shops always alter
whatever you buy so it fits perfectly and dry cleaners tell you exactly how
they plan to treat your clothes.'
Paris also has more shops to choose from. The areas around avenue Montaigne,
rue Faubourg Saint-Honore, place des Victoires and rue de Grenelle are
packed with designer stores. And the city abounds with bargains. Jane
Cattani works for Christian Dior where she has the pick of the collection,
but she also scouts around Agne B. and the La Redoute mail order catalogue
for 'cheap fillers'.
Lady Fergusson favours Givenchy for grand occasions, but browses around the
department stores for 'everyday things'. Natalia Fawcett bought most of her
Parisian clothes from the degriffe shops at place d'Italie, where the
designers sell leftovers from previous seasons at a fraction of the original
price.
The biggest bargains are the soldes prives to which designers invite
faithful customers. These are held on the eve of the normal sales so you
have the pick of the bargains and prices are lower. The only hitch is the
queue. One friend arrived at Christian Lacroix to be told by the doorman
that it would be at least three hours before she could enter the shop.
I queued for an hour at the Yohji Yamamoto men's solde prive to pay for blue
trousers 'ordered' by a friend in London. At home I realised they were
black, not blue. A Parisian would not have chosen the wrong colour.

A 17-year-old girl called Indumathi from Madras was about to change her name
as well as her address. As is the way for most Indian women, she was - in
accordance with the wishes of her parents - to marry a man she had barely
met and to live in a city, Bangalore, she did not know.
The marriage, as it turned out, proved a happy one. True love, Indumathi
explained, grows from mutual understanding and is not something experienced
by the likes of starry-eyed teenagers.
There had, she acknowledged, been a hitch. For all the diligent preparations
undertaken by her parents, for all the dowry calculations, all the
interviews with families of prospective grooms, for all the consultations
with astrologers, gossiping with neighbours and discussions with marriage
brokers, one detail had been overlooked.
Indumathi, which means 'Full Moon,' was to be married to a Mr Chander
Shekar, or 'Mr Crescent Moon.' She was to become irrevocably wedded to the
name Mrs Full Moon Crescent Moon.
Nearly 20 years later, Indumathi was still not entirely reconciled with her
bilunar name, which even now causes her to wince and chuckle deeply. The
moon, however, has smiled on her. Since her marriage she had become a
successful tourist guide based in Bangalore and had taken many well-known
people around the country, including the late film producer Sir David Lean,
during the making of A Passage To India.
Mrs Full Moon Crescent Moon was to guide our Bales group through southern
India, a region often overlooked by the hurried traveller. Our tour got
underway in Madras, India's fourth largest city and the place of Indumathi's
birth.
Madras, where the British East India Company got its first clawhold on the
subcontinent, is reputedly more sedate than the cities of the north, but
there was little evidence of this in the mayhem of its streets.
Ten centuries of transport co-exist on the Madras roads, a burden that often
proves too much judging by the twisted hulks of lorries littering the
wayside. Each stretch of pock-marked tarmac carries swaying bullock carts as
well as Morris Oxfords, creaking rickshaws as well as thundering buses,
zipping motor scooters as well as human ants meandering under the weight of
overlarge bundles.
Navigation is not a visual affair. Most vehicles have dispensed with
mirrors, which are seen as unnecessary appendages, rather as humans have
dispensed with their tails. Instead, motorists manoeuvre by reference to
sound, slowing and swerving as dictated by the cacophony of horns, bells and
hooters. A hint of regulation is provided courtesy of the cream coloured
cows - the so called 'break inspectors' - which wander nonchalantly across
even the busiest intersection.
At night, the only visual aids are the trees flanking the roadside, painted
with white rings to reflect headlight beams. Mrs Full Moon Crescent Moon was
amused by my alarm at the traffic and crowds. She thought it funny to read
in the British press of a 'large crowd' - say 30,000 - attending a sporting
event.
She could produce this many people by ploughing her car into the back of a
rickshaw. That is how many onlookers would instantly gather around. I asked
her not to demonstrate.
Next stop on the Full Moon tour was Bangalore, Indumathi's new home and, by
all accounts, India's pleasantest conurbation. The airport welcomed arrivals
to the 'garden city,' a booming centre for high technology, cosmopolitan
culture and Indian yuppies. Bangalore has boulevards, working traffic
lights, passably uncrowded streets and even a botanical garden. It also has
pubs.
That night in Pub World, a plasticy Wild West theme bar, Bangalore's
swinging set were seated on mock logs, pressing their often substantial
bellies against the bar-top. They drank over-priced bottles of beer and
smoked long cigarettes. There were mixed couples, rare in India, and western
music, rarer still.
The PA system struck up with Bachelor Boy by Cliff Richard. A middle-aged
gentleman with a drooping moustache and a turmeric-stained kipper tie
shouted out the lyrics to his male companion in animated fashion. In a Peter
Sellers-type rasp he enunciated the words 'Happ-ee to be a bach-elor boy
un-til my dy-ing day,' winking and breaking into tremendous laughter at the
wit of the lyrics.
Such salacious behaviour was not in evidence in Kerela, the first state in
the world freely to elect a communist government and our last stop on the
Full Moon itinerary. Kerela has the highest literacy rate in India, the most
equitable distribution of land, the highest suicide rate and the greatest
incidence of death from marauding elephants.
The south-western state, communism notwithstanding, adheres to the system of
arranged marriages predominant in the rest of the country. Engels would not
have approved, but Mr N B Manju, an effusive and good-natured Kerelan, saw
no drawbacks to a system that had delivered him a skinny wife and a fat
dowry.
He explained how things worked in Cochin, Kerela's chief port. Parents with
a daughter of marriagable age, he said, employ the services of a marriage
broker whom they furnish with information on the girl's status, caste, job,
horoscope, appearance and size of dowry on offer.
The broker matches these details with similar data relating to eligible
young men. A meeting between boy and girl is arranged. Parents, uncles,
aunts, nephews, friends, grandparents and assorted human flotsam gather for
the five-minute interview.
Manju noted that such visits are so perfunctory that a well-organised family
can fit in three or four sessions in an afternoon. A decision is then made -
by the young man and his parents - as to which courtship to pursue. The
girl, too, Manju assured me, could call a halt to events.
More romantic visits ensue, with perhaps only 10 relatives in attendance.
Eventually the families agree on marriage arrangements, but not before
employing the services of an astrologer to evaluate the match. A thumbs-down
from him can put the kibosh on everything. If you were really keen on the
girl, though, most astrologers had their price.
It is hard to imagine, during the to-ing and fro-ing of such a saga, how the
parents of Indumathi could have neglected to inquire about the surname of
the prospective groom.
David Pilling travelled c/o Bales Tours (Bales House, Junction Road,

FT  12 SEP 92 / Travel: Japan's Alps - trekking among the gods - Christopher
McCooey enjoys hot outdoor baths, staying in mountain huts and watching the
sun rise while hiking in Japan's North Alps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
I WAS at 5,000ft and taking a bath with a stranger.
'Are you America?' he asked.
'No, I'm from England,' I said, sounding like a school master.
'Ah so,' he said, bobbing his head vigorously just above water. 'My name is
Taniguchi. I am 40 years old.'
Many conversations start like this in Japan even when you are in hot water,
outdoors and higher than Ben Nevis. I was half-way into a 10-day walking
tour through the North Alps of Japan and was enjoying the soak after a hard
day. I was following in the footsteps of an English vicar who had been that
way in the summer of 1894.
The Rev Walter Weston had gone to Japan in 1888 as a missionary. He ended up
spending three extended periods in the country and wrote four books about
Japan, including the classic Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese
Alps.
He is best remembered for introducing the notion of recreational
mountaineering to Japan and opening local eyes to the beauty of Japan's
mountains - a noteworthy thing for a foreigner to have done, particularly as
he looked at the beauties of the mountains with only one eye. For all of his
long life - he died at the age of 79 in 1940, just before the outbreak of
the Pacific War - Weston was blind in one eye.
I asked Taniguchi san if he knew about Weston. 'Of course,' he said without
hesitation. 'Father of mountaineering. There is memorial in Kamikochi.'
Kamikochi, twinned with Grindelwald in Switzerland, was where I was heading,
having started, like Weston, at the spa of Renge Onsen in the north of the
mountain range that runs north-south through the middle of the main island
of Honshu.
Cars and buses can reach Renge, and the trail I was going to follow started
in front of the primitive collection of wooden huts and cabins that housed
the spa's indoor baths and sleeping accommodation. With my water bottle full
of cold, sweet black tea, I set off after a breakfast of rice, dried
seaweed, raw egg, pickles and miso soup. If that is not your idea of how to
start a day in the mountains then you will have to carry your own instant
coffee and porridge and a small stove on which to prepare them.
Japan's mountains are steep and in the hiking season (May to October) it can
get warm in the day-time. But the cool of the mountains is a relief from the
sauna-hot cities. You sweat a lot, so I was grateful for a neck-towel and a
wide-brimmed hat and a map that showed the trail and indicated where
drinking water was available.
There is luxuriant vegetation up to about 6,500ft. Above 8,000ft bare rock
is usually broken into slabs and chunks by freezing and thawing and other
weathering.
The first peak I scaled was Shirouma, the white horse mountain. It was
pretty crowded on top as the mountain is accessible by cable car from
Hakuba, one of the most popular ski resorts in Japan. Almost everyone I met
in the mountains greeted me with 'Konichiwa]' ('Hello]') or 'Ganbatte]'
('Keep going]').
A group of students asked me to join them for a 'memorial' photograph on the
9,620ft summit. It was the first of many such requests during my hike.
Snap-happy Japanese will urge you to say 'Cheezu]' and ask you to 'pozu,'
which usually means raising two fingers in a Churchillian gesture.
The trails are usually well marked, and there are plenty of huts where you
can get food and shelter for the night; a mattress and duvet are supplied
but it is a good idea to take a sheet-style sleeping bag. Accommodation and
two meals costs about Pounds 25. There are also camp-sites that charge about
Pounds 2 a night.
The second day's hike was the hardest. I dropped down more than 6,500ft from
the exposed alpine peaks around Shirouma into a narrow valley verdant with
maple, oak, beech, willow and birch. The whole valley seemed to hum and buzz
with insect life in contrast to the silence of the peaks above.
The map said there was a hot spring in the valley - the symbol looks like an
upside-down jellyfish, steam rising from a pool. Beside the mountain hut at
Babadani were some hot baths, but I walked a bit further up the valley to
where I had seen steam rising from the river bank.
I stripped off and felt my way into the river, finding just the right place
so that my buttocks did not boil and my toes were not tortured by the
ice-cold melt-water. White-rumped swifts swooshed for one last snack before
roost time and a dipper and a grey wagtail bobbed and bowed before retiring.
The next day I hiked along the Rurobe river valley. Much of the time the
trail is an old mining track hewn out of sheer rock on the side of the gorge
cut by the river. In places there are vertical drops of several hundred
feet, but fixed chains and metal bridges are reassuring. I camped the night
near the old mine shaft cut horizontally into the mountain, following a
silver vein.
From the mine it was quite a pull to reach the outdoor spring where I met
Taniguchi san. The place was Senninyu - 'hermit's hot water' - named after
an ascetic who lived in a cave there five centuries ago.
Crossing a snow field, I thought I had encountered the hermit himself: a man
wearing a traditional bamboo strip hat and a kimono of black cotton. There
was a samurai's sword stuck in his belt. On his feet were tabi (socks with
the big toe separated from the rest) and straw sandals called waraji. The
only non-Edo era item was a pair of red Y-fronts, visible because he had
hitched up his kimono to facilitate walking.
He was really a salary man in disguise. He told me he hiked in the alps
dressed like that 'to refresh his Japanese spirit and Japanese heart.' The
good reverend would have nodded sagely if he had encountered such a hiker -
Weston used to tie waraji under his hob-nailed boots to improve his grip
when clambering over wet and slippery rock.
In a day I reached Tateyama, just under 10,000ft; next to it is Oyama, one
of the most sacred peaks in Japan. It was over-run by hordes of day-trippers
who had been coached to within striking distance of the summit. There were
toddlers and teenagers wearing T-shirts saying 'Records are made to be
broken but TDK CDs go on for ever' and, more enigmatically, 'Regard me
sexual eyes.' Their parents and grandparents were crowding into the shrine
atop the peak to be blessed by the resident priest who was waving a sacred
wand over them.
In July and August, the peak summer season, no less than 10,000 people visit
this shrine daily. It does a jangling trade, for it seems that every one of
those 10,000 descends to the bus terminal with a charm that has a bell
attached to it.
The tens of thousands who flock to such shrines may not love the mountains
in the same way as the climbers and hikers. But the fact that they risk
sprained ankles and sweat-stained designer clothes is testimony to the power
that mountains still exert on the Japanese. This goes back to the time
(before Weston arrived) when they considered the mountains that cover
two-thirds of their country to be the domain of the gods.
The high spot of my hike, at 10,430ft, was Yarigatake, which Weston referred
to as the Matterhorn of the East. I scrambled to the summit to watch the
sunset and, 11 hours later, the sunrise. Away to the south-east, Fuji rose
out of the clouds.
All that remained for me was to drop down to the valley to pay my respects
at the Weston memorial - a simple plaque on a shady rock with the
bespectacled and dog-collared vicar looking kindly out at the mountains he
loved.
Details about huts and trails can be obtained from Kita Alps Hyutte
Tantosake, Meibundo, Kotsukaikan-nai, 2-13 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo,
tel: 03-3211-1023.
In addition, the Japan National Tourist Organisation at 6-6 Yurakucho
1-Chome, Tokyo, tel: 03-3502-1461, produces pamphlets and short mountain
hiking itineraries in English for the Kamikochi area.
Any Japan Travel Bureau can make reservations for you in the mountain huts,
as well as hotels and inns. Above the treeline you will never be turned away
from a mountain hut if you do not have a reservation, but you may have to
sleep on the floor.
Make sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing for mountain hiking,
particularly if you plan to climb out of the valleys and up to the peaks.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Private View: The hard shell of Tory mercy - Tory MP Emma
Nicholson has adopted the cause of Iraq's Shias. What made her do it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS CAN so easily make us cynical. Their addiction to the oxygen of
publicity makes them compulsive manipulators: they become dial-a-quote
junkies, inveterate photo-opportunists. Their eyes flick anxiously, their
lives are frantic, their self-esteem overpowering.
So when a Member of Parliament adopts a good cause the first question most
of us want to ask is: who benefits?
Emma Nicholson, MP for Devon West and Torridge, adopted the Shia Muslims of
southern Iraq (an area of which she had no previous knowledge) at the end of
the Gulf War. Two weeks ago, after errands of mercy and much public
agitation in Geneva, London and Washington, she had the satisfaction of
seeing George Bush declare a 'no-fly' zone south of Iraq's 32nd parallel.
She also adopted - or is fostering - a 10-year-old Iraqi boy, Amar, who was
badly burned in the napalm attack that killed his parents and whom she
brought to England from a refugee camp in Iran.
Who, in this case, would be so churlish as to ask cui bono? I was the churl.
Aren't troublespots irresistible for an MP who wants attention at home? I
asked her.
'No,' she replied. 'In fact I held back because of that. I don't ever mix up
aid for people in trouble with magnifying their problems for my benefit.'
But there were plenty of people with Middle East experience in the House of
Commons. Why should you jump in? You could be accused of opportunism.
'No. No, because being a do-gooder is basically very boring for other
people. It's not glamorous. It's very dull. People turn away. 'Oh] how
boring,' they think. 'At it again]' I'd already begged money from my
colleagues to adopt a Romanian orphanage.
'No, it couldn't have been more boring. In the middle of the Gulf War I
merely got up and asked the Foreign Secretary what we were going to do about
the victims afterwards. Couldn't be more boring for colleagues. To my
enormous surprise I got a very positive reply.'
She denied that she is a publicity-seeker. 'It's always nice to hurl rotten
eggs, and politicians are the modern world's Aunt Sallies.' She even claimed
to be wary of interviews, especially with women reporters, who, she claimed,
did their damndest to pervert the result. 'I always try to help other women.
I find this incomprehensible.'
Why do they do it? 'Career advancement for themselves. Desire to be cleverer
than the person they are interviewing. I think the only sadness I have about
my sex is that they are constantly sour, and scratch another woman where it
hurts.'
Emma Nicholson is a large, good-looking Tory lady. Her voice would be
described as plummy were it not for a metallic timbre, the only clue to her
serious deafness. She has an imperious manner and it is easy to picture her
playing Lady Bountiful to the raggle-taggle refugees of Iraq and jousting
with those charming Iranian officials ('We have lot of fun. A lot of
intellectual fun . . .').
Is there another, softer Emma Nicholson beneath the well-glazed crust?
She was born into a God-fearing political family, a good musician who got as
far as the Royal Academy of Music before being frustrated by deafness. She
was educated by Anglican nuns at St. Mary's, Wantage. In her twenties she
chose to live as a celibate career girl, first in computer software for ICL,
then in consultancy, then as a fundraiser for Save the Children before
realising her real ambition, to enter Parliament.
She was 45 before she made it. In the same year, 1987, she regularised a
relationship with Michael Caine, the 60-year-old chairman of Booker (of
Booker Prize fame), marrying him when his own 35-year marriage was
dissolved. They depend on earned income and are not spectacularly rich: the
Booker chairman's salary last year was Pounds 72,000. Nicholson kept her own
name and although her husband was knighted a year later she refuses to
answer to 'Lady Caine'.
That does not stop some constituency critics accusing her of playing the
grande dame, alienating local farmers and rarely showing her face. (It was
this same fault in Margaret Thatcher that prompted Nicholson to shift her
allegiance to Michael Heseltine). She claims that most of her constituents
understand and share her concern for the Third World.
Don't people come up to you and say 'What are doing with all these bloody
Muslims; I've got a problem with my cowshed'?
'They don't use the word Muslim. They call them foreigners.' Political
opponents attacked her in this way, and it upset her.
Your constituents might find it difficult to understand your interest in the
Shias and Iran. Don't you think their regime is crazy?
'There are worse things in life than living under a fundamentalist religious
regime - such as being next door under Saddam Hussein. Actually I think
apartheid is worse. I've never been able to visit South Africa in my whole
life. That for me is the bottom line of human degradation. Because at the
end of the day you can change your religion.'
You think religious restraints are more acceptable than others?
'They certainly seem to be restraints that many societies actively seek.
There's little to choose between the fundamental religionists in Iran and
the nuns in Wantage. It's just the other side of the coin.'
Pro bono publico could be the motto on Nicholson's escutcheon. 'Papa was an
MP, Mama was deputy chairman of Dr. Barnardo's. When I went with Papa on his
rounds I saw the rough edges of British life.'
She remembers one children's home in particular. 'They were grotesquely
handicapped, in the days before abortions (Nicholson is pro-abortion). They
were ruled over by a very kind, very bossy lady. I remember clearly standing
beside a child who was grotesquely deformed, poor little thing, who was
actually much older than me but the same height as me, and thinking: My God
I'm lucky] I've got to do something for these people.'
Then why didn't you join the Labour Party?
'Because they would ruin the country. They're based on an economic and
social theory which mercifully has been discredited. Socialism was dug in in
the mid-seventies. That's why I put my name forward. I couldn't bear to
stand on the sidelines any longer with red-blooded Socialism in the saddle.'
Nicholson would not accept that her own deafness motivates her good works:
she would not even allow me to call it a handicap. 'It's no worse than
having to wear glasses,' she said. 'Society's reaction is still odd, a
mixture of prurience and embarrassment.'
Why did you forego marriage and children of your own?
'I meant not to get married. I made that decision in my early twenties.'
What put you off?
'The need to explore the world, what talent I might have . . . I thought no
one would marry me who would be willing to accommodate that.'
Was it the quality of men you met?
'They were perhaps not big-hearted enough for me. Michael minds very much
about everybody.'
What kind of men did you meet? Computer programmers?
'No. Not much. Really the smart circuit.'
Debs' delights?
'Yes, and they weren't my style.'
Chinless wonders?
'Yes, and even some with chins. They were very nice, but they weren't me. I
don't think I was them either.'
No, I agreed, I should think you frightened the pants off them. She laughed.
Do you like the picture of yourself as the intrepid woman in
mosquito-infested parts of the globe? And showing off the photos afterwards?
'No. That is because I'm a woman. Because I always know that I'm too fat.
I'd much rather never see another photograph of myself ever again anywhere.
I always say: 'My goodness me] I wish I was slimmer or prettier'.'
Did you ever wish you were a man?
'I certainly think it would have been a lot easier for me to be a man,
without any doubt at all. But I am a woman, and not a man dressed up as a
woman.'
When finally I asked Emma Nicholson to confess to her ambition, she was
cagey again. Colleagues say she is disappointed not to have got much
further. I suspect that if she is passed over at Westminster she will try
her hand in the bigger theatre of Europe.
Was there anything else?
'I would dearly love to be a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists. I
love playing the organ. And now that I've had my hearing corrected, there's
nothing to stop me.'
Why the organ?
'I love church music; my favourite composer is Bach. I'm not really an
instrumentalist.'
And of course the organ makes a big noise, I said.
'Yes. It's enormous fun. Pull out all the stops. Great fun. Great, great
fun. You can even drown the vicar.' She snorted like a schoolgirl.
Ambition, compassion, public duty and party politics are, I think, all one
to Emma Nicholson. She comes from a background where 'serving' and 'ruling'
are not distinguished. Agreeable as she is, I could not warm to her public
persona. And perhaps this is the real weakness of our politicians: they are
terrified of letting us see the human being within.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Paris? Been there, done that: Why London leaves the French
capital for dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNSEASONABLY chill winds and lashings of rain have not shown London at its
best in the past couple of weeks. Even so, it was irksome to hear a friend
apologising to a visitor from Paris the other day for the existence of a
city so thoroughly depressing.
Why do the British indulge in this perpetual self-flagellation when
comparing their own capital with that of France? William Davis, chairman of
the British Tourist Authority, was at it this week, complaining in his
annual report of a litter-strewn, tired and tarnished city. Yet just to
mention the word Paris is to trigger eulogies in praise of a supposed
earthly paradise.
Guide books, of course, must bear part of the blame. No guide book would
ever open with the words: 'To be honest, Paris is a bit of a dump, and if I
were you I wouldn't bother going there.' If it did, nobody would buy it.
Instead, the book will say Paris is the world's most wondrous city, and no
one who has spent a lot of time and money visiting the place is going to
come back and say the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.
And yet, so much nonsense is talked about Paris. Take its legendary beauty.
True, Paris has a pretty cathedral, a big arch and an amusing metal tower:
but by comparison with London, it is a visual snore. Most of the interesting
bits were demolished during the Second Empire by Baron Haussmann, a
monomaniacal town planning despot who criss-crossed the city with mile after
mile of dreary, soul-less boulevards lined with uniform, grey stone facades.
The result is a kind of 19th century Milton Keynes.
One of the side-effects of Haussmann's demolition campaign was a
displacement of the prosperous classes to new quarters on the city's western
boundaries, leaving the central areas to the poor. Properties were divided
into ever smaller units as landlords sought to maximise rentals, resulting
in the rabbit-hutch style accommodation which so many Parisians now endure.
If only they had gardens, as so many Londoners do, things might not be so
bad. Or if only Haussmann had thought to give Paris the equivalent of
London's glorious parks. As it is, having neither, Parisians seek to lighten
the gloom of their existence through their obsessional ownership of
preposterous toy dogs. These, lacking alternative facilities, leave an
estimated 20 tonnes of dejections on the city's pavements each day.
Of course, one of the delights of Paris is its compact size. It is tiny
compared with London. Given a good pair of wellington boots and a poor sense
of smell, it is possible to walk around the city in a day. But just what is
there left to do then?
Eating is one possibility. Only a moron, after all, would deny that French
cuisine is among the world's finest. Paris, however, is not the place to
savour it: the memory of a good meal is more likely to endure for the
outrageous price charged than for the quality of the food. As for good wine,
search in vain: all the decent stuff goes to Oddbins and Tesco.
After an indifferent meal, it is time for entertainment. Unfortunately,
unless you are a cineaste, you are as likely to find it in Kidderminster as
Paris. London is leagues ahead in virtually all forms of entertainment, be
it drama, classical and contemporary music, dance, opera, fringe theatre,
comedy, popular music or the club scene. Other than cinema, the only field
in which Paris can claim ascendancy is in cabarets featuring topless dancing
girls (most of them English) waving prodigious amounts of feathers.
Indeed, it is hard to imagine what Parisians do in the evening. They cannot
stay in and watch television: it is too unspeakably awful. Their apartments
are too small for entertaining. There are no pubs. Usually, one surmises,
they end up going to see yet another crackly print of an old Jean Luc Godard
film, then spend the next few hours discussing it in some down-at-heel cafe
over a glass of warm lager and 40 Gauloises.
In fairness, Paris does not come out of every comparison badly. It has a lot
more art galleries than London. Its young people do not get drunk and roam
the streets shouting obscenities. The Metro may be filthy, but it works.
Parisians speak much better French than Londoners.
For sheer exuberance, variety and vitality, however, London puts Paris in
the shade. Its only real problem is that Parisians know it, with the result
that the city is overflowing with Parisian tourists. Perhaps there is a case
for doing the place down after all.

FT  12 SEP 92 / A home in the war zone: David Waller meets the exiled
Croatian count who holds the seat of Vukovar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW PEOPLE begin a political career at the age of 70. But Jakob, Count von
und zu Eltz, has good reasons for throwing himself into the electoral fray
as he did in July when he campaigned for, and won with a resounding
majority, the Vukovar seat in the Croatian elections. He wants to go home.
Not that the count is a refugee from the fighting in what used to be
Yugoslavia; nor, as the owner of large estates on the Rhine and a medieval
castle on the Moselle, is he suffering from the material hardship afflicting
so many of those displaced by the war.
However, for this German aristocrat, home is in Croatia, specifically
Vukovar, the town on the Danube that was taken and occupied by Serb forces
in November last year.
Born in 1921, Count Jakob was brought up in an 18th century manor-house in
the centre of the town, the principal residence of the Eltz family since
1733. He left in 1944, returning only in 1989 when it looked as though
Yugoslavia was returning to democracy. He entered into negotiations for the
return of the ancestral property, but his hopes were dashed by the outbreak
of civil war.
The mansion, preserved intact through the centuries, was destroyed late last
year by Serb militia. The count's poster for his election campaign displays
pictures of the mansion before and after the destruction. His slogan was
'Home Together.' His mission is to rebuild the house, to bring the exiled
Croats back to Vukovar.
'I wouldn't have taken the trouble to get myself elected,' he says in
impeccable English learnt from his Irish nanny, 'if I didn't genuinely
believe that this were possible. This is my main political message. You have
to be convinced that we are going to go back, and we are going to rebuild.
If we resign ourselves to what has happened, if we give up hope, the Serbs
will have achieved what they wanted, and the Croatians will have been driven
out of Vukovar for good.'
The Eltz family's connection with the town dates to the time when an
ancestor helped the Holy Roman Emperor expel the Turks from the area. As a
reward, he was allowed to buy the town, 23 villages, 200,000 acres of land
and 31,000 serfs for the sum of 175,000 gold thalers. Thereafter, successive
counts administered the estates on a feudal basis, taking responsibility for
roads, bridges, schools, the judiciary, police, the health system and the
churches.
By the time Count Jakob was born, serfdom had been abolished and the estate
encompassed a mere 20,000 acres. His father died when he was a child and
Count Jakob grew up in what he describes as 'fairly modest style'.
Like his forebears, he spent most of the year in the Vukovar mansion, its
lawns stretching down to the Danube, only going to Germany in the summer
when he would stay on his Rhineland estates, the most magnificent of which
is the Burg Eltz in the Moselle. This many-turreted castle set on a rocky
cliff was built by the count's ancestors in the 12th century and is one of
Germany's most popular attractions.
Its treasure chamber bears witness to the Eltz family's involvement in
German history through the centuries. A picture of the Gothic pile is on the
back of today's DM500 note. But the count, a fluent Croat-speaker, has
always felt himself more Croatian than German, a feeling intensified by
exile.
He was forced to leave Vukovar shortly after the outbreak of World War Two.
But for a fleeting visit shortly before Russian troops arrived in late 1944,
he did not return for 46 years, when he started a succession of visits to
the old family home. After the civil war broke out, each trip became more
dangerous than the last.
'I visited Vukovar a number of times in early 1991,' he says. 'The last time
I managed to get there was when the siege of the town had begun. We had to
break through the ring to get food and medical supplies into town. I must
admit I felt quite foolish. Here I was, an old man, my pockets full of
Mills' bombs and a sub-machine gun around my neck. This, fortunately, I did
not have to use. I did, however, draw heavy artillery and rocket fire on to
my humble person.' The experience, he admits, gave him quite a nostalgic
feeling: he had not been under such heavy fire since his days in the
Wehrmacht during World War Two.
Since then, his adventures have been political rather than military. He has
thrown himself behind the Croatian cause and won his seat in the
parliament-in-exile as an independent candidate. 'I can do more as an MP,'
the German aristocrat bellows down the phone to a well-wisher congratulating
him on his success, 'than as a mere count.'
He says he wants to impress on the government of Croatia that the
north-easternmost part of Croatia, where Vukovar is located, should not be
forgotten.
His views on the complex situation are informed by a deep knowledge of the
history of the region - and by a deep hatred of Serbs. 'There is absolutely
no historical foundation for the Serbian territorial claims at all,' he
declares, before launching into a tirade of abuse against the Serbs.
His views on the United Nations involvement in the region are hardly more
temperate. 'The presence of the blue-helmets (UN troops),' he claims, 'has
not helped to ameliorate the situation. They are openly favouring the Serbs
and frequently aiding and abetting the 'ethnic cleansing' programme.'
The count draws solace from an episode in the family's history. In the 14th
century the Elector of Trier raised a siege against Burg Eltz, building a
small tower on a neighbouring hill with the aim of raining missiles on to
the knights of Eltz. The tower is now a ruin, a source of satisfaction to
Count Jakob. 'Burg Eltz belongs to me, but where is the Elector now?' he
chuckles.
All the Eltz family had to do was sit and wait for a decade or two. The same
patience underlies the count's determination that the family will once more
go home - to Vukovar.

LONDON ZOO has more lives than a cat. A few weeks ago it was in such deep
trouble that it was going to kill all the animals and turn them into dog
food; or fire them off to Mars to launch a new world; or sell them at
Christie's; or set the dumb things free - there are 27m, if you count all
the insects - in their ancestral homes and habitats.
Now they have been reprieved. The zoo is to stay in business. It believes it
can survive - thanks, in part, to a larger numbers of visitors in recent
times and to campaigns and gifts, including Pounds 1m from my friend and
your friend, the Emir of Kuwait.
Sir John Chapple, president of the Zoological Society of London, is as
delirious as a wombat, and has been quoted as describing the reprieve as
'more than a stay of execution. We have not qualified our decision. The zoo
can remain open because of the great efforts of our staff, our friends and
the society's fellows.'
I was puzzled by that remark. What about the animals? What about their
efforts and heroics?
So round to the zoo I went. First I spoke to a rhino. Was it true, I asked,
that the creatures' lives had been saved by a miraculous marketing effort
and an influx of funds, or was there more to it?
'They've certainly pulled the stops out,' said the rhino grudgingly, 'but
without us they'd be nothing. In the last two years they've tried every
management fad on us that you could put a name to. Quality circles. Team
briefings. Flexi-working and annualised hours. Multi-disciplinary project
teams. Project charters. Cross-functional integration. Vendor networks.
Partnership sourcing. Price corridors. Parallel importing.'
'Parallel importing?'
'It's something to do with bananas.'
'They haven't been cutting your food down?'
'Certainly not,' said the rhino. 'In fact, they've increased it, in
acknowledgement of our workload. I conduct more team briefings than you've
had hot dinners. We work flexi-time in the rhino house. Our annualised hours
are murder. I'm head of the mammalian task force. We cross-functionalise
with reptiles and birds - the fish aren't interested, nor are the insects,
they're still enjoying communism: they say it works for them - and are
starting to vendor network, if you'll pardon my use of the verb form. The
saving of London Zoo may have been influenced by your friend and my friend,
the Emir of Kuwait, and by the boys and girls in marketing, but the
weightiest burden has been shouldered by the animals.'
Next I spoke to a zebra. I explained who I was.
'That's a coincidence,' said the zebra. 'I run our media studies group. I am
planning to invite you to be a guest speaker - the man who has the last word
in the FT every week.'
'What does your group study?'
'The media, stupid. Specifically, how the London media have used every
weapon at their disposal - cheque-book journalism, electronic eavesdropping,
telephoto cameras, fabricated quotes - to distort and uglify the story of
the animals' gallant fight for survival. At one point I thought we were
goners. The media's power is horrendous. The checks and balances are
inadequate.
'Let me quote from the latest issue of The Journalist's Handbook, which runs
a quarterly guide to what is permissible under the Press Complaints
Commission's code of practice. It says: 'A national daily newspaper carried
a story headlined There are no virgins in Essex. The story was based on
their having received no replies to their request for virgins living in
Essex to telephone them. Verdict: no breach of the code.'
'You can see what we're up against. In spite of this week's 'reprieve,'
we're only a tenth of a pfennig off our absolute floor.'
'Who else should I talk to?'
'Try that koala.'
I asked the koala what he thought of the battle to save London Zoo, and of
the deliverance of the creatures. The koala said: 'Get stuffed, you rotten
pom. I'm under contract to the tabloids.'
'You don't sound very happy.' I offered him a gum leaf.
'Of course I'm not, you bludger. In times of currency turmoil, do you know
what constitutes the soundest mode of exchange in international finance?
Better than gold or plutonium? It's koalas, you burrowing skink. In exchange
for the Emir's Pounds 1m, they're sending me to Kuwait.'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: School ties that fail to bind - Inky dictators and
youthful necrophiliacs

<TEXT>
OLD SCHOOL TIES by Tim Devlin and Hywel Williams Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds
17.99, 472 pages
PREP SCHOOL: AN ANTHOLOGY compiled by Michael Gilbert John Murray Pounds
17.95, 228 pages
THE TROUBLE with schools was that they were full of people who were
immature, ignorant and, sometimes, psychopaths. That was just the teachers.
The pupils were much worse. 'Not all headmasters were sadists,' was the best
that could be said about the inky dictators at the top of these festering
institutions.
Have things improved over the years? More or less, according to the findings
of Tim Devlin and Hywel Williams, who had the bright idea of asking
prominent people about their schooldays. Around 1,600 of them did their
homework and sent back their questionnaires. Some, unfortunately, were a
great deal less interesting than others. The difference between a filled-in
form and a well-written book seems to have escaped the authors.
Old School Ties is bitty and, on the whole, a dull read. The most banal
pieces of information are plonked down on the page, isolated amid acres of
white space. But a few nuggets sparkle through the rubble.
Comedian Roy Hudd had to write his own prayer and read it out at assembly.
Actress Angela Pleasance went to a school of which the assistant head was
Jomo Kenyatta's first wife, Edna. Rupert Allason MP, alias espionage expert
Nigel West, went to a Catholic school where one of the resident monks was a
former spy.
The most interesting section consists of memories of people who didn't go to
school, or not for any length of time. That might well say something about
educational establishments in general, but it is not worth ploughing through
472 pages to find out.
Prep School, by contrast, is a real book. It helps that Michael Gilbert, as
well as being himself a better student of English than Devlin and Williams,
has taken his quotations from already-published writings. He propounds the
theory about not all headmasters being sadists, although to some extent this
flies in the face of the evidence he has collected.
One head walloped his boys so hard with a massive ruler that he broke a
finger - not, alas, his own. Another, known as Beetle, not only beat a
pre-teen fiercely enough to draw blood but also had the nerve to charge the
parents the enormous (for 1914) sum of ten shillings for the birch he used.
At Cyril Connolly's school, 'The death rate was low,' which counts as high
praise.
It is well known that the public schools have given our teenagers a tough
time over the centuries; it is more startling to appreciate that the
preparatory schools have handed out much the same treatment to the
seven-to-12 bracket. Indeed, it is amazing that any of the lads actually
stayed on school premises - and not all of them did. One well-known
journalist did a bunk, having received a perfectly serious death threat from
a youthful necrophiliac.
Fortunately, Prep School provides us today with more entertainment than most
of its contributors seem to have enjoyed at the time. Their short extracts,
grouped together under headings such as 'Matrons' and 'Great Men in Short
Trousers,' make for more than a catalogue of horrors.
There are some triumphs: conductor Malcolm Sargent could skive off games by
dislocating his shoulder at will and actor Peter Finch could vomit to order.
Giles Romilly, whose 16-year-old brother Esmond started the subversive
magazine Out of Bounds, wrote ribald verses about a master handicapped by
the name of Handicap.
Arriving at my own prep school some 20 years after singer George Melly, the
youngest of the writers quoted in the book, had left his, I found the
atmosphere far less ferocious. The boys were nicer, for a start; my
favourite teacher had to marry the matron, but no one wrote a single ribald
rhyme about him.

of theatrical giants

<TEXT>
MAGGIE SMITH by Michael Coveney Gollancz Pounds 16.99, 286 pages
MY FATHER LAURENCE OLIVIER by Tarquin Olivier Headline Pounds 16.99, 270
pages
WE MAKE them dames but we don't venerate actresses as we did. Once there
were postcards of Gladys Cooper or Marie Tempest on the railway station
bookstalls. Today, the Flying Scotsman is as likely as Judi Dench. Michael
Coveney gives his Maggie Smith the Shakespearian subtitle A bright
particular star, but this is an all-round portrait of Dame Maggie that goes
beyond the theatre. It has veneration, and to spare.
She is not an easy subject for a theatre biography. Her approach is
businesslike: 'Acting is what I do," she told a New York Times interviewer.
'I've never been in a position to question it.' She does not like public
appearances, except on the stage.
Moreover, a lot of her best work was done in Canada at Stratford, Ontario,
where she was memorable as Millamant, Cleopatra, Rosalind, Beatrice and more
under the influential direction of Robin Phillips. The Canadian exile arose
from an unhappy marriage with Robert Stephens, by whom she has two sons,
both in the theatre. Dame Maggie is now married to writer Beverley Cross, an
old friend from Oxford days when he was at the university and she at the
playhouse. Their life is happily reclusive.
Dame Maggie's aficionados may think of the film of Jean Brodie, or, if they
were lucky, of the line: 'This haddock's disgusting' as she gave it in the
National's Hay Fever, which brought not only a laugh but a round of
applause. Coveney's vast amount of discreet and friendly research - which
surely must have been as enjoyable as it has proved fruitful - presents the
personal life as sensitively as the professional.
Dame Maggie used to be accused critically of frivolous gestures and odd
inflexions, but if such faults really existed, they are gone now. Indeed,
her intonations, to which she gives endless thought, often are clearly right
even when they are unfamiliar: 'Always full of new touches of invention,'
says Sir John Gielgud on directing her. Coveney's book is worthy of her, and
I cannot speak more highly than that.
Tarquin Olivier's book about his father is another matter, an account of the
actor's life seen from close up with little research needed. It was not hard
to overlay one's admiration for that great man with a film of dislike after
the publication of his autobiography, Confessions of an Actor, which Tarquin
reckons he wrote 'in a blind and bitter rage.' It is disagreeable to feel a
like reaction to his son's book, compiled out of deep affection, an emotion
that clearly was mutual and abiding.
Tarquin was Olivier's son by his first wife, Jill Esmond; he was always
close to her. Olivier seduced Vivien Leigh while Jill was pregnant with
Tarquin.
Later, when Vivien had told him that she no longer loved him (and was
already beginning to suffer from her mental difficulty), he transferred his
affections to another actress, Joan Plowright, now Lady Olivier.
The book is a marsh of casual Christian names, and there are many extracts
from family letters of only family interest. Of drama criticism there is, of
course, little. Almost everyone turns out to be a goodie in whatever
circumstances - most of all, Tarquin himself, who must be the most patient
fellow imaginable.

THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII by Antonia Fraser Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds
20, 479 pages
DIVORCED beheaded died, divorced beheaded survived': as every schoolchild
knows, Henry VIII's wives did not have enviable fates. The story of Prince
Charming turned Bluebeard, the king who murdered his way through six
spouses, is among the most gory and sexy in history. Chills and thrills
remain in each re-telling, but what more is there to say?
There is nothing new here. Antonia Fraser fleshes out the tale with guesses
so fevered and intimate that her book is less history than imaginary
portraiture. Queen I, Catherine of Aragon, reigned twice as long as the
other five put together, so records are at least sufficient for speculation
to be viable. But four of Henry's short-lived wives were commoners about
whom nothing - not even their age - is known until the moment he noticed
them.
Fraser can only exaggerate sketchy stereotypes - Anne Boleyn as cunning
temptress, Jane Seymour as docile sweetie-pie. 'Did the earth move for them?
. . . the celebrated ultimate conjunction did not actually represent much
sexual novelty for either King or Lady', she presumes when Anne Boleyn
becomes queen.
A historian's trade is inspired guesswork, but it depends on absolute grasp
of context. Fraser's old-fashioned, personality-dominated history is flat
and wooden because the contemporary world view - the cultural, religious,
political ideas which stamped each queen - is woefully missing.
Ironically, social historians (Lawrence Stone, Gertrude Himmelfarb)
out-thrill her by allowing personality and salacious detail to come alive in
their correct setting. Here, lumpen inventories of jewels and costumes stand
in for period authenticity.
Fraser's queens are 'victims of their biological destiny.' But what about
social factors? The commoner wives fell - as they do in the 1990s - because
they misunderstood royal rules; the foreign princesses, Catherine of Aragon
and Anne of Cleves, knowing about royal survival, kept heads and fortunes.
Fraser has written on many monarchs. This book joins the recent crop of
quasi-feminist biographies arguing independent identities for famous wives.
But it is not the separate personalities that compel here; rather, the
terrifying mix of individual characteristics and political position,
pedigree and likely fertility which determined life for men and women alike
in the 16th century.
This was the age when children's births and deaths dictated their parents'
foreign policy; when lonely teenagers went as ambassadors to marry abroad;
when new alliances were dangled as old spouses lay on their deathbeds.
Renaissance love and marriage are fascinating because people are pawns; to
turn it into Tudor soap opera is both historical and literary misjudgment.

trials

THE HAPPY ISLES OF OCEANIA: PADDLING THE PACIFIC by Paul Theroux Hamish
Hamilton Pounds 16.99, 541 pages
TRAVEL writing is not especially easy. There are too many traps, of which
sentimentality, superficiality and counterfeit enthusiasm are only the three
most obvious. The worst sort of 'travel writing,' common in newspapers but
also found in books, is practically identical to advertising copy-writing.
It is designed to move product, sell holidays, put bums on aircraft seats.
The best sort of travel writing, on the other hand, may be many things: what
Paul Theroux, in his introduction to someone else's travel book (Moritz
Thomsen's The Saddest Pleasure) has called a report of a journey, a memoir,
an autobiography, a confession, a foray into topography and history, a
narrative - a summing-up.
Whatever it is, it requires an abundance of technique, however skilfully
disguised. To see how it is done, you can seldom do better than Paul Theroux
himself, whose latest travel book, about the Pacific, is panoramically
accomplished.
The writing is cool, the reportage industrious and the research rock-solid.
Theroux's control of his material is a wonder to behold. My only quibble is
its silly title, but I doubt that that was Theroux's idea - probably a
marketing wally's.
Theroux is a loner, eccentric, possibly weird. But it is thanks to his
talent for solitariness and to his monomaniacal determination to paddle
between this island and that in a collapsible kayak that we owe many of the
bonuses of this remarkable adventure.
A kayak, yes. Despite sharks, crocs, currents, surf and sometimes
unpredictable and surly natives, Theroux is never happier than when paddling
his little craft to unpopulated spots as far from human company as he can
get. Here he is, for example, loading his boat for a trip to the secluded
islands of the Vava'u group, a part of Tonga whose attraction to Theroux is
that it doesn't contain any Tongans:
'My heaviest single item was water. . . I carried it in two- and
three-gallon bags, a week's supply, which I stuffed under the bulkheads,
with my waterproof bags containing my food, my dry clothes, my stove, my
pots, my tent. On the deck, in a plastic holder, I had my map of the whole
archipelago, and a water bottle, and a compass. Close to hand I had
emergency flares.'
Theroux's journeying starts in New Zealand, with a mind-clearing trek in
Fiordland. Then he visits Australia, where not all his encounters are happy
ones. At a literary dinner in Fremantle a fat drunk lurches down the hall
and stands menacing Theroux in front of all the guests, gargling and making
gestures. 'You're a wanker, mate]' says the drunk, and has to be dragged
away.
After that, Theroux heads for Melanesia (the Trobriands, the Solomons,
Vanuatu and Fiji), Polynesia (Tonga, Vava'u, Western and American Samoa,
Tahiti, the Marquesas, the Cook islands and Easter Island) and eventually
Hawaii.
Theroux could not be dull if he tried. And he is scrupulously inquisitive.
He does not just tell us that Samoans are famously fat. He finds out why.
The answer is massive amounts of bananas, taro, breadfruit; fat-white
mutton; unsaleable parts of dead animals imported from New Zealand and
Australia - chicken backs, parson's noses, trotters, withers; canned corned
beef so loaded with fat (sometimes hippo fat) that it can be eaten with a
spoon.
In Tahiti for Bastille Day, he watches the gala the French call Heiva Tahiti
 -Tahiti Festival - which turns out, as he expects, to be a 'wonderful
example of colonial comedy and hypocrisy'.
After the parade, Theroux talks to some of the French foreign legionnaires
who are thick on the ground in Polynesia. He discovers that the legionnaires
often buy their Tahitian girlfriends sets of false teeth. 'When the
legionnaire goes home to France he takes his girlfriend's teeth with him, so
as to leave her less attractive to men. 'Sometimes the girl does not want to
give her teeth back,' a legionnaire told me in Papeete. 'Then we turn her
upside down and shake them out of her.''
Theroux gives ground to no man in castigation of the French and their
infantile colonial behaviour. If the French foreign ministry is still unsure
of the harm France does itself with its antics in the Pacific - most
wickedly, its nuclear testing - then it ought to have Pages 414-415 faxed to
Paris at once.
When France has destroyed a few more atolls, says Theroux, and managed to
make the islands glow with so much radioactivity that night is turned to
day; when they have sold the rest of the fishing rights; when everything has
been thoroughly plundered, the French will plan a great ceremony and grandly
offer the unemployed, deracinated Pacific citizens in T-shirts and
flip-flops their independence. 'In the destruction of the islands, the
French imperial intention, its mission civilisatrice, will be complete.'
Theroux is equally sharp when writing about the missionaries and other
trawlers for souls - Mormons, especially, but also Jehovah's Witnesses,
Seventh Day Adventists, Catholics, the whole despicable crew  - that have
played such an egregious role in shaping the Pacific.
Many will rate this Paul Theroux's best travel book. Me, I love them all.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Property: The appeal of working in your garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW breed of small garden buildings has allowed an increasing number of
Britain's self-employed businessmen and women to stop running their
companies from the back room and decamp into the garden.
Former England cricket team tour manager Peter Lush gets down to work in his
5.5m diameter round garden room with its conical thatched roof developing
the sports marketing company he runs from home.
He moved into the building, which cost him Pounds 11,000 plus VAT, two years
ago. Not only did this free an upstairs room in his house in Sonning near
Reading, but it also gave him a lot more space and an interesting and
unusual building in which to work.
'It was a wonderful move,' he said. 'I had looked at all sorts of garden
buildings and this one immediately appealed. I have electricity and a phone.
It is very warm in winter, and in summer I cool it by means of a ceiling
fan. It is surrounded on most sides by glass so I have an outlook onto our
large garden and all the peace I could want.'
Lush's thatched office was supplied by Thatching Advisory services of
Wokingham, who sell the thatched round houses in several different sizes.
'More frequently we sell open-sided versions of these buildings for use as
summer houses and tennis club pavilions but I also have one in my garden
that I have used as my office for the past three years,' said managing
director Bob West.
At Godstone in Surrey, Miles Pinniger runs his lighting design and advisory
company from a 12 ft by 18 ft semi-portable building by Homelodge of
Winchester, who adapted it specially for his 6ft 7in frame.
Pinniger installed the building in his garden three years ago when he found
he was outgrowing his cottage home.
The prefabricated one-room building, crowned by a small clock tower, has
enough room for himself and the designer and part-time secretary who work
for him.
'The building is sturdy and well-finished. There is no doubt that it adds to
the value of the property, especially as it has electricity and phone lines.
But if we should move and a future owner decide to have it removed, this is
quite easy as it was erected in two days,' Pinniger said.
'It can also be lifted quite easily by crane. Eventually I am hoping to buy
some land at the rear of our garden. I plan to have the Homelodge lifted
over the hedge into the field.' A Homelodge building like Pinniger's costs
Pounds 11,150 plus VAT erected, carpeted and decorated.
If such a building is within five metres of the house however it qualifies
as an extension and planning consent may be required. Before you instal an
office in your garden seek advice from your local planners. A Surrey woman
who installed a prefabricated garden building with the intention of running
a retail business from her garden fell foul of both local planning
regulations and her neighbours' desire to protect their outlook.
No such problem confronted retired professor Graham Solomon, when, he
installed his 12ft diameter octagonal summer house with cedar shingle roof
30 ft from his house in his garden in the East Sussex village of Waldron.
He saw the Jubilee model from Amdega of Darlington at the Chelsea Flower
Show, and immediately realised it was the solution to his problem of an
overcrowded study in his house which was overflowing with books and
journals.
Amdega installed bookshelves when they erected the building and the total
cost, including VAT, was Pounds 9,500.
'For me it has proved the perfect solution,' Prof. Solomon said. 'I have
power and electric storage heaters so I can work out there all the year
round.
'I spend most of my time writing and rewriting text boooks, so the solitary
situation of the building suits me well. I have a portable phone which I
take with me if I think I shall need it, or if I am expecting a call. If I
want complete solitude I leave it in the house.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Property: Terrifying fete for would-be squires - The hidden
burden of responsibility that awaits purchasers of English village manors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN THOUGH Sarah Evans and her husband had not yet moved in to the big
house they had bought in a Norfolk village, she found herself opening the
fete. 'You must do your bit and get involved,' she said, altough she was
surprised that the chairman of the parish council was so quick to ask. 'I
was terrified, but it gave everybody a chance to see who we are.'
At the end of the season of fetes, sponsored rides, clay-pigeon shoots,
tennis tournaments, and gardens open to the public, who would want to be the
village squire? What are the pluses and minuses of being Mr and Mrs
Bighouse?
To the rest of the village the pluses are obvious, and hallowed by custom.
Anyone who chooses to live in the manor is thought willing to take on its
duties - regardless of the hassles.
When Lt Col Peter Lewis, was looking for a house in Dorset. He was quite
clear he did not want to be a village squire 'We had plenty of all that
running a regiment. But I've no doubt there are people who do want it.' He
plumped for an old rectory, not the manor.
Inheriting a house in Oxfordshire, Laura Sharp was advised to draw all
curtains and lock every door bar one on fete day, so that thieves could not
case the place while mixing with the crowds in the garden.
'I was appalled. But I got some transparent curtains which didn't look too
obvious.'
Theft is the big hazard for those who open their gardens. The visitors
paying to help the retired district nurses can return in a few days to
collect the garden urns. Or they may have made off already with illicit
cuttings hidden in their umbrellas, justifying it to themselves with the
excuse that they are extending our great horticultural heritage. Horse and
tennis events are easier. For these, the Bighouses do not need to be their
own security guards, but they must have the officer qualities to run a
one-day Wimbledon on an endless supply of squash and hot dogs, with St
John's Ambulance standing by.
Nor do duties stop in the winter. 'A bridge evening perhaps?' the Parochial
Church Council will suggest. Or a concert for the fabric fund. Or a supper
for the Tories, Pounds 4.50 a head, cash bar, and incomplete without a few
words from the Member. (It is sound practice to have him say them before the
food. That keeps them shorter.)
Requests for money are year-round. Surely, the Bighouses will support the
prize draw for the village hall, Poppy Day, the Red Cross, the church flower
fund, the homeless and hungry, and sponsor swims for the hospice?
The church will be the keenest to tap the Bighouses cheque book. The parson
knows there is a limit to what he can ask yet again of his tiny
congregation. A large covenant from the Bighouses would answer his prayers.
He will assume they are Anglicans - until they come out as agnostics or
Romans.
How do the new owners see it? Since Laura Sharp's inheritance includes the
village cricket field and allotments, she has a role that may ruffle many
feathers.
'I must be positive,' she says, 'and think of the whole village and not just
of myself or any one village organisation. We are lucky that the new
motorway hardly touches us yet.'
That means not rushing to change parts of village life which, once altered,
can never be replaced.
She has no qualms about the hunt crossing her land, but is still uncertain
how she views the weed-killer the tenant farmer sprays. And lunatic,
out-of-date rumours about housing development rush round the village as fast
as a pint is sunk in the pub.
'But anybody not a recluse in the big house is open to rumours,' she says
briskly. 'Perhaps one should give them something dramatic to talk about.'
For the Bighouses arriving at the manor, the key is joining in, but not
aggressively. Those in similar houses in the other villages will then
welcome them. And they will be known quickly around their village, though
they cannot hope to be accepted for at least a decade. Fresh in many
villager's mind is what happened in the 1980s, when new owners moved on
quickly, having made a killing from selling the kitchen-garden and stables
for conversion to housing.
Laura Sharp has the last word. 'If you're in the big house, I think you
should give something back.' If you do, and stick at it, the village will
eventually come to see that the only time you are going is when you are
carried out. In rural England that is seriously good news.'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Losses and capital gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the tax years 1989-90 and 1990-91, I incurred losses, for capital
gains purposes, of Pounds 6,3000 and Pounds 62 respectively, on sales of
equities. In the following year, 1991-92, I made a capital gain; but within
my normal entitlement for that year. The same will probably be the case in
1992-93. Can I carry forward my losses for 1989-90 and 1990-91 to offset any
excess gains in future years?
Yes, by virtue of section 5(4)(a) of the Capital Gains Tax Act 1979: 'where
the amount of chargeable gains less allowable losses accruing to an
individual in any year of assessment does not exceed the exempt amount for
the year, no deduction from that amount shall be made for that year in
respect of allowable losses carried forward from a previous year'.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Funding an endowment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY QUESTION is of special relevance to those parents with young children -
say, 18 to 25 - who have been hit hard by the collapse in the UK housing
market.
In many cases, these children have been forced by high interest rates to
sell their homes and to cancel their mortgages and the associated endowment
policy. Is there any virtue in parents taking over these endowment policies
and funding them on the childrens' behalf, thus exploiting the regular gift
allowances under the Inheritance Tax regulations while at the same time
taking advantage of the relatively low premium on young lives and securing
some life cover?
What would be the attitude of a building society if a young adult who was
applying for a mortgage presented a policy on which the premiums were paid
by his or her parents? Could the parents continue to pay the premium in this
case? I have in mind an open arrangement, for example the premium is paid
from the parents' bank account, but at some stage the offspring would become
responsible.
An endowment is one form of saving and could therefore constitute a suitable
gift from parents. Neither a building society nor any other mortgage lender
need be concerned with exactly who pays the premium on such policies, as
long as it is paid.
Whether endowment policies are the most suitable way of providing parental
assistance is open to question. If the aim is to provide life assurance then
low-cost term assurance gives much more cover for a minimal premium, leaving
the balance of each year's gift to be invested more efficiently as a small
capital reserve. This can be accessed when required without the surrender
value penalties and high insurance mark-up on endowment policies. However,
this is unlikely to be what an insurance salesman will tell you because a
lot of this mark-up will be paid in commission.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Should I keep my annuity?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE built up a substantial fund of money with an insurer under an
old-style Section 226 self-employed retirement annuity scheme. This is now
fully paid-up and no further contributions will be made. I am 63, but did
not plan to cash it in until I am at least 65 and possibly (since I am not
under immediate pressure) later, on the reasoning that a normal annuity
purchase is best left as long as possible. In due course, however, this fund
will form the greater part of my retirement pension.
I have already noted and am attracted to the concept of the with-profits
annuity. My fund with the insurer has accrued over past years on a
with-profits basis and appears to have done well. My company suggests
(without making a recommendation) that I consider purchasing such an annuity
now rather than holding on as outlined above. What are the pros and cons of
this course?
We can see little reason for purchasing an annuity now if you do not need
the income. The terms of the policy should enable you to go on rolling up
investment income free of tax until you need it and if this is to age 66 or
67 the cost of each pound of annuity will be less because you are older and
have a shorter life expectancy.
Thus you gain on two fronts: one, you will have a bigger money pot when you
eventually retire as a result of further investment, and two, each pound of
that bigger fund will buy you more pension. You can add to this pot by
paying one-off single premiums each year from now until the date you
eventually retire.
We cannot think why anyone should be recommending you to take your annuity
now when the annuity payments will merely be added to your present income
and therefore taxed at your top rate. The only plausible reason we can
imagine is that the person hopes to earn a sales bonus by getting you to buy
such an annuity with his company.
When you eventually retire it might pay you to shop around a few of the
bigger insurance companies to see which is offering the best annuity rates
at that time, but take care that you are comparing like with like. It may be
wise to seek independent advice; if you do, make sure that the adviser is
genuinely independent and discloses his or her terms of business and informs
you of the commission rates on the policies on offer before you sign
anything.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Annuities, a big gap between best and
worst - The myriad market choices for those who are approaching retirement
age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING AN annuity at retirement is the biggest investment most people ever
make. But few insurance companies offer a complete range of products and few
advisers know enough about the more technical options to provide a
comprehensive service.
An annuity is a regular income for life, secured by paying a lump sum to an
insurance company. Once the annuity has been bought it cannot be changed
and, in most cases, the capital invested is lost when the annuitant dies.
By law, most of the proceeds of money purchase pensions must be used to buy
a 'compulsory purchase' annuity. A money purchase pension is one where
contributions are invested to provide a fund at retirement, unlike pensions
based on final salary.
Personal pensions, executive pension plans, free-standing additional
voluntary contributions and contracted-out money purchase schemes are all
examples of money purchase pensions.
The first step towards choosing the right annuity is to make use of the
'open market option.' This allows you to take the proceeds of your pension
fund away from the plan provider and buy your annuity elsewhere. The top
names in personal pension plans are quite different from the top names in
the annuity market so, in most cases, it makes sense to shop around.
Annuities can be sold only by life offices because they alone have the size
to cope with a large spread of risk. If your pension plan is provided by any
other sort of financial institution - say, a unit trust group - then you
have no choice but to use the open market option.
This can improve the income provided by your annuity by up to 25 per cent -
the difference at present between the best and worst rates on offer. But
some life offices penalise policyholders who use the option, while others
pay a 'loyalty bonus' to those who stay put (which amounts to the same
thing). Either way, the differential must be considered when weighing-up the
benefits of the better rates available under the option.
The annuity sold most commonly provides a fixed or level income for life.
Its popularity is mainly because it provides the highest income at the
start, compared with other options. Clearly, however, the 'real' value of
the income plummets once inflation takes its toll. Early retirement -
whether voluntary or enforced - combined with increased longevity increases
this problem.
In recent years, the choice of annuities has increased. Mitchell Philpott,
account director of annuity specialist Norex Pensions Communications, says:
'An annuity may be structured to provide a fixed rate of escalation,
commonly 3 per cent or 5 per cent per annum, or increases may be linked to
the retail price index (RPI). Each type of annuity obviously carries a cost
in terms of a loss of income in the early years to compensate for increasing
income in the later years.
'What is important is that each individual must strike a balance between
their need to safeguard their income against inflation, their need for
immediate spending power and perhaps, most important, their expectation of
life.'
A limited form of inflation-proofing now applies to preserved pensions that
are left behind in a company scheme when an employee changes jobs. The same
provision for inflation-linking will be extended soon to company pensions
being paid. In this light, it seems odd that a similar facility is not
included automatically with annuities.
But the reason why few '5 per cent escalating annuities' are sold can be
seen in Table 1. The initial income is about 30 per cent less than available
with the level annuity, and the break-even point does not occur for 14
years.
The average life expectancy for the 65-year-old male used in the example is
13 years so, clearly, the life offices are not giving anything away here.
But for those who live longer, the 5 per cent escalating annuity provides a
much better deal after year 14.
With the future rate of inflation uncertain, there is a strong argument for
an annuity that increases in line with retail prices. In the past, this has
proved to be more expensive than 5 per cent escalation but, at today's
rates, there is little difference between the two in terms of the initial
income.
Only a handful of insurance companies offer RPI-linked annuities. These
include Standard Life, Eagle Star, Prudential, Sun Life and Sun Alliance.
Table 2 shows how the RPI and 5 per cent escalating annuities would have
compared over the past 20 years although, obviously, future inflation could
be constrained by sterling's membership of the exchange rate mechanism
(ERM). But, given the long-term nature of an annuity, the RPI link does
provide additional insurance against high inflation when retirement is taken
early and is expected to span two decades.
There are other types of annuity that can provide a hedge against inflation
by securing growth through a unit-linked or with-profits fund. The
with-profits annuity is a complex product and is offered only by Equitable
Life and Prudential. (Provident Mutual offers a with-profits annuity but,
generally, this is cost-effective for, and available only to, existing
policyholders).
Under a with-profits annuity, people get a fairly low guaranteed income plus
annual bonuses from the with-profits fund. To lift the initial income, it is
possible to set an anticipated rate of bonus. Where the actual declared
bonus rate is lower, the income will fall, and vice-versa.
Table 3 illustrates the difference between a with-profits and level annuity
where the anticipated bonus is 5 per cent and the actual declared bonus is
8.5 per cent. To assume a bonus rate higher than 5 per cent would be taking
a risk in the present environment and could lead to a falling annual income.
Unit-linked annuities are offered by just a handful of providers including
M&amp;G, Equitable Life and Commercial Union. Under this system, the value of
the annual income reflects the unit value of the underlying fund and, as
such, can fluctuate considerably.
As a long-term investment, the unit-linked route can provide an element of
capital growth unobtainable with a level or escalating annuity but, for most
people, this option should be considered only where there are other sources
of retirement income to meet regular bills and spending.
Initial income under the unit-linked annuity is likely to be worth about 50
per cent of the level annuity. Some providers allow clients to boost this by
incorporating an element of anticipated capital growth. The danger here is
that if the underlying fund fails to achieve the predicted growth
assumptions, then the annual income derived from the annuity will fall
sharply.
Finally, depending on the type of pension arrangements used to yield the
retirement fund, it might be possible to opt for phased retirement. For
example, under a personal pension - and, from this year, a buy-out bond
(used to take transfer values from company pension schemes) - it is possible
to cash-in part of the plan to provide an annuity at, say, 60 and to leave
the rest to appreciate in value until age 70 or even 75.
This option could appeal to the increasing numbers of employees who take
early retirement and continue to work part-time.

DOCTOR CRIMINALE by Malcolm Bradbury Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 344
pages
NOW YOU KNOW by Michael Frayn Viking Pounds 14.99, 282 pages
THE world of Malcolm Bradbury's disappointingly uneven novel is post-modern
and deeply flawed; its leading characters are shallow, devious and cravenly
ambitious. The Doctor Criminale of the title is a feted east European
polymath who jets around the international conference circuit leaving a
trail of abandoned wives and lovers besides, it transpires, a good deal more
than dirty bed-linen. On his heels is the appallingly chinless Francis Jay,
striving to write a television profile of the great man and make his own
mark.
The satire, if that is what it is, is heavy-handed. The philosopher-critic
Criminale is an unlikely chimera of the likes of Steiner and Eco, while Jay
is an amalgam of any number of upwardly mobile young journalists who flit
eagerly from the 'style' pages of one broadsheet newspaper to the next. The
jokes are thinly scattered and the book's set-pieces spill across all the
frontiers of the new Europe of the 1990s. Fact and fiction are mingled
lubriciously; Susan Sontag and Martin Amis, unlikely soulmates, seem to pop
up everywhere.
In the opening and closing pages, the humour is targeted much more
carefully. The beginning, at a Booker prize dinner, is genuinely funny and
its awful vignettes - with every publisher's promotion manager called Fiona
and every presenter of the BBC's Late Show heavily pregnant - will strike
chords with anyone who has watched even five minutes of the ritual on TV. In
between, though, the effect is much more diffuse; Bradbury sets up too many
targets and falls short of all of them.
Perhaps his novel really is an honest attempt to get to grips with the chaos
of post-cold war thought, the onward march of the European superstate, the
sheer vapidity of TV culture. But it reads much more like a trawl through
Bradbury's own fond memories of lavish academic freebies. Of course, there
may be a profound post-modern irony buried somewhere in all the gush; if so,
it sailed over my head.
Michael Frayn's altogether tighter fable attempts far less and achieves far
more. Its world is carefully circumscribed, almost claustrophobic, its grip
on characters relentless and revealing. Which does not necessarily make it
all that convincing: Hilary, the studious young civil servant who throws
over her career in the Home Office to work for a left-wing civil liberties
organisation while having an affair with its curiously charismatic leader
Terry, never comes fully to life. Her motivations always remain something of
a mystery; everyone has another life outside the office, yet hers never
quite coalesces, never fits the final piece into the jigsaw.
Yet, Frayn's ear for dialogue is unfailing as the story unfolds through the
eyes and ears of all the staff of this murky outfit. He cuts from one voice
to the next with consummate skill, catching every subtlety of language and
tone; when the whole organisation begins to tear itself apart, the internal
frictions, the tiny niggles, are mapped precisely. In its own way it is a
tour de force, even if the sum of all the parts is finally rather modest.

WRITTEN ON THE BODY by Jeanette Winterson Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 190
pages
YOUNG people who want to write for a living no longer starve in garrets, but
they can still have a pretty rough time until the money starts to roll in
from the books and the TV-scripts - if ever it does.
Take the case of Jeanette Winterson. In 1983 she was 24 and down from
Oxford, with a first novel inside her bursting to get out. Its title was
from a saying of Nell Gwynn's, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit.
Winterson's circumstances while writing it were distinctly straitened, as
she explains: 'At that time, I was sharing two rooms and a hip bath with the
actress Vicky Licorish. She had no money, I had no money. We could not
afford the luxury of a separate whites wash and so were thankful of the
fashion for coloured knickers, which allowed those garments most closely
associated with our self-esteem not to be grey'.
Just that one brief quotation makes it abundantly clear that we are dealing
with a Writer; someone whose printed words contain the magic that turns them
into a voice talking to you, forcing you to continue reading the book.
Winterson's singular talent was first recognised in the publishing world by
a woman editor at the newly formed Pandora Press, who accepted the novel but
published it only in a paperback edition.
Winterson explains: 'It went unnoticed, except in the most banal way, by
most reviewers and started to sell at an alarming rate. Small bookshops and
word of mouth were the foundations of my career. . .'
The debutante novelist had two trump cards which she played skilfully. She
was Lancashire working class and had been brought up in an eccentric
denomination of the Christian faith, the Pentecostal Evangelists.
The latter fate - an off-beat spiritual up-bringing - makes for a strenuous
childhood but it does in recollection provide wonderful copy for a writer,
as was shown by Edmund Gosse who was raised in the even sterner creed of the
Plymouth Brethren. His account was called Father and Son. Winterson's might
just as easily have been called 'Mother and Daughter.' Oranges went on to
win the Whitbread prize for a first novel and was made into an award-winning
television drama.
Then in 1987 came The Passion, which won the John Llewellyn Rhys prize, and
in 1989 Sexing the Cherry (both available at Pounds 9.95 in the attractive
new hardback Bloomsbury Classics).
By then Winterson had, through her writing, become a totem for the
alternative society. Its high priest across the water, Gore Vidal, gave her
his accolade by describing her as 'the most interesting writer I have read
in 20 years.' Now, Winterson has come up with Written on the Body, involving
a change of publisher from Bloomsbury to Cape and expectations from the
fiction-reading public, whipped up by the publicists, at their highest. The
novel has been heralded by a flurry of interviews, from which we gather that
the hip bath has gone for good and the former female companion has also been
replaced.
Meanwhile, the critical pendulum has started ominously to swing against
Winterson. Reviews have begun to appear by those impatient to knock the
book; some of them were not even prepared to wait for it to be published
officially before putting in the boot. Clearly, those reviewers who failed
to praise Winterson when it was fashionable to do so are not going to let
themselves be caught out a second time, now that it is becoming fashionable
to denigrate her.
And yet, Written on the Body is no better and no worse than any of the
previous novels. It has exactly the same intimacy of manner, the same quota
of brilliant one-liners, the same digressive tendency leading the writer to
indulge in whimsical reminiscence to the detriment of her plot; and it
explores that same high plateau of passion in which the lover seems to be in
love not so much with another person as with the condition of being in love.
She (or maybe he - one assumes, rashly, the first-person narrator is a she
although that is never actually stated) is determined to preserve this bliss
for ever in all its white-hot incandescence.
In the novels after Oranges, the writer put on the mask of some humble
historical figure - Napoleon's under-chef in the Grand Army, the assistant
gardener to John Tradescant during the Civil War period - to demonstrate
such passion as an element in a wider cataclysm. The vulnerability of the
leading women characters was compensated for by giving them some grotesque
physical abnormality from which they drew strength - huge girth, webbed feet
(see Angela Carter's winged heroine, Fevvers, the model for this particular
feminist strategy).
It is all here again but, this time, made contemporary. The male ogre who
stands for the stultifying imprisonment of a conventional affluent marriage
is a Jewish doctor, a cancer specialist from north London's Stamford Hill.
The hero/heroine - the I - who finds an ultimate love object in his wife is
a translator. The affair, involving the ditching of a previous girlfriend,
is described with dithyrambic Wintersonian intensity that is often quite
hard to take.
Such a passion in Winterson's world is never transformed by the process of
procreation, its natural and usual culmination, so what may alter or
frustrate it? The answer, here, is the onset of cancer, portending the death
of the love object.
Leukaemia afflicts the doctor's wife, who returns to him. That leads
Winterson to some high definition writing on the inroads the disease makes
on the body, and also to an extended description of the agony it imposes on
the mind of the sufferer's beloved partner. This is a very real human
problem, one not exclusive to the experience of either gender. It is studied
at the end of this short novel with poignant realism.

THE ENGLISH PATIENT by Michael Ondaatje Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 303 pages
MICHAEL Ondaatje is a Sri Lankan poet, domiciled in Canada, who has now
written the extraordinary novel we have been awaiting from him: The English
Patient is, I suggest, a masterpiece. This week, it was named on the Booker
prize shortlist.
Over the past 10 years, without fanfare, Ondaatje has become something of a
cult figure. There was a 1979 jazz novel called Coming Through Slaughter,
and a 1983 memoir of his family, in particular of his drunken father, called
Running in the Family (re-issued recently in Bloomsbury's elegant
mini-hardback format, Pounds 9.99).
Then - leaving aside the poetry - there was a remarkable novel in 1987
called In the Skin of a Lion (available in Picador, Pounds 5.99). That book
called on John Berger for a prefatory quotation: 'Never again will a single
story be told as though it were the only one.' There is a clue to The
English Patient.
It is interesting, but not essential, to know that this new work picks up
several of the characters from In the Skin of a Lion. After the 1930s'
Canada of the earlier book, we are now in Tuscany in the closing months of
the second world war.
The 'English patient' is a charred, unidentifiable, dying man who, we
gradually discover, had parachuted in flames into the North African desert
where he was rescued by the Bedouin. He is now tended by Hana, the
shell-shocked Canadian nurse who is making her farewell to arms; and
attended by the burglar-spy Caravaggio (for both, see the earlier novel) and
a Sikh sapper, Kip, who spends his time on the very brink of death defusing
the booby traps left in and around the villa by the departing Germans.
The four of them are, in their different ways, in retreat; they continue
their trades - nursing, bomb defusing - but they have stepped back into a
private world in which social constructs have lost meaning. Ondaatje gives
us their various and interlocking stories, and tells them with an
imaginative power that makes them haunting and unforgettable.
There is a central mystery about the 'patient' and, cumulatively and
tentatively, we piece together a history of his pre-war Cairo life in the
years when the Libyan desert was being explored for the first time and
recorded in the dry prose of the Royal Geographic Society. The patient is
not what he seems, and there is irony in it; he is not even English, but
that is shown not to matter.
We are taken beneath the charred surface to see that he is in no way an
enemy - we are beneath that level - but a human being who enjoys pain, love,
affection, memory, morphine, while his burnt body is symbolic of the old
universe which has ended in flames.
Caravaggio, too, has a dramatic biography of horror and has retreated to
watch over Hana, just as she has dedicated herself to the patient. And Kip,
engrossed in his terrifying trade, hovering on the outside, clearing the
ground around the villa, is drawn slowly into the inner circle - until he
hears of Hiroshima: 'They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white
nation.'
The young man who has risked his life to defuse a thousand European bombs is
undone. He, now, must quit the war.
Not for the first time, Ondaatje's imagination is seized by the plunge into
the void (see the nun blown over the bridge in In the Skin of a Lion). Here,
the image of the aviator descending in flames is repeated in Kip's final
motorcycle crash into the river.
The patient 'slips into the harness of the oil-wet parachute and pivots
upside down, breaking free of glass, wind flinging his body back. Then his
legs are free of everything, and he is in the air, bright, not knowing why
he is bright until he realises he is on fire . . .'
None of this can convey the power of Ondaatje's writing, the beauty and
excitement of his images, the elegance of his prose. These are early days,
and Booker-guessing is a silly game, but I find it hard to see how they will
be able to deny him this year's prize.

SERENITY HOUSE by Christopher Hope Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 227 pages
CHRISTOPHER Hope's latest novel, shortlisted this week for the 1992 Booker
prize, renews and develops his singular comic vision. In it, he mixes a
potent, comically intoxicating brew of the surreal, the farcical and the
socially and politically satirical, exactly as he did in A Separate
Development, Kruger's Alp and The Hottentot Room, those exuberant,
free-spirited South African farces pivoted upon the madness of apartheid.
The difference, now, is that in Serenity House the scene has shifted to the
outside world; this writer's precious gift for perceiving and exposing in
so-called normality a crazily- patterned patchwork of violent obsession and
zany ritual has now found expression on a wider canvas. (In My Chocolate
Redeemer - Hope's fourth novel, and his first non-South African in subject
matter - the attempt to do just this had proved curiously loose in
subject-focus and uncertain in style; but as no such disappointments mar the
manifold pleasures of its successor, perhaps that is to be understood as no
more than a necessary dry run, and to be excused as such).
Here, the comic targets are joyously unclouded and cleanly hit. The book's
title is itself an impudent in-joke; for Serenity House is actually a
down-at-heel north London 'eventide refuge' run by a bizarre collection of
wardens, matrons, therapists and doctors, all purveying a distinctive argot
steeped in moral uplift and euphemistic slogan. ('Leaving' for 'dying,' for
instance).
The inmates include the Five Incontinents, with their trail of catheters and
armoury of protective padding; Lady Divina, a dilapidated blue-blood
occasionally roused from senile torpor to rage against the holes in the
ozone layer; and sundry other avatars of fast-advancing physical
decrepitude.
The fun - so blackly hilarious because it is so lightly and deftly plotted -
that Hope has with the desperation and self-absorption of decaying
mortality, the nursing spectacle and medical paraphernalia that accompany
it, and the patronising doublespeak of those who minister to it, earn
Serenity House a place alongside Muriel Spark's Memento Mori and Kingsley
Amis's Ending Up in the literature of frankly observed old age.
The leading inmate, Max Montfalcon, has come to the home guarding a grisly
secret; the process of its unravelling will also drag Serenity House to its
downfall. A walking repository of royalist sympathies and grammatical
stringency (he takes Fowler to breakfast), as well as the knight-protector
of a wardrobe-full of grotesque hidden treasure, he is gradually unmasked as
Maximilian von Falkenberg, a Nazi scientist responsible for horrible
experiments on concentration camp inmates and in mass-murder methodology in
the final phase of the Holocaust.
Montfalcon's daughter, living the life of an upper middle-class English
rose, is married to a braying Tory MP who has already played a notable role
in promoting the bill for the prosecution of elderly war criminals  - a
device which allows the comedy of discovery to be unfolded in uproarious
broad strokes. But simultaneously with the investigation of Montfalcon's
shady past, a grander set of narrative parallels is being proposed and
explored. Under its facade of do-goodery, the Serenity House administration
has been quietly following a programme of unlicensed euthanasia (involving
such modes of swift despatch as the Water Cure, another relishable
euphemism).
After a while, one discerns that Hope's underlying purpose is to throw up
for examination notions of people-disposal - whether of a society's
inconveniently long-lasting old people or, in extremis, of its unwanted
minorities - and to compare and contrast the situations in which such an a
option can ever come to be taken seriously.
As in his South African novels, so here again it is the crispness of wit,
the keenness of observation, and the gravity-defying ability to link
apparent opposites that render the vision at once so bright and so alarming.
A key tool of linkage enters the story with the arrival from Florida - after
all, one of the world's most populous senior-citizen habitats - of the
illiterate, violent, video-addicted teenager Jack Robinson, brought to
London to pursue the tenuous links that connect him with Max's Nazi past.
With typical Hope legerdemain, this Jack-in-the-Beanstalk sub-theme is
teased out to its fulfilment, and the novel to its dizzying comic climax, in
one of the turrets of a fairy-tale castle at the Orlando Disneyland.
Earlier, one has occasionally been given cause to observe that the author's
ear for American speech tones, and his eye for the nuances of American class
distinction and social manners, are a degree less finely honed than their
English equivalents.
But this is, anyhow, a small point to weigh in the balance of so rare and
distinctive an achievement. Serenity House is a surreal farce rigorously
logical according to its own terms of reference, scabrously enjoyable, and
motivated by a sense of the 'real world' that is always profoundly and
exhilaratingly sane.

LEPORELLO by William Palmer Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 15.99, 339 pages
A PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATION by Philip Kerr Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99,
329 pages
CITY OF GOLD by Len Deighton Century Pounds 14.99, 323 pages
HIGH COTTON by Darryl Pinckney Faber Pounds 14.99, 309 pages
WILLIAM Palmer has come late to full-length fiction - he is getting on for
50, with only one previous novel under his belt - but late is better than
never when he writes as well as he does in Leporello. As the title suggests,
it is a re-working of the Don Giovanni story, seen through the eyes of his
cowardly servant.
Ostensibly Leporello's autobiography, it is really just an excuse for a
marvellous romp through the brothels and gaming houses of 18th century
Europe. A beautifully-executed romp, too. beginning with Leporello's
initiation into sex at a very early age and continuing via murder, mayhem
and all sorts of skulduggery to employment with the Don and a new career as
gentleman's gentleman and pander to the aristocracy.
Leporello takes to the work with enthusiasm, living the high life, enjoying
the leavings from his master's table and sometimes also from his bed. What
more could a simple country boy want?
It all ends in tears, as these things usually do, but not before a wonderful
time has been had by all. The author writes in the spirit of Tom Jones and
Fanny Hill, with a sure touch and a masterly grasp of his subject. Why he
has taken so long to blossom into print is something of a puzzle; but if he
can carry on as he has begun, the rest of us will have plenty of cracking
good entertainment ahead.
No such starting problems for Philip Kerr, still young for a writer and
already turning them out at the rate of one a year. His latest thriller, A
Philosophical Investigation, follows a serial killer through the streets of
London. The killer in question is highly intelligent and obsessed by
Wittgenstein. The job of tracking him down has been given to lady chief
inspector 'Jake' Jakowicz.
We are a few years into the future here, with computer technology so
advanced that the Lombroso system (named after the 19th century Italian who
thought criminals could be identified by shape of skull) can screen
individuals for homicidal tendencies and isolate them accordingly.
But 'Wittgenstein' has hacked into the system, calmly erasing his own
details before taking the names of his peers and murdering them one by one.
It is an ambitious story, a slightly uneasy blend of futuristic technology
and highbrow philosophy, in which readers will have to cope not only with
Wittgenstein but also with George Steiner, Malraux, Marcuse, Manicheanism,
Tourette's Syndrome and much else besides. It is also a satire of sorts,
with TV presenter Anna Kreisler (Chrysler = Ford: geddit?) stripping naked
on camera in return for a telephoned pledge of a million dollars for
charity.
It is a little heavy in places, a good basic idea marred by ponderous
execution and a less-than-perfect ear for dialogue. But it is also highly
inventive, which is more than can be said for most books of the kind.
Len Deighton has finally given up on that awful wall in Berlin and, for his
latest story, is falling back on an earlier generation of Germans. The City
of Gold is Cairo just before Rommel's arrival, a hotbed of corruption,
intrigue and double-dealing, with a German spy at large somewhere and Rommel
informed in advance of the British army's every move.
Throw in Greek brothel-keepers, White Russian princes, beautiful English
girls, Jewish gun-runners and deserters from both sides and you have the
makings of a splendid mole-hunting novel, just the sort of thing Deighton is
good at. He carries it off well enough, too, although one must quarrel with
him over the opening chapter in which a detective escorts a British soldier
under arrest for murder to Cairo on the train.
The detective explains to his prisoner that he is going to Cairo to catch
the German spy. He then has a heart attack and drops dead, leaving the
prisoner to unlock his handcuffs and assume the detective's identity. A
younger, hungrier Deighton would never have offered his readers anything so
implausible, not even in jest.
Darryl Pinckney's High Cotton is billed as a novel but reads suspiciously
like an autobiography - that of a young, middle-class black American of
cultured background.
The narrator grows up in a white Indianapolis suburb and knows nothing of
race riots, crack, ghettoes or any of the usual black American experience.
He thinks of himself instead as one of the Also Chosen.
The narrator goes to Columbia university, travels in Europe, gets a variety
of temporary jobs in New York. And all the time he is conscious of his
colour, without ever being aggressive about it. When taxis refuse to stop
for him and white female joggers keep their distance, he understands
perfectly and feels only mildly resentful.
He writes more in sorrow than anger, putting his faith in the power of
understatement rather than wearing his irritation on his sleeve. He has
written a very graceful, elegant, thought-provoking book. But, however hard
one tries, it is still difficult to think of it as a novel.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Doing it the Swedish way - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A fixed exchange rate is the cornerstone of our low-inflation policy.
Interest rates will remain high as long as necessary which, I hope, is not
too long.'
NO, THIS was not John Major's latest attempt to defend the pound with
nothing stronger than an after-dinner speech. These are the words of Mrs
Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister. And she is not one to wobble.
When the Swedish currency looked under threat this week, overnight interest
rates went up to the annual equivalent of 75 per cent. The effect on
long-term rates is much smaller - mortgage rates have risen a mere 5
percentage points to 22 1/2 per cent. UK mortgage payers, take note.
There is a lesson for the UK in the Swedish move. If a government has to put
rates up to defend its currency, a half-hearted increase will not do the
trick. Indeed, too small a rise will only make matters worse as currency
speculators take it as a sign of weakness, not strength, and keep on pushing
for more. If rates have to go up at all, what is needed is an increase large
enough to leap-frog the currency traders' expectations and show a determined
face to the world.
If the UK government really has decided not to devalue sterling - and that
remains in doubt, since the history of devaluations is that governments
always say they will not until they do - what options are left to Major and
chancellor Norman Lamont?
There are three. First, Major can try to talk his way out of it, as he did
on Thursday night at the Scottish CBI dinner.
The prime minister's readiness to stake his career on the government's
handling of sterling's problems - and, at the same time, stake your job, my
mortgage and the entire British economy - is not likely to prove a terribly
effective signal to the foreign exchange markets in all but the short term.
Indeed, the pound barely perked up yesterday.
The next thing is to dream up some more whizzy schemes, like last week's
deal to borrow D-marks in order to buy sterling. That did little more than
buy some time for the pound. That, and a rather weedy promise not to
increase interest rates - unless circumstances change - extracted from the
Germans last weekend, kept sterling above DM 2.80 until about Monday
lunchtime.
The third option is a sudden interest rate rise, although perhaps not quite
of the magnitude of the Swedish increase. A bold enough move would keep the
pound in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
It seems that the government's strategy is to try to cling on without
raising interest rates until the result of the French referendum on
Maastricht is clear. Voting takes place next Sunday.
As the week closed, it was looking likely that the pound could hold out that
long, helped in part by news of another decline in the inflation rate; that
the French were inclining towards Yes; and that the stock market was
recovering. But the market is once again fixing on a moment and not looking
beyond it. While many have asked what would happen if the French voted No -
and assumed it would be bad news for sterling and, indeed, the entire ERM -
few have considered what would happen after a Yes vote beyond thinking that
everything would be hunky dory again.
In fact, a Yes vote could still be bad for sterling. It could be compared
with the excuse of the dollar. This said that the pound's weakness against
the D-mark was not sterling's fault but the dollar's. Then, the dollar
recovered yesterday and sterling did not.
Sterling's problems go beyond those of most of the ERM currencies, barring
Italy, and a Yes vote will not drive them away. Expect a bout of euphoria
followed fairly swiftly by a reassessment of the outlook for the pound. That
might be the moment when interest rates have to go higher.
It would, however, be about the worst news the UK economy could have, even
after being described this week by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR and a
veritable captain of industry, as a desert.
Real interest rates have, in any case, been rising ever since sterling
joined the ERM in October 1990, as the chart shows, even though actual rates
have fallen. Higher nominal interest rates, as well, would probably turn
recession to slump and certainly drive the stock market lower.
This week's stream of company news has not of itself been wholly bad. The
likes of Glaxo, Prudential, Cadbury Schweppes, Rugby and RTZ managed to
increase profits. But the message is in the statements of many company
chairmen. Summarised, these say: the economy is not getting better, there is
no sign when it will get better and, if anything, it is getting worse.
Consensus forecasts for gross domestic product, the simplest measure of the
economy's health, have been revised down once more and now centre on an 0.8
per cent fall this year. Consumer confidence has fallen again and
indications of retail sales in August were dismal.
Yesterday Tarmac, the building materials group, announced closures and
redundancies in its bricks and blocks business as it tries to sort out
overcapacity in the industry. This is capacity which could be lost
permanently to the British economy.
The building sector and the food industry have provided much of the
depressing news this week. Dividend cuts from Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and
Amec, with the first two announcing losses as well, suggest those companies
can see no end in sight to the gloom. In food, Hillsdown, Booker and United
Biscuits showed that this sector could disappoint, too.
All this in pursuit of low inflation. Yesterday's inflation figure, showing
an annual 3.6 per cent increase in prices, gave shares a boost. Compare that
with Swedish inflation of 2.2 per cent. But, one asks, where is the victory
in cutting inflation if the result is an economic desert? And what are the
chances of keeping inflation down when, or if, economic growth eventually
returns?

FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Glaxo has the last laugh - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DON'T SELL Glaxo' was the deathbed advice given in an Anita Brookner story
by a father wanting to give his daughter the benefit of his accumulated
wisdom. Last year, fund managers would have done well to heed his words.
Shares in Europe's largest drugs' group doubled, driven upwards by American
enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks. In 1991, the results of any fund
underweight in Glaxo looked pretty sick.
This year, Glaxo's ride has been bumpier. From a peak in January of 916p,
the shares fell to 658p by the beginning of July. One reason was selling by
US investors, who believed the recession was coming to an end and,
therefore, sold defensive companies such as pharmaceuticals while buying
more cyclical stocks.
The move out of the pharmaceuticals was assisted by various problems at a
number of American drugs groups. In addition, money allocated by fund
managers for the drugs sector was soaked up by the Wellcome secondary offer.
The economic upturn expected by US investors has failed to materialise.
Meanwhile Glaxo, which reported its full-year results on Thursday, continues
to power ahead, able to generate sales growth (excluding currencies) of 18
per cent as well as a profits increase of 11 per cent. Sir Paul Girolami,
the chairman, pointed out that the Pounds 700m increase in turnover was
greater than the group's entire sales less than 10 years ago.
For a company with a turnover of more than Pounds 4bn, that is a remarkable
achievement. It is a particularly outstanding result when compared with
results in other sectors. Since July, Glaxo's shares have risen more than
100p and closed yesterday at 768p The question is whether the consistency of
Glaxo's earnings' growth will make it irresistible to fund managers,
especially if the recession continues. Many were caught short last year and
will not want to be burnt again.
Glaxo's defensive qualities are not in doubt: Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals'
analyst at County NatWest, describes the group as Europe's strongest
company. It has superb marketing expertise and sales of Zantac, an ulcer
treatment and the world's best-selling drug, grew 13 per cent in 1992
despite premature predictions that the product had matured.
Sales of Zofran, a drug used to prevent nausea in patients receiving
radiation and chemotherapy, increased from Pounds 181m to Pounds 259m.
Ernest Mario, the chief executive, said he could think of no medicine which
had achieved sales of Dollars 500m in only two years.
Future growth also looks assured. Glaxo has been building up its sales force
over the past 12 months in preparation for the world-wide launch of two more
potential blockbusters - Imigran, a migraine drug, and Serevent, a
long-acting asthma treatment. About 1,500 representatives have been added
which, Plag says, makes Glaxo's sales force the largest in the world.
Margins squeezed by the additional costs of this marketing build-up and
greater research and development spending, are now likely to expand. So,
what doubts are there about Glaxo?
The first is Imigran, which is still awaiting the licence from the US Food
and Drug Administration which the company had expected earlier this year.
Doubts have been expressed about the product's safety.
The delay is disappointing, says Guy Wood-Gush, analyst at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd. But, he adds, it is reassuring that the authorities have not asked for
more data. Nevertheless, if Imigran fails to gain a licence before January,
he plans to reduce his 1993 sales estimates.
The other question mark is the dollar. BZW estimates that for every 10 cents
the dollar loses, Pounds 30m is knocked off Glaxo's pre-tax profits and 2p
off its earnings per share.
Despite such risks, Wood-Gush believes Glaxo's shares look cheap. Fund
managers despairing of a recovery may look at the group's continuing
earnings growth and increase their weighting.
Brookner's heroine will surely not have sold her Glaxo shares. But if she
has looked after her legacy, she might well consider buying more of the
stock.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Americans set UK on the right track - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOMINANCE of American culture often causes resentment in the UK. Many
Britons long for the days when fast food meant fish and chips, not Big Macs,
and when cinemas showed Ealing comedies rather than Lethal Weapon 3. But
there are some areas where a dose of American business culture can do
Britain a lot of good. In financial services, it has often seemed that US
consumers have had a much wider choice and a better standard of service than
their British counterparts. As one example, those who do not want to pay a
credit card fee have 447 cards to choose from.
Some US practices and products are filtering over to the British side of the
Atlantic, though, and there are two prime examples this week. The first is
the 'tracker' or index fund. The concept is based on the evidence that most
fund managers fail to beat the stock market indices. Rather than gamble on
finding one of the few managers who can beat the index, why not just create
a fund that buys all the shares in the index?
These index funds have seized a large part of the institutional market in
the US and are becoming increasingly popular with UK pension funds. But, as
I have argued before, the concept is even better news for the private
investor, who finds it so difficult to obtain a properly diversified
portfolio or to pick 'blue chip' stocks that live up to the name.
There are several indexed unit trusts in existence already, but none based
on the most prominent UK market benchmark - the FT-SE 100 index. On
September 28, though, James Capel will launch a Footsie fund that gives
investors a simple way to invest in 100 of Britain's biggest companies. The
aim will be to track the index within 0.15 per cent a month and the fund
will have an initial charge of 4 per cent, with a discount of 1 per cent
until the end of the year. The annual charge is 1 per cent.
These charges are not the cheapest in the indexed market. Gartmore abolished
the initial charge on its index fund (which tracks the FT-A All-Share)
earlier this year and its annual charge is just 0.5 per cent. Indeed, there
is an argument that indexed funds should incur much lower costs than
traditional 'active' managers who have to visit companies, analyse accounts
and the like.
To be fair to Capel, there are extensive costs involved in establishing such
a fund, and Footsie can be a difficult index to track since stocks are
replaced on a fairly regular basis and some companies, such as Maxwell
Communications and Polly Peck, can disappear altogether. The Capel fund is
also available via a relatively low minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 (or
Pounds 40 a month via the savings scheme), compared with Pounds 5,000 (or
Pounds 100 a month) at Gartmore.
It is to be hoped, however, that if Capel does raise a substantial sum
though this offer, it will eventually pass on, via a lower annual charge,
some of the economies of scale that can be achieved through indexation.
The second development this week has a more direct American origin.
Fidelity, the big US financial services group, is expanding and re-launching
its stockbroking service. The share-owning culture is far more widespread in
the US, with many towns having their own stockbroker's office. Brokers do
not have the 'stuffy' image that they have in the UK (despite some valiant
efforts, by the likes of Sharelink, to alter perceptions).
The Fidelity service has many elements which other UK brokers may be able to
match and, indeed, beat but, as an overall package, it still looks
impressive. As before, you can call an 0800 freephone number for service
between 8am and 6pm on weekdays. The weekend hours have now been extended to
run from 9am to 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Commission charges are not the
lowest in the market but, at a minimum of Pounds 25 (on deals up to Pounds
2,500), they are reasonably competitive. (The rate on Pounds 2,501-Pounds
5,000 is Pounds 50; the maximum is Pounds 250).
Fidelity's Shareholder Plus service adds a further incentive by holding all
dividends in a money market account, linked to the Bank of Scotland, which
pays a gross rate of 8.5 per cent. Money awaiting investment will also be
held in this account. The money market account is not unique (Albert E.
Sharp has such an account for its discretionary clients, with a chequebook
attached). But two further elements of the service do seem particularly
interesting for those FT readers who are active investors.
First, there is a commission discount for those frequent traders who spend
more than Pounds 250 in commission in a calendar month. Second, Fidelity is
making it easier for investors to buy US and European shares. Judging from
the inquiries I have had at the FT, many investors have had problems buying
overseas stocks.
Fidelity's minimum commission on US securities is Dollars 38 (around Pounds
19). On a purchase of stock of Dollars 5,000, the commission would be
Dollars 88.50 (around Pounds 45). Commissions on European stocks are much
steeper, starting at Pounds 100.
The service is entirely execution-only, so it will not suit those many
investors who need advice on their portfolios. But even if your own broker
can match the above services, it must be good for investors to see a major
US group competing hard for business in the UK broking market.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Markets: Just the sound of Bush's voice lifts stocks - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bush finally made an impression on the stock markets this week.
Speaking to the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday afternoon, Bush outlined
his 'agenda for economic renewal,' which included spending cuts and an
across-the-board tax cut of 1 per cent.
As soon as his words reached Wall Street, investors started buying stocks
heavily, and by the close of trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
registered a 33-point gain, its best showing since July.
This was a distinct improvement on the last time the President made a big
speech. That was back in mid-August at the Republican convention in Houston.
Although his words that night raised spirits on the convention floor, they
went down like a lead balloon on financial markets. The following day the
Dow plunged 51 points and the dollar fell out of bed with a big bump.
So what did the President do right this time? It was difficult to tell at
first glance, primarily because his Detroit speech included little that he
has not said before - spending and tax cuts have been at the heart of the
Republican campaign since mid-summer.
Rather than applauding what he said, the market seemed to be applauding the
fact that he said it. Investors have been distressed these past few weeks by
Bush's inability to make a big and sustainable dent in Governor Bill
Clinton's lead in the polls. Concern about the outcome of the election has
been one of the chief factors restraining enthusiasm for equities.
To Wall Street, Thursday's speech showed that the President has finally hit
on what could be his most potent weapon come polling day in November - the
differences between his and his rival's fiscal policies. If the Republicans
hammer away at the message that their man stands for tax and spending cuts,
whereas the Democratic candidate stands for tax and spending increases, then
the President has a decent chance of winning re-election.
Nothing, of course, is that simple, least of all this year's election
campaign, which has sent so many confusing signals that the investors have
almost given up trying to make sense of it all. Uncertainty and confusion is
the enemy of any financial market, and if Bush's speech can help focus
voters' attention on the defining difference between the Republican and
Democratic candidates, then a 33-point bounce is justified.
Thursday's rally, however, was not just about the Bush speech. The dollar
rose more than one pfennig to DM1.425 in the afternoon on reports that US
aircraft had intercepted an Iraqi fighter over the 'no-fly' zone in northern
Iraq. Although no shots were fired and the Iraqi aeroplane quickly withdrew,
the incident was disturbing enough to send investors scurrying for the
safety of the dollar. The currency's advance buoyed equity investors, who
have been waiting for the dollar to stage a recovery from its recent bout of
the blues.
Stock market sentiment was also aided on Thursday by the latest falls in
interest rates. During the week the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell
to just over 7.23 per cent, its lowest level since 1986. Although over the
past year low US interest rates have not kick-started the economy as they
normally would after a recession, investors have not completely forsaken
their belief in the stimulative powers of cheap credit. Somewhere down the
line, they say, low interest rates are going to feed through into economic
growth.
Even if investors were not overly impressed by the political and economic
fundamentals of the market - the election, the dollar and interest rates -
they could draw comfort from technical indicators.
According to Investors Intelligence, a newsletter that tracks market
sentiment, the number of investment professionals that are bearish about the
outlook for the market rose sharply this week to the highest level seen so
far this year. Given that increased pessimism among investors often precedes
a market rally, the latest figures on sentiment may be a sign that the
market is ready to break out of its summer doldrums.
It did not go unnoticed that the last time bearish sentiment was stronger
than this week's measurement was mid-December last year. That low point
turned out to be the market's floor for 1991, and within a week investors
went on a buying spree which lasted more than a month and sent the Dow to a
succession of record highs.
A repeat performance would be most welcome, although conventional wisdom
suggests that the chances of the market engineering a sustained bull rally
in the last two months of a confusing, and probably close, presidential
election campaign are slim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco MIM, the fund management group, said this week it would be paying
compensation to Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust, which it manages, for
violating investment trust guidelines. The breach concerned a stake and loan
to Alma, the confectionery company which collapsed last year. Plans for a
reorganisation of Drayton are due to be submitted to shareholders in
October.
Meanwhile, Invesco MIM is merging three of its unit trusts - Commodity
Shares, Gold and International Leisure - into its International Growth
trust. None of the disappearing trusts has performed well; the Gold Trust,
in a process of reverse alchemy, has turned Pounds 100 into a leaden Pounds
29.30 over the past five years. Unitholders should not necessarily expect an
improvement; the International Growth trust is 36th out of 38 trusts in its
sector over 10 years.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Guaranteed equity launch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Dunbar is launching a guaranteed equity product. Like other recent
offerings it invests in options. The account lasts five years. On each
anniversary, investors will receive at least 85 per cent of the rise in the
FT-SE 100 index over the period. Gains will be locked in and guaranteed at
the end of five years. If the market goes down over a 12-month period, the
account will keep its value - and Allied Dunbar guarantees that it will not
lose over five years.
The drawbacks are the inflexibility - no money can be withdrawn early except
on death - the lack of income (investors do not benefit from the yield on
the Footsie) and the tax position. Any profits on the product are subject to
income tax but profits on conventional equity investment are subject to
capital gains tax. Since each investor has an annual Pounds 5,800 CGT
allowance, after indexation for inflation, few ever pay CGT. See Serious
Money.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Murdoch plans to raise Dollars 690m from global share
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS CORPORATION, the media empire of Mr Rupert Murdoch which was almost
overwhelmed by its bank debts two years ago, last night signalled another
milestone in its return to financial health by announcing a global share
offering likely to raise some Dollars 690m (Pounds 350m) before fees.
The Australian-based company also confirmed reports that it plans to cut its
bank debt through a Dollars 1bn issue of senior debt securities in the US
market.
Mr Murdoch said he hoped the twin fundraisings would go 'a long way towards
accomplishing our pre-eminent goal, which is to achieve an investment grade
rating'. The company's debt is currently rated several notches below
investment grade by the agencies Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
After growing rapidly by acquisitions and new television ventures during the
1980s, News Corporation found itself tipped into financial crisis by its
Dollars 7.6bn of borrowings in late 1990 and underwent a long and painful
debt renegotiation with nearly 150 banks.
The equity offering, which follows one in December last year which raised
Dollars 404m, involves the issue of 40m ordinary shares, including 18m to be
offered in the US and Canada in the form of American Depositary Shares.
About 13m will be aimed at the Australian market, 5m at the UK and 4m at the
rest of the world. Merrill Lynch, the New York securities house, will act as
global co-ordinator.
News Corporation said it intended to use the entire proceeds of the two debt
and equity offerings to repay bank debt. It noted that in the fiscal year to
June it raised Dollars 1.8bn from asset sales and public and private debt
offerings as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Mr Murdoch said that the proceeds of the offers would satisfy most of the
company's debt amortisation due in February 1994 and the balance would be
satisfied from operating cash flow.

18% in second quarter
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN STANLEY, the New York investment bank, yesterday reported an 18 per
cent rise in second-quarter income as it joined other Wall Street houses in
profiting from the continuing boom in new securities issuance.
Its results fell short of analysts' average expectations but the shares
closed up Dollars  1/4 on Wall Street at Dollars 49 7/8 .
The company reported income of Dollars 119m or Dollars 1.36 a share, against
Dollars 100.9m or Dollars 1.26 in the same period last year. Wall Street
forecasts had been pitched around Dollars 1.47 a share.
Net revenues - gross revenues minus interest expense - rose to Dollars
764.1m, from Dollars 669.1m.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, president, said the
firm had continued to perform well throughout the quarter, 'reflecting the
company's global positioning and a strong market for our underwriting
services'.
Investment banking revenues rose from Dollars 190.5m to Dollars 284.2m.
Secondary revenues - combined trading revenues, commissions and net interest
 -had declined, 'reflecting fixed income and commodities results below
1991's high levels, which were partly offset by increased foreign exchange
revenues'.
Principal trading - trading on the company's own account - produced revenues
of Dollars 204.3m, down from Dollars 323.6m, but the company booked Dollars
20.6m in revenue from investments, compared to nil a year ago.
Commissions rose from Dollars 55.6m to Dollars 77.4m, while asset management
and administration revenues were up from Dollars 37.7m to Dollars 53m.
Six-month income totalled Dollars 258.1m, or Dollars 2.98 a share, against
Dollars 221m or Dollars 2.80 in the first half of 1991.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Planning a decade without power: Loosening links with Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELEGATE returning to this year's Trades Union Congress after an absence
of 10 years would have found much unchanged.
There were composite motions combining contradictory views and an arcane
internal dispute - over the readmission of the EETPU electricians' union -
which was incomprehensible to most outsiders, but was almost the only matter
to excite the delegates all week.
But beneath the surface, radical steps were being taken to reposition
British trade unionism for another decade without political influence.
Most union leaders accept that they will carry influence in industry or
politics only if they effectively represent the varied, sometimes
contradictory, interests of their members.
That means a looser link with the Labour party, a slimmed-down TUC
bureaucracy and a new relationship with employers, symbolised in the
highpoint of the week - the address to Congress by Mr Howard Davies,
director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
Plenty of wise things were said in the debate on slimming and refocusing the
TUC bureaucracy, and it was agreed to reduce the TUC's priority areas from
17 to six.
The political will to stop the TUC spreading itself too thin is not yet
there, though, and Congress once again committed the bureaucracy to
innumerable fresh campaigns.
A new leader at Congress House, the TUC headquarters in London, might
provide the impetus genuine refocusing requires.
Mr Norman Willis, the TUC general secretary, bounced back from pre-Congress
speculation about his future and had, by his standards, a reasonable week.
But he is almost certain to go within the next year.
During that period, the unions' ties with the Labour Party will be
re-ordered.
There was no TUC debate on the subject but there was a vivid illustration of
why some want to abolish the link when Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB
general union, led calls for the devaluation of sterling.
Either the union leaders will change Labour's policy, undermining the
party's claim to speak for the country as a whole, or they will create a row
between the the two 'wings' of the labour movement.
Most union leaders recognise the constraints the Labour link imposes on
their political lobbying and are keen to become more broad-based. But few
can contemplate an end to direct influence in the party.
There is no reform model leading the debate. The idea of converting the 5m
political levy payers in the unions, most of whom are unaware that they even
pay the levy, into 'associate members' of the party, is widely considered
too complex and a recipe for bankrupting the party.
The best guess is that the union vote at the Labour conference, the central
element of the link, will continue to decline to 50 per cent or less and
votes will not be cast in blocks.
If there is ever another Labour government, much will have changed. It will
have looser links with organised labour and much else will have changed from
1979 - the last time Labour held office.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Barclays vows to fight writs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK, the largest of the high street clearers, yesterday vowed to
fight writs served on it alleging that its customers lost money through
'phantom' cash machine withdrawals.
Five banks and building societies - Barclays, Midland, TSB, Nationwide
Building Society and Lloyds - have been named as defendants in an action
brought by Mr Denis Whalley, a Merseyside sollicitor. The action is on
behalf of nine alleged victims of 'phantom' withdrawals from automated
teller machines.
Barclays said yesterday the action was 'misconceived' and that it had
complete confidence in its auto-teller systems. 'At the same time, we are
very pleased that at long last we will have the opportunity to defend our
position in the courts,' it added.
The bank said it had already made a payment to Mr Stephen Raw, one of the
three Barclays customers among the nine plaintiffs. The payment did not
constitute an admission that there had been a 'phantom' withdrawal.
Midland and Lloyds also confirmed that they had received writs from Mr
Whalley. Each bank faces two claims. Lloyds says it has paid the disputed
amount in one case, even though it would have preferred the case to go to
the banking ombudsman for a definitive ruling.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Major sees prominent Scots to 'take stock'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER held a three-hour meeting in Edinburgh yesterday with 14
distinguished Scots as part of his pre-general election pledge to 'take
stock' of Scotland's constitutional place in the UK.
Opposition parties condemned the discussions as a sham, claiming that people
advocating real political change had not been invited.
Some of Mr Major's guests said the underlying presumption of the debate had
been that the union between Scotland and England should be strengthened, and
that a Scottish assembly - favoured by Labour and the Liberal Democrats -
was not the way forward.
Sir William Fraser, the principal of Glasgow University and a former
Scottish office civil servant, said it had been made clear to the prime
minister that in some areas there was a feeling that 'Scotland somehow was
different', and policies applied in England did not necessarily have to be
applied in Scotland, too.
In particular, Sir William said, some guests defended local government in
Scotland whose strength, they felt, the government should recognise.
He added: 'Some people suggested, and I certainly agree with them, there was
further scope for decentralisation of British government departments.'
Another guest, Professor Arthur Midwinter, of Strathclyde University's
Department of Government, said as he left: 'I suggested the government ought
to have a less abrasive style in Scotland and ought to consult more widely.'
Mr Major told journalists the 'very good debate' had put a different
perspective on some constitutional questions. He confirmed that concern had
been expressed about decentralisation, as opposed to devolution, in the
private and public sector, but declined to be drawn on what he described as
'rather surprising points' made during the meeting.
He said the 14 guests had been selected for their personal capabilities
rather than their public positions. 'I'm trying to gauge the instincts of
people and what they believe needs to be done to enshrine and secure the
distinctiveness of Scotland and its place within the union.'
Many Scots, he said, had not fully appreciated the extent to which
administrative responsibility had been devolved from Whitehall to the
Scottish Secretary in recent years.
Asked later who had picked the 14 guests, Mr Major said, to laughter, he had
devolved the selection to the Scottish secretary.
Guests said the prime minister had been 'in listening mode'.
Mr Major indicated his hope to complete his consultations by the end of the
year but refused to set a timetable.
The guests included Mr Scott Bell, managing director of Standard Life
Assurance, Sir Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish and Newcastle, Mr Bruce
Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland and his deputy Professor Jack
Shaw, chairman of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, Mr Bill
Brown, chairman of Scottish Television and Scottish Amicable Life Assurance
Society, Mr Angus Grossart, managing director of Noble Grossart, Ms Barbara
Kelly, chairman of the Rural Forum, Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of
PIEDA, the Edinburgh consultants, Mr Magnus Magnusson, broadcaster and
chairman of Scottish Natural Heritage, and Mr Allan Massie, author.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Smith faces party unrest on Europe: Senior Labour MPs add to
strong criticisms of Maastricht accords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday faced renewed and outspoken
statements on Europe by some of the party's senior spokesmen.
The economic criticism of the Maastricht treaty and the European exchange
rate mechanism, continued yesterday to be the theme of Mr Bryan Gould, the
shadow heritage secretary. High exchange rates were 'throttling' industry by
pricing British goods and jobs out of the market, he said at a conference in
Neath, south Wales.
'It is in these circumstances that we are invited to make the straitjacket
permanent and to place it beyond political debate or action by signing up
for the Maastricht treaty.
'It almost beggars belief that we are now invited to hand over our economic
policy to unaccountable bankers who are instructed by the treaty to give
overriding priority to price stability above all other economic goals and
who would require massive cuts in public spending at a time of deep
recession.
Mr Gould warned of a risk of entrenching as a permanent feature of European
life the policies that have created the worst recession in two generations.
'No wonder the people of Europe are rebelling against their leaders,' he
added.
Labour scepticism on Europe will be bolstered today by a warning from Mr
David Blunkett, another shadow cabinet member, that enthusiasm for further
European integration could risk an increase in racism and fascism in the UK.
Other Labour MPs, including Mr John Morris, the shadow attorney-general,
yesterday added their voices to those calling for a British referendum on
Maastricht.
While Labour's leadership has come under fire for lacking a clear position
on Maastricht and for not bringing the Euro-sceptics back into line, party
officials say there is little to be gained by refining the party's policy
until after the French referendum.
Labour's line both on Maastricht and on the ERM in the circumstances after
the French decision will be thrashed out at the meetings of the national
executive committee, Labour's ruling body, and the shadow cabinet in the
week before the start of the party conference in Blackpool at the end of the
month. Mr Smith has already made clear that he does not favour a referendum.
After a week in which Labour Euro-sceptics have, unusually, been more vocal
than their Tory counterparts, the issue has gathered steam in the run-up to
Labour's conference. The forthcoming elections to the national executive
committee are also thought by some at Westminster to have contributed to the
higher profile of the Euro-sceptics.
Labour officials played down the MPs' statements, arguing that, for example,
Mr Gould's stance on the ERM was well known and had not found much support
during his unsuccessful challenge for the party leadership.
Mr Blunkett's call today is for European policy to take a new direction, in
order to 'root out racism'.

NATIONAL Savings receipts last month fell to only Pounds 126m compared with
more than Pounds 481m in August, the Department for National Savings
reported yesterday.
It explained that the drop was attrributable partly to the withdrawal from
sale of some products including fixed-interest certificates for three weeks.
The July figure was inflated by funds attracted to the First Option bond.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Ofwat meter study may inflame water debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY one household in 10 with a water meter as difficulty in coping with
water bills, according to a study published yesterday by Ofwat, the water
industry watchdog. The findings are likely to inflame debate over the
benefits of water metering.
The report into the social impact of water metering also finds that 41 per
cent of homes fitted with a water meter make no effort to curb their
consumption.
Ofwat, together with the Department of the Environment, has thrown its
support behind wider household metering to help cut demand for water in
regions suffering a shortage.
However, consumer groups have protested that poor families would pay more.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, pointed out that 91 per cent of
those surveyed had no difficulty in affording their metered water bills.
He said: 'Overall, the trials do not appear to have caused difficulties for
many customers and this is encouraging.'
Advocates of metering will also get support from Ofwat's finding that 35 per
cent of households used less water under metering.
Nevertheless, the National Consumer Council said the results bolstered its
opposition to meters.
Ms Wendy Toms, of the council, said:'It is clear from this survey that if
people can afford to pay bills generally then they are not going to save
water. The hardship of saving water will fall most on the poorest people.'
The survey was based on more than 6,000 homes in England and Wales where
meters have been fitted on a trial basis. Only 3 per cent of the 21m homes
in England and Wales now have a water meter, but the report notes that the
areas hosting the trials 'are generally more affluent than Great Britain as
a whole'.
Ofwat said that within the 8.3 per cent of metered homes having trouble in
paying metered water bills, most were low-income households where there was
a struggle to pay other bills.
On further interviewing, it found that 'the majority of this group worried a
lot about their water bills and in some cases this had contributed to family
tension and argument'.

<TEXT>
Russia has made its first territorial 'concession' over the disputed South
Kurile Islands by leasing 378 hectares to a Hong Kong company which wants to
build a tourist complex, Leyla Boulton reports from Moscow.
Mr Viktor Sirenko, deputy governor of the Sakhalin and Kurile region, who is
trying to develop the four islands' economic potential despite the row with
Japan, said a company called Carlson and Kaplan had paid Rbs200m for the
50-year lease. They had promised to equip Shikotan island with hotels, a
casino, and riding, cycling and shooting facilities - and its first proper
road.
The concession could further strain relations with Japan, which has withheld
any finance for the islands until they are returned to it - a hope that took
a major blow this week when President Boris Yeltsin cancelled his visit to
Tokyo.

French referendum on the Maastricht treaty next Sunday.
Presidential aides said Mr Mitterrand would stay in hospital for four to six
days, but he firmly intended to cast his referendum vote in person and
attend the Franco-African summit in Gabon in the first week of October.
The officials' soothing words, however, are unlikely to dampen speculation
about the president's political future, which was already rife before the
operation.
While they insisted that some 80,000 Frenchmen underwent successful prostate
interventions every year, clinical tests still have to establish whether Mr
Mitterrand's complaint was benign or whether he was suffering from a
malignant tumour.
Even if he recovers quickly, those Mitterrand supporters who would like to
see him run for a third term at the next presidential election in 1995 must
now consider the chances of this happening as greatly diminished.
Mr Mitterrand's ill-health also makes it more likely that he would resign in
the event of a No vote in the referendum, though he has repeatedly avoided
committing himself to any course of action if that happens.
It was not clear what effect the president's temporary incapacity will have
on the referendum campaign in which he has played a crucial part. His
impressive performance in a television debate nine days ago, at a time when
the No campaigners had established a clear lead in the opinion polls,
completely reversed the trend.
Louis Harris and CSA polls, published last night, respectively gave the Yes
camp 54 and 52 per cent of the vote. However, a BVA poll published today
predicted a tie. Publication of official polls will be banned from midnight
tonight until voting day, on September 20.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Panic shuffles his cabinet to weaken Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, yesterday appointed five new
cabinet ministers in an effort to strengthen the federal government at the
expense of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Ilija Djukic, the ambassador to China, was appointed foreign minister,
replacing Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, who on Thursday resigned after accusing Mr
Panic of betraying Serbian interests. Mr Jovanovic was seen to be carrying
out Mr Milosevic's instructions. The other appointments included the posts
of finance, agricultural and transport ministers.
The sackings were the latest in a series of moves by Mr
Left: Sarajevo residents queue for water yesterday in an area of the Bosnian
capital hit hard by the continuing fighting
Panic to weaken Mr Milosevic's power base. The Belgrade-born California
businessman has so far wrested control of the federal army and the Interior
Ministry from the Serbian president.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of a Yugoslav peace conference,
yesterday met Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the unrecognised Yugoslavia,
which now comprises only Serbia and Montenegro, and Mr Panic.
They later met top military officials and Mr Milosevic, who is seen by the
international community as the chief instigator of carnage in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
After the meeting, Mr Milosevic said he was optimistic of a quick end to the
bloodshed.
'It is important that the (Geneva peace) conference has assumed a very
objective course. . .leading us to hope that the crisis will be solved much
faster than we had anticipated,' he said.
'The time for war has long since passed and the time for coming together' of
the warring factions has arrived, Lord Owen told reporters. 'I believe Mr
Milosevic is a very crucial person in that kind of future,' he added.
Mr Panic reiterated his intention to halt the bloodshed in Bosnia as soon as
possible.
Reuter reports from Rome: The commander of Nato forces in Europe said
yesterday peace would return to Bosnia only through a political settlement
and criticised those campaigning for military action.
General John Shalikashvili, an American, said in Taranto: 'We will not
advance the cause of peace if we continue to insist on a military solution
to the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.'

FT  12 SEP 92 / Cabinet resistance to EC post for Kinnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN for Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, to take over as
Britain's second EC commissioner in Brussels has run into unexpected
opposition within the cabinet.
Mr John Smith, the present opposition leader, has informally proposed to Mr
John Major that Mr Kinnock be appointed to the high-profile post. He would
replace Mr Bruce Millan as Labour's nominee to work alongside Sir Leon
Brittan, the senior British commissioner.
Traditionally the prime minister would automatically accept Mr Smith's
recommendation, but ministers said last night that it had caused serious
concern about the potential impact on the Tory back benches.
Some ministers are questioning whether the proposed appointment would
encourage more Tory MPs to rebel against Mr Major's support for Maastricht.
Their fears underline the sensitivity in the highest ranks of the government
over Europe.
It is understood that Mr Kinnock discussed a possible move with Mr Major
just before the summer break. Mr Kinnock left with the impression that the
prime minister was ready to endorse his appointment. Mr Millan has said he
is ready to stand down at the end of this year in favour of the former
Labour leader.
But during a discussion at Thursday's cabinet meeting some ministers raised
the possibility that Mr Kinnock's nomination to such an influential post
could inflame passions among Tory MPs about the Maastricht treaty on
European union. No firm proposal was put to the cabinet.
Last night senior Labour officials indicated that Mr Smith would not
formally propose Mr Kinnock until it was clear that Mr Major would endorse
his appointment. But the view of one senior minister was that, with the
dispute in the open, the prime minister would have to move quickly to
resolve the issue.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Super-regulator woos banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLACES will be reserved for banks and building societies on the board of a
proposed new super-regulator for retail financial services, in a move
intended to encourage banks to participate in a body they say they do not
wish to join.
Sources familiar with a consultative document on the new self-regulatory
body, to be known as the Private Investment Authority, said it left room for
up to 30 members on its board of directors.
Of those, 10 to 12 would be 'product providers' such as life insurers and
unit trust companies. Should the banks become members, some of the seats
will be allocated to their representatives.
Six or seven of the remaining seats will be reserved for public-interest
members such as consumer representatives, lawyers and accountants.
The retail financial services arms of the big banks are mostly regulated
directly by the Securities and Investments Board. Persuading them to switch
to membership in the PIA is considered critical to its success. The large
life insurers have said they will not participate unless the banks become
members as well.
Members of the PIA formation committee, headed by Sir Brian Hayes, have
sought meetings with the Treasury and the Bank of England to urge them to
promote membership among banks and others.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Prices index shows lowest August rise for a decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNWARD pressure on prices continued last month as hard-pressed
retailers avoided repeating many of the previous August's price increases.
The 0.1 per cent rise in the retail prices index from 138.8 in July to 138.9
last month was the smallest monthly increase for any August since 1982.
Muted price increases for food, motoring costs, gas and household goods
contributed to the fall in the annual rate from 3.7 per cent to 3.6 per
cent.
Seasonal food prices continued to show the most spectacular falls, dropping
by 12 per cent last month compared with the same month a year ago. That was
the lowest annual rate for nearly 10 years.
Seasonal food prices normally rise in August, but increases this year were
not as sharp as last year, with prices for fresh vegetables and fruit
continuing to fall. The 1.1 per cent increase on the previous month was
mainly the result of dearer potatoes.
According to the figures from the Central Statistical Office, overall food
prices dropped to their lowest annual rate of increase since May 1983.
However, within that, non-seasonal food prices were boosted by more
expensive confectionery, dairy products and imported lamb.
The fall in clothing and footwear prices, compared with a year ago,
reflected special offers for seasonal clothing and continued cut-price sales
for women's clothes. Prices for menswear recovered slightly.
The highest annual rates of price increases continued to be in the service
sector.
Household services rose by 5.9 per cent in the year to August, although
lower house conveyancing charges and estate agents' fees led to a 0.1 per
cent drop on the previous month. Personal goods and services and leisure
services showed high year-on-year rates of increase.
The 0.2 per cent monthly increase in housing costs mainly reflected an
increase in mortgage interest payments.
Fuel and light prices fell 0.5 per cent on the month as the second phase of
the cut in gas prices continued.
Motoring costs fell 0.2 per cent on the month, reflecting lower petrol
prices, although the price of MoT tests increased in August.
The disinflationary momentum in the economy is likely to continue this
month, even though most summer cut-price sales will end and new stock will
enter the shops.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Oftel chief prefers price caps to profit ceilings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, gave a clear warning
yesterday that he would not hesitate to take tough measures to stamp out
market abuse.
Sir Bryan indicated in his first speech since taking up office in June that
he intended to continue the policies he used when director-general of Oftel,
the telecommunications watchdog.
Price-capping or divestment should be considered where it proved difficult
or impossible to inject competition into a market, Sir Bryan said at an
anti-trust conference in Cambridge.
He did not favour a profits ceiling even though high profits were often an
indication that a dominant position was being exploited. He would prefer a
price cap of the type he imposed on British Telecommunications when at
Oftel. A cap would require a company to limit price rises enough to allow
the expectation of a reasonable rate of return while avoiding direct limits
on profits. That would encourage improvements in efficiency.
Sir Bryan said measures to introduce competition by lowering entry barriers
to competitors sometimes worked slowly, and dominant businesses tended to
dominate for long periods.
The role of competition authorities was to create the conditions in which
effective competition could take place so that its benefits could flow
quickly to consumers.
Sir Bryan also indicated that he would pay particular attention to complex
monopolies and duopolies. While simple monopolies were easily recognisable,
he said, difficulties could arise where a market was shared among a few
companies. A duopoly could be an unsatisfactory arrangement unless one of
the parties was a dynamic, competing new entrant.
Kodak and six other film manufacturers have been released from undertakings
originally given in 1966 after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
the colour film market.
The undertakings required Kodak not to discriminate between retail outlets.
They also required all seven companies to make colour film available to
retailers at prices both including and excluding the cost of processing.
The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that the Office of Fair
Trading had concluded that the undertakings, last reviewed in 1983, were no
longer relevant.
Undertakings given by CMB Foodcan, formerly Metal Box, in 1970 in relation
to the supply of metal containers have been revised after a review last year
by Sir Gordon Borrie, who was then director-general of fair trading.

A MOTORIST yesterday made legal history when his conviction for failing to
provide a breath specimen was quashed because of a legal loophole.
It was thought that more than 100,000 other drivers with similar convictions
in England and Wales going back almost 25 years could now apply for them to
be overturned.
Mr Kofi Gandaa, aged 41, a computer engineer of Camberwell, south-east
London, had been found guilty of failing to provide a breath specimen.
He had been convicted under Section 7(6) of the 1988 Road Traffic Act by Bow
Street magistrates in London.
His counsel, Mr Donal McGuire, said section 7(6) of the act was 'bad for
duplicity'. It created two offences of failing to provide a specimen and
there were different penalties for each.

Midland and Lloyds confirmed they had received writs from Mr Whalley. Lloyds

FT  12 SEP 92 / Insurance claims rise starts to slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in insurance claims are beginning to slow down but remain at an
'unacceptable' level, the Association of British Insurers announced
yesterday.
Total theft claims fell in the second quarter of the year, to Pounds 249.5m
from Pounds 300.7m. The second-quarter figure is still 10.4 per cent
greater, however, than for the same quarter last year. Total claims for the
12 months to June are 39.8 per cent greater than the claims for the previous
year at Pounds 1.022bn.
Statistics for fire insurance show were gloomier. Claims for the second
quarter were at Pounds 284.5m, an increase of 16.1 per cent from the Pounds
245.0m for the same quarter last year.
Mr Mike Jones, the ABI's chief executive, said: 'After some miserable
figures for thefts and fire damage, there are some signs that the rate of
increase is at last slowing down. Even so, the increase in claims remains at
an unacceptable level.'
He warned consumers: 'Unless all our efforts are successful, further
increases in premium rates are unavoidable.'
A survey by Which? magazine earlier this year showed that premiums for
household contents policies had already increased substantially.
Average premiums for a typical building and contents policy in a medium-risk
area increased to Pounds 444 this year from Pounds 338 last year. Some
increases were much greater. Norwich Union increased premiums in low-risk
areas by 93 per cent, according to the survey.
The Consumers' Association has claimed that premiums are being increased 'to
make consumers pay for past mistakes'.
The ABI drew attention to bogus and inflated claims, and also said it was
encouraging adequate security measures through its premium structure.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Tarmac to close four of its factories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TARMAC, Britain's biggest construction and materials group, said yesterday
it was closing four plants as well as cutting output of bricks by more than
a third and production of concrete blocks by more than a tenth.
The closures will lead to the loss of 300 jobs in addition to the 5,000
Tarmac has shed in the past 18 months.
The mounting crisis in the construction industry was underlined yesterday by
the decisions by two building groups, Evered Bardon and Lilley, to cut or
cancel their interim dividends.
Meanwhile, Environment Department figures issued yesterday showed a 5 per
cent fall in construction output in Great Britain during the three months to
the end of June compared with the corresponding period last year.
The Building Employers' Confederation, the largest trade association in the
industry, said the figures were disastrous for a sector that had already
been in recession for at least three years.
'They would have been even worse but for an increase in public spending,'
the confederation said. 'This shows how important it is that government
should not reduce investment in construction in the autumn spending round.'
The brick industry has suffered worse than most in the construction downturn
because about 60 per cent of bricks are sold for housebuilding.
The brick manufacturing workforce has fallen by 30 per cent since 1988 from
14,000 to fewer than 10,000. Nevertheless, the industry continues to suffer
from serious overcapacity.
More than 1.4bn unsold bricks, equivalent to six months' supply, were
stockpiled by manufacturers at the end of July - enough to build 170,000
homes.
Even after recent plant closures announced by Redland, Butterley and Tarmac,
the industry will have the ability to manufacture 900m more bricks a year
than it is selling, representing overcapacity of nearly a third.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, said the closures were a
response to an industry-wide affliction.
He added: 'We do not expect to lose market share, and look to our
competitors to follow this strong lead in reducing industry capacity in line
with both current and foreseeable market demand.'
The closure of four plants by the company will reduce its capacity from 270m
to 170m a year. The plants are at Bothwell Park, Strathclyde; Campbell,
Derbyshire; Severn Valley, Avon; and Kibblesworth, Tyne and Wear.
The decision to close the plants comes seven months after Tarmac abandoned
its attempt to merge its brick operations with Steetley.
Steetley was eventually acquired by Redland, the country's second-largest
brick manufacturer, which controls about 17 per cent of the British market.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BIL expects some Gibbs family acceptances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY INVESTMENTS Limited, the New Zealand Investment company traded on
the USM, yesterday posted the offer document detailing its Pounds 11m
hostile bid for Gibbs Mew, the USM-quoted brewer and property development
group.
Although nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by the Gibbs family and
directors, Mr Stephen Bellamy of BIL, said he was confident that the 200p
per share offer would prove tempting to some members of the family.
'We believe some of them, controlling 18 per cent of the shares, may accept
our offer,' he said. He is also targeting non-family board members such as
Ms Tessa Brook, who controls about 9 per cent of the shares.
BIL owns 19.7 per cent of Gibbs after the group's biggest shareholder,
Scottish Amicable, sold its 7.8 per cent stake in July.
The offer document says Gibbs' property profits had proved transitory. The
commercial property subsidiary, which contributed Pounds 1.4m in pre-tax
profits between 1988 and 1990, made aggregate pre-tax losses of more than
Pounds 700,000 in 1991 and 1992.
The pre-tax profit amounted to Pounds 633,000 (Pounds 673,000) for the 12
months to March 28.
Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman of Gibbs said: 'BIL's offer significantly
undervalues Gibbs' assets and prospects. It represents an unwelcome attempt
to obtain the ..company's assets on the cheap.'

For the same period last year taxable profits amounted to Pounds 11.1m.
However, the results for the two periods are not comparable because of the
group's restructuring in June 1991 preparatory to flotation.
First half operating revenue came to Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 92.5m) and
earnings per share to 5.8p (9.4p). The group is paying a 2.5p interim and
forecasts a same-again 5p final.

The outcome was achieved on turnover down by some Pounds 900,000 to Pounds
8.6m. Earnings emerged at 2.2p (4.6p) per share and the interim dividend is
being maintained at 2.2p.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Arcadian deficit cut sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arcadian International, the leisure development group, cut its pre-tax
losses from Pounds 3.68m to Pounds 853,000 for the year to April 30.
Exceptional credits of Pounds 187,000 compared with previous provisions of
Pounds 1.94m. Net interest payable was cut to Pounds 171,000 (Pounds
484,000). Turnover totalled Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 10.7m) and losses per share
10p (32.2p).
The board, chaired by Sir Peter Parker, said the improved results reflected
continuing strong progress in the European leisure operations and the
group's now low exposure to the UK commercial property market.
The 'strong balance sheet' and negligible gearing at the year-end was helped
by the commercial property disposal programme. There were only two
properties remaining with an aggregate book value of Pounds 2.95m, he said.
The board believed that with a portfolio of 'outstanding projects' the
process of increasing shareholder value 'was already underway'.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Co-operative Bank raises provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD DEBT provisions at Co-operative Bank rose by 11 per cent during the 26
weeks to mid-July, compared to the same period last year, writes David
Barchard.
However the bank which lost Pounds 6m in 1991 showed signs of a recovery
this year. Though its loan book contracted, reflecting reduced demand in the
market and tougher credit conditions, retail deposits were said to have
grown steadily in the half year, leaving the bank highly liquid.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.5m, up from Pounds 700,000, after a 12 per
cent rise in opera- ting profits during the half year. The bank, which is
mutually owned, paid out Pounds 2.8m in dividends on its preference shares.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harmony directors oppose call for EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Harmony Leisure, the loss-making pubs and restaurant group,
yesterday urged shareholders to reject a call from challengers to the board
to hold an extraordinary general meeting.
Executive directors at the USM-quoted company, which reported a loss of
Pounds 1.04m in the year to March 31 1991 and a further Pounds 445,000 in
the following six months, are facing a challenge from a group which aims 'to
return Harmony to profit and to generate enough confidence to raise capital
for expansion'.
The company has not yet released its 1991-92 results but has promised to do
so soon.
Shareholders have been urged to requisition an EGM by an 'alternative board'
led by Mr Andrew Martyr, a former hotel executive, and Mr Simon Lynch,
formerly with Grand Metropolitan.
None of the prospective directors in the new team, which also includes Mr
Ronald Laden, former chairman of Quaker Oats (Europe), and Mr Simon Smith, a
London solicitor, holds any Harmony shares.
Mr Stanley Lever, managing director at Harmony, described their proposals as
'opportunistic'.
Speaking from France yesterday, he said Mr Martyr had sought a stake in
Harmony in 1991. 'But he was unable or unwilling to demonstrate that the
necessary resources were available.'
Admitting that the company's poor performance had made it a target for
potential takeovers, Mr Lever blamed Harmony's problems on its growing debt.
'Borrowings have escalated, largely through interest charges. But I can't
see what this group could do to pull it round,' he said.
The challengers to the company, which owns 23 pubs and restaurants in London
and the south-east, have also proposed a 50 per cent cut in board salaries
and performance-related pay for company staff.
Mr Lever said their plans would be vigorously opposed and voiced confidence
that shareholders would reject the proposals. Harmony shares were unchanged
yesterday at 5 1/2 p.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lilley omits interim pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLEY, the Glasgow-based contracting and construction group which has been
among the hardest hit by the collapse of the property development market,
yesterday omitted its interim dividend.
The group achieved an 18 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.05m
for the half year to June 30. However, the rise reflected a cut in interest
charges from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 1m. At the operating level, profits were
down from Pounds 3.46m to Pounds 2.31m with the contracting contribution
down by Pounds 1.83m at Pounds 2.23m.
The passing of the interim dividend - 1p was paid previously - was blamed on
a continuing 'hostile and uncertain' climate.
Sir Lewis Robertson, chairman and one of the UK's leading company doctors,
commenting on the group's interim results and depressed share price,
emphasised that Lilley continued to have the support of its bankers and
Tibest Tres, the company owned by two of Spain's largest construction groups
which paid Pounds 24m for a 21.5 per cent stake in Lilley last autumn.
He expressed hope that the publication of the interim results would 'dispel
unfounded market concern about the group's position,' and said action to
reduce group borrowings was continuing.
In particular, he noted that the unwinding of joint commitments with London
&amp; Edinburgh Trust earlier this year had reduced borrowings by about Pounds
10m, surplus housing land had been sold for Pounds 3.75m and Lilley's
interest in the New Hong Tunnel Company had been sold raising a further
Pounds 3.1m.
Group turnover for the opening half year fell to Pounds 156.34m (Pounds
162.16m) and earnings per share slipped to 0.75p (0.91p). Annual overheads
have been reduced by Pounds 4m following a review.
Turnover of the contracting operations fell to Pounds 117.4m (Pounds
123.6m). Lilley said workload was still at reasonable levels, but business
had been increasingly hard to secure and margins had been eroded throughout
the industry.
Turnover from specialist construction fell slightly to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds
27.3m) but operating profits fell more sharply to Pounds 441,000 (Pounds
2.14m) reflecting reduced volumes in piling and US leasing businesses.
In property development and housebuilding, operating losses were reduced to
Pounds 359,000 after recording a Pounds 931,000 gain on the sale of the
group's investment in Caledonian Land. In 1991, the section posted a Pounds
2.73m operating loss.
COMMENT
Lilley has been working as hard as it can just to survive. It is making all
the right moves by cutting overheads, selling assets, reducing debt and
getting out of the property development business. But although this seems to
have satisfied its bankers and its new Spanish shareholders, the market has
remained uneasy. Yesterday the stock gained 1 1/2 p to 8p. With full-year
pre-tax profits forecast at around Pounds 3m the prospective p/e is 4. But
with no yield to speak of, this is not a stock for the timid.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ex-Kelt chief launches hostile bid for
Blystad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chief executive of Kelt Energy, architect of one of the 1980s
more audacious but ultimately disastrous oil sector mergers, has launched a
bid to take over Blystad, owner of KCA Drilling, the much thumbed-over UK
independent offshore oil service company.
The hostile paper bid from Abbot Holdings, a private company set up by Mr
Alistair Locke, values the loss-making Blystad at Pounds 7.5m, or 5.4p a
share - a 20 per cent premium over the Blystad price before the bid.
The offer has the irrevocable support of three directors of the Norwegian
Blystad family who bought a 65 per cent stake in 1989. However, the
independent board, including the managing director, finance director and
Henry Ansbacher, the independent advisers, yesterday said they would not be
recommending the offer to shareholders.
Ansbacher said they were looking at a potential conflict of interest arising
from a Pounds 3.6m loan from Blystad to a company controlled by the Blystad
family.
Friendly negotiations with the independent directors broke down recently. In
order for Mr Locke to make his offer he required the Blystad board's waiver
of clauses in a confidentiality agreement he had signed precluding hostile
bids.
Blystad must repay a Dollars 5m loan in December, a payment which the Bank
of Ireland, making the offer on behalf of Abbot, says Blystad may not be
able to meet from its cash resources.
Mr Locke says his offer provides the best opportunity for minority
shareholders to retrieve something from a group that has paid no dividend
for seven years, has lost money in the last three years and has a deficit on
profit and loss account.
KCA - a profitable north sea operator with a number of platforms on charter
to oil majors - has passed through a number of hands and was once owned by
Bristol Oil and Minerals.
Mr Locke left Kelt after its highly leveraged bid for Carless in 1988 which
drove the company into the hands of its bankers and led to the forced sale
of its Wytch Farm stake.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon declines 55% and cuts
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERED BARDON yesterday became the latest British construction group to cut
its interim dividend after a sharp fall in first half pre-tax profits.
The building materials group, which has seen its share price fall by two
thirds since the spring, said that its main markets in the UK and US had
continued to suffer due to the recession in both countries.
Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said there was no sign of any recovery in the
UK. Improvements in the US, due to higher spending on infrastructure by some
states, was patchy and still had to show through in higher profits.
He appealed to the British government not to cut investment in roads in the
autumn spending round, which he said would be disastrous for an already
severely weakened UK construction industry.
Pre-tax profits during the first six months of this year fell by 55 per cent
from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 4.6m. The company is cutting its interim
dividend from 1.935p to 0.8p.
This is uncovered by earnings, which fell from 2p to 0.5p. After all
deductions the group made a loss of Pounds 800,000, compared with a retained
loss of Pounds 3.2m last time.
The shares which have fallen from a peak of 87p since May, were unchanged at
27p after yesterday's announcement.
In the UK, operating profits fell from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 8.3m as
volumes and margins for sand and gravel came under increasing pressure.
Sales of crushed rock and coated stone have increased but margins for
blacktop were relatively thin.
US profits fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 4.7m. Mr Tom said the decline
appeared worse than it was because the results included first-time figures
from Massachusetts for January and February - months in which the state
traditionally incurs losses.
On the positive side, the group's net debt had fallen to Pounds 236m. This
compared with Pounds 300m at the corresponding stage last year. Gearing,
despite the debt reduction, remains at 71 per cent if Pounds 25m of
convertible preference stock is included as borrowings.
Mr Tom said that disposals in the US should reduce net debt to about Pounds
200m, excluding preference shares, by about the year end.
COMMENT
Evered is paying the price for its ambitious acquisition policy in the
late-1980s which left the company saddled with large debts just as
construction markets were falling in the UK and US. Peter Tom is working
hard to cut costs and raise cash through disposals. He is doing all the
right things but it is going to be a very long haul and the UK market could
be still be moving against the company - particularly if the government
trims road spending in the autumn expenditure round. The US looks a little
brighter but recovery is likely to be slow with the economy still struggling
to get into gear. Profits of Pounds 15m would put the group on a prospective
p/e of 13, which is high enough.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Southend Property disposal
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHEND Property Holdings yesterday announced the sale of a Bedfordshire
shopping centre for Pounds 17m, writes Vanessa Houlder.
The buyer's identity was not disclosed.
The disposal will reduce Southend's gearing to about 108 per cent, on net
debt of Pounds 120m.
The cash element of the equation had stood at Pounds 21m before the sale.
Southend said the move furthered its policy of creating cash resources to
provide it with security and place it in a position to act immediately on
favourable opportunities.
The Quadrant Centre in Dunstable, which was constructed in the 1960s, is
producing about Pounds 1.7m of rental income.
It was included in Southend's accounts for the year ended March 31 at Pounds
17.5m.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US side cuts United Biscuits to Pounds 70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED BISCUITS' share price rose 24p to close at 259p yesterday after the
group announced actions to reverse a steep deterioration at Keebler, its US
snacks and biscuits operation.
The fall at Keebler was the main factor behind UB's 17 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits during the six months to July 11. Profits of Pounds 70m
compared with Pounds 84.4m, while sales fell by Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.53bn.
Keebler's trading profit fell to Pounds 12.1m from Pounds 29.7m on sales of
Pounds 508.8m (Pounds 512.5m). All the other divisions matched or slightly
exceeded the previous interim results.
UB said Keebler, the second largest US biscuit maker, had suffered from
'extremely unfavourable market conditions', particularly in the first
quarter. As well as recession, it faced fierce price competition, the impact
of rival brand launches and trading down by consumers to cheaper products.
Concern about Keebler's problems have led to a sharp fall in UB's share
price in recent months. UB said it was reviewing all Keebler's operations
and taking measures which should improve the company's performance by next
year, even if the US recession continued.
The recent closure of a California bakery would result in a Dollars 20m
extraordinary charge in the second half but yield annual savings of about
Dollars 9m from next year. Keebler's headquarters staff was being trimmed,
though no big management shake-up was planned.
UB said Keebler was putting a high priority on regaining market share. Since
the end of the first half, sales had increased 8 per cent on the comparable
period though little margin improvement was expected in the second half
because of higher marketing costs.
Keebler planned to re-orient its product strategy and to place more emphasis
on supplying private-label groceries to US retailers. Marketing,
particularly price promotions, was being reviewed to try to ensure money was
spent more effectively.
Mr Eric Nicoli, UB's chief executive, said Keebler remained committed to all
its main product lines and was not expected to undergo any fundamental shift
in strategy or radical restructuring.
Mr Robert Clarke, chairman, said the group's UK and continental European
operations had performed well in difficult circumstances. He expected no
real improvement in trading conditions in the second half, and margins would
remain under pressure.
In continental Europe, trading profit rose to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 9m) on
sales of Pounds 191.4m (Pounds 167m). The increase was due entirely to a
strong performance by McVitie's whereas KP's profit in the region fell 9 per
cent, due partly to investments in marketing and distribution in Spain and
Portugal. UB's recent continental acquisitions had all performed well.
In the UK, trading profit edged up to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds 64.4m) on sales
of Pounds 808.3m (Pounds 834.4m). Sales by both McVitie's and KP fell in the
face of declining biscuit and snack markets, though KP's market share edged
up slightly.
Terry's increased profit slightly to Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 3.1m) on sales
ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 68.9m despite a further weakening of the
market for boxed chocolate assortments. Profit at the Ross Young's frozen
foods business held steady at Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 14.1m) on lower turnover
of Pounds 268.2m (Pounds 291.6p).
Earnings per share were 9.6p (11.6p) fully diluted and 9.7p (12p) undiluted.
An unchanged interim dividend of 5.5p has been declared.

FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Speyhawk reduces loss to Pounds 9.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPEYHAWK, the property developer that is trying to restructure its debts of
more than Pounds 300m, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.54m
for the six months to end-March.
That compared with a Pounds 10.58m loss for the same period last year and
followed a deficit of Pounds 216.8m for the year to September 30 1991, when
it made Pounds 205m of provisions against its properties.
Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman, said he hoped to be able to report the
successful outcome of its restructuring discussions 'before Christmas'.
The talks, which began over a year ago, have been drawn out because of the
large number of banks involved.
In April, the company said that its 46 banks and lending institutions, led
by Barclays and Citibank, had agreed in principle to restructure their loans
of Pounds 303m and provide it with working capital for four years.
Speyhawk's heavy losses have made the company technically insolvent, with
liabilities that exceed assets by about Pounds 80m.
In his statement, Mr Osborne underlined the depressed state of the property
market, which is in its worst recession for over 50 years.
'There are no signs of an immediate improvement in market conditions, making
any return to profitability unlikely for some time,' he said.
He blamed the company's 'disappointing' level of lettings on the oversupply
of office space in London and the recession, which curtailed demand.
As a result, few fully let properties were put on the market, which was
'sluggish and somewhat unreceptive'. Sales consisted of a number of small
transactions.
For the first six months turnover of Pounds 10.74m compared with Pounds
42.54m. Interest costs amounted to Pounds 9.54m, while overheads were Pounds
2.6m.
Losses per share were reduced from 45.8p to 41.2p.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Prudential warns of bonus rate cuts -
With-profits endowment policy holders face tougher times ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL, the UK's biggest life insurer, this week took the prudent step
of warning the City that it expects to cut its bonuses for with-profits
policyholders next year.
In publishing its interim figures, it accounted for the profits on its life
fund on the assumption that the bonuses for next year would be cut. Usually,
life offices assume that bonuses will be maintained, so this is a bad sign
for the Pru's with-profits pension and endowment holders.
This would be the third year in succession in which the Pru's bonus rates
had been cut. Several other offices have already followed this lead and the
latest strong signal they have sent out could strengthen the trend towards
lower pay-outs.
However, the Pru's final decision on bonuses will not be made until the
beginning of next year, so nothing is yet certain. If investment returns
recover by more than the Pru expects in the next four months, then bonuses
may survive intact.
Other companies quickly asserted that they were also likely to cut bonuses.
Standard Life, which now sells slightly more endowments than the Pru, sent a
signal at the beginning of the year by cutting its interim reversionary
bonus (payable to the relatives of policyholders who die during the year).
An actuary for Standard Life confirmed that across the industry, terminal
bonuses were very likely to be cut. Actuaries at Life Association of
Scotland and GA Life concurred that the trend in bonuses must be downwards.
Falling bonuses are bad news for investors. However, recession and
accompanying high interest rates are among the main factors forcing them
lower. Therefore Prudential asserts that the real return (after inflation)
available to investors need not be forced down.
Existing policyholders should also avoid panicking on two other fronts.
First, although pay-outs will fall, it is still highly unlikely that an
endowment will actually fail to pay off a mortgage.
A recent survey by Money Management found that unit-linked endowments
offered by four companies - Providence Capitol, M&amp;G, Manulife and Scottish
Mutual - will, on current projections, fail to meet their sum assured. But
these are wholly different from with-profits endowments, which are typically
underwritten so conservatively that they will overshoot their target unless
bonuses are cut radically.
John Lister, actuary with GA Life, is sure that nominal investment returns
will drop, taking bonuses with them. But this is a long way from saying they
will fail to pay off the mortgage. For 25-year policies starting this year,
GA Life needs to earn almost exactly 9 per cent net per annum - a rate not
far above current money market rates and easily supported using profits from
protection business.
A second myth which needs de-bunking is the idea that current bonus rates
can be 'locked into' by surrendering a policy now. Life policies do not work
that way. Current terminal bonuses are paid out only to those who have
stayed the course, including many good years. Surrender values are
calculated differently.
Lister points out that those who break the contract by giving up a policy
early cannot expect to receive all of the terminal bonus, and deprive other
policyholders of funds, at a point when bonuses are justifiably coming down
because of lower investment returns. Unfortunately, there is no easy way out
of a with-profits policy once it is started.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Bad news week for EZTs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Zone Trusts were hit by unwelcome publicity this week. Imro, the
investment managers' regulator, announced that it was clamping down on
claims of 'guarantees' from the trusts.
Most trusts are able to quote either a guarantee of rental income for a
certain period from a bank, or in a few cases a guarantee that the building
will be bought at the end of a fixed term for a fixed price.
However, these guarantees are not limitless and depend on the strength of
the guarantor. John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, has launched an
investigation into the marketing claims that have been made. He said: 'We
have issued a notice to members putting them on warning for extra care and
due diligence in the literature they use to promote such schemes.'
The depressed commercial property market means EZTs might be thinner on the
ground this year in any case. However, Morgan explained that clamping down
will be difficult because several different regulators are involved.
Investors in one of the least successful EZTs launched to date, Greig
Middleton's GMEZT2, have also found problems working with the regulatory
framework. Now, in another embarrassing move for the EZT industry, they are
organising in an attempt to obtain compensation.
Rental income on the building owned by the flat was guaranteed by Seifert
Ltd, the property development arm of the architectural practice, which went
into receivership in July. Income after the end of this year is uncertain,
while the trust will need to meet the costs of the building's upkeep. This
is particularly awkward for many of the estimated 300 investors, as EZTs are
most tax-efficient when funded by a loan. Income is needed to maintain
repayments.
Now David Pine, of Eversheds Alexander Tatham, the Manchester solicitors who
previously represented investors in Barlow Clowes and Dunsdale Securities,
and creditors of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, is
organising an investors' protection committee. He intends to set it up at
the annual general meeting of the trust, on September 23.
Pine wants investors who would support an action plan to contact him
directly. The address is: David Pine, Eversheds Alexander Tatham, 30 St
Anne's Street, Manchester M2 3DM. Tel: 061-236-4444.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Investor protection - Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD ELKIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BIG efforts have been made
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
mainly through the Financial Services Act 1986 (FSA) - to protect investors
from losses caused by the collapse of UK advisers and money managers of all
kinds.
Not only are such firms subject to regulation but schemes have been set up
to compensate investors should they fail. However, only the investment firms
are covered. So, if you lose money because your broker becomes insolvent, or
because the UK unit trust or insurance company in which he or she invested
for you fails, you will be compensated. But, if the investment was in, say,
Coloroll shares, no compensation will be payable.
Unfortunately, the large number of compensation schemes confuses the
picture. And, as usual, the position is far more complicated for expatriates
than resident Britons.
The core of these arrangements is the Investors' Compensation Scheme (ICS).
This was set up by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) and provides
compensation for losses brought about by the collapse of any organisation,
authorised under the FSA, in relation to any investment business which it
regulates.
'Investment business' encompasses such things as dealing in, or advising on,
life assurance, unit trusts, investment linked pensions, stocks and shares,
commodities, financial futures and options. It does not cover general
insurance, bank and building society deposits or investments in such things
as houses, land or gold coins.
The maximum compensation available under the scheme is 100 per cent of the
first Pounds 30,000 and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000 - ie a maximum
of Pounds 48,000 for any one default. If, exceptionally, claims in any one
year exceed Pounds 100m, they will all be scaled down.
Some regulatory bodies, for example the Law Society, Institute of Chartered
Accountants and Insurance Brokers Registration Council have equivalent
schemes. The Law Society's scheme covers the full amount of any loss up to
Pounds 1m.
Whether compensation is available to overseas investors dealing with UK
firms, depends on the extent of the 'foreign' element in the transaction.
Transactions involving overseas residents and overseas-based advisers are
not covered. But if business is arranged between a UK intermediary and an
individual abroad - whether by correspondence or in the course of a meeting
overseas, following which the adviser takes the signed application papers
and payment back to the UK - compensation will be available. But should the
adviser send those papers direct from the overseas location to an investment
organisation outside the UK, the position is open to doubt.
If the foreign element in any business is sufficient to exclude it from the
cover of the ICS, you will not only lose the right to compensation on the
failure of the intermediary, but also of any UK product company - for
example, an authorised unit trust, into which the investment concerned is
made.
Such considerations aside, investor losses caused by the failure of a UK
unit trust would give rise to a claim. The treatment of investment trust
insolvency is, however, rather more complex. Losses in connection with a
savings scheme, would be covered. But failure of the trust itself would not.
Losses arising from the failure of overseas unit trusts and the like are not
covered by the ICS. However, a number of countries - Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle
of Man and Jersey - have equivalent compensation schemes of their own.
Canada, Eire, Luxembourg and Switzerland have SIB- recognised local
regulation. But there are no compensation schemes in those countries.
Compensation for the failure of UK insurance companies, under the 1975
Policyholders Protection Act, is different again. The Act provides for
compensation of up to 90 per cent of the policy value without any upper
limit. However, since this scheme did not cover business failure resulting
from bad marketing or bad advice, these risks are covered by the Lautro
indemnity scheme, subject to the same maximum as the ICS - Pounds 48,000 per
claim.
As in the case of unit trusts, offshore policies are not covered, but some
overseas territories have arrangements of their own.
Bank and building society deposits are not 'investments' in terms of the
FSA, and are not covered by the ICS. They are separate UK deposit schemes,
but the maximum compensation is 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 for
banks and 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 for building societies.
Outside the UK, the Isle of Man, alone of the three main offshore islands,
has provisions covering bank deposits. These too mirror mainland
arrangements, although participation by foreign banks is voluntary. Offshore
subsidiaries of UK building societies need no special arrangements, since
the Building Societies Act 1986 requires parent societies to carry
responsibility for all of their liabilities.
All of which is rather complex. But it ensures that expatriates have greater
protection when dealing with UK firms than they would by investing in an
unregulated environment.

<TEXT>
KINGFISHER, the retailing group, is unlikely to add much cheer to the debate
about the state of the economy when it reports its interim results on
Tuesday.
Nigel Whittaker, the group's corporate affairs director, is likely to be
humming the same tune as he frequently sings as the CBI's retail sales
front-man: depressed levels of consumer spending with little sign of any
uplift.
While the B&amp;Q chain has faced pressure from a price war in the DIY trade,
Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug should have benefited from productivity
gains. However, Kingfisher has a knack of exceeding expectations and may
report pre-tax profits above the Pounds 61m consensus forecast and last
year's Pounds 62.5m.
On Monday, Dalgety reports profits for the year to end June. Forecasts
centre on Pounds 115m pre-tax, up from Pounds 110.9m, with petfoods and
snacks leading the way. Tougher trading conditions in milling, baking, food
ingredients and animal foods are expected though. With the finances sound,
the company is regarded as more solid than many in the sector.
Inchcape, the international motor distribution, services and marketing
group, is expected to announce interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m,
compared with Pounds 91m, on Monday. The figures are helped by the first
inclusion of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the motor company acquired with the
help of a Pounds 376m rights issue last December.
Tuesday sees interim results from MB-Caradon, the building products and
cheque printing group which has a quarter share in CarnaudMetalbox. Pre-tax
profits are expected to have risen from Pounds 47.2m to Pounds 60m, helped
by the use of the rights issue money raised last year and substantial
cost-cutting measures.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group, also reports on
Tuesday. Estimates for interim pre-tax profits range from Pounds 92m to
Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 135.5m. Analysts will ask about the extent
to which AWA, a pulp buyer, has suffered from rising pulp costs and falling
paper prices.
First-half results from Guinness on Thursday are expected to reflect
economic weakness in its international markets. After reports of tough
trading conditions from several other drinks companies, analysts have
trimmed forecasts of pre-tax profits to between Pounds 360m and Pounds 365m,
an increase of 4 per cent on the 1991 interims.
Guinness has indicated that growth will be more than usually biased towards
the second half this year because of the phasing of capital spending.
Full-year profits are still expected to top Pounds 1bn for the first time.
RMC, one of the more stoical of the building materials company and so far
helped by the buoyancy of its German operation, is expected to announce
interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 60m, down from Pounds 69.9m.
Apart from questions about margin pressure on ready-mix concrete in the UK,
analysts will also be interested in whether RMC has any rationalisation
plans for its block plants. Both Tarmac and Marley have announced closures
in this field.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: MMC to probe medical costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES ARE high that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission can bring the
escalating costs of UK private medical insurance under control.
It announced this week that it will investigate the British Medical
Association to see whether doctors are conspiring to set medical charges at
artificially high levels.
Premiums have risen rapidly over the last two years, partly because of
rising medical costs.
Bob Bycroft, the managing director of Medical Insurance Agency, who is
providing evidence to the MMC panel, welcomed the investigation. 'Anything
that focuses attention on the increasing cost of private medical care has
got to be a good thing.'
He said there was increasing evidence of multiple procedures - in other
words, to quote his example, if a patient went to hospital to have an
operation on varicose veins in one leg, the surgeon would also operate on
the second leg because 'it would need to be done eventually'.
There is also evidence that the BMA's recommended guidelines on fees,
introduced in 1989, have been treated as the norm which doctors ought to
charge, rather than the upward limit.
According to Jan Lawson, of the Private Health Partnership, a Leeds broker,
in Yorkshire the BMA guidelines led to a 60 per cent rise in consultants'
fees overnight.
An FT investigation this week also showed that BMA fees tend to be higher
than the scales recommended by the British United Provident Association
(Bupa), which for many years were regarded as the industry standard.
However, there is more to the rise in premiums than inflation in medical
costs. Nancy Saldana of Cigna, an insurer, does not object to the BMA's
scales, which mirror an exercise in the US to assess the relative costs of
different procedures. The problem, she says, is the way they have been used
and interpreted.
She believes that over-use of hospital care could have much to do with
escalating premiums. Her favourite example is the hospital extraction of
wisdom teeth, which until a few years ago was normally carried out in a
dentist's chair.
In the UK, each Briton went to hospital 50 per cent more often at the end of
the 1980s than at the beginning of the decade, according to Bupa figures.
This increased use of health care may mean premiums will continue to rise.
The best way to avoid a possible medical cartel lies with the National
Health Service. Consumer surveys suggest that the only significant problem
with the NHS is the length of time patients sometimes face before having
operations. You can combat this by shopping around between different NHS
regions, according to a survey in Which? magazine, as waiting lists vary
considerably between areas.
The National Waiting List Helpline (081-983-1133) gives details of which
district health authorities have the shortest waiting times for the
operation you require, plus information on hospitals in those districts.
Following the latest dose of health service reforms you can now ask your GP,
if he or she is a fundholder, to refer you to any hospital. If they are not
fundholding the procedure is more complicated: they must try to persuade
your own health authority to pay for you to be referred elsewhere.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Man in the News: Ex-monk on a motorcycle - Peter Middleton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Lloyd's of London began the search for a new chief executive, it can
hardly have expected that a motor-cycling ex-monk from Middlesbrough would
be the best man for one of the insurance market's top jobs.
As Lloyd's struggles to emerge from one of the most difficult periods in its
300-year history, the choice of Mr Peter Middleton, a 52-year-old former
diplomat and businessman who lacks any experience of the insurance business,
might seem curious, even risky.
But Mr Middleton, a tall, clean-cut, tanned and self-confident figure, may
be what Lloyd's needs at this turbulent time, though his background and
style set him apart from other senior figures at Lloyd's, and most of the
Names, the individuals who stake their personal wealth on the market's
fortunes.
From a working-class family on Teesside (his father was a foreman at an ICI
chemicals plant) Mr Middleton speaks with a Geordie accent and says he has
an 'unrequited love affair' with his home-town football club, Middlesbrough
FC. He also professes a passion for motorbikes. This week he has travelled
to interviews on a Suzuki 800cc Easy Rider-style machine. Educated at a
local Catholic grammar school, he later joined a monastery in Paignton,
Devon, run by a small French monastic order, the Society of Mary.
'It was something I felt attracted to. I'm immensely pleased that I did. It
was a real education,' says Mr Middleton, who adds that he retains his
religious convictions in a 'private kind of way'.
After the monastery came a year in Paris studying philosophy at the
Sorbonne, where Mr Middleton acquired fluency in French, and three years at
Hull University, where he read social studies.
His education left him with a lasting appetite for literature - he is
currently re-reading Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility - as well as an
ability to survive on three to four hours' sleep a night. 'A bloke would
ring a bell at some unholy hour and I would stagger down to matins,' he
says, adding he can make do 'with two hours a night but not for more than a
fortnight'.
Many Names would consider his lifestyle austere, perhaps spartan. He does
not have a house in the country, living with his wife and three children in
Twickenham, south-west London; he never drinks alcohol on 'work premises'
and runs, on average, 30 miles a week.
Like his early life, his career defies easy categorisation. After graduating
from Hull in 1969, Mr Middleton joined the foreign service, spending two
years in Indonesia and two in Tanzania, before returning to London. Between
1977 and 1982 he was senior British embassy counsellor in Paris, where he
became acquainted with Labour and Conservative government officials. His
diplomatic skills will be useful at Lloyd's, where he will need to come to
terms with the market's complex politics and byzantine structure.
Mr Middleton has personal warmth as well as tact, says Sir John Trelawny of
Godard Kay Rogers, the recruitment agency. 'That will serve him well in a
market where relations between the corporation (which administers and
provides back-up services) and the market (the agents and syndicates) have
been slightly scratchy.'
Negotiating skills will also be helpful in dealing with those Names facing
financial ruin as a result of Lloyd's recent record losses.
But it is Mr Middleton's experience in business that made the case for his
appointment so strong. At 45, he was recruited to Midland Bank by the French
ex-Midland banker, Mr Herve de Carmoy, who wanted to see if top British
civil servants could work equally well in the private sector, like some of
their French counterparts.
He then spent two years at Midland International, before joining Thomas
Cook, Midland Bank's travel subsidiary, in December 1987. Midland had
rescued Thomas Cook from British Rail in 1972, but the company had lost its
way and staff were demoralised and directionless.
'There was no sense of purpose that I could detect. There were independent
pockets of excellence but they'd decided to go unilateral,' says Mr
Middleton, assessing the mood of pessimism prevalent at Thomas Cook when he
joined.
He decided to expand business in Europe and North America and develop new
specialist leisure and business travel areas. Mr Middleton moved the group
into retail foreign exchange dealing.
Layers of senior management were discarded and specialist teams recruited to
implement the plans. The changes aggravated problems in the short term, but
there is general agreement that they paved the way for the revival in Thomas
Cook's fortunes.
Mr Middleton was negotiating the successful sale of Thomas Cook to a German
consortium comprising West Deutsche Landesbank and one of Germany's largest
charter airlines when he was approached by Lloyd's. 'When I was first
approached, to say I was surprised is an understatement. I couldn't take it
seriously. I couldn't imagine I'd be offered the job,' he says.
Yet despite the obvious differences of size and business, the outside
headhunters and the Lloyd's committee responsible for recruitment were
intrigued by the similarities between Thomas Cook and the insurance market.
Both are world-famous British brand names. Thomas Cook's business was in
decline, so is Lloyd's. And like Thomas Cook, Lloyd's is embarking on a
change of strategy. Last year a task force of senior market professionals
mapped out a five- to 10-year blueprint for Lloyd's, designed to reduce
costs, increase competitiveness and reverse the loss of market share in
reinsurance and commercial insurance.
Mr David Rowland, who headed the task force, is to become chairman of
Lloyd's in January and, as head of a newly created market board, Mr
Middleton will work closely with him in refining the strategy and persuading
the market to back it. This will be his first task. It will prove difficult,
but it is a challenge Mr Middleton relishes. When he was steering a new
course at Thomas Cook, he says, he thrived on the pressure. There will be no
shortage of that at Lloyd's.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Staking his reputation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British prime minister cannot be accused of failing to give a lead. He
has certainly done so this week. In two important speeches, the first on the
future of the European Community and the second on the exchange rate, Mr
John Major has attempted to explain the government's strategy to a wider
public. In so doing he has not prevaricated, nor has he sought to distance
his personal position from that of the government as a whole, as other prime
ministers have been known to do. On the contrary, he has put his own
reputation and maybe his political future on the line.
On Monday Mr Major rehearsed the government's case for supporting the
Maastricht treaty on European union. In essence, it is that it is always in
Britain's interest to be a willing participant in plans for the evolution of
European unity, not least because only those who take part can influence
such plans. Britain did exert influence at Maastricht, in the direction of a
looser political structure than Euro-federalists would like. The result was
a compromise. Yet the issues that the continent faces - economic
development, enlargement of the community, responses to international crises
 -would not disappear if the treaty were to remain unratified. In defiance
of the alarums from his own backbenches, Mr Major expressed an unmistakable
wish that the treaty be ratified.
If 'Maastricht' is engraved on the prime minister's heart, political
prudence is still, on this matter, in control of his head. In his speech he
reaffirmed that if the French vote No tomorrow week Maastricht will be dead.
If the Danes cannot be honourably accommodated, there will be no treaty.
Assuming that France and Denmark are back on board, the British government's
policy is to face a parliamentary battle, however bruising, in order to
ensure the passage of the ratification bill. Since all three national
political parties are in favour of the deal (leaving aside dissidents within
each of their ranks), it is reasonable to assume that eventual passage is
assured.
No referendum
Mr Major did, however, leave one hostage to fortune in this speech. He
emphatically ruled out a British referendum. A close Yes vote would increase
the pressure for such a consultation. The prime minister is presumably
relying on the Labour party's apparent unwillingness to push for a national
vote. This is in part due to a belief that it would be wrong, in part to an
inglorious fear of exposing the splits within Labour's own ranks. If,
however, the Labour leader, Mr John Smith, summons up his courage, he may
seize the opportunity to call for a people's verdict. That would put the
government on the spot.
This is as nothing to what would happen if Britain is eventually forced to
devalue sterling, either outright or as part of a general realignment of
currencies inside the exchange rate mechanism. On this matter political
calculation and a whip's natural prudence have been cast aside. Mr Major's
address to the Scottish CBI in Glasgow on Thursday night leaves no room for
doubt about his commitment. 'There is going to be no devaluation, no
realignment,' he insisted. Cynics may argue that any prime minister would
have to say as much, given the state of the currency markets this week. That
may be so, but no prime minister is bound to assert, with such
uncharacteristic passion as that used by Mr Major on Thursday, that 'the
soft option, the devaluer's option, the inflationary option would be a
betrayal of our future' and to add, with especial emphasis, 'and it is not
the government's policy'.
Motivating force
With these words the prime minister has staked his political authority on an
exchange rate over which he can have only a limited degree of control. The
public now knows that the ambition to strive for zero inflation and stick
there is not Mr Norman Lamont's, or not the chancellor's alone. It is the
prime minister's motivating force. For him it is a matter of principle. If
there were now to be a devaluation he would lose credibility. A general ERM
realignment, which would not be a miracle cure for the economy, might be
complicated enough to allow for a technical escape, but probably not at the
bar of public opinion. Mr Major's plain speaking, his obvious sincerity and
his widely perceived honesty, constitute his principal sources of political
strength. A sneaky devaluation, leaving open the question of why we were all
lashed to the mast for two stormy years, would put all that at risk.
The consequence is that there will either be a wreck, if the turbulence in
the markets increases in force, or following a further prolonged period of
economic pain the gains will begin to be regarded as worthwhile. With the
continuation of the recession, the government cannot finance public
expenditure at the levels currently contemplated; cuts that affect millions
of people are likely to be imposed. They must hope that Mr Major's economics
are right. These years of hard slog must be justified by results. On such
scales, a reputation is but a feather.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Wild days are here again: Adjusting to the rigours of the
ERM is proving tougher than expected for some European currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
There will be no devaluations,' said the chancellor of the exchequer, Norman
Lamont, on the steps of the Treasury last month. Since then the government
has staked billions of pounds in borrowed money to shore up the wilting
sterling exchange rate.
But such intervention exercises have a poor historical record of success in
countering the waves of cynicism, greed and fear that periodically break
over the foreign exchange markets. Very often, too, the market practitioners
have a clearer perception of the underlying economic realities than do
beleaguered politicians.
This week, however, the main spotlight has been directed elsewhere in
Europe. Two of the Nordic countries which have been unofficial members of
the European Community's currency club, the European Monetary System, have
been caught in the torrent of speculation.
On Tuesday the Finnish markka was floated off its lifeline to the EMS's
hybrid currency, the Ecu. The markka immediately sank by some 13 per cent
against the D-Mark, and then a desperate battle began in Sweden to save the
krona, involving at one stage overnight interest rates of 75 per cent.
Within the EC proper the greatest pressure has been on the Italian lira.
Interest rates have been sharply raised, taking the margin over D-Mark rates
for three-month deposits up to about 10 percentage points. The Italian
government, meanwhile, is seeking emergency powers to tackle the country's
economic crisis.
The immediate trigger for all this has been the approach of the French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty, with voting taking place a week
tomorrow. Present expectation is that the French will vote Yes by a narrow
margin but the decision could still go either way. A No verdict would bring
a potentially explosive end to a summer of simmering crisis for European
currencies, beginning with the unexpected decision of the Danes to reject
Maastricht in their own referendum at the beginning of June.
Why has the crisis blown up in this way? Until the mishap in Denmark,
European businessmen and travellers had been led to believe that currency
integration was moving ahead quickly. With the single market about to be
launched at the end of 1992, Europeans were to be spared the hazards of
volatile currencies within their own continent.
Although the ERM in theory permits currencies to shift around in occasional
realignments, in practice the last significant change was back in 1986. The
Maastricht treaty set out possible timetables according to which the ERM
would be strengthened into a complete monetary union, perhaps in 1999, with
a European Central Bank to control the single Euro-currency.
The urge to fix exchange rates is one that comes and goes. The post-second
world war Bretton Woods agreement, which was based upon the dollar and gold,
lasted until 1971. It broke down because of the pressure of increasing
speculative currency flows and the impossibility of holding down the gold
price any longer.
Floating can prove inflationary, however, unless a country's money is
strictly controlled by a tough central bank able to overrule free-spending
politicians. Moreover any small country in which imports and exports are
very large in relation to the size of the economy can find floating
dangerous because currency fluctuations may cause havoc with the internal
price level. Borrowing may become very expensive, too, if a currency is seen
to be risky. Yet large and powerful countries, notably the US, with imports
only about 10 per cent of GDP, may be largely indifferent to the ups and
downs of their currencies.
Germany, where the Bundesbank has an important degree of independence, is
one of the few countries to have achieved low inflation consistently over
the years. Even during the 1970s some EC member states chose to track the
D-Mark in a loose arrangement nicknamed the 'snake' (which the UK left after
just six weeks in 1972 in pursuit of an inflationary economic boom). In 1979
this structure was refined and became the EMS.
Over the next decade and more the EMS went from strength to strength. Even
inflationary currencies such as the French franc and the Italian lira were
seemingly tamed. Reluctant Britain eventually joined in 1990, and Spain and
Portugal came in too. Hangers-on such as Sweden and Finland attached
themselves to the system, partly to strengthen their credentials as
candidates for EC membership.
The buzz word behind it all was 'convergence'. With exchange rates locked
together, European economies would come more and more in line in terms of
inflation, output, growth and eventually living standards. Short-term
interest rates and long-term bond yields, for instance, would fall into
line. Moreover, because the German economy was the most powerful in the EC,
the whole community would benefit from low German inflation.
There has been an important political element too. The French have been
especially determined to lock the franc and the D-Mark together to
strengthen political cohesion at the very core of the EC and prevent Germany
from turning its attention increasingly to the east.
However, there are signs of over-confidence. The EMS has become bigger and
more unwieldy, and yet EC politicians appear to have decided that the ERM
should effectively be made into a fixed-rate arrangement. Devaluation has
become a symbol of political as well as economic failure. Except in the most
favourable conditions, however, this mechanism cannot work satisfactorily
unless a monetary institution is created which looks at the needs of Europe
as a whole. In practice the ERM is dominated by the Bundesbank, which has a
constitutional obligation to consider only the interests of Germany.
Short-term interest rate trends clearly reflect the change in sentiment.
Differentials between the D-Mark and other ERM currencies generally narrowed
until May, but have been widening since the Danish vote, often very sharply.
Convergence has turned into divergence.
This year, quite apart from the problems of the Maastricht referenda, three
factors have begun to tear the ERM apart:
The US has embarked upon a strategy of aggressive cuts in interest rates,
almost regardless of the impact on the dollar's external value.
Post-unification stresses in Germany have caused the Bundesbank to raise
interest rates to very high levels, thus pushing all the ERM currencies to
extreme valuations against the dollar, and to a lesser extent against the
Japanese yen.
Economic growth rates have slumped throughout Europe, and particular
economic problems in countries such as the UK, Italy and Sweden are raising
serious questions over their ability to sustain their present exchange
rates.
The ERM was supposed to bring positive benefits, pulling down inflation in
those countries where it was high and reducing the need for Europeans to
hedge against movements in each other's currencies. It would assist
businesses to expand across borders and achieve the economies of scale.
Now, however, the question is whether the attempts to keep up with the
D-Mark are beginning to impose unreasonable economic costs. Britain is a
case in point. Membership of the ERM has encouraged a reduction in inflation
from 10.9 per cent on entry in 1990 to 3.6 per cent as released yesterday.
That has turned out to be the easy bit. But the Treasury has never begun to
grasp the negative implications for economic performance as a whole. Last
autumn, for instance, it forecast that 1992 would show economic growth of 2
1/4 per cent. In fact GDP now appears likely to fall a little. It can be
argued, therefore, that the unexpected cost of ERM membership will be
anything up to 3 per cent of GDP in this year alone.
When currencies depreciate, the sufferers are liable to be savers and
consumers. But hard currency policies tend to penalise borrowers and
manufacturing industry. Tightening belts may be one thing but closing
factories is another.
Sweden is also suffering a serious recession; GDP dropped by 1 per cent in
1991 and may fall slightly again this year. Again, inflation is not a
problem, as it has been running below Germany's. But serious difficulties
have been surfacing in the financial system. The government has already
rescued Nordbanken and agreed to bail out Gota Bank. These are two of
Sweden's four biggest banks.
This highlights the problem that harmonisation of financial systems may be
the most difficult element of convergence within a structure such as the
ERM. Both in the UK and Scandinavia credit growth reached extreme levels in
the late 1980s and the continuing overhang of debt could undermine the
attempts to switch to a hard currency regime. In Germany, where episodes of
currency appreciation have been quite common during the past 30 years, debt
levels are much more conservative. But what will the British government do
if banks in the UK begin to collapse?
Financial difficulties apart, however, in neither the UK or Sweden is there
any great case in terms of economic fundamentals for devaluation against the
D-Mark (though the level of the dollar is another matter). Yet both
countries urgently need much lower interest rates than they are likely to
enjoy for several years within the D-Mark-dominated ERM. Their problems are
quite different from those of Italy, which does appear to have lost
competitiveness and also has a severe problem of government overspending.
Most observers now regard a lira devaluation as inevitable. The danger is
that massive speculation will shift from one currency to another. Meanwhile
there is little flexibility left within the ERM, with the vulnerable
currencies trapped almost on their floors against the D-Mark.
It all adds up to one of the biggest currency crises since the wild days of
the 1970s, and before that the early 1930s, another period when competitive
devaluations and political obstinacy led to economic disruption and
speculative excess.
In 1931 there may have been no breakfast TV sound bites from chancellor
Philip Snowden, but the British authorities were, as now, borrowing heavily
from banks to support sterling - and this was only a few weeks before the
Gold Standard had to be abandoned.
On Thursday this week, however, John Major took up Norman Lamont's rallying
cry. 'There is going to be no devaluation, no realignment,' he told a
Scottish CBI dinner. The applause seemed polite rather than enthusiastic,
which is not surprising given that, on present policies, industry will
continue to bear much of the cost of adjustment.

THE Financial Times has launched a new, free service for private investors
who would like to receive the annual reports of listed companies, writes
Philip Coggan.
All that you need to do is ring 081-643-7181 and quote a code which is
listed at the end of the London Share Service listings in the FT. This code
will be changed every week. Then name the company concerned and give your
name and address. The report will be sent to you on the next working day.
The service is open to all readers, whether in the UK or overseas. The lines
are open between 9am and 5.30pm on weekdays and there is an answering
service at other times. For today only, the lines are open between 9 am and
4pm.
At present 130 listed companies have agreed to join the service. The
companies concerned are identified with an ace-of-clubs symbol in the share
listings pages. Companies which have joined include Bank of Scotland,
Hanson, National Power, Smithkline Beecham and Unilever.
Only one annual report per company can be sent to each individual, but you
may order the reports of several different companies.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Maastricht, a vital matter of yes or
no - The implications of the vital referendum in France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
THE MAIN effects of the French referendum vote are likely to be in the short
term. But the poll could still have a substantial impact on currencies,
share prices, bond prices and interest rates.
NON]
If the French vote against the treaty, it could mean very bad news. The
immediate effect is certain to be pressure on the weak currencies within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism - sterling in particular.
Mark Henderson, chief investment officer of Touche Remnant, thinks that 'the
UK would certainly have to raise base rates, immediately and decisively, on
September 21.' He suggests that either 1.75 or 2 percentage points might be
needed. And as Bob Semple, of County Nat West, puts it: 'We need an interest
rate rise like we need a hole in the head.'
Given the recent pressure on building society margins, a base rate rise
would mean higher mortgage rates. The societies are aware of the damage this
might do to the housing market and the Halifax Building Society, the UK's
biggest mortgage lender, has said it would strive to keep any rise to a
minimum.
Much would depend on whether some societies raise savers' rates to attract
funds. That would force others to follow suit, and then to increase mortgage
rates in line.
There is a silver lining. TR does not believe that high interest rates would
remain in place long enough to harm the economy, with lower German interest
rates eventually coming to the rescue.
As to the effect of a No vote on bond and share prices, Semple says much
depends on whether the UK decides to devalue or to raise rates. 'One school
of thought is that a devaluation would be good news for equities', he says,
'but it would be very bad news for bonds and there would be enormous market
turmoil as a result. Things might settle down more quickly with an interest
rate rise, through the Swedish situation shows you have to be tough. If
things get really bad the FT-SE 100 Index could fall to 2200.'
According to Derek Scott, of BZW: 'With earnings estimates being reviewed
downwards, little hope of a German rate cut before the end of the year, the
dollar at over-competitive levels, economic growth stagnating and valuations
hit by higher bond yields, there is little chance of equity markets
shrugging off a 'No' vote.'
But Dick Barfield, investment director of Standard Life, down-played the
significance of a 'No', suggesting that on a three-month view it would, like
the UK general election, have little lasting impact. 'The most important
things are German interest rates and the level of the Deutschemark against
the dollar. This vote isn't going to affect that one way or the other. The
markets have been far too preoccupied by this.'
Stephen Pearson, of GT Management, also believes that the importance of the
referendum for the long term has been over-estimated, He thinks that the
fundamental factor currently moving European markets, the German base rate,
is unlikely to be affected.
OUI]
A Yes vote would be far better news (except for those who believe that
European union would be disastrous). Interest rates, and therefore mortgage
rates, would be far less likely to rise, and markets would enjoy a boost of
confidence.
But as Semple points out: 'Even if there is a yes vote, it still has to be
ratified by the rest of the community. The Exchange Rate Mechanism is also
suffering from the backwash of the falling dollar, and one has to ask
whether a Clinton victory is priced into either the dollar or Wall Street.'
Derek Scott of BZW feels that if the French vote Yes, 'the threat of rate
rises should be avoided in countries where economic fundamentals are sound.'
However, he argues that the vote will not bring forward the long-awaited
interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank. Nevertheless, Scott feels that a
'yes' would help both French and UK equities, where real long rates are very
high and would benefit from better bond trends.
Dick Barfield admits that the UK markets would probably jump after a 'Oui'
vote, but this does not affect Standard Life's strategy, which is to view
all the European markets, especially the UK, as looking cheap on a 12-month
view.
Touche Remnant's Henderson believes that the reaction to a 'Oui' could be
short-lived. Both equities and bonds would rise, but an equity rally could
be short-lived because sterling would also rally, damaging UK export
potential.
Never the less, if you are worried about your investments or mortgage
payments, and you are visiting France over the next week, it might be worth
a bit of canvassing . . .

no - The implications of the vital referendum in France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A FRENCH referendum would not normally seem a matter of importance for
British investors. Sometimes, though, the financial markets seize on a
particular event and give it enormous significance. So it is with the French
vote on September 20 over whether to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Five
years ago, the markets would have viewed progress towards European monetary
union as purely an academic issue. Now, it has the power to ruin economies.
The problem lies with the economic strength of Germany and the determination
of the Bundesbank (the nation's central bank) to defeat inflation.
International investors have had a natural preference for the Deutschemark
over other European currencies.
Other countries in the exchange rate mechanism traditionally have been
forced to offer higher interest rates to attract investors and maintain
their parity against the Deutschemark. But the prospect of European monetary
union via the Maastricht treaty altered the equation. Eventually, there
would be one currency and one interest rate across the Continent. So,
investors who bought the other currencies in the ERM would effectively be
buying 'higher yielding Deutschemarks.'
This theory of 'convergence' meant that those who bought European bonds
would enjoy capital gains as yields fell gradually to German levels.
(Remember that, as yields fall, prices rise). The outcome was that the
differentials between German interest rates and the rates of other ERM
countries were able to narrow.
But the No vote in the Danish referendum earlier this year, and the doubts
about the result of the French poll, have thrown the whole process into
doubt. If the French vote No, progress towards European monetary union will
stop. It is even possible that the exchange rate mechanism, which has
brought a measure of European currency stability for more than a decade,
will break up.
Such uncertainty makes international investors flock for the safe haven of
the Deutschemark, the one currency they are certain will not be devalued.
That has put immense pressure on the European currencies - such as the pound
and the lira - perceived to be weaker.
There are two obvious responses for the other ERM countries. One is to
devalue, something that seems unacceptable politically. The second is to
raise interest rates and increase the differential with Germany. But German
rates are high already and, with most European economies in a weak state, no
government - especially Britain's - wants to risk the damage a rate rise
would cause. The Italians have been forced to bite the bullet, though; will
the UK have to follow?
Those are the stakes behind the French poll. We asked City experts what
would happen to markets in the event of a Oui or Non vote.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING band of directors appears to be prepared to buy shares. Allied
Colloids, the speciality chemical group, announced final results at the
beginning of June. Following an up-beat statement, six directors  -
including the chairman, managing director and finance director - bought a
total of 12,000 shares at 163p. The shares have been as high as 220p in May
this year and are trading now at about 166p.
The food retailing sector has maintained a fairly steady performance over
the past year. At William Low, Dundee-based superstore operator and food
retailer, four directors bought a total of 26,000 shares at prices between
176p and 180p.
Results from Excalibur Group in July reflected the problems of companies
trading in luxury and giftware items. The company makes and wholesales high
quality jewellery. Despite pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds
1.1m, its precision engineering division was reported to be doing well.
Three directors - the chairman, managing director and finance director -
bought a total of 1,784,000 shares at 8p.
JA Fooks, the chairman of East Surrey Holdings, a statutory water company,
sold 506,470 shares at 222.5p. The shares have performed strongly since
coming to the market in March 1990. Fooks still holds 1,256,850.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Blind justice for the world's wild creatures: The Greens
hold that all animal life is sacrosanct. But is emotion blinding us to the
hard facts of wildlife conservation?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF the traumas of the Green Party, whose annual conference this
weekend is overhung by the resignation of half its executive committee, the
influence of nature conservationists has never been higher.
The Green movement's dilemma is that many of its proposals would require
higher prices, raised taxes; even an economy of zero growth. Fundamentalists
refuse to make the compromises which 'light' Greens think are needed to drum
up popular support. But can the movement's 'thou shalt not kill' philosophy
really apply to the conservation of wild animals?
Frequently in this debate, being 'wild' is not enough. Everybody loves a
fawn, and apparent defencelessness. Furriness is better media material than
scaliness - as zoo keepers know. Popular support for the cause of wildlife
is reinforced constantly by nature films, but many, alas, promote
sentimental attitudes which usurp rational decisions on wildlife management
based on practical knowledge.
In a recent television programme on Epping Forest, north east of London, the
footage was cut and mixed to show a deer calf being mothered in a
sun-dappled glade, the whole pretty scene approved by a watching fox and an
owl in a tree. Nature's dynamic had been turned upside down to provide
viewers with a syrupy - but dangerous - emollient.
The real story is very different. The countryside has never been so tamed,
so trimmed to suit the purpose of man. Yet it is increasingly alien
territory to urban visitors, so much so that a Berkshire farmer has been
instructed to remove scarecrows which were frightening ramblers.
To take another example, the number of Canada geese in London parks is
approaching crisis point. This fact produces columns of letters to
newspapers suggesting solutions which are disturbing in their blend of
concern for wildlife management - and their utter ignorance of that same
subject. The fact that the parks' vegetation is unable to support more birds
appears incomprehensible to most writers. Deceived by the park-keepers'
clever presentation of an artificial mix and density of waterfowl,
commentators are horrified when a goose cull is proposed.
In Noah's Ark we started with a myth of wildlife harmony; in doctored
television films (misnamed 'documentaries') we consolidate it. Once the
criterion for judging culls of birds and animals was 'sustainable
development': if a habitat could sustain only a limited population of a
particular species, culling would be acceptable. This is fast changing. The
World Wildlife Fund now opposes killing whales on the grounds that it is
simply wrong. But if this applies to whales, why not also to mackerel?
Humans have always given different values to different forms of wildlife.
Unfortunately, the attribution of these values is entirely anthropomorphic
and has nothing to do with objective standards. This tension between
sentiment, ideals and practicality is part of the problem facing the Green
movement. It makes it extremely difficult for man to play God with nature.
So, whales, seals and puffins are now described in conservation circles as
'charismatic' species. Whales, to be sure, are complex sentient beings whose
mystery is deepened by their faraway haunts. Puffins are probably complex
sentient beings too, but primarily they have pretty bills. But other equally
striking species - for example the red deer in Scotland - are currently
environmental 'bad guys' because they chew and destroy hardwood trees.
Then how should environmentalists take the life and death decision about
whether an animal deserves to be preserved or culled? The credentials of
each species oscillates wildly. Not long ago sheep and their grazing habits
were seen to be the principal enemies of heather moorland. Now sheep are too
closely associated with bankrupt or suicidal farmers to be a target.
There is frequently a hidden social criterion in the vogues of
environmentalism. Today in the UK the vast population of rabbits might seem
an uncontroversial target for suppression in order to protect the habitat.
Conservation bodies are silent about rabbits, not wishing to encourage
sport-killing. Rabbits can kill young trees even in spite of the fencing
which keeps bigger animals out - but then, so can field voles. A pogrom
against voles? Hardly.
In Africa, the best friend of natural bushland is the tsetse fly, which
spreads diseases affecting herbivores. Although cattle ranchers are trying
to eradicate the fly the malarial tsetse remains unchampioned, even though
its survival is vital to the African bush. Domestication has made the
destructive rabbit seem friendly; the valuable tsetse fly remains a hostile
alien.
The public idea of what makes an animal or bird ecologically 'good' have
much less to do with its true characteristics than with the human
perceptions of that animal or bird. The fox, for example, attracts sympathy
in spite of its undoubted destructiveness. Australia's 5m foxes have so far
eradicated 16 native species. Foxes are one of the few carnivores which kill
for fun, and joy-killing is a biological oddity. British sympathy with the
fox results from a stronger dislike of its horse-riding oppressors.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has recently made a
brave decision concerning foxes. Its programme to reintroduce capercaillie
to its Highland estate of Abernethy was being frustrated by large numbers of
the birds' predators - foxes and crows. In spite of the problems of
persuading its 800,000-strong, mostly urban, membership of the rightness of
the policy, the society has decided to experiment with predator control.
Abernethy remains a sensitive case because it is in the Cairngorms,
presently the site of a complicated tug-of-war between developers,
traditionalists, and fringe Greens. There have been fierce protests at the
recent decision at Balmoral to fence out red deer in order to save the
ancient Caledonian pine forest of Ballochbuie. No one disputes the rightness
of the objective. But local conservationists have said that capercaillie and
other game will be killed flying into the deer fence. Nobody troubled to
look at the traditional use of deer fences in capercaillie forests, in which
heather was tied to the top wires so that the birds could see them. Local
game managers, approaching the job without prejudices, are one step ahead in
their use of wildlife-friendly anti-cyclone fencing, which pushes in when
hit, then bounces back.
Indeed, in spite of the silliness of the extreme 'dark' Greens, it is widely
recognised that in an environment created by man, man has a responsibility
to exercise control and to maintain healthy balances. This has produced some
ethical teasers. On one occasion the RSPB killed many predatory gulls, which
were multiplying in large numbers, in order to save a rare species of tern.
Recently, another rare tern colony has been protected from kestrels by
providing the predators with alternative food supplies.
These pro-active interventions would appear to make sense in a world too
often overheated by ill-informed sentimentalism. But what action is
appropriate on the Shetland island of Foula, where calcium and
phosphorous-starved sheep have been eating young seabirds? Do we have the
right to stamp on this evolutionary oddity, or not?
Moreover, the selective favouritism in our attitude to God's creatures is
never more strained than when under pressure from his premier creation: man.
In Canada, the authorities would yield position to few countries in their
commitment to species conservation and professionally-managed wildlife
systems. But the controls on hunting and fishing permits, the sale of game
meat and fish (both prohibited), and habitat protection apply only to white
Canadians. The native peoples - Eskimos and Indians - are exempted from both
seasonal hunting restrictions and from hunting quotas. A native person can
slaughter any animal, at any time, in any quantity, with any weapon.
The result of the free-for-all is that animals are killed - and simply
dumped. In Saskatchewan, thousands of slaughtered caribou were abandoned to
rot after only their tongues had been removed. Yet the freedom from hunting
restrictions in Canada is meant to be for 'subsistence' purposes. In
reality, practical wildlife management is being heavily compromised by this
exemptions system.
North Canadian peoples have also been the unfortunate victims of
ill-conceived animal welfarism from a distant continent. When the EC banned
harp and ring seal imports in the early 1980s, activists who had campaigned
for the ban deprived the Canadian Indians and Eskimos of their main trading
resource and condemned them to a shrunken existence.
One consequence of the ban is that seal populations, which were never in any
danger, have multiplied exponentially. Canadian fishermen complain that the
seals are now putting fish stocks under extreme pressure.
The seal issue has resonance for British fishermen, many of whom report that
grey seals are now following fishing boats out from harbour and chasing fish
as the nets draw them in. Sport anglers have had fish seized from their
hooks. But the government is powerless to act. The volume of protest against
the last government-initiated cull of grey seals in the late 1970s stopped
that cull and established that, regardless of what potentially harmful
biological imbalances developed, seals could no longer be managed rationally
in Britain.
This was an extraordinary debacle. The grey seal was not rare, was neither a
commercial nor sport species, was only being culled to protect the livings
of local fishermen and is, biologically-speaking, the most savage marine
predator of its size. Its dewy-eyed facial resemblance to a labrador was
said to be the chief reason for its power to stir public sympathy.
This is just one example of the drift of public attitudes to wildlife:
towards the view that no wild creature should be used for any human purpose.
This essentially quixotic and romantic ideal could only arise from an
affluent and urban society. It represents the ultimate detachment from
nature, for it follows that we must grow, in increasingly artificial
conditions, all dietary protein. This development is rushing ever onwards,
with the growth of genetically-refined farmed red deer, bison, elk, salmon,
lobsters, halibut, and so on.
We call the evolution from harvesting wild stocks an escape from barbarism
and believe we are being conservationist. Meanwhile, we labour harder to
provide more naturally-produced foodstuffs, simulating wild conditions while
at the same time eschewing products taken from the wild.
The irony is that the original trappers and hunters - the killers - were the
ones with the true, hard-earned knowledge of wildlife. They were the humans
with a vested interest in the conservation of wild species, for next year's
crop, and the next generation, depended on it. Ours - the would-be
conservationists - is ceasing to.

FT  12 SEP 92 / The Long View: Copycat consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST HOW does your company's pension fund manager decide the investment
strategy that could determine the standard of living you will enjoy in your
retirement? Does he scientifically study all possible investments and select
a balanced portfolio according to an elaborate analysis of return and risk,
making changes according to circumstances?
The answer in most cases is no. What he does instead is to monitor what
other pension fund managers are doing. He copies the average portfolio,
adding enough minor variations to justify charging 'active' management fees.
Nearly all British pension fund portfolios now closely track the consensus.
The weightings of all the components of a portfolio, whether whole asset
categories (such as bonds or UK equities) or individual stock holdings, are
continually monitored and checked against the average weightings.
If you ask an investment manager to explain this procedure he will probably
say that the consensus portfolio represents the accumulated wisdom of
hundreds of senior investment professionals. Moreover, the approach works.
Pension funds have performed exceptionally well during the past decade or
so, easily beating minimum investment targets. This has allowed widespread
upgrading of benefits at the same time as permitting many British companies
to reduce or eliminate their pension contributions for years at a time.
But there is another explanation. It is that investment managers - and
pension fund trustees who hire and fire them - are driven by inappropriate
risk criteria. They are terrified that their investment returns might differ
widely from those of the average pension fund. In fact the liabilities of
pension funds are extremely long-term, and short-term volatility should be
of little importance to scheme members. Managers and trustees, nevertheless,
see big commercial and personal risks to contracts and jobs. So they are
driven to the safety of consensus.
In a world of increasingly disturbed financial markets a vital question is
now raised by all this. What happens if the consensus is seriously wrong?
Logically speaking, if everybody copies everybody else it is impossible for
the consensus strategy to change at all. In practice there will no doubt be
small divergencies allowing slow shifts. Also, pension funds will be
affected by external forces. If equity markets rise, as they did in the
1980s, exposures to equities will reflect that. And in the late 1980s the
British government was eagerly buying back its long-dated gilts, so the
decision of the pension fund managers to reduce their exposure to gilts was
effectively taken for them.
Nearly all the change in portfolio structure during the 1980s was
explainable by such external factors. The only substantial positive decision
by managers appears to have been the move to build up overseas equities from
5 per cent to over 20 per cent of portfolios.
Until the early 1980s British pension fund portfolios were reasonably well
diversified across equities, bonds and property. This is still the pattern
for pension funds overseas, in the US and Continental Europe. But the
strategy in the UK has now reached an extreme. According to Caps, an
independent measurement company, exposure to equities (UK plus overseas)
stood at a record 83 per cent at the end of June. Investments in bonds and
property are small.
Such an asset allocation may have made sense in the fast- growing and often
inflationary 1980s but it now looks grotesque. Although it is almost two
years since the UK entered the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System no strategic adjustment at all has yet been made by British
pension fund managers. Yet it was clear at the time that bonds would become
better value and offer decent real returns, and indeed since the end of
September 1990 the total return on gilts has been about 43 per cent while UK
equities have only returned 28 per cent. As time has gone on the comparison
has become even less flattering for equities. Over the past year the return
on equities has been minus 9 per cent but on long gilts it has been plus 17
per cent.
You can argue that the UK will soon be forced out of the ERM and then the
equity market will roar ahead again. Long-term pension fund strategists,
perhaps, are simply brushing aside a temporary political diversion. But
whatever the future of the sterling-DM exchange rate there is unlikely to be
a simple return to the economic climate of the 1980s.
There has been a change in the investment fundamentals over the past two
years to which pension funds surely ought to have measurably responded. It
is the absence of any such flexibility which suggests that the worship of
the consensus has paralysed the pension fund investment process.
We are dealing here with shifts in mass psychology. Until the 1960s equities
were scarcely thought to be suitable investments for pension funds at all.
Now the conventional wisdom is that only equities are natural pension fund
assets.
Of course, any investor in the stock market has to be prepared for a bad
year, and pension fund trustees will probably not worry too much if their
portfolios make a minus return this year when they could have earned a safe
10 per cent by putting the money on deposit. But another year of weak share
prices and falling dividends (which have dropped 1.4 per cent over the last
year in nominal terms on the All-Share Index) might cause restlessness.
It may never happen. But the danger is that the herd will attempt to shift
from one consensus position to a radically different one. If tens of
billions of pounds are on the move the impact on asset prices could be
highly disruptive.
You may have cause to hope that your company's pension fund manager can keep
a little ahead of the crowd.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Wheeler deals in Formula One: Honda pulls out as teams and
drivers jostle for position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE multi-million-pound Formula One soap was in something of a spin
yesterday as it gathered for this weekend's Italian grand prix at Monza.
Yesterday's announcement by the Japanese carmaker Honda that it will
withdraw from grand prix motor racing - which it has dominated with McLaren
cars for most of a decade - at the close of the current racing season in
November, was only part of a plot even Dallas audiences might have found
hard to swallow.
Such is the brouhaha over the future of top drivers and teams that
tomorrow's gruelling 250-mile race could be relegated to a sideshow.
Behind the curtains of their giant American motor homes in the Monza
paddock, executives of such big corporate sponsors as Benetton, the Italian
clothing group, and the tobacco giant RJ Reynolds, which annually sink
hundreds of millions of pounds into grand prix racing, were gleefully
contemplating such publicity-rich cliffhangers as:
Will ace British driver Nigel Mansell stay with the Williams-Renault grand
prix team for next season despite having just become 1992 world champion?
Will Ayrton Senna, the brilliant but disillusioned Brazilian driver and
winner of last year's championship leave McLaren and drive for Williams for
nothing?
Will Williams offer Senna Mansell's slot if the British champion leaves them
and will Frenchman and former three-times world champion Alain Prost, whose
contract with Williams excludes Senna as a possible team-mate, blow a gasket
if that happens?
Last night McLaren was understood to be preparing a statement disclosing the
identity of a new engine supplier and Mansell, after dominating practice
yesterday, hinted that his negotiations with Williams would probably be
resolved over the weekend.
The size of his retainer - a mere Dollars 10m last year - appears to have
been the main stumbling block as well as a precise condition for working
with Prost.
But an even more potent player is waiting in the wings.
American Michael Andretti, son of 1978 world champion, Mario Andretti, has
been signed to drive for McLaren next year, having just been crowned
Indy/Cart champion, North America's equivalent of grand prix racing.
The signing of Andretti is likely to spark a major resurgence of interest,
with the prospect of big new injections of US sponsorship cash and
potentially lucrative broadcasting contracts.
For Honda, struggling in the face of flagging sales and image fortunes in
North America, that would be deeply ironic.
The company's decision to withdraw is a sign of changing times for Japanese
carmakers, which have been battered by falling sales and plunging profits.
Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, denied the decision was aimed at
saving money, but said the 100 engineers working full-time on the racing
effort were needed elsewhere in the company, in part to bolster research and
development efforts relating to the environment.
Mr Kawamoto showed not a trace of emotion - or irony - as he announced a
decision similar to one that almost drove him from the company 25 years ago.
Mr Kawamoto, as a young engineer, was in the midst of designing an F1 engine
in 1968 when Honda decided to withdraw from racing. He was so disgusted he
stopped coming to work for several months and nearly resigned.

FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac's announcement that it is cutting a third of its brick production and
a tenth of its concrete block output is welcome news for an industry plagued
by overcapacity. The depressing reality, though, is that this is only a
partial solution for the company, while several competitors must be thinking
of following suit.
The ideal solution for Tarmac would have been a joint venture with Steetley,
but this proposal was trumped by Redland's bid. As a result the costs of
withdrawal now have to be taken unilaterally, though the assumption is that
last year's Pounds 18m provision should be sufficient to cover the bill.
Mutterings about mothballing some of the plant, moreover, should protect the
balance sheet: the company can presumably argue that there is no need for a
write-off. Since it has only 5-6 per cent of the market and is unable to
take a more aggressive stance, one nevertheless wonders whether Tarmac
should be in the brick business at all.
Yesterday's announcement obviously raises the prospect of similar moves from
the likes of Ibstock Johnsen and London Brick. There will always be a
temptation to hang on and try to poach market share, but with Redland in the
background that may not be prudent. Ironically, the controversial practice
of acquisition accounting provides Redland with a spur to take the right
commercial decision. The company is expected to signal hefty restructuring
provisions against Steetley when it reports its interim figures next month,
enabling it to speed up rationalisation of the sector.

FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Nestle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to read too much for the future into Nestle's interim
results. Perrier will only be consolidated from the current half onwards,
and the remainder of 1992 is beset with uncertainties over exchange rates.
Nestle derives about a quarter of its sales from the US and a sizeable
additional chunk from countries whose currencies are in some way
dollar-linked. So exchange rate movements will inevitably trim sharply the
16.5 per cent growth in earnings per share achieved in the first half.
That said, Nestle has certainly turned in an impressive performance both on
volumes - up over 4 per cent excluding Brazil - and on operating margins
which have risen from 9.1 to 9.8 per cent. That North America was
particularly strong is some consolation for the weak dollar. More generally,
Nestle appears to be reaping the benefits from its recent restructuring. As
for Perrier, earnings dilution this year should be minimal. Next year it
could start making a positive contribution, given the scope for margin
improvement.
Even at present dollar levels, it is hard to see Nestle's earnings growth
slowing to less than 8 per cent. In that case it should easily outstrip
Unilever, although such a comparison must include all the usual caveats
about accounting differences. The share price is still doubtless distorted
by the share split which has finally brought the paper within reach of
retail investors. None the less, at yesterday's close of SFr952, the bearer
shares do not look expensive.

FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even after yesterday's 24p bounce in the shares it is worth recalling that
UB has lost 40 per cent of its stock market value since mid April. Investors
were understandably relieved that the wilder rumours about first-half
trading were wide of the mark, and justifiably impressed by a performance -
Keebler aside - which saw margins in the UK and continental Europe
maintained. As the recent re-rating implies, though, strategic problems in
the US will not be easily resolved, and competition can only intensify in
other recession-hit markets.
To be fair, there is no air of complacency about Keebler. Costs have already
been cut and there may be more to come; sales are running 8 per cent ahead
of last year thanks to better promotion; and new products will help the
second half. That said, UB is up against powerful rivals in Nabisco and
Pepsico, whose margins are three or four times greater. They will not
presumably stand idly by while Keebler attempts to win back market share.
The question of whether UB is of sufficient size to be a national player in
the US may worry investors for some time.
Its dominance at home, by contrast, is demonstrated by McVitie's ability to
achieve good biscuit profits without chasing volume. The pressure is on,
though, from the likes of Burton's (ABF) so there is unlikely to be any
substantial improvement in the second half. Not so long ago an 8 per cent
yield would have seemed a slight for one of the sector's quality players -
but given the thinnish dividend cover the market is right to be cautious.

FT  12 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: A suspect revival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would probably be best to be wary of yesterday's 30.3-point rise in the
UK equity market. The sudden revival of the dollar may be of real benefit to
companies like Reuters and Glaxo with large markets in North America. It is
premature to expect it to put an end to the troubles of the pound in the
ERM, and hence to the interest rate alert. The market may have been
deceiving itself if that was its reason for marking up the clearing banks by
over 3 per cent - and getting on for 5 per cent in the case of Barclays.
There are still formidable obstacles in the way of a sustainable recovery.
The immediate problem is the French vote on Maastricht. No one can yet say
exactly how that will turn out, although the market seems to have factored a
weak 'yes' vote into its expectations. The assumption is that this, too,
would calm the exchange markets. Perhaps so, but Italy's economic problems
will not easily go away whatever France decides. So strains in the ERM may
resurface, and sterling would again be vulnerable. However forthright the
prime minister in his language, the government has displayed with its
actions a deep reluctance to raise interest rates.
Besides, it is not as if there were much to cheer about in the real economy.
BTR's description of the landscape as a desert may linger in the memory, but
this week has seen one dismal trading statement after another. At this point
investors should be past applauding an extra fraction of a percentage point
off the inflation rate. A spot of economic recovery would be much more
reassuring.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Sterling and lira kept under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE Italian lira and sterling remained under intense pressure in the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday despite a strong rally by the
dollar against the D-Mark.
The dollar rose by more than 4 pfennigs against the German currency,
touching DM1.4535 in US trading and closing at DM1.4500 in London - its
highest close in three weeks.
Previously a rise in the dollar was accompanied by renewed investment in the
lira and sterling, as dealers trim their holdings of D-Marks.
However, the Italian lira was still weak yesterday, closing at L765.2
against the D-Mark in London, in spite of intervention on its behalf from
the Bank of Italy and the Bundesbank. The lira's ERM floor against the
D-Mark is L765.4.
Sterling again hovered near its ERM floor of DM2.7780, but closed at
DM2.7900. In New York it closed at DM2.7864 against the German currency.
Neither the German nor Italian central banks were prepared to reveal the
scale of their intervention to support the lira yesterday, but some dealers
suggested that it was very high and had cost several billion D-Marks.
This support operation was on a similar scale to one that was mounted last
Friday when the Bank of Italy also raised the discount rate by 1.75 points
to 15 per cent.
The dollar's rally was not due to any concrete developments, but some
dealers suggested that there were signs of a slowdown in the German economy
and that the Bundesbank might be forced to cut interest rates this year.
The large differential between US and German short-term rates has been the
principal factor driving the dollar down since the spring.

FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US investors appear reluctant
to buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets failed to follow through on Thursday's big gains as share
prices held steady despite a stronger dollar and good inflation news, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.55 at 3,305.71.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended slightly weaker, down
0.37 at 419.58, while the Amex composite put on 1.64 at 386.45 and the
Nasdaq composite advanced 1.78 to 583.02. Turnover on the NYSE was 182m
shares.
After Thursday's 33-point jump in the Dow, some analysts had hoped that
investors would build on those gains yesterday. The dollar was strong,
rising almost three pfennigs to DM1.45 amid heavy technical buying, meaning
that the beleaguered US currency had rallied more than six pfennigs since
Labor Day.
The day's main economic news was also positive for equities, with the Labor
department reporting that producer prices rose just 0.1 per cent in August.
The figures indicated that inflationary pressures in the economy remain
extremely subdued, and confirmed the view that if the Federal Reserve wants
to ease monetary policy again, fear of inflation should not be a hindrance.
In spite of the good fundamentals, investors appeared reluctant to buy. They
may have been unsettled by falling bond prices, although the Treasury
market's weakness was linked to the heavy supply of new corporate debt, said
analysts, and did not suggest that yields were on a long-term upward path.
Among individual stocks, trading in shares of Morgan Stanley was delayed due
to an order imbalance on the sell side after the New York investment bank
announced second-quarter profits of Dollars 119m, 19 per cent higher than a
year ago but below analysts' forecasts. The shares fell more than Dollars 1
but recovered in the afternoon to finish up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 49 7/8 .
Ford fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 1/4 in turnover of 1.8m after Mr Jack
Kirnan, motor analyst at securities house Salomon Brothers, lowered his
rating from 'buy' to 'hold' and cut his forecasts for 1992 and 1993. Mr
Kirnan said he was downgrading Ford because of the group's exposure to
Europe, especially the UK, where sales are particularly weak and where the
company is losing ground to General Motors. GM shares were down Dollars  1/4
at Dollars 33 5/8 .
Medtronic rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 88 3/4 in busy trading after the
company settled its litigations with the German technology group Siemens.
Siemens will make payments to Medtronic, with an initial outlay of Dollars
50m.
On the Nasdaq market, Castle Energy jumped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 3 after
the company revealed it would buy some of the assets of Atlantic Richfield
for a total of Dollars 128m. Electronic Arts rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 32 on
the news it had acquired a Texas video game maker for Dollars 35m in stock.
Canada
TORONTO changed little in active trading, the TSE-300 composite index losing
3.36 to 3440.57, down about 16 points on the week. Declines led advances by
276 to 272 in volume of 36.6m shares.
Gold stocks suffered most with American Barrick and Placer Dome, two of the
group's most heavily weighted components, falling  5/8 to 36 5/8 and  1/4 to
12 1/4 respectively.

FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Higher dollar gives Paris a
good day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the dollar, and a gently firmer start on Wall Street helped
bourses, particularly the late closers, yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS enjoyed a positive day as the market took confidence from the dollar.
The CAC-40 index ended up 27.81 at 1,801.99, just off the day's high of
1,803.01, while turnover was a healthy FFr2.4bn. The market gained 1.3 per
cent on the week.
Some speculative buying of bank and finance stocks was noted on hopes of a
Yes vote in the Maastricht referendum, which could signal a cut in interest
rates. Societe Generale gained FFr5 to FFr534, Suez was up FFr5.50 to
FFr249.00 and Paribas advanced FFr15 to FFr342.
Rhone-Poulenc reversed Thursday's sharp fall with a gain in its certificates
of FFr13 to FFr543. Peugeot featured in active trade after the group
forecast a rise in European sales: its shares gained FFr26 to FFr619.
The Peugeot news helped the automotive sector, Valeo, the replacement
components company, improving FFr35 or 4.9 per cent to FFr745 with some
40,000 shares traded. Michelin gained FFr7 to FFr206.
FRANKFURT toyed with special situations as the DAX index ended 0.87 lower at
1,527.80, 0.6 per cent down on the week in turnover down to DM3.6bn from
DM4.2bn.
A earnings downgrade for Thyssen dropped the steelmaker by DM4.30 to
DM190.50. Goldman Sachs trimmed its DVFA earnings forecasts from DM15 to
DM13 a share for 1991-92, and from DM16 to DM14 for 1992-93, and expected a
dividend cut from DM10 to DM6 a share.
Varta, the battery maker, dropped DM6 to DM294 for a loss of DM16 on the
week. Analysts said that the car industry was squeezing its components
suppliers.
On the plus side, construction stocks rose after a trade group reported that
new orders for the west German construction sector rose by 2.1 per cent in
June. Philip Holzmann closed DM40 higher at DM845 and Hochtief rose DM25 to
DM970. In banking, Commerzbank said that it was thinking about a dividend
increase for 1992 and the shares rose DM2.30 to DM220.80.
MILAN went sharply into reverse, the Comit index closing 6.17 lower at
367.09, 1.2 per cent down on the week, as dealers again focused on the
struggling lira and political worries.
The Bank of Italy said the rumours of an imminent rate hike were unfounded.
ZURICH rose on the higher dollar, the SMI index closing 19.0 better at
1,811.8. In addition, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Swiss Volksbank, better
than expected first half profits from Nestle lifted the bearers by SFr11 to
SFr952.
AMSTERDAM rose on the stronger dollar, the CBS Tendency index climbing 0.9
to 109.2, 0.6 per cent lower on the week. Royal Dutch and Unilever both
showed up well, up Fl 2.00 and Fl 2.50 respectively to Fl 144.30 and Fl
183.20.
BRUSSELS took its cue from neighbouring markets and ended the week firmer.
The Bel-20 index closed up 6.37 at 1,079.58, a gain of 0.86 per cent on the
week, in turnover of BFr804m.
UCB, the pharmaceuticals and packaging company, pleased investors with its
first half figures (released after Thursday's close) and gained BFr650, or
2.9 per cent to BFr23,000.
BBL resumed trading after Thursday's suspension on news that the Dutch
insurer, ING, was to make a bid. Its shares closed up BFr175 or 5.3 per cent
at BFr3,450 with 19,200 shares traded.
STOCKHOLM closed the week firmer as investors began to be encouraged by
central bank efforts to defend the krona. The Affarsvarlden index rose 13.1
to 720.3, 4.9 per cent lower on the week. Turnover was Skr355m after SKr397m
on Thursday.
The banking share index rose 7.3 per cent with SE-Banken A shares SKr1
firmer at SKr15.
Procordia B shares rose SKr6 to Skr148 after announcing, on Thursday, the
sale of its sugar producing subsidiary and acquisition of Swedish Match. In
OSLO the market continued to improve with the all-share index up 4.18 at
313.51, unchanged on the week. Turnover was NKr218m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr4
to NKr134.
VIENNA was little changed on the day but up 2 per cent on the week. The ATX
index rose 0.53 to 745.85 with Leykam, the paper manufacturer, gaining Sch7
to Sch312, for the day's biggest rise.
ISTANBUL reached a two month high in spite of some late profit-taking. The
75-share index, which rose 128 in early trade, closed up 24.77 at 4,322.10
in turnover estimated at TL321.8bn. Eregli, the steel group, went against
the trend, falling TL50 to TL3,800.
MADRID's general index rose 1.16 to 208.81, 3.5 per cent down on the week.

FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Resilient Lisbon looks for selective
growth - Portuguese equity performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The small Portuguese bolsa has been more resilient than many of its
competitors to the pressures which have driven equities down this year.
While share prices have fallen, the local market has performed better than
most of its European counterparts. Analysts believe that it will continue to
do so for the rest of this year, although investors will have to be more
selective.
The Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index rose by 5.1 per cent in the first six
months ending June 30, out-performing most other European indices, including
the FT-SE 100 which rose 1.1 per cent in the period; only Zurich, Paris,
Frankfurt and Milan rose by more than Lisbon, according to Baring
Securities. During the second quarter, the BTA index was among only four in
Europe which bucked the trend of falling indices.
Since June, the Portuguese market has been buffeted by domestic and
international factors. Fears over the future of the EC, with uncertainty
surrounding the outcome of the French Maastricht referendum on September 20,
helped take the BTA index down to 1,971.9 on Thursday, still above its
1,869.6 year low of February 12, but against a peak of 2,156.4 on May 11.
The market was also adversely affected by the flight out of the country in
July of Mr Pedro Caldeira, a leading stockbroker, leaving behind him debts
exceeding Esc 400m (Dollars 3.2m). The scandal, coming shortly after the
suspension of two brokers for irregularities, has undermined investor
confidence, though analysts believe it may have a salutary impact.
There were positive factors. Interest rates, which had been declining slowly
since the start of the year came down more abruptly in August when the
central bank reduced its intervention rate twice within a week and announced
plans to lift all capital controls by the end of the year. Dealers thought
that more cuts were on the way, but analysts say that this will depend on
clearer signals that inflation is falling. It is expected to be around 9 per
cent this year, at the higher end of the 7-9 per cent range government
forecast.
On September 1, the authorities abolished the requirement for Portuguese
companies which want to borrow in foreign currencies to deposit the
equivalent of 25 per cent of the amount in escudos with the Bank of Portugal
in an interest-free deposit. Companies hope that this will also help to push
down Portuguese interest rates, thereby reducing the gap between domestic
and international levels.
'This has big implications for companies with a high level of debt,' says
one analyst. 'Their income side will benefit. For good companies which
struggle under a heavy weight of financial charges, the fall in interest
rates will have a very significant effect. Some companies could see their
profits double as a result.'
Interest rates for investors have declined markedly. Whereas they could get
14.5 per cent on six month money at the beginning of August, this is down to
11.5-12 per cent. 'The fall in fixed income yields will encourage investors
towards the floating market, and that's good for the stock exchange,' says a
stockbroker.
In addition, the ongoing reform of the bolsa will raise market efficiency
and transparency. Supervision has been tightened and the gradual expansion
of continuous trading, along with the first effective steps to link the
Lisbon and Oporto exchanges, will also help. But optimism has to be tempered
with caution.
'Investors will have to be much more selective,' says a fund manager. 'It is
increasingly important to look at sectors. For example, construction stocks
are up by almost 25 per cent this year, but the overall index is down.'
He believes that most financials will underperform selected industrial
stocks as the fall in interest rates cuts into bank margins and profits.
More than 50 per cent of the index consists of financial companies, so if
their shares are depressed it drags the index down.
Companies likely to do well are those involved in major modernisation and
infrastructure projects. These include a new bridge over the Tagus from
Lisbon, expansion of the Lisbon underground, several power plants and a
cross-country gas pipeline, the renovation of the railways, new motorways to
Spain, as well as major industrial investments in new factories such as the
Ford-Volkswagen Dollars 2.8bn joint venture car plant in Setubal. All this
activity will give work, not just to construction companies but also to
manufacturers of a wide range of related products.
Selected financial institutions such as Banco Comercial Portugues and Banco
Portugues de Investimento, more adaptable to change, are expected to do
well, while interest rate sensitive stocks such as Sonae could also benefit.
The economy is expected to grow by about 2.5 per cent this year and is
forecast to grow by 3 per cent in 1993, so, barring major international
shocks, prospects look relatively positive. 'We've had a very unfavourable
environment with high interest rates and a tight monetary policy. Now
conditions are becoming more favourable,' says a stockbroker.

STOCKS closed sharply lower on futures-linked selling and publication of the
Bank of Japan's tankan, or quarterly economic survey, which showed business
confidence at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, agencies report from
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 800.78 or 4.2 per cent to 18,107.69, a 2.4 per cent
decline on the week, closing just above its intraday low of 18,097.55 after
a high of 18,902.85 in the morning session. Volume was estimated at 700m
shares, up from 625.4m, declines exceeding advances by 898 to 165 with 89
unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 45.12 or 3.2 per cent to
1,369.85 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.84 to 1,093.23.
'Bad data was expected, so the tankan is no surprise,' one analyst said.
'Today's fall was mostly due to futures.'
Investors expected the settlement price of the September Nikkei futures
contract to be in the low 19,000s, but it turned out to be 18,631. Brokers
said that investors who had bought all week, expecting a technical rally
over 19,000 in the morning session, took profits.
Speculative biotechnology shares lost ground in heavy volume. Green Cross
lost Y60 to Y1,720 in volume of 11.85m shares while Meiji Milk lost Y40 to
Y1,080 in turnover of 11.32m shares. Blue-chip electricals held up well with
Sharp unchanged at Y1,070 and Mitsubishi Electric down Y7 at Y488.
NTT dropped sharply, losing Y24,000 to Y576,000. Banks fell heavily with IBJ
down Y110 to Y2,820, Bank of Tokyo losing Y100 to Y1,290, and Sumitomo Bank
Y110 weaker at Y1,700.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets showed a mixed performance yesterday with Bangkok
continuing to improve. Seoul and Taiwan were closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG continued to blame Sino-US trade friction as the Hang Seng index
fell another 94.26, or 1.7 per cent to 5,537.29, down 3 per cent on the week
in turnover ofHKDollars 1.82bn, up from HKDollars 1.46bn.
Overseas institutions led the selling but selective buying, mostly by local
Chinese fund investors, was said to have prevented a worse plunge. Brokers
attributed this to a rebounding US dollar, to which the local currency is
pegged, and sound fundamentals.
AUSTRALIA maintained its focus on Westpac, with another 51m rights to the
bank's share issue traded. The All Ordinaries index closed up 17.2 at
1,501.00, down 1.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of ADollars 260.2m.
Westpac closed 4 cents higher at ADollars 2.92, off an intraday high of
ADollars 3.02.
Elsewhere News Corp gained 22 cents to ADollars 23.32 while Foster's Brewing
fell 5 cents to ADollars 1.48 ahead of Monday's annual results.
BANGKOK rose further, the SET index gaining 10.70 or 1.35 per cent to 801.90
in turnover of Bt11.15bn. The market has advanced 5 per cent over the week.
Krisda Mahanakorn, a property group, was the day's most active issue, up
Bt16 at Bt218.
KUALA LUMPUR investors liquidated positions following the sharp fall in
Tokyo, and the KLSE composite index fell 3.40 to at 580.79, a fraction lower
on the week. Fund managers kept to the sidelines ahead of the Malaysian
budget next month.
MANILA advanced as a strong performance by PLDT overnight in the US prompted
last-minute buying. The composite index gained 4.96 to 1,417.96, a rise of
1.86 per cent on the week.
PLDT gained 10 pesos to 975 pesos, and combined turnover rose to 262m pesos
from 195m peses.
NEW ZEALAND edged higher as Fletcher Challenge reversed falls earlier in the
week. The NZSE-40 index rose 7.39 to 1,461.17, 1.2 per cent lower on the
week. Turnover was NZDollars 18m. Fletcher Challenge gained 7 cents to
NZDollars 2.21.

FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco line placed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD retailer Tesco had one of the busiest sessions in recent weeks after
Hoare Govett, the London securities house, placed the large line of stock
which has been hanging over the market for some time.
Hoare placed the block of 5m shares with institutions at around 208p. The
share price at first eased a penny on the placing but rallied to close 3 up
at 211p on suggestions that Tesco might have been a beneficiary from
switching out of rival Argyll Group, whose shares fell 7 to 325p. Turnover
in Tesco reached 15m, just shy of the year's highest daily total. Argyll
traded 3.3m.
Food group rallies
Food manufacturing group United Biscuits had a volatile but busy session
after reporting interim figures below market expectations and issuing a
warning over profits for the full year.
The shares fell sharply in early trading on the news of profits of Pounds
70m, down from Pounds 84.4m, and compared with market expectations of around
Pounds 75m; it also warned that profits will be lower at the year-end. At
the day's worst the shares were down 13 at 222p.
However an optimistic meeting with analysts at which confidence in a
maintained final dividend was restored, coupled with renewed bid
speculation, caused a turnaround in the shares mid-morning. They closed up
24 at to 259p on the highest daily turnover this year of 9.6m shares.
Smith New Court reduced its full year forecast by Pounds 25m to Pounds 170m
but classed the shares on a 'short term buy,' suggesting they had been
oversold and now offered an attractive yield. Nomura also trimmed its
forecast, reducing its profit estimate from Pounds 186m to Pounds 170.5m.
Arjo Wiggins weak
Arjo Wiggins, the paper manufacturing and distribution group, was one of the
worst performers among the Footsie constituents. The shares retreated a
further 8 to 180p, the lowest level since January 1981; turnover was a hefty
2.2m shares.
Dealers attributed the decline to nervousness ahead of the interim figures
due next Tuesday. The group posted profits of Pounds 135.5m in the first
half last year but several analysts expect pre-tax profits to dip below
Pounds 100m this time.
The big dollar earners powered ahead as the US currency appreciated against
other currencies. Glaxo, also helped by a good Press response to its
preliminary results, jumped 21 1/2 to 767 1/2 p, having touched 778p;
turnover reached a hefty 5.5m shares. SmithKline Beecham moved up 9 to 489p
on 3m, while Wellcome advanced 21 to 869p. Reuter put on 21 to 1117p.
The oil sector, whose earnings stream is almost entirely priced in dollars,
was among the market's best performers as the US currency surged higher
against all the major currencies.
Additionally boosted by the dividend increase announced on Thursday
afternoon, Shell improved a further 7 to 474p on 3.4m while BP, bought
aggressively by US investors, jumped 5 1/2 to 197 1/2 p on 9.2m.
Enterprise Oil, back in favour after delivering better than expected interim
numbers earlier in the week, pushed up 11 more to 328p on good turnover of
2.9m while a single trade of 1.9m Lasmo at 125 1/2 p early in the session
triggered some big activity in the shares which settled 2 up at 126p.
Burmah Castrol, a strong market since the increased interim dividend at the
start of the month, marked their re-election-entry to the list of Footsie
constituents with a jump of 12 to 585p.
Bank shares, despite their recent good performances relative to the market,
were among the front runners as dealers, thought to be running short books,
hoisted prices to try to tempt sellers into the market.
Dealers said institutions had focussed on 'safe' areas of themarket and
settled on the clearing banks as offering good yields and safe dividends.
Barclays attracted the heaviest turnover and 14 higher at 314p with 6m
traded. Lloyds, given an additional boost by a 'buy' recommendation
published by BZW, raced up 13 to 411p on 2.6m. The broker highlighted the
probability that Lloyds would be able to pay above average dividend
increases and still increase its net assets at well above the rate of
inflation this year and next.
NatWest gained 11 to 330p on 2.3m, while TSB put on 4 to 131p on 3.4m. Abbey
National added 5 at 270p albeit in relatively thin trading of less than 1m.
First National Finance tumbled just before the close, sliding 5 to 17p.
Insurances attracted sustained support, with Commercial Union (up 17 at
492p) and General Accident (8 higher at 448p) prominent in the composites.
Prudential, one of the best performers among the Footsie after excellent
interim announced in midweek, added 4 more at 249p. Legal &amp; General jumped 7
to 315p with the market expecting the group to reveal interim profits in the
region of Pounds 75m next Thursday but still concerned about potential
losses in the domestic mortgage indemnity market.
Willis Corroon, to be removed from the Footsie list next month, received a
substantial boost from the upsurge in the dollar, closing 9 firmer at 165p.
Turnover in British Steel rose to 23m shares as the shares improved 2 to 51
1/2 p, boosted by US buying.
Demand for the stock from the US remains buoyant and a group of US analysts
is at present in the UK visiting the company. The number of shares in the
hands of US investors is now estimated to be around 21 per cent of total
equity.
Hopes of an early agreement on a new five year coal supply contract
continued to drive shares of the generators higher. National Power added 4
more at 261p and PowerGen 3 to 273p.
Kalon, the paint manufacturer which recently lost out in its bid to gain
control of Manders, dropped 4 to 79 1/2 p despite a denial of market rumours
of lost contracts.
The building materials/contracting sectors put on a brave performance, after
a week in which some of the sector leaders announced big losses and dividend
cuts. The sector was also hit by downgrades and sell recommendations.
Tarmac, after big cuts in its bricks division, rose 3 to 59p.
Investors took on board advise from County NatWest to switch out of Granada
Group and into Thorn EMI. The former shed 3 to 237p, as the latter firmed 2
to 671p.
Brewers experienced a bumpy ride. Guinness shed 6 to 517p, on talk of a
planned acquisition and a profits downgrade from the company's broker
Cazennove. Volume reached 4.2m.
Allied Lyons was also out of favour after two securities houses cut their
forecasts. Lehman Brothers reduced the current year figure by Pounds 32m to
Pounds 660m, and the following year's by Pounds 65m to Pounds 725m blaming
current weakness of the economy in both the UK and the US and the weaker
dollar for the cut. The shares ended a penny lower at 550p, after turnover
of 2.5m.

FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong gains in dollar-earning stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND UK STOCK MARKET EDITOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH IN the US dollar boosted the big overseas earning stocks in London
yesterday, counter-balancing a more cautious response to sterling's
performance against the D-mark. The strongly-worded rejection from the UK
prime minister of suggestions of realignment of the pound in the European
exchange rate mechanism calmed recent uncertainties.
Domestic issues, including many leading retailers, found encouragement from
the latest UK inflation statistics, showing an annualised increase of only
3.6 per cent, the lowest for four years. By the close, the FT-SE Index was
more than 30 points higher, although traders warned that confidence remained
fragile.
Traders appeared surprised at yesterday's further advance in the Footsie
Index, which brought a closing level of 2,370.9, up 30.3 on the day. The
gain reversed what had been a loss over the week to show a net gain of 8.7
points since last Friday's close. Dealers under strict orders not to leave
share positions open in these treacherous markets hurried to buy stock when
the market moved forward yesterday.
Equities opened firmly against the D-Mark but soon lost impetus when the
pound failed to maintain its initial response to the uncompromising defence
of sterling's role in the ERM by Mr John Major, the British prime minster,
who said any realignment of sterling's parity would be 'a betrayal of our
future.'
But other considerations were brushed aside in equities by powerful rises in
the big dollar-orientated issues, including the oils, pharmaceuticals and
international traders. With Glaxo, British Petroleum, Shell, Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham all higher in good turnover, the Footsie Index quickly
extended its early gain of 6 points to 32.8.
While the UK Retail Price index was a little better than expected, the
favourable response from consumer stocks was unexpected in view of this
week's negative survey of the retail outlook from the Confederation of
British Industry.
Trading volum increased after Wall Street opened its new session with a gain
of 7 Dow points. Seaq-recorded volume finally totalled 476.8m shares, just
behind the 485.6m recorded on the previous day. However, there were renewed
hints that low trading volume is hurting City firms; Thursday's retail
business was worth only Pounds 900.9m, still on the low side for market
profitability.
Retail turnover has remained painfully low, even by comparison with the
unprofitable levels of the comparable period of 1991.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Platinum leads precious
metals lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATINUM LED a general retreat of precious metals prices yesterday after
hopes were raised of tension easing in South Africa, by far the biggest
producer of the white metal, by the African National Congress's expression
of willingness to hold talks with the government.
Earlier in the week grave concern about racial unrest in the South African
homelands had lifted the platinum price to the highest level for four weeks.
Monday's violence in Ciskei was reflected in a Dollars 2.80-a-troy-ounce
rise and further gains were prompted in mid-week by fears that threatened
mass action by the ANC might disrupt the Bophuthatswana operation of Impala,
South Africa's second biggest producer of platinum. Those fears helped to
push the price to Dollars 364.15 and ounce in London before profit-taking
was encouraged late on Wednesday by assurances from the country's biggest
producers that they were not expecting output to be affected.
The selling continued on Thursday and quickened yesterday with the added
encouragement of the ANC statement and the dollar's improved fortunes on the
foreign exchanges. In the afternoon the London platinum price was fixed at
Dollars 356.25 an ounce, Dollars 4.85 below Thursday's level and 95 cents
down on the week.
Though the gold market remained technically weak its price followed
platinum's early rise, albeit at a respectful distance. What remained of
those gains were wiped out yesterday, however, and the price closed on the
London bullion market at Dollars 340.25 an ounce, down Dollars 1.25 on the
week.
Silver was noticeably weaker than the other precious metals throughout week
and after falling 6.5 cents yesterday the London price closed at 369.5 cents
an ounce, down 6.5 cents on balance.
Base metals prices were mostly lower at the London Metal Exchange, led by
copper, which breached with unexpected ease support at the equivalent of
Dollars 2,420 a tonne for three months delivery. Traders attributed the
market's weakness to continuing concern about the world economy's slowness
to emerge from the recession, liquidation of Chinese long positions and
increased shipments from Russia.
In sterling terms copper appeared to finish the week with its tail up,
gaining Pounds 25.50 in the three months position yesterday to reach Pounds
1,267.75 a tonne, down Pounds 9.75 on the week. But the rally was entirely
attributable to the continuing dollar rally. In terms of that currency the
three months position was down Dollars 16.50 on the day and Dollars 111.50
on the week at Dollars 2,397.50 a tonne. Traders said the next downside
chart objective was Dollars 2,380 a tonne.
The currency factor had no such cushioning effect on the dollar-denominated
LME nickel market. The three months position was marginally steadier during
the second half of the week but still ended Dollars 142.50 down on balance
at Dollars 7,012.50 a tonne. Twice it had touched a 2 1/2 -year low of
Dollars 6,915 a tonne as sentiment was undermined by depressed fundamentals
and negative technical factors, which encouraged speculators to liquidate
long positions. Some producer support was noted, as well as modest Chinese
buying, but this was insufficient to reverse the trend.
Zinc prices joined in the general downtrend this week, as the supply squeeze
worries that had been bolstering them appeared to ease. After breaching
support at Dollars 1,380 a tonne on Tuesday the three months price closed
yesterday at Dollars 1,341 a tonne, down Dollars 51.50 on the week, and the
cash premium - a reflection of the squeeze fears - narrowed from Dollars
44.25 to Dollars 24 a tonne.
Dealers warned, however, that the zinc market remained vulnerable to renewed
supply tightness in the final quarter of this year, which is attributed to
options-related operations by a group of producers and a leading trade
house.
Coffee prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange began the week with
a continuation of last week's rise but quickly fell under the influence of a
depressed New York market. Concern about oversupply of the arabica coffee
variety traded in New York helped to push the September futures price there
below the psychologically-important 50 cents a lb mark at one point.
Oversupply is not at present a problem for the London's robusta coffee
market but, as often happens, sympathetic pains caused it to abandon its
upward course and the November position closed yesterday at Dollars 769 a
tonne, down Dollars 19 on the week.

FT  12 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives markets provided a good lead yesterday for an equity market
already encouraged by the strength of the US dollar, writes Terry Byland.
In the stock index sector, the September contract, which expires in a just
over a week, traded briskly as dealers continued to roll-over positions into
the December contract which will take over as the market leader. Locals, or
independent traders, were short of the September contract and their efforts
to close positions forced the price higher.
September showed a premium of around 10 points to cash at the close; with no
fair value premium now standing on the September, last night's quotation
represented an acceptable cost-of-carry premium on December.
Turnover in traded options increased from 26,448 contracts on Thursday to
35,499 yesterday, with calls registering 19,044. The FT-SE 100 Index option
saw a sharp rise in business, recording a total of 16,524 contracts against
10,914. HSBC topped the list of individual stock contracts with 2,210,
followed by Glaxo (2,084) as the drug group continued to respond to the
trading results.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS unaffected by dollar rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH sterling and the Italian lira remained under intense pressure in the
European monetary system yesterday despite a strong recovery by the US
dollar against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz.
In an erratic day of trading, the dollar rose nearly 4 pfennigs against the
German currency. On previous occasions, the selling of D-Marks for dollars
has helped to ease strains in the EMS. But yesterday the lira refused to
move off its ERM floor against the D-Mark of L765.4 for long, despite huge
intervention on its behalf from the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy which
bought lire for D-Marks. Sterling retained its beleaguered image, closing a
 1/4 pfennig up on the day at DM2.7900.
The European currencies failed to respond to the dollar's rise partly
because it was not firmly underpinned. There was no significant indicator
pushing the US currency up, but it closed at DM1.4500 in London.
Dealers had a pot pourri of reasons for buying dollars yesterday. One
operator was guided by a Japanese report that finance ministers of the Group
of Seven leading industrial nations would beef up their policy on central
bank intervention when they meet next weekend. Mr Julian Simmonds, head of
foreign currency at Citibank, also said that there were increasing signs
that the Bundesbank would have to ease monetary policy before the year's
end. 'But I wouldn't be so bold as to say that the dollar is on the way up
again,' he added.
One week before the French referendum, EMS currencies would probably not
have rallied against the D-Mark in any event. There is profound uncertainty
in the market about the future of the European cross rates. Trading remains
thin, and most operators are unwilling to keep positions open for long.
One sample of the volatility in Europe was the performance of the Finnish
markka yesterday morning, which gained nearly 3 per cent in value against
the D-Mark on very thin trading, despite this week's devaluation. 'It just
shows how fickle the markets are,' said Mr Mark Slater, Director of Foreign
Exchange at Merrill Lynch in London.
Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy spent billions of D-Marks
yesterday trying to push the Italian lira off its ERM floor against the
D-Mark. As usual, the currency came under intense pressure at the weekend
because of fears of devaluation.
Dealers said that the Bundesbank's obligation to buy the lira on its floor
made it the victim of a lucrative ERM arbitrage play. Operators yesterday
bought the Italian currency when it dropped below the official ERM floor.
They then called the Bundesbank to sell the lira at a guaranteed profit at
the ERM floor of L765.4.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures dip again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures dipped again yesterday as a new wave of nervousness hit the
market in the run up to next Sunday's French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty.
Dealers continued to be worried about sterling's poor performance on the
foreign exchanges and the possibility that the UK government will have to
defend the currency with an interest rate rise. Few will have wanted to
leave themselves exposed before the weekend, which brings fears of currency
realignments and dramatic headlines in the Sunday press.
Futures prices were affected by the slightest rumour. One clearing bank
dealer said that the December contract lost 3 basis points after a news
agency report suggested that the Bank of Spain was not averse to a
devaluation of the peseta - a suggestion that could not be substantiated.
Other dealers claimed that the December contract was being heavily sold by a
single bank dealer, and that nobody in the market could work out what his
strategy was.
By the day's end, the December contract had closed 13 basis points down from
its previous opening at 89.22. The September contract, which expires next
week, closed 12 basis points below its opening level at 89.38. Both prices
discount a 1/2 percentage point rise in base rates, at least.
Rates in the sterling cash market remained firm, even though the Bank of
England's Pounds 950m shortage was nearly all removed in the early round.
Three-month money again closed at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side, while
the 1 month rate remained at 10 1/4 per cent.
One dealer said that the clearing banks would be able to live with 1 month
money up to  1/2 a per cent higher than base rates, as long the overnight
rate remained soft. Yesterday, overnight money fell as low as 8 3/4 per cent
following the Bank's early assistance. The Bank could come under pressure to
raise base rates if the 1 month rate goes higher next week.
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 408m of Band 1 bank bills at
9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 51m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 5m
of Band 4 Treasury bills and Pounds 90m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent
and Pounds 353m for resale to the market at 9 15/16 per cent.
The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.25bn and there was late
assistance of Pounds 100m.

FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mazda Motor to trim payout as it
loses market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MAZDA Motor, the Japanese car maker, yesterday cut its profit estimate for
the year by more than half and said it would cut its dividend payment.
The move comes in response to the weak state of the domestic market, which
has cut heavily into Mazda sales. Mazda, however, is facing an especially
difficult situation compared to most Japanese car makers.
It is losing market share in a declining market. At the same time it faces
an enormous depreciation charge following a period of high investment to
expand capacity made when it expected the market to continue growing
rapidly.
Mazda said its parent-company pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993
would come to only Y7bn (Dollars 57m), 64 per cent lower than last year's
Y19.67bn in pre-tax profits, and 86 per cent below profits seen two years
ago.
It said it would cut its interim dividend from Y3.5 a share to Y3 a share,
and reduce the second-half payout from Y4 to Y3 a share, resulting a 20 per
cent cut in the full-year distribution.
Like other Japanese car makers, Mazda has been forced to cut sales
projections in response to the rapid cooling of consumer spending at home.
Mazda had expected to increase unit sales this year, but now says sales will
fall from 550,000 to 520,000 units at home. Exports are expected to be down
by 60,000 units to 800,000 units.
As a result, Mazda expects the value of sales to decline by less than 1 per
cent to Y2,290bn.
Net after tax income is projected to decline from Y9.27bn to Y3.5bn.
Mazda is also expected to cut further into capital spending, bringing this
down to Y125bn, compared to Y148bn last year.
Mazda geared up strongly for growth in the late 1980s, and last year
finished restructuring its domestic sales network into five channels, each
of which must be supplied with a range of different vehicle models. The cost
of investing in the sales network plus the high cost of developing so many
new models is now weighing heavily on the company.
Toyota is the only other domestic car company which maintains so many sales
channels, but its sales are about 5 times larger than Mazda's.
Mazda also appears to have been caught by the shift of consumer tastes in
Japan toward more conservative goods.
Its range of vehicles are probably the most radically styled on the road in
Japan, which would probably have won it many customers at the time the
expansion was planned.
Now, however, it continues to lose market share to other companies whose
models are arguably more dull.

JOHN LABATT, the Canadian beer and entertainment group, is spinning off its
dairy division into a separate, listed company.
Labatt, controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is also paying a special
dividend totalling CDollars 275m (USDollars 225m) or CDollars 3 a share.
The dairy business has revenues of about CDollars 2bn a year from operations
in the US and Canada. Labatt has withdrawn from numerous food-processing
ventures over the past few years, and the creation of a separate dairy
company is a further effort to concentrate on its brewing and entertainment
interests.
Separately, Labatt reported a 13 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings
from continuing operations to CDollars 52m, or 55 cents a share, from
CDollars 46m or 47 cents. Revenues rose by 12 per cent to CDollars 1.12bn.

NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, has reported a 16.5 per cent jump
in consolidated net profits for the first half to SFr1.18bn (Dollars 950m )
on sales up 13.3 per cent to SFr26.3bn.
The group, which acquired Source Perrier, the leading French mineral water
group, in July, said sales volume growth of 3.3 per cent would be maintained
or improved in the second half. But it warned that if the dollar and yen
remained weak and the Swiss franc strong against other European currencies
until the year-end, the profit growth rate would slow.
Volume growth in all regions was over 4 per cent, except in Brazil where it
declined after a very strong 1991. Margins improved 'significantly' in all
areas except Europe.
Net financing costs rose 26 per cent to SFr307m, reflecting higher interest
charges and a 9.4 per cent rise in net borrowings to SFr7.1bn at June 30
compared with a year earlier. The 1992 net debt figure was struck before
paying SFr3.4bn for Perrier.
Capital spending rose 16.2 per cent to SFr1.3bn during the first half.
Perrier will be consolidated from July 1.

FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sweden draws up contingency plan
to bail out banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish government is preparing contingency plans to save the country's
banking system from possible collapse.
Faced with estimated credit losses for all Sweden's banks of up to SKr90bn
over the next few years, the finance ministry is drawing up options for
action should the position worsen.
Mr Urban Backstrom, under secretary at the finance ministry, said the
measures included the state acquiring the bank's bad debts or setting up
some form of insurance to curb their credit losses. The banks would have to
guarantee to repay the state over a number of years.
However, Mr Backstrom ruled out taking the banks into state ownership. 'We
don't want the government to own banks,' he said. 'We have seen from the
experience of other countries that this is inefficient,' referring to Norway
and Finland.
The cost to the government of any further bank rescues could be substantial.
He said: 'Everybody will have to pay for achieving stability as taxpayers
and customers.
'Foreigners and creditors to the Swedish banking system should not feel
worried because the government will defend it.'
Earlier this year the Swedish government carried out ad hoc rescues of
Nordbanken, with SKr20bn in loans and guarantees, and Forsta Sparbanken, the
savings bank with SKr7.3bn. And this week the government was forced to
guarantee all the obligations of Gota Bank, Sweden's fourth largest
commercial bank.
But Mr Backstrom said the state had to prepare for a 'worst case scenario'
with a comprehensive strategy 'taking a whole grip of the banking system'.
The troubles of Sweden's banking sector increased yesterday when Moody's
Investors Service said it was reviewing the possible downgrading of the
long-term debt ratings of the country's leading commercial banks. These are
Skandinaviska-Enskilda Banken, Svenska Handelsbanken, Nordbanken and
Swedbank, the savings bank.
Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa - the insurance
conglomerate which is Gota Bank's chief shareholder - said yesterday his
company would continue to provide financial support for the bank as long as
this did not put at risk Trygg-Hansa's financial position.
His remarks cleared up confusion earlier this week, when it appeared
Trygg-Hansa thought the Swedish state would be responsible entirely for
Gota's financial rescue. Under pressure from the finance ministry, Mr
Sprangare accepted that Trygg-Hansa would continue to 'contribute to a
solution which limits the burden on tax payers'.
At the same time the Swedish government emphasised it will guarantee all the
activities of Gota Bank to individual customers, corporations and other
creditors, until a solution is found for its future. This followed the bank
revealing that credit losses for this year would mount to SKr8bn, with an
operating deficit of between SKr3bn and SKr4bn.

FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hitachi cuts audio-visual
workforce by about 20%

<TEXT>
THE steep decline in Japan's consumer electronics market is forcing Hitachi,
Japan's largest electrical machinery company, to cut its workforce in the
audio-visual division by 20 per cent this year, or by about 800.
The move by one of Japan's most prominent companies is a sign of the depth
of the recession in the industry. Cutting employment is the last resort for
a company like Hitachi, and a clear sign that the market is not expected to
recover.
The 800 employees do not face redundancy but will be transferred to other
divisions or affiliated companies, of which Hitachi has a vast network. The
company has already ordered 2,200 workers who were making video recorders to
take extra holidays in September and October to reduce production and bring
down bulging inventories.
These short-term measures, however, now appear to be insufficient.
The company is also considering plans to chop back on headquarters
management staff by retraining personnel and sending them to work in sales
or maintenance.
Hitachi has yet to issue a formal revision of its profits forecast, but a
company spokesman said pre-tax profits would likely fall below Y100bn
(Dollars 813m) in the year to March 1993, from Y128.9bn last year.
Hitachi faces slow sales across a wide range of product areas, including
semiconductors and computers. But its electrical power division is
performing well because of projects in Japan.

FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Japan's steel groups slash
profit forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading steel makers yesterday announced sharp downward revisions of
profit estimates for the first half to end-September, and they are likely
apply for government subsidies to help cover the cost of transferring and
retraining idled workers.
Nippon Steel, the country's largest producer, forecast a 74.6 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit to Y14bn, (Dollars 113.8m) compared to the same period
last year, and said the effects of the government's just-announced emergency
economic package would come too late to bolster profits this year.
Other makers expect similar profit falls, with Kobe Steel down from Y18.9bn
last year to Y6bn, Kawasaki Steel's profit to be halved to Y4bn, Sumitomo
Metal Industries down from Y22.2bn to Y4bn, and NKK falling from Y14.1bn to
Y5bn.
The industry is suffering because of falling sales to most of its leading
customers, including the car, construction, and consumer electronics
industries, and because streamlining programmes begun in the mid-1980s were
derailed during the easy money era of the late 1980s.
An application for government subsidies would signal a return to
streamlining, as the last application was made after appreciation of the yen
prompted a sharp fall in crude steel production in 1986. However, demand
rose in 1990, as domestic car sales soared and speculative developers
fuelled construction orders.
The downturn over the past year has also highlighted unwise diversifications
made by steel makers attempting to employ idle workers in ventures ranging
from amusement parks to bicycle factories.
Companies have been forced to review those investments, and it appears
likely that workers will be retrenched over the next year.
Nippon Steel said sales for the first half are likely to fall 6.4 per cent
to Y1,190bn, while pre-tax profit for the full-year is expected to fall 60
per cent to Y40bn on a 9 per cent fall in sales to Y2,400bn. The company's
crude steel production is forecast to fall 14 per cent in the first half.
'We should feel some effects of the economic package, but a real recovery
will not come until next fiscal year. Crude steel production in the second
half is likely to be a bit higher than in the first half,' Nippon Steel
said.
Steel companies are expected to benefit from a rise in public works
investment as part of the Y10,700bn economic package announced in August in
an attempt to revive the ailing economy. But it is unclear whether the
package will stabilise crude steel demand.
Kobe said sales are likely to fall 6 per cent in the first half, while
Kawasaki is expecting sales of Y550bn, down from Y592bn. Sumitomo predicted
sales would fall from Y569bn to Y520bn. However, NKK's sales are still
forecast to rise slightly from Y596bn to Y600bn.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIKKO Securities, Japan's third largest broker, is apparently in the final
stages of preparing a streamlining programme that may lead to the closing of
domestic and international branches and cuts to its workforce.
The company confirmed yesterday that it will transfer the operations of its
Copenhagen office to London at the end of this month, and merge the business
of the San Francisco office of Nikko Securities International with that of
the Los Angeles office.
Japanese newspapers reported that the company may reduce its 11,000-member
workforce by 1,700 as part of a three-year review programme and that about
10 domestic branches would be closed, but the company did not confirm those
reports.
Most Japanese securities houses are being forced to review staff and branch
numbers, as the continuing weakness of the Tokyo stock market, combined with
the rapid expansion of the industry during the late 1980s, has left
companies with unsustainable personnel costs.
However, in a decision that runs against the tide, Nikko said that two
affiliates, Nikko Research Center and Nikko System Center, would share a new
San Francisco office from January next year to research 'information
technologies'.
The Bank of Tokyo Ltd group has agreed to use Y2.4bn to finance Dainana
Securities, an unlisted brokerage which has been hit by the ongoing stock
market slump, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Dainana will increase its capital through the allocation of new shares to a
third party with the support of the Bank of Tokyo group, a leading Dainana
shareholder.
Dainana will receive payment on September 28.
With the Bank of Tokyo group's financial support, Dainana will be able to
increase its capital by Y1.2bn to about Y3.28bn. Also, Dainana will be able
to raise the percentage of self-owned capital to 200 per cent, and meet
self-owned capital regulations. It is currently down to about 120 per cent,
he added.
The brokerage posted a pre-tax loss of Y2.31bn for the year to March 1992,
due to the sluggish stock market in Japan.
Dainana appointed as president a former Bank of Tokyo official, Mr Yoshiaki
Ara, as a part of its restructuring process supported by the bank.

support krona

<TEXT>
SWEDEN plans to launch an Ecu8bn syndicated loan in the international credit
market as part of the Ecu16bn financing being used to help support the krona
in the foreign exchange markets.
The Swedish currency came under pressure earlier this week after Finland cut
the markka's link with the Ecu, allowing it to float against other
currencies.
Sweden was hit by a sudden outflow of capital, and the Riksbank, the
country's central bank, was forced to pushed its marginal lending rate up to
75 per cent, from 24 per cent, to defend the Swedish currency.
The Riksbank said it would add foreign currency worth up to Ecu16bn to its
foreign exchange reserves, using borrowings made on its own behalf and on
the part of the National Debt Office. The Ecu8bn syndicated loan, being
co-ordinated by JP Morgan, constitutes half this borrowing.
The remainder of the Ecu16bn earmarked for supporting the krona has been
raised already. The National Debt Office said it has drawn on US and
Euro-commercial paper programmes amounting to Dollars 5bn and two standby
credit facilities totalling Dollars 3.4bn, while the Riksbank has drawn on
existing agreements with other central banks.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Stitch-up treatment: Alan Pike asks whether private UK
patients get value for money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a five-day stay in a private hospital, a seriously ill patient died.
When the hospital's Pounds 24,000 bill reached the health insurer, it
included a Pounds 430 item for the patient's late discharge.
Such stories about private hospitals are sometimes laced with exaggeration.
Mr Julian Stainton, managing director of Western Provident Association and
the most vocal critic of lax cost-control in the private-health sector,
insists this one is not. Western Provident, the insurer involved, is
currently in dispute with the hospital over the bill.
This week's announcement that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to
investigate private medical fees raises a wider question. Do purchasers of
private healthcare get value for money in Britain, a country with - in spite
of the debate over whether it is adequately funded - one of the most
impressive 'free' health systems in the world?
The existence of the National Health Service means that, unlike in other
countries, the private sector can be selective, and does not have to provide
a service aimed at the entire population. But recent increases in insurance
premiums, loss of business during the recession and growing competition are
all forcing the private sector to become far more concerned about value for
money.
More than 70 per cent of private hospital treatment is financed from
insurance, which covers about 12 per cent of the population. In their
marketing material, insurers play heavily on the fact that private-health
cover helps take the worry out of being ill.
If you are ill, however, the worry may be over whether your policy will pay
for treatment. This is particularly likely to be a problem if worry made you
ill in the first place - private psychiatry is one area where insurers are
tightening up on claims.
In a bid to contain costs and win a broader social base of customers,
insurers are offering more competitive budget schemes. A single person aged
30 to 34 would pay Pounds 60.18 a month for the fullest cover from Bupa, the
biggest private healthcare group. Norwich Union Healthcare this year
introduced a scheme with exceptionally extensive cover, but it costs a
healthy 30- to 34-year-old more than Pounds 1,000 a year for a scheme
covering areas normally excluded such as infertility, long-term renal
dialysis and pregnancy.
Budget schemes provide much cheaper options than these. But, although paying
less means getting less, customers sometimes fail to appreciate this fully
until they make claims and find they face restrictions on things like the
hospitals they can use.
Expensive advances in medical science are adding to the pressure on the
private sector to control its costs. A third of all operations in private
hospitals are classified as major or complex. PPP, the second-largest
insurer, last year paid out 3,000 claims of more than Pounds 10,000 each,
including one of more than Pounds 100,000.
Critics such as Mr Stainton, however, say that a cavalier attitude towards
charges by some hospitals is also part of the problem. 'You get more
consumer protection when you buy a sandwich on a train than when you enter a
private hospital. British Rail displays a price tariff and will give you an
itemised bill. Don't take it for granted that private hospitals do the
same.'
Mr Stainton scrutinises charges for early admission or late discharge
particularly carefully. Although these are often medically necessary, they
are alleged to be used sometimes by hospitals as a device to top up profits.
Mrs Christine Boardman, from Elgin, Scotland, queried a Pounds 198
late-discharge item on a bill with her insurer, Bupa. She had asked the
hospital if she could remain in her room until her husband collected her
after treatment. 'The room was not serviced and was not needed again that
night,' says Mrs Boardman. 'But Bupa decided that the item was justified and
paid the bill.'
The monopolies commission's investigation arises from fee guidelines for
private work reissued this month by the British Medical Association. These
are only advisory, says the BMA, and Mr Stainton supports them. 'They
provide us with a yardstick for what is reasonable and it is one of the few
areas where we have some basis for cost-control,' he says.
Mr Richard Marcus, a surgeon and member of the BMA council, believes costs
may rise if the guidelines have to be abandoned. He says the private sector
has proved itself too timid at controlling 'maverick' doctors who charge far
above the average.
A study by Laing and Buisson, the healthcare consultant and publisher,
showed that the highest-earning 20 per cent of consultants averaged Pounds
95,000 a year from private practice in 1990. Doctors say such figures are
distorted by the fact that a relatively small number within the 20 per cent
have exceptionally high earnings.
While there is more competition in the health insurance market than for many
years, the delivery end of private healthcare is not subject to normal
competitive pressures. Mrs Boardman sums up the difficulties: 'The choice of
consultant is made by your general practitioner. If that consultant does
private work at only one hospital, that is where you will go.'
Private medicine is a tight world where hospital operators, insurers and
doctors know, even as they squabble, that they depend on each other. There
may, however, be ways of opening up the market to more competition.
Some NHS trust hospitals, for example, plan to use their new independence to
revamp the public sector's rather down-at-heel private-patient facilities
and challenge the independent hospitals.
A next, more significant step would be for NHS managers to encourage their
consultants, who staff the independent hospitals on a part-time basis, to do
all private work on NHS premises. Private hospitals might find it cheaper to
employ their own full-time consultants - under the current arrangements,
some London consultants receive half their income from the private sector in
return for a relatively tiny investment of time.
A still more radical view comes from critics - including a number of junior
doctors - who believe the root of the problem is Britain's medical
establishment, which operates the profession's entry and promotion system in
favour of the status quo.
The government and General Medical Council, the profession's regulatory
body, currently face legal challenges aimed at making it easier for
EC-qualified specialists to practise in Britain. Advocates of the move say
that, if this happened, it would prove the first step towards a more open
market in which the present consultant system would collapse, specialists be
allowed to advertise, and patients approach them directly rather than
through GPs.
Perhaps the most immediate worry for the private sector is survey evidence
that people take out private medical insurance for a single, overwhelming
reason - to avoid having to wait for treatment.
NHS waiting times are often shorter than people realise. If trust hospitals,
prompted by the demands of the Patient's Charter, get this message across
before the private sector can control its costs, there may be difficult
times ahead.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Paler shade of Green: The troubled party's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Green party members were not behaving like an endangered species at the
start of their annual conference on Thursday in the far from green
Wolverhampton Civic Hall. 'One of our functions is to keep the other
political parties sane. Of course we have a future,' said one member,
defiant about the party's recent troubles.
But outside the conference hall many members said they were hurt by the
remarks of Ms Sara Parkin, head of the party until September 20, who claimed
two weeks ago that the Green party had become a liability to green politics.
As well as Ms Parkin, another five of its 11-strong executive are standing
down for various reasons. One of its highest-profile members, Mr Jonathon
Porritt, has also declared that he will no longer take an active part.
The party's rise and fall has been rapid; the question is whether it now
faces extinction. Its membership, at 8,000, has fallen to 1987 levels after
reaching 19,000 in June 1990, shortly after its European elections triumph
when it captured 15 per cent of the vote. Significantly, its following
halved in a period when popular support for green issues and environmental
pressure groups continued to rise.
Some symptoms of its troubles were on display at the conference. Its
members' widespread mistrust of leadership and 'cult of personality' is one
reason its executive has changed so often. 'Better in some ways not to have
a leader - though you have to for political purposes,' said Mr Guy Woodford
from Malvern Hills.
The party's introversion - the agenda contained 25 motions on internal
procedure - has sometimes sat oddly with its policies on the welfare of the
planet. And its pursuit of political correctness, while scrupulous, can be
paralysing. Mr Matthew Patterson of the standing orders committee pleaded
for an amendment to be 'put in language the man in the street can understand
 -ignore the sexism'.
Beyond its control, however, is a wider problem. 'Other parties have stolen
bits of our clothes,' according to Mr Woodford, such as its long-standing
support for catalytic converters on cars.
Perhaps the biggest reason for the membership decline, however, is that many
who joined in 1989 and 1990 misunderstood the character of the party. 'The
European manifesto was not as radical as the party actually is. People were
joining just to save the whale,' said Ms Jo Graham from the party's
Loughborough branch.
She and many others believe membership has simply shrunk back to the
pre-1989 core. Much of that comprises the hippies and anarchists who joined
the party's first incarnation as the People party, along with the peace
movement contingent who joined in the mid-1980s when the Labour party
abandoned its commitment to unilateral disarmament.
At its present level the Green party may have reached equilibrium,
'sustainability' on a small scale, the goal its conference is now
prescribing for many communities. Provided it follows the prudence of its
last executive committee and keeps several tens of thousand pounds in the
bank, it will probably survive as the political expression of those who want
to live a pure green life. But it is wishful thinking for its members to
hope that it can influence other parties as it did after its European
triumph. That threat has shrunk together with its membership.
Instead, greater pressure on mainstream parties is now being exerted by
environmental pressure groups, which now dwarf the Green party in
membership, money and organisation. As the Green party has lost impetus, the
pressure groups have gained momentum, hindered only slightly by the
recession. Friends of the Earth now has more than 200,000 UK supporters and
an annual income that tops Pounds 5m. Greenpeace UK has more than 400,000
supporters and Pounds 4m income; its worldwide network has more than 4m
supporters and expects to receive Dollars 150m this year.
The turning point was 1989-90 when a series of environmental concerns helped
treble their UK membership. For nearly two years the front pages detailed
the death of seals in the North Sea; a salmonella outbreak; the levels of
pesticides and bacteria in water. 'It does tend to be fear that brings
people to green issues at first,' says Ms Parkin. 'In 1989 the environment
was out canvassing - it was delivering the evidence.'
According to Mr Mark Gilden, director of ICD marketing services, a market
research company, 'the profile of people who are interested in these issues
has enormously expanded. The main supporters are directors and professionals
 -the bank manager who keeps his green politics in the cupboard - as well as
the student radicals.'
But unlike the Green party, the pressure groups have held on to their new
members. The groups have also become more sophisticated in their research -
often tracking down obscure government figures. They have become more adept
at recruiting: 'We start them on the whales when they're kids then move them
on to nuclear as they get older,' said one Save the Whale campaigner.
But all groups face the threat of recession, which has stalled or cut into
their income - for example, Greenpeace has just axed its turtle campaign and
may drop work on marine pollution.
According to Mr Porritt, the pressure groups must adapt to 'a change in the
tenor of the debate - business is no longer so hostile. Some of the green
groups have been terribly slow to get involved in discussions of market
mechanisms - such as pollution permits and carbon taxes. The quality of
their research has been better on the problems than the solutions.'
But if green pressure groups can make those changes, they are unlikely to
find the Green party a hindrance, as Ms Parkin feared. Nor are they likely
to need its help - they look set to eclipse it still further.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Turn BES property investment into something
longer-term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From T C VILLIERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When the government decided to revive the private rented housing sector
in 1999, it chose to do so by encouraging individuals to invest through the
Business Expansion Scheme (BES), although the scheme was always designed to
provide equity for companies for five years only. It is now considered that
this period is too short for investment in the housing market and so
attempts are being made to find alternative, longer-term finance, as
described in John Willman's article 'A welcome mat for the rental market',
(September 8).
So far more than Pounds 1bn has been raised from private investors under the
BES and this has cost the government about Pounds 400m in tax relief. All
alternative schemes being proposed include some form of government fiscal
incentive. Yet the BES is to be abolished next year and private investors
putting money into publicly accountable companies are to be cut out as a
funding source.
However, many BES investors might welcome the opportunity of turning their
five-year investment into something longer term. Such a move would prevent
many properties currently owned by BES companies returning to owner
occupation at the end of the period, adding to the market overhang from next
year. Although additional sources of finance will be needed to increase the
amount of housing available for rent, common sense dictates that the
government should begin by maximising the return on its own investment by
encouraging individuals to become long-term investors.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: When praise of Fischer sounds rather hollow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH MC DONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was outraged by Dominic Lawson's attack on the character of Bobby
Fischer ('The dark knight returns, his strange genius undimmed', September
5). His article is an example of why Fischer shuns the press and media so
often. There is a difference between objectively criticising people and
sticking labels on them.
I was especially disgusted to read: ''. . . What is morally degraded can be
aesthetically right.' That telling phrase encapsulates the paradox of Bobby
Fischer.' How dare he say Fischer is morally degraded. Few people in the
press, if any, know anything in particular about the finesses of Fischer's
opinions, motivations or beliefs and are not likely to if they keep on
needlessly insulting him.
Praising the flawless beauty of Bobby's chess moves sounds rather hollow if,
in the same breath, someone slaps an unjust label on the genius who made
them.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Employee shareholder forgotten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAMIAN CARNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The debate on market making in smaller listed companies' shares has,
with the exception of Mr King's letter (September 9), largely forgotten
employee shareholders.
Companies which are relegated to the Bulletin Board may well experience poor
liquidity in their shares. While those that decide to de-list will lose the
ready access to an external market in their shares entirely.
The impact on employees is clear; they will be less likely to participate
in, or value, employee share schemes if they fear they will be left with
unsaleable shares.
Companies keen to maintain or introduce share incentives for employees
should consider setting up an employee share ownership plan (Esop) trust.
The Esop can not only match buyers and sellers but also buy and sell shares
when there is a temporary excess of demand or supply.
If liquidity increases and market-making expands in the shares, the Esop's
role diminishes. If, on the other hand, the company decides to de-list, the
Esop can take the strain of creating the internal market that makes shares
incentives worthwhile.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Bulletin Board share trading not for 'second-class
citizens'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ANDREW HUGH SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Paul King (Letters, September 9) is concerned about whether
companies traded on the London Stock Exchange's Company Bulletin Board are
treated as 'second-class citizens'.
I can reassure Mr King that the exchange does not treat his company - or any
other smaller company - as a second-class citizen. I could also like to put
the record straight on a number of misconceptions that have arisen about the
trading facilities for smaller companies' shares.
The Company Bulletin Board was introduced to provide an effective trading
mechanism for those companies with shares that are traded only sporadically,
and where marketmakers can not profitably commit their capital to providing
a trading facility.
The very name Company Bulletin Board perhaps elicits some of the
misunderstandings about the nature of this service. It is in fact a trading
mechanism that enables investors to display to the market as a whole their
buying or selling orders in each listed security. In addition, the Bulletin
Board displays for each company a table of corporate and historical price
and trading information which is of direct benefit to investors.
The corporate broker, whose name and telephone number is prominently
displayed, is obliged to facilitate trading. He is able to act as principal
to help smooth inconsistencies in order flow, as indeed is any other member
firm trading in Bulletin Board securities. He will also ensure that prices
displayed are a realistic reflection of both supply and demand and the
fundamental value of the company.
In smaller companies generally, there is usually only a relatively small
amount of shares available to be freely traded, the rest being held by
directors, employees and long-term investing institutions. It is precisely
because of these characteristics that marketmakers are finding it
increasingly difficult to operate profitably in this area of the market.
The pattern of trading in Mr King's company's shares is typical of smaller
companies. Around 75 bargains took place during the last year, and one-third
of those trades by value were executed around the announcement of the annual
figures.
Put another way, on average, only two or three investors wished to buy or
sell shares during each fortnightly account period. Marketmakers cannot
stimulate additional business at these levels; they can only execute
naturally arising business. This can be equally well achieved through the
Bulletin Board dealing mechanism.
Finally, the Bulletin Board has already proved that it is an appropriate
trading mechanism for smaller companies' shares.
There is no evidence, from statistics collated to date, that trading levels
are adversely affected by the transition from marketmaking to the Bulletin
Board. We will, of course, continue to review and enhance the service in the
light of experience.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Top pay not matched by performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL GREGG, Dr STEPHEN MACHIN, Dr STEFAN SZYMANSKI and Mr CHRIS
WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With respect to your recent feature on directors' pay ('Salary
restraint hits top earners', September 2) and Mr Vernon-Harcourt's letter
(September 7), the real issue of concern for shareholders and public
policymakers is not the precise percentage increases received by top
directors but whether they are justified by the performance of their
companies.
Our recent study based on a sample of about 300 FT-SE 500 companies between
1982 and 1991 points to the fact that, even in the severe recession
currently hitting the UK economy, pay of top directors has consistently
risen by substantially more than the rate of inflation.
More importantly, any link between growth in top pay and corporate
performance - measured by shareholder returns or earnings per share - was
absent after 1988.
The concern regarding directors' pay awards expressed by the media, academic
commentators and workers' organisations appears to be entirely justified. At
the very least this suggests that the mechanisms by which top directors
receive their pay awards need to be reappraised/reformed in a substantial
manner.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Bush's F-15 ploy clouds BAe Saudi deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, DAVID WHITE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday flew to the electorally important state of
Missouri, to tell workers at the McDonnell Douglas plant in St Louis that he
was authorising the sale of 72 F-15 fighters to Saudi Arabia. The
announcement threw a question mark over whether Saudi Arabia intends to
proceed with purchasing more Tornado strike aircraft from Britain.
A long-awaited deal, estimated at Pounds 4bn, for 48 Tornados and British
Aerospace Hawk light fighters and trainers, is believed to have been
awaiting signature since August.
BAe maintains its prospective deal will be unaffected by Saudi purchases
from the US.
Mr Bush had already hinted that he was likely to approve the sale, but chose
to turn the formal announcement into a rally for his election campaign, as
he did last week when he reversed his policy on arms sales to Taiwan by
approving the sale of F-16 fighters built by General Dynamics in Texas.
Missouri, though it has fewer electoral votes than Texas, is similarly
viewed as critical to Mr Bush's chances of winning re-election. The Dollars
9bn sale is expected to provide 40,000 jobs and affect the economies of 45
states.
Although Israel and its supporters in the US have in the past objected to
the sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia, administration officials say they do not
expect strong opposition from the Israeli government.
Saudi Arabia initially opted for the Anglo-German-Italian Tornado in the
mid-1980s when it was barred from purchasing the F-15E, the two-seat,
long-range strike version of the US jet.
It renewed its request for F-15Es in 1989 and again last year, after the
Gulf war, asking for 48 of the strike version and 24 two-seat
air-superiority fighters.
The White House said the Saudis would get F-16XP models, less capable than
the F-15E, which is only flown by the US Air Force.
McDonnell Douglas has been anxious that Congress should notified within the
next few days in order to obtain approval this year.
Although Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, has given
qualified backing for the sale, the next opportunity for congressional
approval would not be expected to arise before the spring.
The US State Department yesterday announced its decision to waive
restrictions on the export of six satellite projects to China, Reuter
reports. They include the APSAT, Asiasat 2, Intelsat VIIA, STARSAT,
Afriastar and Dong Fang Hong 3 satellite projects.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 15 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group (APEC) have
decided to put the organisation on a more permanent footing by setting up a
small secretariat in Singapore.
The decision was reached in Bangkok, at the group's fourth annual
ministerial meeting, which ended yesterday. The ministers also agreed a
programme to prepare for regional trade liberalisation and issued a
statement calling for a speedy end to the Uruguay Round of world trade
talks, held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
APEC, set up in 1989, comprises the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and the six members of the
Association of South East Asian Nations - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
Members say its main value has been its regular consultations and studies on
matters such as compiling regional trade data.
The decision to site the secretariat in Singapore is partly to quell worries
in south-east Asia that the smaller nations will be dominated in APEC by
Japan, the US and other economic powers.
The Uruguay Round statement issued yesterday includes calls for the major
economies in particular to settle their differences, and for countries such
as the US to refrain from taking unilateral retaliation against countries
deemed to be trading unfairly.
Mr Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, said yesterday he had been
assured by US officials that the Bush administration would push for a
Uruguay Round settlement some time between the French referendum on
Maastricht and the US presidential elections in November.

FT  12 SEP 92 / US election is Clinton's to lose: Jurek Martin assesses the
first week of the presidential campaign proper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR adviser to Mr Bill Clinton, speaking delicately off the record this
week, said: 'I'm sure George Bush can't win this election now, but we can
still lose it.' This assessment would probably find agreement, also
unattributably, in the Bush campaign. The first week of what might be
described as the home stretch of the campaign, beginning on Labour Day last
Monday, offered plenty of hints as to the tactics of both sides.
Two issues dominated the week - the economy and the truthfulness of both
candidates. On the first, there is a universal assumption that the economy
itself cannot come to Mr Bush's rescue. If the third quarter GNP returns, to
be announced a week before election day, show growth at less than 1 per
cent, as may happen and as the Clinton camp, looking for last-minute
ammunition, not so secretly hopes, then that will put the seal on what is
already evident.
It explains why the thrust of President Bush's economic address in Detroit
on Thursday was all about the future. It was also couched in general terms
except for its explicit linkage of US performance to the growth of the
global economy and free trade. Mr Bush said afterwards this was the most
important aspect of his speech.
It was, in essence, an attempt to turn weakness into strength. Never mind
the present, Mr Bush was saying, your future is in better hands with a man
who understands the global picture than with one who would merely impose
bigger domestic government and higher taxes.
It did not exactly help the presentation that the White House made an awful
hash of clarifying one of the president's more strident promises on
Wednesday - not to raise taxes 'ever, ever', a phrase that will surely haunt
him in the weeks ahead as much as his 1988 'read my lips, no new taxes'.
But at least Mr Bush was saying something positive about the economy. His
surrogates were also saying a lot of negative things about Mr Clinton's
character, specifically his not always consistent explanations of how he
avoided military service, and this, in turn, puts the Democratic candidate's
team on the spot.
It wants the debate to remain firmly focused on the economy. This is what Mr
Clinton spent a lot of the week doing, talking about how 'to end welfare as
we know it' - through a Dollars 24bn four-year programme of tax credits and
private and community sector employment - and about retraining, particularly
in the defence industry. His campaign is convinced the electorate wants to
hear what precise policies are in store, always a Clinton strength.
Some advisers think that to counter Mr Bush's incessant labelling of their
candidate as a man who enjoys increasing taxes, much more should be heard of
his proposals to lower them on the middle classes and about how he would
reduce the federal deficit, on which he is said privately to be an economic
hawk.
But that is not their great fear. Their fear is that he will be sidetracked,
as he was briefly this week, into a slanging match, fending off charges
about the draft with counterblasts at Mr Bush's alleged involvement in
Iran-Contra and the re-arming of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The concern here is
twofold: that to engage in such exchanges will only highlight Mr Clinton's
character and the suspicion that past foreign entanglements by the president
do not really interest the public. Absent a smoking gun, neither Iraq nor
Iran-gate yet equals Watergate; lying to Congress is widely seen as routine.
The Bush week, in both its positive and negative respects and excepting the
tax pledge mess, bore all the hallmarks of Mr James Baker, now in full
control of the campaign. Mr David Broder, austere political columnist of the
Washington Post, complained bitterly that it was typically Bakeresque that
'the public must lose its chance to hear a serious discussion about the
nation's future'.
Mr Baker certainly seemed to have put an end to a lot of presidential talk
about traditional family values, a non-winner according to all the polls. It
was surprising, therefore, that Mr Bush took himself off to Virginia last
night for a speech to the Rev Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition, which
thinks that gays of both sexes are conspiring with liberal perverts to
undermine the nation's moral fibre. Mr Robertson, however, might be good at
getting out the conservative vote.
The final Baker touch, so irksome to Mr Broder, was his prevarication over
the format of the upcoming presidential debates. The suspicion is that he
does not want Mr Bush exposed to a one-on-one with Mr Clinton in the
presence of a single self-effacing moderator but would prefer the presence
of grandstanding journalists asking outlandish 'character' questions because
they pose a greater potential threat to Mr Clinton.
There will be two or three debates in the end, because Mr Bush needs them.
Ms Elaine Kamarck, who advises Mr Clinton, probably got it right when she
said the announcement of debates tended to turn the public off the campaign
in the days before they take place. Mr Baker, she pointed out, needed to
keep Mr Bush moving, and on the offensive, all the time. Freezing opinion
with him ten points behind did not make sense. Such was not the
characteristic of the first week. With both candidates invoking President
Harry Truman at every turn, it hardly could have been.

FT  12 SEP 92 / De Klerk calls for early summit with Mandela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's President F W de Klerk yesterday welcomed the decision by Mr
Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, to attend an emergency
summit on violence.
'What is now of critical importance ..is that we should meet as urgently as
possible,' Mr de Klerk said after meeting senior ministers. He said the
constitutional development minister, Mr Roelf Meyer, would discuss a time
and venue for the meeting with ANC secretary-general Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.
Mr Ramaphosa said on Thursday the ANC would refuse to attend such a meeting
until the government had taken steps to meet certain conditions. But he left
open the possibility of negotiating around the conditions. These included
releasing 400 prisoners whom the ANC claims are political prisoners, as well
as banning the carrying of dangerous weapons in public and implementing
measures to prevent the use of single-sex hostels to launch attacks on
surrounding black townships.
Yesterday government officials rejected the ANC conditions, but observers
nevertheless expected both sides to find a way of allowing the talks to take
place.
The ANC and the government seem set for a test of wills over these issues,
which had been under discussion for some weeks before the Ciskei massacre.
The ANC judges that its bargaining position has been strengthened after the
events in Ciskei, which have been condemned worldwide, and that it can use
this added leverage to force an agreement on the release of political
prisoners.
The government is hoping to enlist the international community to pressure
the ANC into attending the violence summit, without making any further major
concessions on the prisoners.
Action cannot be delayed indefinitely, however, as the ANC made clear
yesterday it would pursue its campaign against anti-ANC homeland leaders by
marching next weekend on the capital of the Bophuthatswana black homeland,
ruled by President Lucas Mangope, one of the organisation's most bitter
rivals.
ANC officials said they would adopt a less confrontational strategy than in
Ciskei, where 28 people were shot dead by security forces after marchers
deviated from their permitted route. But the potential for violent conflict
in Bophuthatswana remains high.
Meanwhile business welcomed the ANC's decision to attend talks on violence.
'Even a conditional positive response by the ANC alliance to renew
high-level negotiations could have an early favourable impact on business
confidence,' South African Chamber of Business Director Raymond Parsons said
in a statement.
The South African Defence Force yesterday said the armed wing of the ANC was
plotting to kill Ciskei homeland leader Brigadier Oupa Gqozo.
The ANC denied the allegation, saying the organisation was 'in no way
planning to assassinate Gqozo. We reject the charge as false propaganda.'
General George Meiring, the South African army chief said the ANC, which
formally suspended its armed struggle when it was legalised in February
1990, appeared to be stockpiling arms in the region. The cache included a
rocket launcher and Ciskei security force uniforms, he said.
'Since the tragedy (on Monday), Ciskei is experiencing violence on a scale
not seen in a long time,' General Meiring said. 'At least 15 houses
belonging to members of the Ciskei defence force and police have been
burned.'

THE Bank of Japan yesterday moved quickly to dampen expectations of a cut in
interest rates after the central bank's quarterly survey showed a severe
deterioration in business conditions.
A bank official said the Tankan, or short term economic survey, was in line
with central bank expectations and would not prompt a review of monetary
policy.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was sharply down for most of the day, fell
further following publication of the report.
The Nikkei average finished the day down 800.78 points at 18,107.69.
The survey painted the picture of a deeply depressed economy with few signs
of an immediate turnaround.
The closely-watched index of business conditions in manufacturing fell from
 24 in May to -37 last month.
Just as important, the index for non-manufacturing plunged from 1 to -13,
reflecting sharp deterioration in construction, retailing and other
services.
The survey was conducted after the central bank cut interest rates by half a
point to 3.25 per cent in late July, but before a Y10,700bn (Pounds 44bn)
emergency economic programme was announced on August 28.
Excess stock levels continued to build during the quarter, with the index of
inventories rising from 32 to 38.
The rise points to a further steep decline in industrial output in the
months ahead as companies try to reduce stocks of unsold goods at a time
when consumer spending is cooling rapidly.
A central bank official said that company efforts to reduce stocks would be
completed by the end of the year, although the bank has been consistently
over-optimistic this year about the pace of inventory adjustment.
Pre-tax profits are expected to be down by 12 per cent in the current fiscal
year for manufacturing companies, and 8.5 per cent for non-manufacturers.
Manufacturers are expecting a 30.2 per cent decline in the first half of the
year, followed by a 10.4 per cent rise in the second half.
The central bank said the rise was predicated on a recovery of the economy
expected to begin in the new year.
Large enterprises revised capital spending plans downward by 0.6 percentage
points during the quarter, with planned spending down by 2.8 per cent this
fiscal year compared to last year.
Manufacturing investment is expected to be down by 10.4 per cent, while
non-manufacturing investment, excluding public utilities will be flat.
This will be compensated for partly by a planned 7.8 per cent rise in public
utility investment.
Ratios of financial liquidity declined, although the central bank said these
were still high by historic standards.
Small enterprises planned to slash capital spending by 22.5 per cent this
year, although the size of the decline is expected to be more moderate as
companies finalise plans.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Hong Kong speculates over Patten's flying visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten is to make a flying visit to London on Tuesday for
discussions with Mr John Major, the prime minister, on the issues he plans
to raise in his first key policy address as Hong Kong's governor on October
7.
Mr Patten's planned speech has generated considerable speculation in the
colony, particularly on the approach he will take to the development of
democracy in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China
in 1997.
Some officials expect him to announce changes to Hong Kong's political
institutions and a widening of the scope of democracy, though perhaps
without altering the pace, previously agreed with China, of direct elections
to the Legislative Council.
Mr Patten's visit was arranged at short notice at his request, according to
Hong Kong government officials. He will arrive on Tuesday morning and leave
for Hong Kong the same evening. The meeting was interpreted positively in
Hong Kong as underlining Hong Kong's rising position on the agenda of the
government in London.
Negotiations with China on the financing of Hong Kong's new airport are
expected to be another topic in the talks with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd is expected to meet Qian Qichen, China's
foreign minister, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York later
this month.
Uncertainty about Mr Patten's plans for democracy is widely thought to have
been a factor delaying Chinese approval of the airport financing plans.
However, there were signs of progress on the airport this week when China
made a new proposal which the Hong Kong government said it would examine
seriously. It is important for Mr Major that the airport plans proceed
smoothly, because his visit to Beijing last year to sign a memorandum of
understanding on the airport was the price for securing China's agreement to
let the project go ahead.
The airport is planned to open before British sovereignty over Hong Kong
ends in 1997, but this target could be in danger if the financing plans are
delayed much longer. The joint Sino-British airport committee is expected to
meet again on Wednesday to discuss China's latest proposals.
British government officials could make no comment yesterday on the agenda
for Mr Patten's talks.
Among issues in Mr Patten's policy statement, one area of possible change is
expected to be the structure of the Executive Council (Exco), now the
equivalent of a cabinet, appointed by the governor. Exco members have
offered their resignations, allowing Mr Patten the possibility of splitting
the executive from the legislature and turning the former into a purely
advisory body.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Trade surplus grows as import demand weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus in August rose 31.6 per cent on a year earlier to
Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 3.8bn), as demand for imports continued to weaken and
China surpassed Germany as the country's third largest trading partner.
The Ministry of Finance said the increase in the surplus was due to an
appreciation of the Japanese currency. In yen terms, exports were marginally
lower, but imports fell by 7.7 per cent, reflecting the slowing of the
domestic economy.
In dollar terms, Japan's exports rose by 6.9 per cent to Dollars 26.5bn and
imports fell 0.4 per cent to Dollars 19bn. Seasonally-adjusted, exports fell
2.8 per cent from a month earlier to Dollars 28.2bn, while imports were down
5 per cent to Dollars 19.5bn.
The most striking increase in exports was in semiconductor equipment, which
rose 12.3 per cent in apparent response to improvement in the US computer
market and as a result of falling demand in the domestic market.
Similarly, steel exports increased 12.9 per cent by volume, though only 2.7
per cent by value, as leading steel makers sought replacement markets for
their products. Motorcyle exports rose 17.9 per cent by volume and 20.3 per
cent by value.
Exports to the US rose by 2.9 per cent to Dollars 7.74bn, while imports fell
7.4 per cent to Dollars 4.2bn, leaving a surplus of Dollars 3.5bn, up from
Dollars 2.9bn in the same month last year.
Meanwhile, Japan's exports to the EC rose 10.2 per cent to Dollars 4.7bn and
imports edged 0.3 per cent higher to Dollars 2.5bn.
The largest increases in exports to the EC were in car parts (up 36.7 per
cent), integrated circuits (up 18.3 per cent), office machinery (17.7 per
cent), and passenger cars (15 per cent).
Each of these Japanese industries is reporting slower sales and falling
profits in the domestic market.
Trade with China continued to expand sharply, with exports from Japan 26.6
per cent higher and imports rising 29.7 per cent. Another sign of increased
demand from the fast growing southern Chinese economy was a 30.9 per cent
increase in exports to Hong Kong.
The consistently large increases in trade with China sees that country on
the verge of becoming Japan's second largest trading partner, a position
that it is likely to consolidate in coming months. A year ago, China was the
fifth largest partner, behind the US, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Marseillais find little to sing about in Maastricht:
Treaty's effects in dispute in France's second city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXACTLY 200 years ago, the people of Marseilles first heard a performance of
the republican hymn which France was to adopt as its national anthem.
The port city's first performance of the Marseillaise was sung at a banquet
in an elegant neo-classical hall in the rue Thubaneau. The building, now
filthy and peeling, is today used as a Turkish bath, run by Nol-el-Dine
Benaziza, a sad-eyed, 34-year-old Algerian.
In a way, the building symbolises the changes facing Marseilles. For fears
of the death of a republican France of the type portrayed in the
Marseillaise, growing unemployment and the problems of a big immigrant
population are at the centre of Marseilles city dwellers' concerns as they
approach the referendum on European monetary and political union in just
over a week.
The Hamam, opened by Mr Benaziza's family during the second world war,
serves the Moslem population of a squalid ghetto in the centre of France's
second largest city, where a fifth of the population are immigrants.
The rue Thubaneau, a gloomy chasm with cracked and bulging walls, is one of
half a dozen streets in the Porte d'Aix quarter that has been left out of
the city authorities' renovation drive, a reminder of the deep divisions
which have emerged in recent years between the French and the immigrant
population.
Mr Benaziza has no right to vote, but he wants the Maastricht Treaty to go
through because he thinks it will improve security in his area, a centre for
crime and prostitution. Maastricht is unlikely to improve the policing of
Marseilles, but Mr Benaziza is not alone in having his own interpretation of
the treaty.
Among those who do have the right to vote, by contrast, suspicion of
Maastricht and its consequences runs high. A typical example is Mr Florentin
Andre, a supporter of the extreme right-wing National Front (FN), who drives
a taxi around the Porte d'Aix area.
A fake Rolex glitters on Mr Florentin's wrist as he fulminates: 'We have had
enough of these immigrants. They don't work, they take our social security
payments, then marry a French person to increase their rights. Believe me, I
know. We drivers see the city day and night - it is as if we were the
concierges of the city.'
Mr Jean-Claide Remedjian, his brother-in-law and another FN supporter, adds:
'I will vote No twice, with both my right and my left hand.'
They speak for an important minority in Marseilles, given that the FN won
nearly a quarter of the vote in the Provence Alpes Cotes d'Azur region of
which the port city is the capital, in last March's regional elections.
On both sides, French and immigrant, feelings about Maastricht are confused.
A striking number do not know, or even want to know, what the treaty is
about. Lucie Perault, 67, a Gaullist voter who runs a fruit and vegetable
stall in the Marche des Capucins, says she has not read the treaty but will
vote no because she thinks the project will drive up unemployment. She is
worried about her university-age grandchildren, who cannot find jobs.
A group of Senegalese factory workers, taking a morning smoke outside their
hostel in Bellevue (an unsuitable name for this ugly run-down suburb),
confess to having no clue what the fuss is about, even though some of them
have lived in France for 30 years.
Down in the port, France's largest, people appear a little better informed.
A good example is Mr Christian Savino, who reads a circular on monetary
union in his office at a dockside warehouse. Competition from cheaper ports
across Europe has hit Marseilles hard in recent years, but Mr Savino feels
confident that his family's fruit transport business can face the future.
'I am for the opening of barriers. I don't see why the port should not
profit from it,' he says. 'The problem is that the French government
campaign has been handled badly and come too late. People round here don't
believe what the politicians say any more.'
A few hundred yards away, a group of dockers loading containers on a
Corsican cargo ship appear as divided on the treaty as the rest of the
French public.
'It is just for capitalists. There is nothing in it for us,' says Mr
Alexandre Hettak, a left-wing voter in charge of a team of 20 dockers. 'It
should bring social conditions to the highest level in Europe, but instead
conditions will fall to the lowest level.'
As a mark of how deeply Marseilles' dockworkers feel their livelihoods to be
threatened, it is one of the few ports still to hold out against the French
government's attempt to reform its 45-year-old dock labour scheme in line
with cheaper European competition.
Mr Hettak's colleague, Mr Jean-Pierre Roche, is by contrast a fervent
Maastricht supporter. More growth in competition for the port, closer
European economic integration - these things are inevitable, he argues. 'We
might as well share round the cake, otherwise we will all go hungry,' he
adds.
In Marseilles, as in France generally, the referendum campaign has sparked
off an intense but deeply muddled debate. Among the colourful cosmopolitan
crowds milling around the harbour front, the outcome is evenly balanced.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Germans warned of health spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has too many doctors and too many hospital beds, and consumes far
too many medicines, Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, declared
yesterday.
As a result, government subsidies for the health service will almost double
in the current year, from DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) in 1991 to more than
DM10bn in 1992, he warned the German parliament.
Figures published yesterday showed that west Germans in 1990 spent DM304bn
on their health, or almost 10 per cent of gross national product. Per
capita, that meant spending DM4,770, an increase of 9.7 per cent over 1989.
Mr Seehofer insisted yesterday that the health service and pharmaceutical
industry must share cuts of DM8.2bn, while patients will contribute DM3.2bn
in increased charges.
However, he has agreed to set up working groups with doctors' organisations,
and the opposition Social Democrats, to reach consensus on the plan.
The plan tabled in the Bundestag provides for a 5 per cent cut in
pharmaceutical prices from next January, strict limits on the quantity of
medicines doctors may prescribe, and a limit on the number of new doctors to
be registered with the state-subsidised health insurance schemes. There
would also be increased charges to patients for hospital care and
prescriptions.
Mr Seehofer said Germany had the second highest density of doctors per
capita in Europe. 'In the next eight years we expect a further 22,000
doctors to be registered, and yet probably we will not get any healthier.'
He added that neighbouring Denmark, with as high a life expectancy as
Germany, consumed only one-fifth of the medicines per capita. He also said
far too many patients who could be cared for at home, or be treated as
outpatients, were kept in hospital.
The result of Germany's health boom was that contributions to health
insurance now consume 13 per cent of average incomes, and would rise to 15
per cent by the end of 1994 without the savings planned.
Mr Seehofer's offer of talks was welcomed by the Social Democrats, but the
opposition is determined to limit the effect on patients.
The German government yesterday announced the establishment of four working
groups to bring together government, industry, trade unions, the federal
states and local government in preparing a 'solidarity pact' to revive the
German economy, Quentin Peel reports.
The groups will consider measures to improve the competitiveness of German
industry and to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Russia and Ukraine set for big grain purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and Ukraine, the largest of the former Soviet states, will make big
grain purchases on the world market this year - though these are expected to
be down on last year following a better harvest than originally forecast.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday said that the grain harvest would
be 110m tonnes, requiring imports of 7m-15m tonnes - a large drop on last
year's level of 25m tonnes. The figure followed a briefing from Mr Leonid
Chechinsky, the Grain Board chairman, to the effect that the harvest would
be a good one and that the yield per hectare would be some 2.1 tonnes,
higher than for the past five years.
However, a western agricultural expert in Moscow warned that the break-up of
the Soviet Union and the increasing difficulties faced by transport services
put the storage and distribution of the grain at risk.
Russia has made desperate efforts to secure hard currency to continue
repaying agricultural credits advanced by Canada - second only to the US in
exports of grain, with an average of 5m tonnes a year. Canada, which
extended CDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 625m) in credits to the former USSR, cut off
shipments in August after non-payment of arrears, but has since resumed
exports and says it will continue to offer credits this year.
Mr Vitold Fokin, prime minister of Ukraine, said yesterday that Ukraine
would again need to import 11m tonnes of grain, even though the 40m tonne
harvest expected is above average. State purchases of grain from farms are
still running below required levels, in spite of increases in the prices
paid to an average of Rbs12,000 a tonne - with hard wheat commanding up to
Rbs24,000 a tonne in some areas, notably the Urals.
Mr Alexander Romashko, a senior official in the Agriculture Ministry, said
yesterday purchases were now proving more difficult as farms hoarded their
grain in expectation of still higher prices.
Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of Russia's powerful state enterprise lobby,
yesterday presented President Boris Yeltsin with his most explicit ultimatum
yet to slow the pace of radical reforms or face the full might of factory
directors, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
Mr Volsky, also a leader of the Civic Union opposition group which includes
the country's vice-president, said that unless he got a 'positive response'
to a 13-point list of demands by November, he would convene a conference of
industrial managers.
The demands included reducing the tax burden on enterprises to stem a fall
in production and price and wage controls.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is taking a 35 per cent
stake in a new bank to provide long-term project finance in Russia, writes
Peter Norman.
The EBRD board this week approved participation in the Moscow-based Russian
Project Finance Bank, which will provide corporate and project finance. The
bank will have an initial capital of Dollars 6m, which will rise to Dollars
100m (Pounds 50.7m) after two years. It will be headed by Mr Sergei
Konyachev, former managing director of the Moscow Narodny bank in London.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC officials yesterday responded cautiously to the Danish Social Democratic
party's proposals for a compromise with the European Community on the
Maastricht treaty, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
A senior EC official said the proposals marked a first step towards a common
effort aimed at meeting Danish objections to the treaty, following the
rejection of Maastricht in last June's referendum in Denmark.
'It is just the beginning of the negotiation process,' an official in
Brussels said. Informal talks are already under way in talks between Denmark
and the British presidency.
Talks will gather pace when the Danish government publishes its White Paper
on Maastricht after the French referendum on September 20.
The key question is whether the EC and Denmark can agree on how to proceed
before January 1, when the treaty is to come into force. Without an
agreement - or at least a wide-ranging consensus at the Edinburgh summit of
the 12 members in December - Denmark risks being left in legal limbo.
EC officials said some of the Danish proposals, notably the affirmation that
they would not send soldiers to serve in a future European army, were
uncontroversial, since this was not required under the Maastricht treaty.
Brussels officials said negotiations between the 11 members and Denmark were
bound to become tense if the French approve the Maastricht treaty. EC states
such as Spain and Italy will want to press ahead with ratification, while
the Danish government wants more time to prepare public opinion.
'The timing is extremely delicate,' said a senior EC official.
Another difficulty identified in Brussels is Britain's sympathetic attitude
to the Danish predicament.

</HEADLINE>

   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations and EC officials and the leaders of the new Yugoslavia
yesterday agreed to start placing heavy weapons in Bosnia-Hercegovina under
international supervision today.
But western diplomats last night said it was unrealistic to believe that
Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, would hand over their weapons if
forces loyal to the Bosnian government refuse to comply with the agreement.
Serb forces laying siege to Bihac fired artillery shells into the Bosnian
town last night.
'There is no let-up in the fighting around Sarajevo,' a UN official said
after visiting the Bosnian capital on Thursday with Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's
special envoy, and Lord Owen, the EC's mediator. They are joint chairmen of
the Geneva talks on the former Yugoslavia.
The agreement, signed by the UN, the EC, Mr Milan Panic, and Mr Dobrica
Cosic, prime minister and president respectively of the new Yugoslavia, also
included other measures aimed at implementing decisions taken at last
month's London Conference.
But they were not signed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Vance
said the lengthy communique was 'not submitted to Mr Milosevic' and it was
not necessary to obtain his approval.
Mr Milosevic had a working lunch with Mr Vance, but he was not invited to a
dinner last night with senior UN, EC, and Yugoslav officials.
The agreement, which contained several vague commitments, also referred to
the 'desirability' of sending international monitors to Bosnia-Hercegovina's
borders as a means of stemming the flow of weapons to Bosnian, Serbian and
Croatian forces fighting in Bosnia. But no mention was made about how many,
or when they would be sent.
Croatia and Serbia have together already seized large swathes of territory
in Bosnia, leaving the Moslem Bosnian community, which makes up 43 per cent
of the 4.3m population, with less than 10 per cent of the republic.
The agreement also said that 'in principle', observers would monitor the
airfields. But again, no mention was specifically made about when, how, and
if the monitors would be deployed in Serbia and Montenegro, the two
republics which constitute the rump Yugoslavia and which have been accused
of supplying weapons to Bosnia's Serb forces.
Moreover, despite a specific reference in the London Conference documents,
UN, EC and Yugoslav officials yesterday did not refer to closing down
Bosnia's air-space to the use of all military aircraft.
Although the agreement also condemned the policy of 'ethnic cleansing' - the
forcible deportation of civilians from Bosnia - and said that documents
forcing them to give up their property were invalid, no mention was made
about how the 2m refugees forced to leave their homes could return.
In addition, last night's agreement did not specify when the main road
between Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and Belgrade, the Serbian capital,
would be opened. Instead, it said the route would be opened soon.
It was closed after fighting broke out in Croatia in July 1991.
Lord Owen will today fly back to London to meet EC foreign ministers, while
Mr Vance will continue holding talks with Yugoslav officials.
Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, yesterday appointed five new
cabinet ministers in an effort to strengthen the federal government at the
expense of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Ilija Djukic, ambassador to China, was named foreign minister, replacing
Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, who on Thursday resigned after accusing Mr Panic of
betraying Serbian interests. The other appointments included the posts of
finance, agricultural and transport ministers. Mr Panic kept the defence
portfolio.
The sackings were the latest in a series of moves by Mr Panic to weaken Mr
Milosevic's power base. The Belgrade-born California businessman has so far
wrested control of the federal army and the Interior Ministry from the
Serbian president.

MR Arkady Volsky, the head of Russia's powerful state enterprise lobby,
yesterday presented President Boris Yeltsin with his most explicit ultimatum
yet to go easy on radical reforms or face the full might of factory
directors.
But while he accepted that hyperinflation could result from his demands, Mr
Yeltsin yesterday hit out at 'supporters of cheap credit and unrealistic
social programmes' who were pushing the country into 'this abyss'.
Mr Yeltsin also attacked the policies advocated by Mr Viktor Gerashchenko,
acting central bank chairman, saying the central bank should either be made
independent of parliament or put directly under the government's control.
Mr Volsky, also a leader of the Civic Union opposition group which includes
the country's vice-president, said that unless he got a 'positive response'
to a 13-point list of demands by November, he would convene a conference of
industrial managers.
Apart from reducing the tax burden on enterprises to stem a fall in
production, the demands included the creation of integrated groups of
companies rather than demonopolisation, price and wage controls, and cross
shareholdings between enterprises 'as in Japan'.
Confused comments from Prof Yevgeny Yasin, the Civic Union's chief
economist, who also advises the government, were revealing of the chaos of a
group which calls itself a constructive opposition.
Prof Yasin said the government had to 'save' industry from devastating
rationalisation but must also tighten its financial policy to avoid
hyperinflation. He said investment was vital but could only take place with
inflation down to 3-5 per cent a month - a level, coinciding with
International Monetary Fund targets, which he has described as impossible to
reach this year.
His deputy, Mr Sergei Alexashenko did not agree that hyperinflation was to
be avoided at all costs. 'Argentina was able to invest in conditions of
hyperinflation and so would we.'

A FORMULA which could resolve the impasse caused by Denmark's 'No' to the
Maastricht treaty has been put forward by the opposition Danish Social
Democratic party (SDP).
The minority Conservative-Liberal coalition needs the support of the SDP -
the largest party in the eight-party Folketing (parliament) - for any
agreement with the Community.
The SDP's plan would require a special arrangement under which Denmark would
participate in European union with exemptions in important areas such as
monetary policy and defence.
In particular, the SDP blueprint comes out against Danish membership of the
Western European Union, the nine-member European security group conceived as
eventually organising common European defence.
The proposals, to be formally approved at the SDP's quadrennial congress
tomorrow, are likely to be a crucial ingredient of any deal over Denmark's
future relationship with the EC.
Suggesting substantial common ground between government and opposition, Mr
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, described the SDP plan as 'very
realistic'. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said: 'It goes in the
right direction.'
The Danish proposals, which will be worked out in detail later this autumn,
have been made necessary by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in its
referendum on June 2.
Assuming that France approves the treaty on September 20, the EC will need
to work out a deal with Denmark - involving a new referendum next year -
before the treaty can go into effect.
Many of the SDP's reservations concern key areas of future EC policies.
However, provided France votes Yes, the Community is likely to show
considerable willingness to countenance Danish 'opt-outs' to allow a
face-saving Maastricht compromise.
As well as opposition to common European defence - laid down under
Maastricht as a future goal of inter-governmental co-operation - the SDP
document reaffirms Denmark's refusal to commit itself to a common European
currency.
During treaty negotiations, Denmark already reserved its position on
economic and monetary union (Emu), by making its participation in the final
phase of Emu conditional on a further referendum.
Among other demands, the SDP favours an assurance from the EC that Denmark
decides its own social welfare policies. It wants clarification of the
'subsidiarity' principle, laying down that decision-making should be made at
the lowest level of government.
It also seeks safeguards against erosion of influence of the small member
states in EC institutions.
Additionally, the SDP also rejects the concept of European citizenship - put
forward in the Maastricht treaty in connection with voting rights in
countries of residence of citizens of other EC members.
However, since Denmark already allows foreigners to vote in its local
elections after three years' residence, this SDP stipulation is unlikely to
represent an important obstacle to Community acceptance.

FT  12 SEP 92 / New bank to finance Russian projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is taking a 35 per cent
stake in a new bank to provide long-term project finance in Russia.
The EBRD board this week approved participation in the Russian Project
Finance Bank, a Moscow-based institution which will provide much-needed
corporate finance and project finance in the former Soviet republic.
The bank will have an initial capital of Dollars 6m, which will rise to
Dollars 100m (Pounds 50.7m) after two years. It is starting operations with
a staff of 30, some of whom are non-Russian experts seconded by western
banking institutions. The bank should employ 125 people by the end of its
second year.
Ten Russian banks and enterprises will hold stakes amounting to 49 per cent
of the bank's capital, while the remaining 16 per cent of the bank will be
reserved for the bank's staff under a share ownership scheme. The EBRD hopes
to attract western institutions as investors in the bank and will pare back
its holding accordingly over time.
The project is the brain-child of Mr Sergei Konyachev, aged 37, a former
managing director of the Moscow Narodny bank in London, who will be the new
bank's first president.
The project has involved a significant international effort. The European
Commission will provide staff training worth around Ecu7m (Pounds 5.1m).
As well as providing medium- and long-term credits, the new bank will carry
out treasury and capital market operations.
The bank's first chairman comes from the EBRD. He is Mr David Hexter, head
of the financial institutions group of the EBRD's merchant banking division.
He joined the EBRD recently after working for many years on eastern Europe
for Citibank, the US bank.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Bank of Japan sees bleak economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN stared a real recession squarely in the face yesterday.
The country's leading steelmakers forecast sharply lower profits, securities
houses announced plans for streamlining and the stock market again lost
confidence - along with 4.2 per cent of its value.
The bleak mood was drawn in more detail by the Bank of Japan, which released
its quarterly economic survey of enterprises. The bank found business
confidence across the economy sagging badly since its last survey in May,
with the manufacturers' index falling from - 24 to - 37.
The outlooks for profits, sales and investment were all down. The only
category rising was inventories, the index for which rose from 32 to 38,
pointing to a sharp decline in industrial production in the months ahead.
The survey was reinforced by Nippon Steel's forecast of a 74.6 per cent drop
in pre-tax profits for the half year ending this month. Most other
steelmakers announced similar declines in profits. More important, the
industry said it was preparing to seek government subsidies for 'employment
adjustment'. This is the euphemism for transferring workers to subsidiaries,
asking workers at idle factories to stay at home until business improves,
retraining workers, and, as a last resort, sacking them.
Mr Takeshi Noda, economic planning minister, gave clear notice of what lay
ahead when he said: 'We are one step before entering into the phase of
employment adjustment.'
Job losses have so far been relatively few. But with consumer demand waning,
output falling, inventories growing and profits plunging, many economists
say it is only a matter of time before the manufacturing sector contracts
with big job losses.
Mr Paul Summerville, economist at Jardine Fleming Securities, expects
manufacturing employment to decline by 3 per cent in the next year, based on
the current decline in industrial output. This means half a million workers
could be on the streets. They are unlikely to stay there long, however,
given Japan's steep rise in public investment that will start next year as
part of the government's Y10,700bn (Pounds 44bn) emergency economic package
announced two weeks ago. But in the meantime many industries will face tough
times.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Lowest inflation for 4 years fails to revive pound: Industry
chiefs call for boost to demand - Tarmac closes four plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday moved closer to the government's goal of zero inflation as
official figures showed that prices in the 12 months to August rose by 3.6
per cent, the smallest annual increase for more than four years.
But the good news on inflation failed to boost the flagging pound, which
closed last night less than 1 1/2 pfennigs above its DM2.7780 floor in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
As Mr John Major, the prime minister, welcomed the drop in inflation,
Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and materials group, gave a harsh
reminder of the country's current woes. The company said it was to close
four plants and cut brick and concrete block production sharply in response
to the construction industry's problems.
The 0.1 per cent rise in retail prices last month was the smallest increase
in any August since 1982. The 3.6 per cent inflation rate in the 12 months
to August compared with 3.7 per cent in the year to July.
The rate of price increases excluding mortgage interest payments - often
taken as a measure of underlying inflation - dropped to 4.2 per cent from
4.4 per cent, the lowest annual figure since April 1988.
According to the Central Statistical Office, which released the figures,
many of last year's price increases were not repeated last month at the end
of a difficult summer for retailers.
Mr Major, who has put the defeat of inflation at the heart of his economic
policy, said Britain was making the 'most substantial progress in inflation
seen for many years'.
At a press conference in Edinburgh he said: 'We have now got inflation down
to levels it has only touched briefly in the last quarter of a century. What
is different is that it looks as though this is a secure reduction of
underlying inflation that will be sustainable in the future.'
Mr Major said low inflation would improve Britain's competitive position and
bring more jobs and greater prosperity.
The better-than-expected news on inflation, however, came at the end of a
week of further gloomy news on the economy.
On Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry said most retailers did
not expect consumer confidence to improve before the end of the year while
official figures yesterday showed a 5 per cent fall in construction output
in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year ago.
Also this week, several corporate leaders, including Sir Clifford Chetwood
and Sir Owen Green, chairmen of Wimpey and BTR respectively, called on urged
the government to take steps to boost demand.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, the computer company, yesterday added
his voice, saying the government should do more to encourage consumer
spending. 'I think they should switch attention from inflation to expanding
the economy. We have to encourage people to spend again. We cannot employ
more people until we sell more goods,' he said.
In London the pound dipped close to its floor as it continued to come under
pressure against the D-Mark. It closed at DM2.7900, up a quarter of a
pfennig on the day.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor of the exchequer, said that the
government should be taking action to revive the economy.
'When Japan, with 2 per cent inflation and 2 per cent unemployment, takes
urgent measures to revive the economy, Britain, with 10 per cent
unemployment and entering the third year of recession, should be acting
now,' he said.
Shares shrugged off the pound's lacklustre performance, encouraged by the
better-than-expected inflation figures. The FT-SE 100 index closed up 30.3
on the day at 2,370.9.

FT  12 SEP 92 / Brussels expected to oppose ICI swap deal with Du Pont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission merger authorities appear ready to oppose a swap of
chemical assets between Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont
of the US.
The deal is regarded by ICI as an important test case in the rationalisation
of Europe's chemical industry. Announced in April, it involves ICI swapping
its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m
in cash.
The Commission's merger task force is expected to recommend to Sir Leon
Brittan, the competition commissioner, that the deal be blocked in its
present form because it would give Du Pont a dominant position in nylon
carpet fibre.
The task force has found that Du Pont's EC market share would be 35 per cent
by volume and 43 per cent by value.
The task force's opposition to the deal, however, has split the EC advisory
committee on merger cases, where its view is supported by only a narrow
majority of governments. The Commission's industry directorate favours the
deal.
Brussels officials suggested yesterday that the unusually wide split on the
committee could make it harder for Sir Leon to ask his 16 fellow
commissioners to veto the transaction. A decision is expected by the end of
this month. The official deadline is October 9.
The carpet fibre business accounts for only 20 per cent of ICI's nylon
assets. In theory, the task force's objections could be met by excluding
carpet fibres from the deal.
This might prove too expensive to contemplate, since nylon fibre is produced
at all three of ICI's nylon plants in the UK and Germany. It is not thought
that any undertakings short of divestment would satisfy the merger
authorities.
ICI argued that the relevant market against which the deal should be
measured was that for artificial carpet fibres as a whole, including
polypropylene fibres.
It is claimed that polypropylene has increased its share of this market from
14 per cent to 35 per cent over the past 10 years. The argument has been
rejected.
Some of ICI's supporters in Brussels concede that the deal raises
competition issues in nylon fibres. But they argue that these do not warrant
thwarting an otherwise sensible rationalisation of assets.
The deal has also to be passed by the US competition authorities, since it
involves ICI becoming the world's largest supplier of acrylic and the second
biggest producer in the US. This is expected to pose fewer problems than in
the EC, since the market shares involved are smaller.
A US ruling is not expected before the end of the year.
Since the EC merger regulation took effect two years ago, the Commission has
blocked only one of 120 mergers notified to it, the proposed takeover of De
Havilland of Canada by French and Italian state aerospace companies.

for the NY Daily News
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MORTIMER ZUCKERMAN, the owner of US News and World Report magazine, took
the pole position last night as the leading contender to acquire The Daily
News, the loss-making New York tabloid that was formerly owned by the late
Mr Robert Maxwell.
A New York bankruptcy judge gave Mr Zuckerman six days to achieve an
agreement with both creditors and a key trade union.
On Thursday night aides to Mr Conrad Black, the bidder previously thought
most likely to succeed, admitted they could not reach an accord with trade
unions because they could not match the offer made by Mr Zuckerman.
Mr Martin Maleska, an investment banker representing Mr Black, said Mr Black
would only return to the fray 'if Mr Zuckerman is unable to complete the
transaction'.
Mr Zuckerman already has the support of eight trade unions at The Daily
News.
But the Newspaper Guild, which represents editorial staff, is resisting his
insistence on the right for him to change staff without regard to the
existing seniority system.
A lawyer for the newspaper's creditors committee told Judge Tina Brozman in
New York the committee was unhappy with Mr Zuckerman's offer to pay Dollars
18m of the Dollars 42m owed by the newspaper. Mr Black had offered the
creditors Dollars 22m.
The News meanwhile agreed to postpone staff pay cuts on the understanding
that if Mr Zuckerman achieved deals with all unions by next Thursday he
would provide a Dollars 3m bridge loan to the paper.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Lib Dems target the politically uncommitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH agenda in British politics addressing basic issues such as the
creation of a 'society of opportunity' is the theme the Liberal Democrats
hope will bring new people into politics.
A consultation paper called Challenge, Opportunity and Responsibility was
launched yesterday by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, ready for
discussion at the party conference next week.
Both Mr Ashdown and Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said the debate
about the paper would be even more important than discussion of the party's
future strategy.
Potential involvement of the politically uncommitted is a critical element
in Liberal Democrat efforts to move discussion away from the question of
possible pacts or agreements with Labour. Mr Ashdown said the 'values'
document showed that the party was confident enough to raise the difficult
questions avoided by the other parties.
It would form the basis for a framework paper to be considered at next
year's party conference, and be the first step in mapping out the next
general election manifesto.
It says: 'The empowerment of the individual - every individual, not just
those who are already richer and more successful - is our key aim.'
Mr Ashdown conceded that it would be more difficult for the Liberal
Democrats to involve the politically inactive when the party had been in
existence for a few years, than it had been to bring people into the SDP as
a fresh venture.
He insisted, however, that the consultation paper marked the second part of
a two-stage strategy: post-election dissatisfaction with the government's
economic policy and only a limp challenge from Labour contributed to
circumstances in which the third party could emerge as a stronger force.
In the strategy debate, the party would be able to decide, Mr Ashdown said,
whether its aim was still to build itself up to be a party of government -
as he believed - or whether it should settle for a lesser role.

FT  11 SEP 92 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Glaxo's export sales advance
31% to Pounds 837m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 12 September 1992) appended to this article.
SIR PAUL GIROLAMI, Glaxo's chairman, was in expansive mood yesterday as he
announced a 12th year of rapid growth in profits and sales.
The Pounds 700m increase in turnover was greater than the sales of the whole
group less than 10 years ago, he pointed out. Meanwhile, the group's exports
from the UK increased 31 per cent from Pounds 641m in 1991 to Pounds 837m in
1992.
Such growth was impressive said Mr Ernest Mario, deputy chairman. This was
particularly true when Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, was losing
market share. The drug, with sales of Pounds 1.81bn, represented 44 per cent
of group sales, and this percentage would fall as the product continued to
mature, said Mr Mario.
Sales of Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug, nevertheless, increased 13 per cent (9
per cent at constant exchange rates). In the US sales were up 13 per cent in
local currency.
Mr Mario said the increase in Zantac sales was partly the consequence of an
expansion of the US sales- force by 500 representatives in anticipation of
the licensing of Imigran, a migraine treatment also known as Imitrex. While
waiting for the drug to be licensed, they were marketing Zantac.
Sales of respiratory drugs increased 24 per cent to Pounds 964m,
representing 24 per cent of group sales. Sales of Ventolin, an asthma
medicine, increased 15 per cent at constant exchange rates. Sales of another
asthma drug, Becotide, also known as Beconase, increased 26 per cent.
Revenues from Serevent, a long-acting asthma drug and one of Glaxo's most
promising medicines, increased from Pounds 9m to Pounds 37m. Mr Mario said
this was in spite of the fact it had not yet been launched in five of the 10
largest pharmaceuticals markets - the US, Japan, Germany, France and Spain.
Antibiotics, representing 17 per cent of group sales, increased 12 per cent
to Pounds 681m. In the US sales grew only 2 per cent at constant exchange
rates because of pricing pressures, said Mr Mario.
Sales of Zofran, a drug used to prevent nausea in patients receiving
radiation and chemotherapy, increased from Pounds 181m to Pounds 259m. The
company is hoping to receive a licence for use with post-operative patients.
Imigran, Glaxo's controversial migraine drug, had sales of Pounds 43m. Mr
Mario said he was pleased with the patient acceptance of the drug, which is
yet to be licensed in the US, Japan and Germany.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agriculture faces the menace of
environmentalism - Post Earth Summit conference in the Netherlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONTAGUE KEEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government will shortly acknowledge that a number of prohibited
products ought never to have been banned as carcinogens, according to former
US secretary of state for agriculture Mr John Block, now president of
America's wholesale grocers' association.
Addressing a post-Earth Summit conference in the Netherlands this week Mr
Block accused many critics of agriculture of irresponsible distortion of
scientific evidence. The conference, on how environmental issues could
affect farm trade, was organised by the International Policy Council on
Agriculture and Trade and the Dutch Government.
Few of the representatives from 34 countries disputed an assertion of the
former secretary-general of the Brundtland Commission, Mr Jim MacNeill, that
the 1990s would see a major increase in unilaterally enacted national laws
imposing restrictions on a wide range of products failing to meet
environmental - including welfare as well as human, animal or plant health -
requirements. Nor did speakers doubt that these restrictions might be used
as covert protectionist devices to an extent that could nullify advances
made through negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
towards reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
The increasingly dominating role that well organised environmentalism was
already playing in industry generally, especially those sectors related to
welfare, pharmaceuticals and food, clearly worried speakers from many
countries. But of particular concern were fears that ill-informed prejudice
would supersede scientific consensus to restrict trade, raise manufacturing
costs and impose unwarranted burdens on food producers.
One example was the European Community's maximum permissible nitrate levels
in drinking water, the strict enforcement of which, according to Mr Peter
Johnson, chief executive of Booker Countryside and an unabashed apologist
for British agribusiness, would end internationally-competitive farming in
England's bread-basket, even though the rule was in direct conflict with
scientific findings.
Likewise the 'emotional and altogether hasty banning of Alar', a crop
protection chemical applied to apples, had had a serious effect on apple
sales. 'It does not take long for five supermarket owners supplying over one
third of the UK's food to withdraw an item about which they have doubts'
warned Mr Johnson.
The welfare issue was another oft-quoted example. Everyone sympathised with
the US for being rebuffed by the Gatt panel that had examined the legitimacy
of the US ban on tuna fish caught in circumstances hazardous to dolphins.
Most nevertheless endorsed the Gatt view that the governments cannot be
allowed to act unilaterally: there must be international agreement. There
was more than a hint, however, that US consumers would tolerate no such
rebuff. By operating a consumer boycott, they could achieve overnight what
ponderous international mechanisms would have taken years to accomplish.
Mr Michael Smith, a leading environmental expert and a former Gatt
ambassador, warned that the environment was the trade issue of the decade,
and traders would ignore it at their peril. Only by a narrow margin had
Californians rejected proposition 65, which effectively would have left
scientific judgments on the merits of legislation in the hands of such
authorities as Jane Fonda.
But Mr Kenneth Cook, chief author of the conservation and environmental
provisions of US Farm Bills, warned that public fears would not be assuaged
by being told there was nothing to worry about. Every time there was a
scare, the credibility of scientific assurances was reduced, he said.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia feels after-effects of
cocoa fever - Growers' initial enthusiasm has evaporated as prices have
plummeted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE late 1970s and early 1980s cocoa fever swept through the small town
of Tawau, in the state of Sabah, East Malaysia. 'We all had pockets full of
cash then' says Mr Nicholas Mok, a local cocoa smallholder. 'The bars were
full, you even had to book restaurant tables for breakfast - we all bought
Mercedes.'
But that was in the good old days when the export price of a tonne of cocoa
was more than MDollars 13,000 (Pounds 2,615 at the present exchange rate).
Now growers like Mr Mok are lucky if they get MDollars 2,500 per tonne and
earlier this year prices went as low as MDollars 1,700 a tonne.
Last year Malaysia produced 230,000 tonnes of cocoa - about 10 per cent of
world output. Sabah accounts for about 57 per cent of Malaysia's total
production, with more than half of the state's output coming from the Tawau
area. 'There's no doubt that more people are moving out of cocoa production
and into palm oil, which is more profitable at the moment,' says Mr Hashim
Wahab, head of the Malaysian Cocoa Board.
'Something has to be done about pricing - the consumers blame producing
countries for overproduction but if there was disease or some other mishap
then the consumers would suffer. . . It's as if the consumers - mostly the
big chocolate companies - want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg.'
Latest cocoa board forecasts are for a drop in Malaysia's production this
year to 184,000 tonnes, the lowest since 1986.
It is only recently that Malaysia joined the Ivory Coast, Ghana and Brazil
as a major cocoa producer. Commercial growing began in the mid-1950s. In
1960 less than 2,000 hectares (4,950 acres) of land was given up to cocoa.
By 1980 there was more than 100,000 ha under cocoa: spurred on by high
prices Malaysia's cocoa production climbed by about 30 per cent each year in
the mid-1980s.
BAL Plantations, wholly-owned by the London-based Commonwealth Development
Corporation, is one of Tawau's biggest cocoa producers, with 6,000 workers
and about 40 per cent of its 16,000 ha estate planted with cocoa trees.
Malaysian cocoa production is claimed to be the most efficient in the world:
at BAL the aim is to produce about 2,000 kg a hectare. According to Mr Lim
Fook Hin, finance controller at BAL, African countries produce only about
500 kg a hectare.
'We are now experimenting with close planting of trees to achieve even
higher yields,' says Mr Lim. 'But we have been losing money for the past
three years on cocoa. We are lucky because we have oil palm and rubber
production and no debts. It's the mono-crop, highly geared producers who are
really suffering'. BAL has so far not taken any land out of cocoa production
but has made efforts to cut costs, mainly by reducing fertiliser use. 'We
might lose a small portion of our crop but with the price so bad it's a
calculated risk,' says Mr Lim.
About 40 per cent of Malaysia's cocoa production is estate-based, the rest
from smallholdings. It is estimated that present production costs are about
MDollars 3,000 a tonne for the estates and MDollars 2,400 for smallholders.
At the height of the cocoa boom in the late 1970s many speculators with
little knowledge of cocoa - several of them formerly involved in Malaysia's
tin mining industry - rushed to Sabah to buy land. While cocoa offers a
quick return on capital compared to palm oil and rubber, it is a highly
sensitive crop and needs careful husbandry. Many of the new planters
invested little in fertiliser use and often planted on marginal land.
Mr Lim feels a shake-out is now going on in the cocoa sector. 'In the short
term only the most efficient producers will survive,' he says. 'But if the
price does not rise within the next two or three years then there could be
no cocoa industry left in Sabah.'
Malaysian producers concede that there has been global overproduction but
argue that consumers often exaggerate world cocoa stock holdings. Malaysia
says it is penalised both by European Community tariffs and the quality that
discount Malaysian cocoa is subject to on the London market. Meanwhile
production costs are rising: labour is in short supply in Sabah and most
workers on the plantations are immigrants or 'guest-workers' from Indonesia.
Costly insecticide has to be used frequently to control disease,
particularly the cocoa pod borer, an insect which burrows into the pod,
oxidising the beans.
The big European consumers still tend to favour the West African or Ghana
cocoa bean. Malaysia and other producing countries have been hit by the
dramatic fall in cocoa consumption in what was the Soviet Union. In 1988 the
Soviet Union imported 200,000 tonnes of cocoa beans plus an additional
75,000 tonnes of cocoa liquor (one of the extracts of the cocoa processing
industry). The forecast for total cocoa imports by the CIS this year is only
25,000 tonnes.
Malaysia feels that while production seems to be falling in Brazil, the west
African countries, with few agricultural alternatives, will continue to
produce cocoa even at the present depressed price levels. There is also
concern about the rapid rise of cocoa output in Indonesia, where labour
costs are much lower.
Downstream development is perceived as the most promising solution. In 1990
about 72,000 tonnes or 30 per cent of Malaysia's total cocoa bean production
was processed locally. The processing, referred to as grinding, has several
stages, producing cocoa liquor, butter, paste, powder or chocolate.
But there are problems. The infrastructure is bad in Sabah and energy costs
in the state are double those on the mainland. Cocoa beans from Sabah have
to be transported to the Malaysian peninsula or Singapore for onward
processing. Singapore, with no cocoa production of its own, processes about
50,000 tonnes of cocoa beans each year. Many of the big chocolate companies
prefer to do their own grinding. Some Malaysian producers have made attempts
to go into chocolate production themselves but face marketing problems.
The other solution is to search out new markets. China has recently made
substantial purchases of Malaysian cocoa beans and there are hopes of a
growing market in the East Asia region. The Malaysian Cocoa Board is
considering launching a generic advertising campaign aimed at increasing
regional cocoa consumption.
Small producers like Tawau's Mr Mok are willing to try anything to survive.
'Cocoa trees need shade so above my cocoa I'm growing durian fruits, which
are very profitable' says Mr Mok. 'In between the cocoa trees I've planted
papaya and below I'm growing a special local vegetable. Then I'm also
producing kampung (village) chickens. We'll be wiped out if we just sit back
and wait for cocoa prices to rise.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia astonishes market with
uranium profit claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ASTONISHING claim that Russia is exporting uranium at a profit, although
prices are below the cost of production at most western uranium mines, was
made yesterday by Mr Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian Federation's Minister for
Nuclear Energy.
His remarks provoked a sharp response by other delegates at the Uranium
Institute's annual symposium in London. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economic
adviser to the RTZ Corporation of the UK, one of the world's biggest uranium
producers, said: 'Most of his arguments are plain nonsense. The Russians and
their partners in the US are getting away with murder and the western
industry should stand up to them.'
Russia faces uranium dumping allegations in the US and, in an oblique
reference to this, Mr Mikhailov said in the English version of his text:
'The high technical level of our production processes makes it possible to
export profitably, even under the conditions of extremely low prices which
exist in the world uranium market today.
'We believe that efforts to limit or reduce our exports are unfair and
unfortunate.'
He said Russia's present production allowed for the export of 3,500 tonnes
of uranium a year and an increase to 5,000 tonnes a year was possible.
Money from these exports would be used to buy food, equipment, materials and
technology from the west to the benefit of parts of the western economy.
'The world community must realise the necessity of actively supporting the
irreversible reforms in Russia at this historic moment,' he added.
Mr Mikhailov suggested that some of Russia's 'substantial' uranium stockpile
might be moved to the west, partly to give assurance of supply to western
consumers and partly to be held as collateral for loans to his country.
He claimed Russia's share of the uranium market was about 6 per cent and 'we
believe that it could be as high as 20 to 25 per cent in a market free of
artificial restrictions'.
Mr Crowson, in a paper to be delivered at the symposium today, suggests that
to talk of production costs and the relative efficiencies of the western and
Russian industries is 'unrealistic,' given that the Russian currency is not
fully convertible and that 'Russian costs of energy and labour are greatly
subsidised'.
He adds: 'That labour costs (in the CIS) and environmental standards are
well below western levels is a competitive fact of life, however
regrettable. That said, there will be inexorable levelling up tendencies to
CIS costs and it is highly doubtful whether the CIS producers could maintain
their present output at prices close to present spot market levels.'
Mr Crowson dismisses Mr Mikhailov's suggestion that Russia is not winning
its proper share of the market. He points out that the Uranium Institute
estimates that the CIS produced 10,500 tonnes of uranium in 1991 or 19.3 per
cent of the world's total reactor requirements of 54,280 tonnes. 'To ignore
domestic CIS and east European reactor requirements in looking at relative
market shares seems rather extraordinary.'
He makes these remarks in the context of a warning to uranium consumers that
the present apparent abundance of the material - used solely to produce
nuclear energy - 'is more apparent than real'. He suggests that 'market
conditions can change very quickly and unexpectedly. When they do, the
inevitable scramble for cover will exacerbate any turnaround'.

Three-month COPPER fell below expected support around Dollars 2,420 a tonne
on the LME as New York opened lower yesterday afternoon. Sentiment was
depressed by Chinese liquidation and increased supplies of Russian metal.
Prices stabilised on the late kerb, but still closed at Dollars 2,414, down
Dollars 46 from Wednesday and only Dollars 2 above the day's low. Analysts
say the next major downside objective is Dollars 2,380. ZINC also weakened
with sentiment depressed by this week's general decline in the base metals.
The premium for cash metal over three-month narrowed, but traders still see
the market vulnerable to renewed tightness in the final quarter. Analysts
say there is a band of technical support between Dollars 1,310 and Dollars
1,320, which is also likely to cushion declines. London's robusta COFFEE
rebounded from earlier losses after New York arabicas stooped to new lows
but managed to uncover some light buying. But most active near November
showed little inclination to break out of its current Dollars 770 to Dollars
800 range. PLATINUM was easier in London after running into profit-taking
following its advance earlier in the week.

production slide continues
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government will next week more than double the controlled
domestic price for oil to boost support for the ailing oil production
sector, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, deputy prime minister responsible for energy
policy, announced yesterday.
He also forecast that oil production would total 395m to 397m tonnes this
year, down from 460m the previous year. Exports would reach 57m-58m tonnes,
half of which would be delivered to hard currency-paying countries beyond
the former Soviet Union. He gave no comparative figure for the previous
year, when the Soviet Union was still one country and exported 53.9m tonnes.
He dismissed reports that Russia had suspended deliveries of oil products to
Japan and western Europe. But he confirmed that the government planned to
centralise exports next year to meet its international obligations better.
Mr Chernomyrdin said the new domestic price would be about Rbs4,000-5,000 a
tonne, up from the current range of Rbs1,800-2,200. 'If we continue with
present prices, the industry will be indebted to the tune of Rbs170bn by the
end of the year,' he said.
The government was still working out a mechanism for how the new pricing
system would work, he said. Despite the liberalisation of most other prices
since January, energy and fuel prices have remained regulated in order to
protect industry from an oil price shock. While the industry's costs have
gone up its revenues have remained fixed. An additional problem is that even
at the present prices, enterprises and refineries within Russia and other
former Soviet republics have found it difficult to pay for oil deliveries
and have continued to receive supplies none the less.
At his first major news conference since his appointment in June, Mr
Chernomyrdin said his strategy for overhauling the energy sector had been
approved at a government session yesterday. Although he did not go into
details, nothing of what he said suggested a major departure from the
policies of his young predecessor, Mr Vladimir Lopukhin.
And while he regretted the freezing of the funds of oil and other types of
joint ventures in Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank that once had a
monopoly of foreign currency operations, he held out little comfort to the
victims, saying his priority was to make sure this never happened again.
Mr Chernomyrdin added that despite President Boris Yeltsin's last minute
decision to call off what was supposed to be a ground-breaking trip to
Japan, Moscow still expected to receive about Dollars 1.4bn in new Japanese
financing to overhaul its gas industry and purchase drilling equipment. But
he also suggested to an incredulous audience that delays in drawing up new
agreements for Japanese companies to take part in additional oil and gas
tenders off Sakhalin island had been one of the reasons for the postponement
of the presidential trip.

FT  11 SEP 92 / MoD seeks hovercraft bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence plans to revive the use of hovercraft after
abandoning them in the 1980s.
It is inviting tenders for up to four diesel-engined hovercraft to start
service with the Royal Marines by the end of next year.
Main UK contenders for the contract, expected to be worth about Pounds 1m,
are Griffon Hovercraft, which has recently clinched export deals for Sweden
and Thailand, and Slingsby Aviation.
Among others invited to bid is an Australian company, Airlift Marine. Five
French companies are also due to be notified.
The US and Russia make significant use of hovercraft for amphibious
operations. The UK set up an inter-service trials unit in the 1960s, but the
gas-turbine craft of the time were found to be too unreliable, noisy and
expensive.
The MoD said modern technology had largely overcome those drawbacks.
The planned craft, much smaller than the US marines' tank-carrying Landing
Craft Air Cushion, will carry up to 16 fully equipped men or two tonnes of
stores over sea, land or ice at up to 30 knots.
Conventional landing craft will still be needed to transport vehicles, heavy
equipment and the main body of troops ashore.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Banks urged to balance goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN PEARSE, chief executive of Midland Bank, warned yesterday that
banks and companies should take care to balance the pursuit of rewards for
shareholders against other goals.
'The relentless focus on financial performance places a high value on the
pursuit of shareholder value as the dominating factor in business
management,' he said, in a seminar for the Chartered Institute of Bankers.
He warned of 'dangers if shareholder value is over-accentuated - for example
if short-term decisions are taken that are not in the customer's best
interest'.
There has been a debate between banks and their shareholders over the past
few years about whether banks have been run with sufficient emphasis on
rewarding shareholders. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England, warned recently that banks should put the interests of shareholders
and customers above the public interest.
Mr Pearse insisted yesterday that there was nothing to distinguish a bank's
obligations to its shareholders from those of any other limited company.
He said that a bank had 'moral and social obligations' to take account of
its relationships with 'suppliers, staff, customers and the community'.
Mr Pearse added: 'There will be times in the business cycle when the
long-term fulfilment of strategic aims requires short-term profit sacrifices
while investment or restructuring is undertaken.' So a bank's policy of
increasing dividend payments to shareholders may 'need to be reviewed' when
profits are under pressure.
UK banks have been reluctant to cut dividends. Midland's dividend cut after
its poor 1990 financial results was the first by a UK clearing bank since
the 1930s.

FT  11 SEP 92 / CBI Distributive Trades Survey: Retailers report dismal
sales levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RETAILERS suffered dismal high street sales last month and do not
expect consumer confidence to recover before the end of the year.
Sales volumes remained below last year's for the third consecutive month in
spite of a slight improvement on July's particularly poor figures.
The latest survey of distributive trades from the Confederation of British
Industry also showed a sharp drop in activity for wholesalers and poor sales
for car dealers. It confirmed that retailers have had a troubled summer as
rising unemployment and high debt levels have hit spending power.
The poor outlook for Britain's high streets has apparently worsened over the
past three months. According to the survey, a modest upward trend in the
annual growth rate of sales since the beginning of the year was reversed in
June when sales volumes slipped below the levels of a year before.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trade panel, said:
'While high street sales have improved compared with the dismal trading
conditions in July, it is difficult to see a resumption of the underlying
improve-ment reported earlier in the year.'
Mr Whittaker said shops were now burdened with stock levels that were too
high in relation to expected demand.
'Shops have continued to cut back sharply on orders placed with their
suppliers as they try to reduce the build-up in stocks since the beginning
of the year,' he explained.
That accounted for wholesalers' sluggish trade last month. They reported the
sharpest annual fall in sales since March last year and expect another fall
this month.
Within retailing, footwear, furniture and carpet stores reversed July's
decline in sales, reporting that trade last month was higher than a year
before.
Grocers, who until recently had weathered the recession relatively well,
said sales last month had flattened out compared with a year ago, while
chemists' sales slowed. Off-licences saw sales drop sharply below the levels
of a year before.
Clothing and DIY retailers said volumes continued to fall, while sales of
electrical and other household goods remained flat.
Sales for motor traders were disappointing in August - a month that
generally accounts for a quarter of their annual trade. Although volumes
were up on August last year, they were poor for the time of year.
Other findings of the survey - conducted between August 17 and September 2,
and covering 15,000 retail, wholesale and motor trade outlets - included:
More than two thirds of retailers expect the situation to stay the same over
the next three months, but on balance wholesalers and motor traders expect
things to worsen.
Investment intentions have weakened over the past three months. Retailers,
wholesalers and motor traders reported that they intended to invest less
over the coming year.
The rate of job shedding, compared with a year ago, has intensified, with
motor traders reporting the sharpest cuts. In May, wholesalers reported a
rise in employment but trends have now reversed sharply.
There was a significant reduction in the annual rate of price increases.
Wholesalers reported the sharpest reduction in price inflation.
The share of deliveries accounted for by imports has remained broadly
unchanged over the past year. However, import penetration in retailing rose
faster last month than when it was surveyed in May. For wholesaling and the
motor trades, import penetration fell.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Early market gain lost after Bundesbank
confirms money target

SPECULATION, later denied, that the Bundesbank was due to hold an emergency
meeting, and hopes of a revaluation of the D-Mark sent European government
bond markets higher yesterday.
However, bond prices slipped back late in the afternoon on comments by Mr
Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank board member, in defence of the central bank's
use of a target for M3 money supply growth and its efforts to reach that
target.
Trading was volatile due to uncertainty about the implications of this
week's events in Sweden and Italy, and due to continued weakness in the lira
in spite of central bank intervention. Activity concentrated in futures,
although dealers reported demand for the French 30-year government bond.
GERMAN bunds and futures continued on their upward path, as investors sought
refuge in D-Mark paper. The December bund contract touched a high of 89.49
in afternoon trading after opening at 89.13 on London's Liffe.
ITALIAN government bond prices eased in the morning as dealers took their
profits after the previous day's late gains, but recouped their losses as
the day progressed.
The December future fell 30 basis points to 92.12, in quieter trading, with
16,422 contracts traded, compared with more than 25,000 the previous day.
ON the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the September OAT bond futures
contract closed at 106.60, up 0.50 in active volume of 141,948 lots, while
the December contract closed at 107.04, up 0.52 on volume of 33,445 lots. At
the long end of the government bond market, the 8 1/2 per cent 2023 bond
rose 0.99 to 97.27 to yield 8.75 per cent.
UK GILTS and futures had a more comfortable day, in spite of sterling
remaining below DM2.79.
The 11 3/4 bond due 2003/07 rose  19/32 to 114 5/8 while in the futures
market, the December contract rose  1/2 point to 97.02.
SWEDISH government bonds were supported by aggressive buying by domestic
institutions and the yield on the two-year 199 bond fell to 13.88 per cent
from 14.15 per cent. However, there was a flattening of the yield curve at
the longer end.
THE Spanish government bond market failed to participate in the generally
firmer mood, concentrating instead on its domestic economic problems. The
yield on the 10-year 10.30 per cent bond rose to 12.65/69 per cent from
12.51/55 per cent.
US Treasury securities recovered from early weakness after the market judged
that the economic plan unveiled by President Bush yesterday would not widen
the deficit.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 100
3/32 , yielding 7.237 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 13/16
, yielding 3.801 per cent.
Almost Dollars 6bn of new corporate debt has been issued this week, and not
only did the large influx of corporate supply lure investors away from
Treasuries, but some underwriters sold government securities to hedge their
corporate deals. Consequently, prices at the long end of the Treasury market
came under early selling pressure yesterday.
However, prices recovered in the afternoon on President Bush's speech.
Although he called for a one percentage point cut in taxes, analysts judged
that his proposals would have no real impact on the deficit, which remains
the bond market's greatest worry.
CANADA'S sliding dollar has led to a decline in Canadian bond prices in
recent days.
Prices of long-term government bonds dropped about 1.60 points yesterday,
bringing their fall to almost three points since the start of the week. The
30-year bond was yielding 8.1 per cent at the close.
Mr Barry Calhoun, chief bond trader at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said that the
pressure was confined mainly to foreigners selling into a thin market.
The spread between Canadian and US bonds, a key indicator of the
attractiveness of the Canadian market, has widened from 72 basis points at
the beginning of this month to 91 points. The Bank of Canada raised its
bellwether bank rate by 21 basis points to 5.14 per cent, the first increase
in 19 weeks. The Bank rate was set last week at 4.93 per cent.
TRADING in Japanese government bonds was thin ahead of today's publication
of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey. The yield on the 145 10-year
government bond ended at 4.84 per cent, one basis point lower, as dealers
covered short positions late in the afternoon.
Dealers expected the Tankan to be negative, showing a build-up of
inventories, a drop in business confidence and more evidence of a liquidity
squeeze. However, they added that the survey was of historical importance
and that the bond market was more likely to be influenced by the stock
market, which saw the Nikkei break above 19,000 yesterday.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Dealers braced for second Eurobond
issue withdrawal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurobond market was yesterday facing its second aborted issue in as many
days, as the lead manager to Pta10bn of floating-rate notes from the
European Investment Bank came close to calling off the deal.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the lead manager, said it was '90 per cent certain'
the issue would be pulled following Wednesday's announcement of the ending
of the tax exemption which made the bonds of the EIB and other multilateral
agencies particularly attractive to Italian investors. Around 60 per cent to
70 per cent of the bonds placed so far had been sold in Italy, the BBV said,
adding that more than half of the total issue had been sold before the
Italian announcement.
The move to call off the deal was held over, however, after an unexpected
report late in the day that the peseta issue might still benefit from the
tax exemption. A final decision has been delayed until today, when bankers
and the issuer hope to have more information about when the tax change
officially comes into effect.
BBV said that it had warned banks involved in the Pta10bn deal not to trade
the bonds since the issue was likely to be abandoned.
Meanwhile, a second EIB issue, to raise Y50bn, was not launched as planned
yesterday as the bank and its lead managers, Morgan Stanley and Long Term
Credit Bank, awaited further clarification of the Italian tax change.
These delays follow Golman Sach's decision on Wednesday to call off a
Dollars 384m issue for Osprey Mortgage Services, a rare mortgage-backed deal
from Sweden. Turmoil in the Swedish markets was blamed for the postponment,
even though the issue was announced some hours after this week's upheaval
first hit the Scandinavian markets.
The disruption in the Eurobond market left bankers querying the
circumstances in which lead managers exercise their powers to call off bond
issues under the standard, broadly-worded force majeure clauses contained in
most Eurobond documentation.
Such powers have been rarely used: proposed issues from BAT when it was
under threat of takeover and a Robert Holmes a Court vehicle at the time of
the 1987 stock market crash are the only recent examples.
Decisions on whether or not to abandon issues have been complicated by the
development of the swaps market. Swap transactions do not carry force
majeure clauses, meaning that they cannot be abandoned if the underlying
bond issue to which they are linked is pulled. In such cases, banks could
face a loss when unwinding the swap. Goldman would not say whether the
Osprey deal had been swapped before it was postponed.
The pulling of deals has reawakened concern over how force majeure clauses
are applied. The subject has stirred little interest since the Gulf war but
at that time no Eurobond issues were abandoned.
A bank close to one of the deals said yesterday: 'It makes sense to pull a
deal, rather than try to be macho and carry it off when no one wants it.'
The Province of Ontario is preparing to launch its second global bond
offering, totalling at least Dollars 1.5bn. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch
have been mandated to arrange the offering of five-year, seven-year or
10-year bonds, which is likely to be launched next week.
Ontario launched its first global bond offering, a Dollars 2bn issue of 7
3/4 bonds due 2002, in May. That deal is now trading at a yield spread of 60
basis points, relative to the US Treasury market. However, the spread has
widened because the issue is now trading at a premium to par of more than
six points. A new global offering would likely be priced at a tighter
spread.
Ontario, Canada's largest province in terms of economic activity and
population, has raised CDollars 5.9bn of its 1992-93 borrowing requirement,
expected to total CDollars 9.7bn.

<TEXT>
JOHN GOVETT Unit Management has launched four authorised futures funds,
adding to the limited range of UK unit trusts investing in derivative
instruments.
The Securities and Investments Board opened the door to unit trusts
investing in derivative instruments more than a year ago, but only two
companies, John Govett and Legal &amp; General, have so far taken advantage of
the new regulations, which many market participants have criticised as too
restrictive.
Up to 10 per cent of the assets of futures and options funds (Fofs) can be
invested in derivative products, while the riskier geared futures and
options funds (GFofs) can have up to 20 per cent of their assets in futures
and options.
ED&amp;F Mann has raised Dollars 220m in year to end July, in joint venture
futures funds in various countries, including non-unit trust futures funds
in the UK, in conjunction with Providence Capital.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Traders confused by new
Italian tax arrangements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE arrangements for the Italian government's abolition of withholding tax
exemption for Eurobonds issued by supranational institutions, announced as
part of Wednesday's economic package, remained unclear yesterday, creating
some confusion in secondary market trading of Eurobonds issued by the World
Bank and European Investment Bank.
Until now, Italian residents holding Eurobonds issued by agencies of which
Italy is a member have not paid withholding tax.
The decree will be published today. Dealers hope the following areas of
uncertainty will be clarified:
The Italian authorities specified that the loss of tax-exempt status would
not apply to holders of existing bonds, but it was not specified whether
tax-exempt status is lost once bonds are traded in the secondary market.
However, sources close to the Italian Treasury said yesterday that the
tax-exemption would continue to apply to all issues launched prior to the
tax change, even if they changed hands.
While the original wording of the tax changes suggested that the loss of
exemption would apply only to supranational agencies - the World Bank, the
EIB, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Agency -
it appears possible that the wording of the decree will include Italy, and
some Italian-backed agencies such as Ferrovie, which benefit from tax-exempt
status.
In the domestic market, these borrowers are subject to 12 1/2 per cent
withholding tax, so such a change would appear logical.
The effect on the active repo (repurchase agreement) market in World Bank
and EIB Eurobonds is unclear. Banks and investors outside Italy have been
able, through the repo market, to benefit from the tax-break for Italian
investors. For example, a London-based bank sells a World Bank Eurobond to
an Italian investor at 99, and agrees to buy it back at 98, the lower price
representing the repo rate.
Until now, the loss has been deductible as a business expense for Italian
investors, but this tax break could also be changed in the decree. In this
case, the Italian tax exempt repo market would be hurt by the disappearance
of both the benefits of tax exempt status, and the tax deductible loss.
A slight rally in prices in EIB and World Bank issues yesterday reflected
expectations that the tax change would not be backdated. However, volume was
thin, as few traders felt inclined to deal ahead of publication.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira closes below ERM floor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE Italian lira and sterling remained under intense pressure in the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, in spite of attempts in Rome and
London to support the currencies, writes James Blitz.
The Italian authorities are making a huge attempt to support the lira, but
the currency spent most of the European trading day on or near its ERM floor
of L765.40 to the D-Mark.
Last week, Italy raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points and, on
Wednesday, the government announced that it would be seeking emergency
powers to alter taxation and investment in the economy where necessary.
Neither of these moves is having much effect on the markets. 'Dealers
increasingly believe that the lira will be devalued, irrespective of the
outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty,' said Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, senior American adviser at Bank of America in London.
Yesterday, Mr Carlo Ciampi, the Bank of Italy's governor, criticised the
Bundesbank for having 'excessively high' interest rates, and said they
should be cut. Some dealers saw this as a particularly ominous development
because the criticism came as the German central bank was helping to support
the Italian currency by buying lira through open market intervention.
The Italians may have been frustrated that the German intervention, which is
required under European Monetary System rules, was not large enough. Several
analysts said the intervention had been too small, and the lira closed in
London below its ERM floor at L765.70 per D-Mark.
The pound was under less pressure than it had been on Wednesday evening, but
hovered around the DM2.79 level for most of the day, near its ERM floor of
DM2.7780. It was partly supported by a statement from the British government
that sterling would remain fixed to its central ERM rate of DM2.95.
Compounding this were unofficial suggestions that the Bundesbank may lower
rates before the end of the year. Mr Eberhard Martini, president of
Germany's main banking trade group, said German interest rates could come
down 'at the beginning of next year at the latest, possibly in December'.
But the pound closed in London unchanged at DM2.7875.
The dollar rallied sharply to a high of DM1.4198 in the European morning,
partly on comments from Mr Wayne Angell, a US Federal Reserve governor, that
the US currency was seriously undervalued. However, a substantial sell order
by a large Far Eastern investor wiped out the gain and the dollar ended
virtually unchanged in London at DM1.4105. A good rally was later staged in
New York by the dollar, leaving a DM1.4258 close.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures recover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures dipped even further in early morning trading yesterday as
dealers became increasingly concerned about the pound's fall the night
before on the foreign exchanges.
However, futures recovered later in the day as the pound stabilised at
around DM2.79 against the D-Mark, and the dollar rallied further against the
German currency.
In the early morning, the December short sterling contract opened 6 basis
points down at 89.17 and quickly slipped to a low of 89.14. It later
rebounded to finish 13 basis points up on the day at 89.30. Trading in the
September contract, which expires next week, was far less volatile. After
declining to a low of 89.26, the contract moved forward to end at 89.45.
One clearing bank dealer said there was no sign that the Bank of England had
yet bought sterling on the foreign exchanges by means of its recent D-Mark
borrowing facility, and that this helped to support the currency.
The market remained very tense, however. Unlike Wednesday's trading,
yesterday's rumours pointed to an easing of German policy. One trader noted
that there were suggestions that the German government could reintroduce the
income tax surcharge which would help the Bundesbank reduce rates.
Period rates in the interbank market also reflected slight optimism after
the hairy close to trading on Wednesday. Three-month money softened to end
at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 5/8 per
cent. One-month money, an impor-tant indicator of whether the Bank of
England will have to raise rates, also eased, from 10 1/2 per cent on the
offered side to 10 1/4 per cent.
The softening of the short dates was partly caused by the Bank of England's
accom-modating position in the money market, dealing in all four bands. In
the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 29m of Band 3 bills at 9 3/4 per cent,
Pounds 4m of Band 4 Treasury bills and Pounds 258m of Band 4 bank bills at 9
per cent. Later the Bank purchased Pounds 45m of Band 3 bank bills and
Pounds 12m of Band 4 bank bills.
The forecast was later revised to around Pounds 850m, and the Bank purchased
Pounds 106m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late
assistance of Pounds 220m.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dollar rally and buy programs
boost Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices rose sharply in heavy trading yesterday, buoyed by a dollar
rally, computer buy programs and hopes that lower interest rates will boost
economic activity, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 33.77 at 3,305.16. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 3.59 to 419.95, while the
American SE composite gained 1.99 at 384.81 and the Nasdaq composite
advanced 6.35 to 581.24. Turnover on the New York SE reached 222m shares.
The dollar's performance - it held its ground early on in New York before
rallying to a DM1.4258 close - and gains overnight in Japanese and European
equity markets set the tone for a positive day's trading. Sentiment was also
lifted by hopes among some investors that the latest decline in interest
rates will eventually feed through into economic growth.
Prices did not take off, however, until mid-afternoon when a series of buy
programs hit the market, lifting share prices across the board. The market
was also helped by expectations that President Bush would unveil some new
economic proposals in his speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The speech,
however, contained nothing new, although most stocks held on to their gains.
Chubb fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 75 1/4 after Kemper Securities lowered its
1992 earnings estimate to take account of losses which the insurer will
incur as a result of Hurricane Andrew. Estimates put those losses at between
Dollars 35m and Dollars 45m for Chubb.
National Semiconductor firmed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 12 on fiscal first-
quarter net income of 17 cents a share, a sharp turnround from the Dollars
1.64 a share loss taken after a charge at the same stage of 1991.
Gillette declined Dollars 1 but recovered to end only Dollars  1/4 off at
Dollars 57 1/8 after announcing the acquisition of UK group Parker Pen
Holdings, for about Dollars 561m. The acquisition will be financed with new
borrowings.
Best Buy closed off the day's high and up just Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 17
1/2 after the electronic appliance retailer said it was 'comfortable' with
analysts' forecasts of 25 cents a share earnings for the third quarter.
On the Nasdaq market, Apple shed Dollars 1 initially to Dollars 48 in heavy
trading after the computer group announced a restructuring which would lead
to job cuts and a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of Dollars 20m. The stock
recovered along with the market, however, and ended a net Dollars  1/4 up at
Dollars 49 1/4 .
Alliance Pharmaceutical plunged Dollars 4 3/4 , more than 30 per cent, to
Dollars 10 on news that clinical trials on two of the company's products
will not resume this month.
Canada
A RISE in the Bank of Canada's key interest rate, combined with worries over
the weakness of the Canadian dollar, kept Toronto from following Wall
Street's good rally.
The TSE 300 index slipped 5.1 to 3,443.9 but rises exceeded declines by a
small margin of 280 to 257. Volume was a fairly heavy 30.5m shares.
PWA gained 5 cents at CDollars 3.45 and Air Canada retreated 40 cents to
CDollars 3.90 following PWA's acceptance of the proposal to merge its
Canadian airlines with Air Canada.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Two December bets on German
rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank could cut interest rates in December, writes Our Markets
Staff. Mr James Cornish, a strategist with County NatWest, said yesterday
that Bundesbank professional staff see room for a percentage point cut in
discount rate then, probably with a smaller fall in Lombard rate as well.
Meanwhile, Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the German Banking Association
and chairman of Bayernhypo, said in a magazine interview that German
interest rates could come down 'at the beginning of next year at the latest,
possibly though in December.'
FRANKFURT rallied from midsession lows, the DAX index closing 3.41 higher at
1,528.67 after a 5.06 fall to 597.37 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover was
little changed at DM4.2bn.
Dealers gave futures markets the credit for the rebound. Heavyweights
featured with Allianz closing DM5 higher at DM1,730 after a DM25 fall to its
low for the day.
Chemicals were mostly flat, but a large selling order from London and
tomorrow's start of the subscription period for a one-for-seven rights issue
saw Degussa drop DM10.30 to DM303 before finishing DM5 lower at DM308.30.
MILAN's privatisation candidates, Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, were
suspended yesterday and interest moved to companies for which similar hopes
had been disappointed. The food group, Sme dropped L149, or 4.1 per cent to
L3,501 and Banca Commerciale by L47 to L2,528.
An early rally on government capital gains moves and privatisation news
faded as thoughts returned to Italy's present financial situation, and a
rise of 1.63 to 376.26 in the Comit index at the official close was replaced
by a fall of nearly 1 per cent in London post-bourse trading.
PARIS advanced in a technical reaction to recent declines, the CAC-40 index
rising 17.41 to 1,774.18 in turnover of FFr1.8bn.
Rhone-Poulenc, suspended limit down in the morning after cutting its
projected 1992 operating profit, saw its certificates close down FFr70 or
11.6 per cent at FFr530 with some 354,000 shares traded.
St Gobain was another casualty, losing FFr13 to FFr516 on expectations of
disappointing first half figures. Air Liquide gained from switching out of
Rhone-Poulenc, putting on FFr19 to FFr745.
Among Nordic markets, SWEDEN's Affarsvarlden index lost 5.3 to 707.2 and
OSLO's composite index advanced 6.09 to 309.33.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel noted on Sweden that, while the collapse in
the financial sector kept sentiment nervous, foreign buyers were seen coming
into the market in late trading, focusing on international blue chips.
Astra, whose A shares gained SKr2 to SKr512 while the B's were unchanged at
SKr503, accounted for 25 per cent of turnover.
Mr Peter Bradshaw, Scandinavian analyst at Robert Fleming, commented that
Oslo remained resilient because of benefits derived from the oil sector and
lower interest rates. Norsk Hydro climbed NKr5.50 to NKr130.00.
ZURICH rose as money market rates edged lower, the SMI index adding 13.7 to
1,792.8. However, Kuoni fell SFr200 to SFr29,700. The travel agency, which
said yesterday that it has been shoring up its takeover defences after its
largest shareholder selling out in May, has risen from a low of SFr13,400
early in the year.
BRUSSELS moved up in light trading, with banks and financial groups stronger
on news that the Dutch insurer, ING, may bid for BBL. The Bel-20 index
advanced 7.16 to 1,073.21.
BBL, which closed at BFr3,275 on Wednesday, was suspended from trading
yesterday amid uncertainty over the possible ING bid.
Elsewhere, Tessenderlo rose BFr40 to BFr6,050 after announcing an increase
in interim earnings in spite of a worldwide downturn in the chemical
industry. In the same sector, UCB rose BFr400 to BFr22,350 after announcing
a rise in first half profit after the close on Wednesday.
AMSTERDAM saw strong interest in ING, down Fl 1.80 to Fl 42.20 on the BBL

<TEXT>
A LATE bout of futures-related selling pared earlier gains to leave the
Nikkei average only modestly higher on the day, writes Neil Weinberg in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained a net 32.92 at 18,908.47 after registering a
day's high of 19,284.12, its best level for more than five months, and a low
of 18,894.22.
Turnover expanded sharply to 600m shares, while rises outpaced falls by 686
to 339, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks finished 1.45 up at 1,414.97, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
was a slight 0.69 firmer at 1,142.22.
After clearing the 19,000 mark with ease, the Nikkei was pulled down by
futures-related selling ahead of today's expiration of September futures.
The afternoon retreat from earlier levels contrasted with the previous day,
when a late round of futures-linked activity pushed the index sharply ahead.
A trader speculated that the financial authorities may be influencing
trading behind the scenes to support the market until after the first half
of the fiscal year account closes at the end of the month. The Finance
Ministry is widely acknowledged to be putting pressure on companies not to
sell shares before that date.
The Bank of Japan is scheduled today to release its tankan quarterly
economic survey. The results are expected to show further deterioration in
the economy, but the market has already discounted this into equity prices.
Speculative biotechnology and pharmaceutical shares, which have performed
strongly in recent sessions, suffered a bout of heavy selling. Meiji Milk,
the day's most active issue, was off Y70 at Y1,120 amid cross-trading, and
Green Cross lost Y100 to Y1,780.
Public works-related shares fared well, with Sumitomo Cement rising Y20 to
Y559 and Osaka Cement Y7 to Y442.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 336.17 to 20,394.79 in volume of 32.2m
shares. Aoyama Trading fell Y430 to Y7,190.
Roundup
POLITICAL worries in Hong Kong provided the main feature of the day
elsewhere in the Pacific Rim region.
HONG KONG finished sharply lower on worries about worsening Sino-US trade
relations, the Hang Seng index recording a fall of 95.44, or 1.7 per cent,
at 5,631.55 in turnover down from Wednesday's HKDollars 1.51bn to HKDollars
1.46bn.
China's retaliation plan against possible US trade sanctions, with a list of
US goods targeted for punitive tariffs, combined with uncertainties over
President George Bush's political future, and leading blue chips, which had
gained in a recent rebound, lost the most. HSBC topped the actives list and
ended HKDollars 1 off at HKDollars 54.50, while Cheung Kong, 40 cents down
at HKDollars 22.40, came second.
NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by continuing weakness in Fletcher Challenge
(FLC). The NZSE-40 index declined by 6.18 to 1,453.78 in turnover of
NZDollars 31.8m.
News that FLC was about to sell a third of its stake in Natural Gas to
Australian Gas Light for NZDollars 152m, and another third to the public,
failed to improve sentiment in the stock, which closed 8 cents cheaper at
NZDollars 2.14.
AUSTRALIA reversed early falls and the All Ordinaries index was finally 5.1
up on balance at 1,484.0, after touching 1,462.3. Turnover amounted to
ADollars 266.3m.
Banks were generally higher, with Westpac advancing 13 cents to ADollars
2.88 after more than 33m rights to the bank's forthcoming share issue were
traded.
SINGAPORE ended firmer but sentiment was dampened in the afternoon by the
Hong Kong performance. The Straits Times Industrial index recorded a net
gain of just 3.53 at 1,372.07.
KUALA LUMPUR weakened after Wednesday's holiday, although motor shares
gained ground on news that the government will ease financing for the
purchase of commercial vehicles. The composite index slipped 2.42 to 584.19
in volume of 56.4m shares.
BANGKOK closed at a four-month high, with banks and finance issues among the
day's main gainers. The SET index put on 8.35, or 1 per cent, to 791.20 in
turnover of Bt12.68bn.
Union Asia Finance, unchanged at Bt113, was the day's most active stock on
turnover of Bt1.13bn.
MANILA's composite index gained 5.53 at 1,412.00 in combined turnover of
195m pesos.
TAIWAN saw very thin trade ahead of its closure for the mid-autumn festival
today and tomorrow, but the weighted index finished 15.38 higher at
3,785.50.

FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Shell-shocked Argentina sees some rays
of hope - But small investors may have been hurt too badly to care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The worst is over for the Buenos Aires stock exchange, shell-shocked after a
45 per cent slide in share prices since June. That, at least, is the
optimistic view being put about by local brokers, who forecast a gentle but
uninterrupted rise in prices for the rest of the year.
Even if they are right, there is unlikely to be much cheering in the narrow
streets of the city's financial centre. During the bull run earlier this
year, crowds blocked traffic as they scanned the big electronic boards which
flash up share prices during trading hours.
These small-time punters, many of whom gambled their life savings on the
stock market or played the derivatives market, panicked when share values
dipped and are unlikely ever to return. Neither are the dozen or so
companies, which were bracing themselves to go public, likely to venture
into such a depressed and unstable market. The strong flow of foreign
capital may not have stopped, but it has slowed to a trickle as foreigners
have become far more cautious.
All this is a great pity. Argentina has missed a golden opportunity to build
a more widely based and more professional equity market, which could provide
capital for companies and reasonable investment for savers. Instead, the
Argentines' deep-seated speculative urges gained the upper hand.
Profit-taking and anxiety overseas about Latin stocks in June sent prices
down. That was the signal for heavily leveraged investors to desert the
market en masse, rather than increase their margins. Banks dumped their
collateral on the stock market and investors locked into futures contracts,
which they thought would yield a real 25 to 30 per cent annual profit, were
left holding stocks as prices fell.
Now the market seems to have stopped for a rest. Brokers, optimistic as
ever, say it will start to move forward and are advising clients to buy.
Analysts also believe prices have hit bottom. Mr Roberto Zorgno of economic
consultants Macroeconomica says: 'From now on, it is a smooth run upwards
all the way to the end of the year.'
Mr Eugenio Reynal, equities chief at investment bank Merchant Bankers
Asociados, declares that the fourth quarter of 1992 will be the best this
year. 'Inflation will fall below one per cent a month and international
interest rates will probably keep falling,' he says. 'The stock exchange is
still not cheap, but I am looking very carefully at some companies. Research
is 90 per cent of the decision now - before it was all instinct.'
About two dozen private companies which include two affiliates of food giant
Bunge y Born, Citibank's local industrial holding company, and paper maker
Alto Parana, have won government approval for their listings and are ready
to go public. But they are holding back, waiting for prices to rise. Mr
Zorgno says equity finance for a blue chip is now twice as expensive as a
local bond placement.
Mr Christopher Ecclestone, an equity analyst, says foreign investors will
turn their nose up at any new stock which is not 'well priced', with
prospective price/earnings ratios of about 10. Three local companies,
including Sevel, Argentina's biggest car company which builds Peugeot and
Fiat cars under licence, have gone public this year. But in each case their
prices have performed badly, making investors wary of new issues.
However, Mr Zorgno warns that his bullish forecast ends in December. He
expects more unrest at the end of the year, when the costs of Argentina's
tough adjustment policies start becoming brutally apparent. He says: 'There
is a big question mark at the end of the year.'

property write-offs

<TEXT>
GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, Australia's biggest food group, has maintained a
resurging operating performance with a 7 per cent rise in net profits,
before special items, from ADollars 100.8m (USDollars 72.5m) to ADollars
108.1m in the June year.
But bottom line earnings were hit by a ADollars 58.6m special loss, against
a ADollars 9.4m profit previously, reflecting property write-downs and
rationalisation costs.
The result came on a small rise in sales to ADollars 4.21bn from ADollars
4.13bn and the dividend is being held at 11 cents a share.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said the result was achieved in spite of
intense competition in Australasian markets which make up 66 per cent of the
company's total business. 'The programme that began two years ago to focus
on core businesses, to sell non-performing and non-strategic assets, cut
debt and reduce overheads is showing through in the improved quality of
pre-tax and pre-abnormal earnings and the strengthened balance sheet.
'In the past two years we have increased earnings before interest and tax by
more than 25 per cent, sold more than ADollars 440m worth of assets, cut
interest costs, increased operating profit before tax by about 50 per cent,
reduced net debt by ADollars 272m and improved gross cash flow per share by
7.4 per cent. Directors are aiming to achieve a minimum growth in net profit
after tax, before abnormal items of 15 per cent in the current year and
believe this would represent a significant improvement given the prevailing
economic conditions.'
The company's biggest earning division remained baking and milling, although
its net contribution fell 13.6 per cent to ADollars 85.1m. Among the best
improvers, the food ingredients division lifted its contribution by 64.7 per
cent to ADollars 41m.

cents and a dividend of 8.6 cents a share was declared.
The company noted that the net profits were 7.3 per cent better than the
ADollars 18.6m forecast at the time of the share issue.
The dividend was in line with the prospectus forecast.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Airlines, the government-owned carrier, yesterday unveiled a fall
into net losses after abnormal items of ADollars 48.36m (USDollars 34.70m)
for the year to June 30, from profits of ADollars 65.99m the previous year,
Reuter reports from Sydney.
Mr Ted Harris, chairman, said the result reflected an extraordinary
operating environment exacerbated by the continuing impact of the recession
on air travel.
There had been a 'bizarre discounting war' during the year, driven by
recessed economic conditions and a serious oversupply of seats in the
domestic airline market.
Australian Airlines, to be sold to the government-owned international Qantas
Airways for ADollars 400m on September 14, booked an abnormal loss of
ADollars 30.16m, compared with an abnormal gain of ADollars 106.60m last
year.
The abnormal loss in the latest year was mainly due to provisions for
employee redundancy costs and diminution of carrying value of certain
aircraft engines and spare parts.
The airline said an extraordinary expense of ADollars 978,000 was booked for
costs incurred in preparation for privatisation.
Sales rose by ADollars 140m to a record ADollars 1.52bn.
'The company again was burdened by excessive debt to equity,' the airline
said. Interest expense was ADollars 86.8m, down from ADollars 98.72m last
year, while the gearing ratio was 85.9/14.1 debt to equity, compared with
81.1/18.9 last year.

SANTOS, the onshore Australian petroleum producer, has defied lower prices
with a 91 per cent rise in net earnings for the first half to June.
The South Australian-based company lifted net profits to ADollars 64.1m
(USDollars 46.1m) from ADollars 33.6m a year earlier, on a 15.8 per cent
rise in sales to ADollars 360.0m from ADollars 310.8m.
The interim dividend is being raised to 10 cents a share from 9 cents.
The directors said the average oil price received by the company eased to
ADollars 26.95 a barrel from ADollars 27.54, but this was offset by an 8.4
per cent advance in sales volume to 16.8m barrels of oil equivalent. Santos'
net debt increased to ADollars 784.8m from ADollars 755.0m, they said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE NATIONALE Investeringsbank, the Dutch banking group with strong links to
the government, has set up an Ecu500m Euro-medium-term note programme, in a
move to expand and diversify its funding base.
The programme will be used to 'tap the international capital markets on a
more systematic basis' than in the past, said Mr Peter van der Lugt, a
member of the DNIB board of managing directors.
The bank's borrowing programme is set to increase from Fl 2.5bn (Dollars
1.57bn) this year to more than Fl 3bn in 1993, as its balance sheet grows.
In addition, demand from the bank's corporate clients for loans denominated
in dollars has increased its need for foreign currency borrowing.
In future, about half of the bank's funding will be sought in the
international capital markets, through the MTN programme and Eurobond
offerings.
The programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley, has been rated AA plus by
Standard &amp; Poor's and Aa3 by Moody's.
Last year, prior to seeking a debt rating, the bulk of the bank's Fl 2bn
funding was in the domestic private placement and bond markets, and in the
Japanese and Swiss private placement markets.

AUSTRALIAN Gas Light Company (AGL), the Sydney-based gas utility, is holding

The result followed a 6 per cent advance in sales to ADollars 896.2m from

in the year, mainly through a ADollars 116m rights issue.
Mr Jack Davenport, chairman, said the company was continuing an orderly
disposal of its property interests, with proceeds of ADollars 52m in the

He said the purchase of a large stake in Natural Gas Corporation for up to
ADollars 139m was consistent with AGL's strategy of growth in industries it

FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand industrial group, yesterday said it will
sell at least a third of its wholly-owned subsidiary Natural Gas Corp to
Australian Gas Light.
A further third is to be sold to the public, raising about NZDollars 305.2m
(USDollars 165m). The news failed to spark interest in Fletcher Challenge
shares which, still under pressure, fell a further eight cents to NZDollars
2.14 yesterday, largely because of its perceived debt problems.
Analysts said NGC's sale had been signalled and taken into account in
assessing the company's outlook.
Fletcher Challenge had intimated in March last year its intention to sell a
large stake in NGC.
The company was extensively restructured over the past 18 months to
facilitate a sale of this type. While an overseas company was expected to
buy a significant stake, the identity of a possible buyer had never been
disclosed. NGC is the main distributor of gas to both commercial and
domestic consumers in New Zealand.

CITIC Pacific, the Hong Kong-listed arm of the Beijing foreign investment
company, has announced a 950 per cent leap in earnings for the six months to
June to HKDollars 439.5m (USDollars 56.9m), compared with HKDollars 41.8m a
year earlier.
The main impetus was the first-time inclusion of profits from its 12.5 per
cent stake in Cathay Pacific and Citic's wholly-owned motor trading group
Dah Chong Hong.
Profits growth was achieved through substantial purchases funded by new
shares, but even on a per-share basis, Citic achieved 114 per cent growth to
39.2 cents, from 18.3 cents.
Cathay Pacific achieved a 13 per cent increase in earnings at the interim
stage. Citic's other airline business, 46 per cent owned Dragonair, saw
strong growth as a result of the booming business environment in China,
where it has the majority of its routes.
Dah Chong Hong's car sales in Hong Kong showed limited improvement in a
competitive environment, but Citic's China connections enabled it to expand
in the mainland.
Telecommunications traffic between Macao and China increased by 32 per cent,
helping to engineer 'remarkable growth' for Citic's 20 per cent owned Macao
Telecom.
The results should improve in the second half of the year as they will
include a full contribution from 100 per cent of Dah Chong Hong. Citic owned
only 35 per cent of the company in the first three months of 1992.
The company recommended an interim dividend of 8.2 cents, up from 6.8 cents
in 1991.

A BELGIAN court yesterday ruled that Accor, the French hotels group, did not
have to reopen its FFr2.2bn (Dollars 458.3m) bid for Wagons-Lits, the
Franco-Belgian tourism company, writes Andrew Hill.
The judgment should draw some of the sting from last month's landmark court
ruling forcing Accor to pay three groups of minority shareholders an extra
FFr950m for their shares.
Accor is appealing against Cannot distribute vertically the August judgment,
which established that the French company - and Societe Generale de Belgique
 -gained control of Wagons-Lits in June 1990, when they bought a 26 per cent
stake at BFr12,500 a share. The bid was launched last October at BFr8,650.
The Brussels commercial court yesterday rejected institutional shareholders'
attempt to reopen the bid, apparently dashing hopes that other investors
might Cannot distribute vertically receive the increased price. Brokers had
estimated the French company might have to pay an additional FFr1.6bn if the
August ruling was extended to all shareholders.
Some analysts believe investors who can prove they held shares in June 1990
might still receive the extra cash. Accor had promised to extend the payout
to shareholders 'in a similar situation' if it finally loses the court
battle.

Lambert (BBL). The offer would value Belgium's second largest bank at
BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.18bn).
The bid would be part of ING's campaign to create a second 'home' market,
but the outcome depends to an extent on the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert, the Belgian holding company which controls 24 per cent of BBL.
GBL is reserving judgment on the offer until a formal bid is launched, but
Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, GBL's deputy chairman and a BBL director, said
yesterday: 'The price (BFr3,600 a share) doesn't seem satisfactory.'
As a first step, ING, which already owns slightly more than 10 per cent of
BBL, is seeking to buy a 6.72 per cent stake held by Unipar and SBH
Investments of Italy. If these and other conditions are met, ING said it
would launch a bid for the rest of the Belgian bank's shares sometime after
mid-October. The offer would be conditional on ING securing at least 51 per
cent of BBL's share capital. The two moves could cost ING up to Fl 3.2bn
(Dollars 2bn) in cash, to be raised in part by an issue of preference
shares.
The Banking Commission, Belgium's takeover authority, recommended the Dutch
company should launch a full bid if it bought the Italian stake. It is the
first time ING has made clear it intends to acquire a majority holding in
BBL following months of wrangling between BBL's various institutional
shareholders about future alliances.
BBL's management favours an international alliance, but others - who may
include Mr Albert Frere, GBL's influential chairman - have pressed for links
with a Belgian institution, such as Credit Communal.
ING's proposals have split the BBL board. At Wednesday's emergency meeting,
directors appointed by GBL, Royale Belge and Winterthur - Belgian and Swiss
insurance companies - were out-voted when they opposed plans to allow ING to
look at the bank's books. They argued it could be dangerous to give the
Dutch group access to confidential information, in case it decided not to
bid. The board said it would decide whether to support a bid once it had
examined the terms of an offer.
Under a syndicate deal among BBL's main institutional shareholders, any
shares must first be offered to GBL, which has a 15-day right to first
refusal. GBL is almost certain to turn down the shares, if it lifts its
stake it will be forced to bid for the whole group.
Unipar has offered its shares to the syndicate members for BFr3,600 each,
against BBL's closing price on Wednesday of BFr3,275.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Management team may buy Spanish
store chain
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MANAGEMENT team has emerged as the most likely buyer of Galerias
Preciados, the Spanish department store chain owned by Mountleigh, the UK
property group in receivership.
The buy-out team, led by the Galerias's financial director, the chief
planning executive and the head of its legal department, is believed to have
reached an underwriting agreement with Caja Madrid, a leading savings bank,
.
Peat Marwick, the receiver, said 'several offers' had been received for
Galerias and there would be 'no fire sale'. A decision is expected in 'weeks
rather than days'.
Mr Michael Babcock, Galerias' general manager, who was appointed by
Mountleigh in February last year, resigned last week and was replaced by Mr
Jaime Uya, a former head of Galerias' marketing division, who is understood
to favour the management buy-out.
The withdrawal of a bid made jointly by Parques Urbanos, a leading developer
of shopping centres in Spain, and by Zara, a domestic textile manufacturer
and retailer, has also stirred speculation of a management buy-out.
Mr Carlos Bardon, chairman of Aserinvest, a Madrid consultancy that advised
the joint bid, said the offer had been withdrawn because Peat Marwick failed
to provide details of an audit on Galerias within the time specified by the
bid.
A feature of the management buy-out offer is that it would be endorsed by
unions representing Galerias' 8,000 employees. The unions have staged
several protests recently, to press for a quick sale and the security of
their jobs.
It is understood that should the managers win control of Galerias, it was
likely at least two stores could be subsequently acquired by Marks and
Spencer, the UK retailing group which is operating in Madrid and Seville and
is seeking to expand further in Spain.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Increase in turnover helps
Fortis climb to Ecu196m

<TEXT>
FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian insurance and banking group, posted a 10.3 per
cent rise in first-half net profit to Ecu195.8m (Dollars 279.9m) on turnover
up 25.2 per cent at Ecu4.5bn.
The strong increase in turnover partly reflects acquisitions such as the
purchase of the group insurance division of Mutual Benefit Life in the US.
After adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, the turnover increase is
equivalent to 15.2 per cent.
Fortis, which is jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium,
said the steep decline in the value of the dollar would influence
second-half results, but it repeated earlier predictions that 1992 net
profit would be slightly higher than in 1991.
Operating profit rose by 18 per cent to Ecu180.2m, with both the insurance
and the banking operations contributing to the gain.
Realised capital gains on investments were up Ecu6.8m at Ecu71.4m. Higher
gains on property and bond investments outweighed lower results on share
sales.
In life insurance, the group's biggest business, operating results were
largely unchanged at Ecu63.1m compared with Ecu62.4m a year earlier.
Operating results in accident and health insurance rose 40 per cent to
Ecu32.8m, reflecting the US acquisition as well as an improvement in results
in Belgium.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc surprises with
profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the French state-owned chemical group, surprised the Paris
market yesterday when it warned it would not achieve its operating profits
target for the third quarter this year. The group's prefered investment
certificates fell 13 per cent from FFr600 to FFr530 on the news.
Analysts said the warning, after assurances four weeks ago that the target
was achievable, had undermined Rhone-Poulenc's credibility, effectively
scuppering short-term possibilities of privatisation or changes in capital
structure.
The company, France's largest chemicals group, estimated growth in the third
quarter of between 10 and 15 per cent. In February, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou,
chief executive, promised that in spite of recession, earnings growth in
1992 and 1993 would be at least 20 per cent.
The group said it had not been aware of the full extent of the shortfall
until after its half-year results in August. One analyst said this suggested
either a sudden downturn, or the company's reporting systems needed
improvement.
The company blamed several factors for the under-performance, but stressed
the weakness of the US dollar. It said although its US healthcare operations
reached its targets, the dollar's depreciation below FFr4.80 had affected
results of its US businesses.
Last year about 23 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc's turnover was in the US. Its
US operations made trading profits of about FFr1.2bn (Dollars 240m) against
group profits of FFr6.2bn.
The dollar's depreciation also hit the group's organic chemical
intermediates operations. The relative strength of the franc made its
products increasingly uncompetitive in America, while cheap US imports were
undermining prices in European markets.
Rhone-Poulenc net income rose 38 per cent to FFr1.55bn in the first half
from FFr1.12bn in the same period last year.

FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: A tentative step towards a
'perfect marriage' - BBL is regarded as a vehicle for combining banking and
insurance services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is probably stretching a point to compare the likely bid for Banque
Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), the Belgian bank, with the fight for Societe
Generale de Belgique in the late 1980s.
For one thing, Internationale Nederlanden Groep has built its 10 per cent
stake in BBL under a regulatory regime which was strengthened considerably
following the shock 1988 bid for La Generale by Mr Carlo De Benedetti. For
another, the Dutch banking and insurance company, which yesterday indicated
it was considering a formal bid, appears to have the backing of most of
BBL's senior management.
But the BBL affair does have some of the same volatile elements as the La
Generale battle: a foreign bidder, the possibility of fierce opposition and
an entrepreneurial figure who holds most of the keys to the outcome.
In the La Generale bid the entrepreneur was Mr De Benedetti, an outsider,
and, eventually, a loser. But in the case of BBL, it is one of Belgium's
most powerful insiders: Mr Albert Frere, chairman and managing director of
Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the holding company which controls some 24
per cent of BBL.
GBL and Mr Frere's influence cannot be overestimated. For example, thanks to
a long-standing shareholder agreement, the holding company could actually
thwart ING's offer before it has been launched - by buying the 6.72 per cent
stake ING has been offered by Unipar of Italy. GBL is unlikely to exercise
its right to buy, because if it did, the Belgian regulatory authorities
would certainly force a bid for the rest of the bank. If anything, Mr Frere
wants to reduce his stake.
But GBL is not necessarily going to cave in to the Dutch. Comte Jean-Pierre
de Launoit, GBL's deputy chairman and a BBL director, said yesterday the
price - which values the group at BFr63bn (Dollars 2.16bn) - seemed
unsatisfactory.
GBL will reserve judgment on the bid until ING has had a closer look at the
bank and launched a formal offer. That could take until the middle of next
month, allowing time for other shareholders to put together alternative
proposals.
One possibility, which Mr Frere is thought to favour, is a link with Credit
Communal, the credit institution jointly owned by all the municipalities and
provinces of Belgium. However, if BBL's management continues to back an ING
offer, such a deal would be difficult to justify.
ING's announcement yesterday was based partly on the recommendation of the
Banking Commission, Belgium's takeover authority, that a bid should be
launched. But the Commission yesterday denied its advice was based on last
month's landmark court ruling which helped establish the definition of
'control' in Belgian takeovers.
In spite of the Commission's recommendation, ING has imposed several
conditions on the bid. It wants to audit the BBL accounts - against the
wishes of directors appointed by GBL, Royale Belge and Winterthur, the Swiss
insurer - and will not go ahead with a full bid unless it can win more than
51 per cent of the bank.
The Dutch group may have gone further than before in stating its intentions
and seems to have a better chance of acquiring the bank than any other
shareholder.
For its part, ING regards BBL as the perfect vehicle to introduce
'bancassurance' - the combining of banking and insurance services in one
company - into the Belgian market. With its 975 branches, BBL is seen as an
attractive outlet for selling traditional insurance products to banking
clients, mirroring what ING is trying to do in the Netherlands.
Abroad, BBL is an interesting partner for ING because of its presence in
Africa, a legacy of Belgium's colonial past. ING's subsidiary NMB Bank,
which this week was renamed ING Bank, has built up a strong reputation in
emerging markets and in trading in third-world debt.
Yet until now ING has proceeded cautiously, fearful of political
sensitivities in Belgium about one of the country's premier financial
institutions falling into the hands of a Dutch concern from north of the
border. ING was quick to say yesterday that if the takeover goes ahead, BBL
will retain its identity and corporate culture while participating in the
development of the Dutch group's overall strategy.
The bancassurance concept was the driving force behind the creation of ING
in early 1991, when Nationale-Nederlanden, the biggest Dutch insurer, merged
with NMB Postbank, the Netherlands' third-largest bank, to create a broad
financial services group. ING's intention has been to expand in Europe, and
it has never disguised its interest in BBL.
Nevertheless, news of the deal was met with some scepticism on the Amsterdam
Stock Exchange, where ING's shares fell to close at Fl 1.80 at Fl 42.2.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bunzl on recovery road with 8.5% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNZL, the paper and packaging group under new management for the last year,
reported a 8.5 per cent increase in profits for the half year to June 30.
The rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20m to Pounds 21.7m, was the first
since 1988. A series of disposals led to a fall in sales to Pounds 619.2m
(Pounds 693.4m).
Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said: 'This is the first solid step to
the road to recovery. After a year we have rationalised the businesses,
disposed of the margin companies and made a few selective acquisitions.'
Trading profit before exceptionals increased to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26m) with
margins rising from 3.7 per cent to 4.4 per cent.
Bunzl's biggest earner, the paper and plastics division, reported increased
profits of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 12.6m). A cost reduction programme in its
key US subsidiary helped push margins up by 1.4 percentage points to 5.2 per
cent.
Profits from fine paper fell from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 7.6m. The group is
expanding in Germany but the overall fine paper market is declining.
Building supplies profits were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 700,000) helped by
closing lossmaking plants. However, return on capital was 4.3 per cent,
significantly lower than the double figures achieved by the other divisions.
Mr Habgood said the business still had to prove itself.
Cigarette filters fell slightly to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.2m). The division
is to open a US plant next year.
Plastic products rose to Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3m), as the improved
performance from US businesses offset disappointing results in Brazil.
Borrowings over the year to June 30 were reduced from Pounds 126m to Pounds
97.7m, representing gearing of 47.8 per cent.
Earnings per share rose from 2.7p to 3.2p. The dividend is maintained at
1.8p.
COMMENT
It is not often that a company which disappointed the City in the roaring
eighties produces better-than-expected results in the difficult nineties. A
well executed disposal programme has enabled the group to concentrate on its
core-businesses. Mr Habgood has made it clear that the weakest parts of the
group, such as building materials, remain on trial. In the meantime paper
and plastics will continue to expand. With forecast pre-tax profits for the
year of Pounds 44m, giving earnings per share of 6.5p, the shares, up 2p to
89p, are on a slightly higher than average prospective multiple of 13.5.
This factors in the weak dollar, affecting a little more than half of
pre-tax profits. It still does not look like a strong buy but the potential
to move forward means the shares are, at the very least, fairly valued.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pendragon increases 7% to Pounds 2.17m
despite disappointing car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENDRAGON, the luxury and executive cars dealer, yesterday announced a
slight increase in interim profits, despite disappointing sales of new and
used cars.
Pre-tax profits increased 7 per cent, from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 2.17m.
However, this did not match growth in turnover, which was up 31 per cent at
Pounds 101m (Pounds 77m) due to acquisitions.
Mr Trevor Finn, chief executive, said new car sales volumes were higher, but
margins had fallen, while sales of used cars declined.
'People are buying, but there are very few emotional purchases taking place.
It is all sensible, commercial buying,' he said.
Business cars such as Mercedes Benz and BMW had increased sales. But luxury
cars - where margins are higher - such as Rolls-Royce and Ferrari continued
to be poor.
With customers delaying purchases, cars were getting older and requiring
more after-sales service. This division increased its proportion of group
revenues to 56 per cent, compared to 44 per cent two years ago.
Contract hire was flat at about 6 per cent of turnover.
Operating profits increased 15 per cent to Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 2.72m).
Higher borrowings to fund acquisitions pushed interest costs to Pounds
949,000 (Pounds 698,000). Mr Finn said borrowings would rise to between
Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m by the year end, less than 30 per cent of
shareholders' funds of Pounds 35.2m.
The interim dividend is lifted 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p) on earnings of 5p
(5.9p)
Pendragon also announced the acquisition of two dealerships - one for Honda
and the other for Aston Martin - for about Pounds 1.3m. The company now has
45 franchises, including two in Germany, compared to 23 two years ago.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bibby seeks Pounds 36m to help relieve
Caterpillar debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural group, yesterday launched a
Pounds 35.6m rights issue to relieve debt taken on with the acquisition of
Spain's sole Caterpillar distributor.
Bibby is 78.9 per cent-owned by the South African Barlow Rand group, which
is taking up its full entitlement in the 1-for-4 issue. The 115p issue price
compares with yesterday's opening of 136p. At the close 16p had been shed.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby's chairman, said the rights issue was
envisaged earlier this summer, when it raised its bid for Finanzauto to
Pta15.9bn (Pounds 88m) to clinch success.
Including more than Pounds 120m of Finanzauto's borrowings and contingent
liabilities, the combined group's gearing had risen to about 150 per cent on
net debt of more than Pounds 240m.
By the end of the financial year in September, with the help of the issue
proceeds, gearing would be down to about 90 per cent, he said. Further
reductions would be achieved by cutting stock and selling non-core assets.
The directors planned to maintain the final dividend at 6.9p to make an
unchanged 9.75p total.
In the six months to June 30, Finanzauto made pre-tax profits of Pta106m,
down from Pta792m. That reflected a 50 per cent fall in the market for earth
moving equipment in Spain.
The balance of the rights issue has been underwritten by Cazenove.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering advances to Pounds 1.55m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE continuing difficult trading conditions in the UK and South Africa -
its two main operating areas - Hall Engineering (Holdings) achieved a 33 per
cent pre-tax profits advance to Pounds 1.55m in the six months to June 30.
Turnover of Pounds 64m compared with Pounds 79.4m.
Total borrowings rose but were still some Pounds 7m lower than at the
corresponding stage last year following good cash generation in the the
second half of 1991. This led to a fall of almost Pounds 1m in interest
payable to Pounds 1.56m.
The company said the continuing predominance of profit from overseas had led
to a build up of advance corporation tax which could not be set off against
current mainstream UK tax.
While the amount paid remains available to be utilised, the company
considered it prudent to write off a large part of this year's ACT costs
against profits. This has led to an assumed rate of tax for the year of 55
per cent.
Earnings per share fell to 2.27p (2.69p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.3p.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said the group continued to enjoy a high level of
reward from its investments throughout the world, in particular the
associated companies in the Pacific Basin.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Lower Exchequer Levy helps LWT rise to
Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE recession LWT (Holdings) increased pre-tax profits to Pounds
13.7m in the six months to June 30, an advance of 41 per cent on last time's
Pounds 9.76m.
An important factor in the rise, however, was a Pounds 2.8m drop in
Exchequer Levy. Profits before levy and interest increased by 9 per cent,
from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 22.7m.
Mr Christopher Bland, chairman, said the results reflected 'higher
advertising revenue, sponsorship and programme income and continued tight
control of overheads, production costs and cash'.
London, and LWT in particular, has been increasing its share of television
advertising. In the year to July 1992 LWT's share was 12.024 per cent,
compared with 11.775 per cent in the previous year with each 0.1 percentage
point accounting for about Pounds 1m in revenue.
Mr Bland also said the company planned to write-off its Pounds 3.2m share of
start-up costs on the London News Network and Good Morning Television
against the profit and loss account.
LNN is the 50-50 joint venture with Carlton Television for a seven-day
London television news operation. And LWT has a 20 per cent in GMTV, which
takes over the commercial breakfast licence from TV-am on January 1.
LWT is also expected to sell its 5 per cent stake in Independent Television
News when new shareholders are brought into the organisation.
Mr Bland expected 'a satisfactory result for the year' although it remained
difficult to predict advertising revenue, there being no real sign of an end
to the recession.
A fixed preferred dividend of 1.969p was paid to holders of preference and
management shares at the end of June. The next dividend at the end of the
year will reflect the previously announced 50 per cent increase in the fixed
preferred dividend.
The share price closed 13p higher at 254p.

FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Deal hint helps the generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two big power generators, National Power and PowerGen, were the best
performers in the FT-SE 100 Index, advancing 9.6 per cent and 7.4 per cent
respectively, on hints that a new coal supply deal with British Coal,
favourable to the generators, is about to be announced.
Negotiation of a new contract with the power generating companies is a
pre-requisite for the government's privatisation of British Coal which is
planned to proceed later this year.
Utilities specialists were not entirely convinced by the rumours and British
Coal insisted that the supply deal is still in negotiation. One analyst said
the rumours perhaps referred merely to proposals put forward by the
generators, adding that there was a significant risk that a new deal may not
be agreed before the September 16 deadline. In that case, the government
would impose its own terms, which might not be viewed favourably in the
stock market.
National Power closed 22 1/2 stronger at 257p after volume of 13m shares,
and PowerGen 18 1/2 up at 270p on 12m traded.
Vickers upset
Engineering group Vickers registered the day's biggest percentage fall after
trading worries and technical factors upset the shares. Problems are said to
have surfaced during trials of Vickers' Challenger 2 tank, and a leading
securities house is reported to have taken a particularly bearish stance
because of continued poor sales at its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary.
A line of stock was said to have been on offer early in the session. At
worst the shares were down 18 but came off the bottom with the market to end
a net 14 off at 84p, their lowest close since January 1985.
Cadbury caution
Foods concern Cadbury Schweppes fell 14 to 415p on reflection of the group's
interim figures. The profits, at Pounds 121.5m, were above the range of
analysts' forecasts but the subsequent meeting provoked caution and
full-year estimates were brought back to the Pounds 335m level. Cadbury said
its main markets were still difficult and exchange rates would have an
increasingly negative impact in the second half.
The effect of Cadbury's results ran over into the performance of United
Biscuits, which is due to release first-half figures today and retreated 10
to 235p.
Full-year profits from pharmaceuticals group Glaxo were in line with
forecasts but the shares closed 7 down on the day at 746p with 7m traded.
It was a classic case of its being better to travel than arrive. The shares
had risen ahead of the figures and would have only improved further on
unforeseen good news.
Goldman Sachs analyst Mr Paul Krikler said of the Pounds 1.427bn profit: 'I
think these are good figures and show the underlying strength of the company
and its products.' Most analysts were particularly pleased by the continued
growth of Glaxo's headline anti-ulcer drug Zantac.
London International Group recovered 12 to 174p after agency broker James
Capel published a note pointing out that the shares were cheap at the
current level.
The latest batch of results from a building sector reeling from dividend
cuts and trading losses provided much needed relief. John Laing turned in
profits slightly down from last year's but generally well ahead of most
estimates, and a same again dividend. The post-results meeting with building
analysts was said to have gone extremely well and the shares rose sharply by
11 to 120p.
Blue Circle declined to 127p before rebounding to finish unchanged at 134p
after delivering half-year profits in line with most forecasts and a
maintained interim dividend.
Amec, however, was the latest of the housebuilder/contractors to chop its
interim, halving the payment and saying the final would get the same
treatment. The stock retreated to 58p before ending a net 7 down at 60p.
Enterprise Oil forged ahead 6.4 per cent, clawing back some of the ground
lost last week when Hoare Govett, acting for a single institution, sold a
2.1 per cent block of the shares.
The rise, which left the stock 19 higher at 317p, followed a maintained
interim dividend and slightly higher than expected net profits. Mr Alan
Sinclair at Smith New Court said that with its production profile growing
the shares 'should be nearer 350p', and offered good long term attractions.
Shell appreciated 6 to 467p as the market displayed its satisfaction with
the near 4 1/2 per cent increase in the interim dividend, at the top end of
expectations and 'enough to keep the market reasonably happy', said Mr Keith
Morris of Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken.
A couple of big trades in National Westminster accounted for much of the
day's business of 4.6m shares and the stock settled 2 higher at 319p.
Prudential was aggressively bought, adding 9 at 245p, still boosted by
Wednesday's excellent results.
Textiles company Coats Viyella receded 10 to 155p after warning that
second-half profits were likely to be affected by conditions in Brazil, poor
UK trading, a weaker dollar and a debt level which remained higher than
expected. Forecasts for the full year were chopped by around Pounds 5m to
the Pounds 125m level.
The world's biggest mining group, RTZ, recovered 22 to 514p after announcing
increased interim results.
Food distributor and manufacturer Booker dropped 22 to 325p after reporting
lower than expected half-time profits. The company also said it had seen no
sign of an end to recession.
J. Sainsbury was under continued pressure, with a seller of 800,000 shares
prompting the stock price to slide 16 to 430p.
A 7 per cent increase in half-year profits and improved dividend at
conglomerate BTR helped the shares jump 19 to 425p in brisk trade of 5.1m.
Paper recycler David S. Smith saw very heavy turnover after Credit Lyonnais
Laing crossed a block of 3m shares, more than 2.4 per cent of the shares in
issue, between institutions at 250p. The stock fell 20 to 253p.
Granada Group dipped 6 to 240p. A leading broker was reported to have bought
a block of around 5m shares at 239p and started selling them at 240 1/2 p.

FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities brush off CBI retail survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALMER foreign exchange markets, firmer government bonds and a batch of
satisfactory trading results from leading British companies helped UK stocks
yesterday to brush off the effects of a highly gloomy survey of retailing
from the Confederation of British Industry.
After some initial uncertainty, share prices staged a rally from the losses
of the two preceding sessions. The FT-SE Index closed 13.1 up at 2,340.6,
near the day's best level.
Nervousness over the dramas seen this week in European currencies continued
to overhang equities. Although a shade easier against the D-Mark when equity
trading closed, the pound had turned in a firmer performance for most of the
day, and this set the stage for a better showing in the stock market.
Share prices opened firmer but lost heart as traders absorbed the details of
the CBI's report on retailing, which said that shop sales fell in August for
the third consecutive month. More worrying for the market was the opinion of
the CBI members that no improvement is in sight this year, which suggested
that any prospects of a consumer-led recovery from the UK recession are even
further away than feared.
However, sterling's rally after touching its D-Mark low on Wednesday night
proved a stronger factor in the stock market and shares resumed their
advance to show a 14.8 rise at 2,342.3 on the Footsie at midsession. But
support faded away in the second half of the session and it was not until
Wall Street opened 11 Dow points higher that London regained its impetus.
Satisfactory trading results from Glaxo, the pharmaceutical stock which
features strongly in almost every fund manager's portfolio, also helped
sentiment, and there were no unpleasant surprises from the rest of the day's
corporate reporting list. Safety first is still the investors' watchword,
and fund managers will have no truck with any stock where the dividend is
thought to be in danger.
Most of the share gains came among those stocks hit hard by company news
disclosed earlier in the week. Seaq trading volume increased to 485.6m
shares and traders believed that the proportion of retail, or customer,
business was higher. Wednesday's Seaq total of 400.9m shares represented
retail business worth only Pounds 761.7m, still unimpressive in terms of
market profitability.
Even the battered retail and consumer share sectors managed to shrug off the
implications of the CBI survey to record a few scattered gains as the
steadier trend in the pound soothed some of the worries regarding the
outlook for UK interest rates and high street spending prospects.
Some London-based securities houses are now daring to ask themselves what
would happen if the French vote 'no' in the Maastricht referendum on
September 20. Some hardy spirits suggest that this might make life easier
for the UK equity market by making a sterling devaluation more possible -
although Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull warned that such hopes could
prove a 'Fools' Paradise'.

FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of favourable corporate results, together with a steadier
performance in fixed interest markets, sent stock index futures forward in
thin trade, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,342, a 10-point premium to
the cash market, and moved ahead, boosted by good results from several of
the UK's leading companies.
The release of a CBI report showing a decline in high street sales for
August led to a mid-morning setback in the contract. This, however, proved
to be temporary and the contract was soon in demand again. It traded in a
tight range of 2,340 and 2,350 for the next few hours before a bout of
profit-taking just before the opening on Wall Street led to a retreat.
The firm start in New York, together with the performance in the currency
and fixed interest markets, once again helped September regain momentum and
it finished at 2,353, up 17 from the previous session and at a 10-point
premium to cash. Turnover, at 7,228, was thin.
In traded options, volume was poor at 26,423. The FT-SE 100 option was
active, trading 10,889 lots. National Power was the busiest stock option,
with 4,514 contracts dealt.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sema near to France Telecom link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday announced
an agreement under which France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications
company, would acquire a minority equity stake as part of an industrial
partnership arrangement.
Mr Pierre Bonelli, Sema's chief executive officer, was in London to announce
the interim results. He stressed that the agreement was subject to approval
by the French government, and details could not be announced until this had
been granted
Sema is anxious to develop its telecommunications business, which accounts
for just 7 per cent of turnover. It confirmed in July that it had been
discussing a partnership with France Telecom. At the same time, Sema
disclosed that Telecom was holding discussions with Paribas, the French bank
which holds a 39 per cent stake in Sema.
If the agreement is approved, Paribas's shareholding is expected to be
transferred to a holding company, which would be owned jointly by the bank
and Telecom, but with Paribas as the majority shareholder.
Sema's interim results showed an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 7.73m (Pounds 6.57m) in the six months to June 30.
Mr Bonelli said the gain reflected improved profitability in several
markets, where, despite difficult trading conditions, the strategy of
focusing on systems integration had enabled Sema to increase its share.
Turnover from continuing operations in the core businesses of systems
integration, facilities management and software products, rose to Pounds
195.4m (Pounds 177.4m), excluding Pounds 23.5m in the 1991 period
attributable to the Sofres market research business, since sold.
The contribution from the systems integration business grew by 11 per cent
to Pounds 149m (Pounds 134m) while facilities management turnover rose to
Pounds 27m (25.6m) and products put in Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 18m).
Following the sale of Sofres, the UK is Sema's largest market. It accounted
for 44 per cent of turnover in the first half.
Retained profits were boosted by the Pounds 15.4m after tax profit on the
Sofres sale.
'Significant cashflow improvements,' together with the Sofres disposal,
enabled Sema to remove all debt from its balance sheet and show net cash of
Pounds 8m at the end of June, compared to Pounds 18m of net debt at the end
of 1991.
Earnings per share increased to 5.3p (4.7p) from which Sema is paying a
dividend of 1.1p (1p).
Mr Bonelli said Sema had managed to improve profitability in France, Spain
and in its joint venture with BAe which was breaking even. Efforts to
improve profitability in other areas, including the UK systems business,
were continuing.
In addition he reaffirmed that Sema was hoping to finalise a partnership
agreement shortly for its costly I-Line industrial software package.
The project, which is being developed by its German subsidiary, been
consuming large amounts of research and development expenditure.

0.83p (0.02p). Net asset value per share at period-end amounted to 60.1p

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gowrings, the motor dealer and leisure group, swung from losses of Pounds
531,000 to profits of Pounds 172,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June
30.
The result was bolstered via an exceptional Pounds 170,000 credit (debit
Pounds 150,000) representing a gain on the sale of a residential park in
Oxfordshire.
Turnover reached Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 23.5m) with the motor contribution up
at Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 20.3m) helped by a 'significant' increase in new car
sales.
The interim is maintained at 1p from earnings of 1.62p (losses 5.9p)

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reece, the cycle manufacturer which also has interests in glass and brick
making machinery, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 183,000 in the half year
to June 30.
That compared with profits of Pounds 540,000 last time and came from
turnover down from Pounds 6.93m to Pounds 6.56m. The company said that were
it not for the acquisition of the distribution depots from Harding Group in
the second half of last year, turnover would have fallen further still.
Cost-cutting measures resulted in a reduction in staffing levels from 259 to
218. Working capital was also being reduced with particular emphasis on
stock reduction.
Losses per share came out at 0.14p (0.33p earnings). The interim dividend is
passed - 0.1p was paid last time.

James Beattie, the Wolverhampton-based stores group, suffered a 26 per cent
fall in profits, from Pounds 2.37m to Pounds 1.76m pre-tax, for the six
months to July 31.
The company blamed difficult trading conditions and a lack of customer
spending. 'The continuing and obstinate refusal of the economy to shake off
the inertia of the last two years remains an abiding frustration,' directors
said.
Turnover, excluding VAT, rose to Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 33m) reflecting
increased selling space, but investment income fell to Pounds 1.04m (Pounds
1.38m).
Earnings were 2.51p (3.4p) per share. The interim dividend is maintained at
1.4p.

The interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p (1.1p) on unchanged earnings per
share of 4p.
The company, which manufactures microporous plastics for clothing and
industrial applications, moved from the USM to the main market in February.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Erith reports losses of Pounds 229,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite 'a further deterioration in the trading climate' Erith, the builders
merchant, achieved a slight improvement at the pre-tax level in the six
months to end-June.
Losses were Pounds 229,000, compared with Pounds 332,000 in the second half
of last year and profits of Pounds 356,000 at the interim stage last time.
Turnover fell by Pounds 657,000 to Pounds 33.5m.
The company said the promised uplift in demand for building materials
following the general election in April had evaporated, while losses arising
from bad debts had once again been a large cost feature, amounting to more
than 2 per cent of turnover.
Losses emerged at 0.34p (0.55p earnings) and the interim dividend is 0.35p
(1.3p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIRDAR reported a 9.5 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds
4.61m to Pounds 5.05m, but said that pronounced recessionary conditions in
the final quarter meant that progress was not as good as had been expected.
Sales at the textiles company in the year to June 30 fell to Pounds 52m
(Pounds 53.5m), but costs and overheads were cut to Pounds 46.2m (Pounds
48m) and interest payable declined to Pounds 910,000 (Pounds 1.15m).
An unchanged final dividend of 3.5p maintains the total at 5.15p on earnings
per share of 5.85p (5.26p).

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Orbicom seeks leave to trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORBICOM, the Shrewsbury-based trading company which during 1990-91 made a
number of deals in Russia, is seeking protection from its UK creditors
through a company voluntary arrangement.
This device allows a financially wounded company, with the agreement of its
creditors, to continue trading while it works its way out of debt.
Newland Mallett Garner Woodbury, the Bristol accountants, will on September
24 present a business plan to the group's creditors outlining how it intends
to clear the Pounds 1.3m debt by the middle of next year.
Formed in 1990 by Mr Mark and Mrs Natalya Jones, Orbicom was engaged in the
barter trading of Siberian liquid natural gas, the sale of Rover cars in
Russia, joint ventures with Russian partners on the development of Yamal
Peninsula oil and gas, the supply of medical equipment to Siberia and
engineering projects in Moscow and Siber-ia.
Mr Jones yesterday attributed Orbicom's difficulties to the fact that 'the
Russians are not paying their way.'
The company was hurt, he said, by the collapse of the Bank for Foreign and
Economic Affairs in Moscow and of Orbicom's LNG business following the
break-up of the Soviet Union.
But, he added: 'We are not closing the company, we are not liquidating the
company, we are not running away from our UK creditors.'
Newland Mallett noted that the potential turnover of Orbicom's signed
contracts in Russia was Pounds 22m, but 'at the moment it is unlikely to
achieve this turnover.'
Orbicom's inability to extract funds from Russia has meant that its deal to
buy 4,800 Montego cars from Rover for onward sale in the Siberian area of
Tyumen fell by the wayside. Only 32 cars were delivered, Orbicom could pay
for no more.
The Orbicom deal offered Rover a route into the Russian market. But at the
Moscow motor show a month ago it said: 'It seems unlikely that this
opportunity will develop any further.'
Rover said yesterday that it was exploring how to set up independent
dealerships in Russia, but that it had no intention of setting up a
manufacturing plant.
Orbicom's ability to satisfy its UK creditors seems to depend largely on an
engineering contract which, Newland Mallet said, it had 'brought back on
line.'
The accountants would not specify the contract, but previously Orbicom
announced a joint venture with Moulinex Swan Holdings to build an electrical
appliance plant in Tyumen and a Moscow city government contract for a waste
recycling plant.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Booker disappoints market with slight fall
to Pounds 32.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food distribution and manufacturing group, yesterday
disappointed the market when it announced a slight fall in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 32.9m to Pounds 32.6m. The dividend is unchanged at
7.5p.
The shares fell 22p to 325p on the news. Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief
executive, said there was no sign of an end to recession and trading
conditions were 'very tough'. However, he regarded the figures as
'reasonably robust'.
The group was responding to conditions by cutting costs and improving
efficiency. 'We must see the environment of today as the one we confront
tomorrow and the day after, and must size ourselves accordingly,' Mr Taylor
said.
During the period Booker increased its bad debt provisions by 36 per cent to
Pounds 8.4m, though Mr Taylor said this had been done on a conservative
basis. There were also some one-off costs such as Pounds 1m for closing a
delivered food depot at Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, although in total
these were about Pounds 300,000 more than in the comparable period.
The figures covered the 24 weeks to June 13, a change in the reporting
period. In the six months to end-June, the old basis, pre-tax profits were
estimated to have been Pounds 36m against Pounds 37.8m.
Group sales rose 4.2 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn and operating profits fell 1.6
per cent to Pounds 43.6m. The interest charge was Pounds 400,000 lower at
Pounds 11m.
Pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 1.6m higher but for the weakness of
the dollar. Profits were translated at Dollars 1.85 to the pound compared to
Dollars 1.62 the previous year.
Pre-tax profits from the food distribution division fell from Pounds 15.5m
to Pounds 12.7m. Catering customers in particular were hit by lower consumer
spending. Since the period ended sales growth has weakened.
The agribusiness division, which includes chicken and turkey breeding,
salmon farming, forestry and mushrooms, suffered a dip in profits from
Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 9.4m.
The turkey business returned to profit, and an upturn in salmon prices is
beginning to come through. However, the mushroom business had not recovered
as much as hoped. There were delays in shipping product from Daehnfeldt, the
seed business.
Profits from fish and prepared foods jumped from Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 9.1m.
The factories were working at high levels of capacity and sandwich sales
were good as people eating out traded down.
Earnings per share dipped from 11.56p to 11.34p as the tax rate increased
from 21.6 per cent to 22.4 per cent.
Mr Taylor said that the group's borrowings should be lower at the year end
than at the end of 1991, when gearing was 76 per cent.
COMMENT
Booker deserves a small prize for broadly maintaining profits when some
other food related groups are suffering declines, but the second half will
be more of a test. Forecasters are picking Pounds 100m as a round number,
against Pounds 103.9m last time, which would give a p/e of about 9.4. The
yield on a maintained dividend is 8.9 per cent, although cover is a bit thin
at 1.6 times. The rating is fair enough as things stand, but Booker's shares
will never perform well until it shows it can turn its well-rehearsed
potential into reality. A hard act in a recession, but one Booker should be
doing more to perfect.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Brit Mohair slips to Pounds 1m at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of British Mohair declined from Pounds 1.18m to Pounds 1.02m
over the half year ended June 30.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 18.5m) with exports accounting for
Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 4.59m). Textiles continued to operate at reduced levels
and profit margins were eroded. However, the engineering subsidiaries and
other activities increased both turnover and profits.
Trading conditions in textiles were expected to remain difficult in the
second half. But the directors said the improvement in profits from
specialised engineering should be maintained and they expected group profits
for the second six months to be similar to those of the first half.

Severfield-Reeve said that unrealistic pricing levels within the
construction industry had forced the structural steelwork group into the red
in the first half.
For the six months to June 30 a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 398,000 was
reported on sales of Pounds 8.66m. That compared with a profit of Pounds
505,000 on sales of Pounds 8.84m.
Losses per share amounted to 2.65p (earnings 3.24p) and the USM-quoted group
is passing its interim dividend - 1p was paid previously.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ocean hit by falling demand for North Sea
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services company,
yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds
20.8m in the six months to June 30.
The decline was mainly due to falling demand for offshore oil support
services in the North Sea as oil companies cut spending.
This knocked operating profits from the company's marine services division,
including the better performing tugs business, to Pounds 12.6m from Pounds
15.1m.
Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, estimated North Sea offshore activity
was 25 per cent down, compared with 10 per cent in South-east Asia.
Freight and distribution maintained operating profits at Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 10.6m).
Environmental services, including UK waste disposal and US laboratory
testing, saw operating profits fall to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.1m) as both
markets declined.
The company's interest bill started to rise again to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds
3.4m). First half capital expenditure was Pounds 32m.
Earnings fell to 9.4p (11.8p) but the dividend is maintained at 4.71p. The
company's shares closed up 2p at 189p.
COMMENT
As if depressed world trade and falling North Sea investment is not enough,
Ocean now has to worry about the dollar's decline too. About 40 per cent of
revenues are dollar related, either stemming from the US or from related
currencies in South-east Asia. There was no marked effect in the first half,
but if present rates continue there could be a Pounds 1.5m hit in the second
half, even after taking into account the company's hedging strategy. The
company rightly points to its mix of businesses and locations, which
guarantee some respite from recession, and steps taken - in the US
especially - to control costs and prepare for the upturn. Like everyone
else, however, Ocean will just have to wait. Full year forecasts of Pounds
45m put the shares on a multiple of about 10. With currency worries flavour
of the month, that looks about right.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella ahead to Pounds 53m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING CONDITIONS in the textiles and clothing industry remained 'harsh',
Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's biggest textiles
manufacturer, said yesterday.
He warned he could not see a recovery in the UK until the summer of 1993 and
that trading would be difficult in the rest of the world outside the US and
Far East. The shares fell 10p to 155p.
The statement accompanied Coats' results for the six months to June 30 which
showed higher operating and pre-tax profits following last year's
acquisition of Tootal, the thread maker.
The acquisition helped push turnover from Pounds 877m to Pounds 1.02bn,
while operating profits rose 37 per cent to Pounds 69.2m (Pounds 50.6m).
However, rising debt and interest charges held profits at the pre-tax level
to Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 48.1m).
The increased number of shares in issue as a result of the deal meant that
earnings per share were unchanged at 4.3p. The interim dividend is held at
3p.
The Brazilian activities fell into the red, accounting for an overall loss
of Pounds 700,000 for South America, compared with a profit of Pounds 6m.
The company blamed high interest rates and inflation. It has spent about
Pounds 3m in exceptional reorganisation costs in Brazil.
The benefits of the merger with Tootal came through strongly in North
America, which showed a 65 per cent improvement in operating profits, from
Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 20.4m. The company merged its industrial and consumer
thread interests and has gained in market share and margin.
North America was also helped by improvements at Dynacast, the precision
engineering business. Operating profits rose from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds
10.7m.
The UK also saw a sharp gain, from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 19.1m, thanks to
cost cutting, including the closure in April of a shirt factory in Northern
Ireland.
COMMENT
There are an awful lot of losses in Brazil for Coats Viyella. More
restructuring costs are to come as the company switches production to Asia;
Coats' sourcing of clothes from outside western Europe has risen from zero
to more than 20 per cent in two years. Gearing is going in the wrong
direction, the company is caught in an ACT trap, the UK economy is dreadful
and cash flow is slow. Fortunately for Coats, the Tootal merger benefits are
arriving and the US is producing cash. Next year, perhaps, a stronger dollar
will make the US yet more valuable, help out over ACT and protect domestic
markets a little. The company will be lucky to make Pounds 120m pre-tax for
the full year, compared with Pounds 111m last year, and earn 11p a share for
an above sector average p/e of 14.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Imports hit Bernard Matthews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW PRICE turkey imports from the European Community and US producers were
blamed yesterday by Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat processor, for
a 65 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits.
In the 28 weeks to July 12 the group reported profits of Pounds 2.16m
compared to Pounds 6.16m in the 1991 period, and halved its interim dividend
to 1p (2p).
Turnover fell by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 65.7m (Pounds 73.28m) and earnings
per share fell to 1.33p (3.33p).
Profits were also depressed by interest charges of Pounds 29,000 compared to
interest receipts of Pounds 157,000 in the 1991 period. Mr Bernard Matthews,
chairman, said the sharp reduction in profits was expected following his
profits warning earlier in the year.
He said that following poor Easter sales the group was experiencing
extremely difficult trading conditions, especially with sales of whole
turkeys and turkey meat. 'These difficulties are being caused by the very
low prices offered on the UK market by both EC and US producers.' Although
the company has successfully launched a range of new value-added products,
and is setting up a marketing organisation to introduce its branded products
into other EC countries, Mr Matthews said that in the short term the UK
market is likely to remain depressed. He warned that full year profits will
probably be less than half those in 1991 when profits were Pounds 13.2m.

Losses at TLS Range, the USM-quoted vehicle rental group, were cut from
Pounds 267,000 to Pounds 77,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30.
Turnover was virtually static at Pounds 4.7m.
Net finance charges accounted for Pounds 543,000 (Pounds 736,000). Losses
per share emerged at 0.5p (1.58p). There is again no interim dividend.
Increased demand and improved margins achieved in the first half were not
maintained in July and August and further steps were taken to reduce
overheads.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Branson rail plan on brink of collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group to start an experimental express
train service in competition with British Rail appeared to be on the verge
of collapse yesterday.
Mr Branson said it had emerged during talks with BR that charges likely to
be imposed by the corporation would be too high for the Virgin service to be
commercially viable.
Virgin is now likely to drop its plans to operate trains on the
London-Edinburgh-Glasgow route until after parliament has approved the
privatisation of BR.
Mr Branson had planned to be the first private-sector operator of express
trains on BR's tracks by starting up a service next year before the
privatisation legislation.
He says the plans are foundering because BR says that, in addition to other
charges, its statutes would require Virgin to compensate the corporation for
revenues lost as a result of the competition.
'It's like being told you can compete with British Airways on transatlantic
routes as long as you compensate them at the end of the year for all the
profits they have lost,' Mr Branson said.
He said he did not believe BR was being deliberately obstructive. 'I think
they have had a good, genuine look at our plans, but they have come up with
some problems which may be insurmountable.'
Mr Branson said the relevant statutes would be superseded by privatisation
legislation. He still hoped to introduce a main-line passenger service, but
the hitch would mean a delay of at least a year.
The apparent collapse of Mr Branson's plans is the second blow in a
fortnight to the government's plans efforts to encourage private-sector
participation in running trains.
At the end of last month Charterail, a private-sector freight operator, came
close to calling in the liquidators.
BR said it could not comment on the discussions with Virgin because they
were confidential, but the talks were continuing.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Major stands by 'hounded' Mellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Mellor, the heritage secretary, was said last night to retain the
'full confidence' of the prime minister following the latest newspaper
allegations about his personal life.
Amid speculation among Tory MPs and some ministers that he is now struggling
to hold on to his seat in the cabinet, Downing Street said Mr Major had no
intention of asking him to stand down.
Senior ministers voiced concern, however, about what one characterised as an
attempt by sections of the media to 'hound' Mr Mellor from office. While
most of his colleagues believe that the heritage secretary will remain, some
acknowledge that if the press campaign continued there would be a question
mark over his future.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, telephoned Mr Mellor at lunchtime
yesterday to offer personal backing and to quash suggestions that
Conservative Central Office had discussed his future with his local
constituency party.
The prime minister's officials dismissed as 'insignificant' a report in The
Daily Mail that the heritage secretary had been provided with occasional use
of a London flat and a car by Mr Elliott Bernerd, a property developer. A
senior official said Mr Major had been informed of the friendship and was
satisfied that there had been no 'impropriety'.
Government officials said that Mr Mellor had used the car provided by Mr
Bernerd during the election campaign but had made the proper declaration to
electoral officers. There had been no direct discussion between Mr Major and
the heritage secretary.
The report followed a series of detailed allegations in other newspapers
centring on Mr Mellor's alleged affair earlier this year with Ms Antonia de
Sancha. Friends of the heritage secretary, who this week insisted that he
had no intention of standing down, said the latest allegations were part of
a tabloid circulation war. Mr Mellor has been subpoenaed to appear as a
witness in a libel action against Mirror Group Newspapers that begins in the
High Court on Monday, John Mason writes.
Ms Mona Bauwens, daughter of a Palestinian Liberation Organisation official,
is suing MGN over comments in The People of September 2 1990 that Mr Mellor
and his family should not have gone on holiday with her in the aftermath of
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, when the PLO supported Iraq.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Troubles fail to deter Greens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Green party were in resilient mood as they gathered for their
annual conference in the Wolverhampton Civic Centre at a turbulent point in
the party's history.
Mr Guy Woodford from Malvern Hills said: 'No, we're not finished. Our
policies are right. I am an eternal optimist.'
Two weeks ago Ms Sara Parkin, the party's chair, announced that she would
not stand for re-election. Referring to the resistance of local activists to
central organisation, she said: 'I didn't want to be responsible for
something I couldn't control.' Another five of the 11-strong executive are
also standing down.
Membership has been falling - green pressure groups have a combined
following of several million but the Green party has only 8,000 members, the
same as in 1987 and a long way below its June 1990 peak of 19,000, which
followed its winning 15 per cent of the vote in the 1989 European elections.
Many members feel betrayed by Ms Parkin's comments. The Malvern Hills branch
said yesterday: 'The goings-on at the national level are not just
embarrassing, they are a very damaging insult.'
Others were more dismissive. Mr Frank Nickels from Warwick said yesterday:
'We never wanted a leader in the sense of a figurehead.' He found the
disruption at the top irrelevant. 'I am green, I want to be greener, and if
I can grow my own tobacco next year that will be perfect.'
Undeterred by its troubles, the conference plunged into a four-day agenda on
land distribution, the Kurds, elections in Guyana and 25 motions on the
party's internal organisation.
It remains a conference like no other. Sessions start with a minute's
silence for 'attunement'. Workshops end with an invitation to those who have
stayed silent to share their thoughts. Babies' nappies are changed on the
conference office floor, mothers breastfeed while delivering views on the
economy, and there are no plastic cups.
Then there was the imminent arrival of Mr David Icke. The former BBC sports
presenter and former Green party co-chair, who caused consternation by
announcing that he was 'an aspect of the Godhead' will address a meeting of
the Pagan Greens tomorrow.
Ms Jo Graham from Loughborough, one of those who invited him, said: 'David
will be talking economics this time. He doesn't talk on that level - of
channelling energies - any more.'
In her view, shared by many, the recent fall in membership was inevitable.
Mr Peter Barnett from the party's head office said: 'Many people joined
around 1989 thinking that we would save their local forest and then found
out we're out to ban the bomb, leave Nato and legalise cannabis.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / Bout of face-saving strikes Ulster talks: The significance
of the Democratic Unionists' walkout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Democratic Unionist party reaffirmed yesterday that it would take no
further part in talks on the future of Northern Ireland until the Irish
government's constitutional claim over the province was on the negotiating
table.
The walkout comes as the talks reach a crucial point. After months of
preparatory meetings and preliminary skirmishing, the core issues - the
Irish Republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and whether the
unionists will accept some all-island dimension to an agreed solution - are
about to be discussed at the talks.
The DUP's withdrawal has cast a shadow over the entire talks process. A
plenary session went ahead yesterday without the party.
The Ulster Unionist party made clear that it would not be joining the DUP in
withdrawing from the process, but would continue in discussions 'with the
aim of forcing the Irish government to withdraw its legal claim to the
territory of our part of the United Kingdom'.
A meeting between the British and Irish governments is scheduled to take
place in London today.
The apparent impasse in the talks appears to have much to do with the art of
face-saving. Any agreement will require concessions from the four political
parties and the two governments involved, but all know that a concession
made too soon, or too readily, might bring a backlash from their political
constituencies, not to mention the paramilitaries, and maybe the end of a
political career or two.
The week after next, the talks are due to move from Stormont, the seat of
government in Northern Ireland, to Dublin. It will be a symbolic moment, and
one of great sensitivity for hardline unionists such as the Rev Ian Paisley,
the DUP leader, who have consistently cold-shouldered their southern
neighbours.
Determination to maintain the confidential nature of the talks has caused
difficulties with some rank-and-file unionists who feel they are not being
kept sufficiently appraised of developments. Some DUP members resigned when
Mr Paisley agreed to sit at the same table as Dublin ministers.
So when the constitutional issue was placed fourth of a four-item agenda at
this week's talks, the DUP apparently felt it was time to spell out more
clearly its attitude to the Irish constitutional claim.
The fact that Mr Paisley and his deputy, Mr Peter Robinson, left two
delegates keeping their seats warm at the table - one of them Mr Paisley's
daughter Rhonda - strengthens the view that the fuss may be little more than
playing to the loyalist gallery.
Once the item is reached on the agenda, the two leaders have hinted that
they will be back at the table, but probably only if that point can be
reached next week, before the talks move to Dublin.
There is little indication yet that Dublin is prepared to meet Mr Paisley's
demand on the constitutional issue without something in return from the
unionists. The unionists have given no indication publicly or, it seems,
within the negotiations, of what reciprocal step they might take.
The Irish government insists that its territorial claim is up for
negotiation, but also that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'.
To make unilateral concessions to the unionists before their arrival in
Dublin would be very difficult politically.
Few doubt that the Fianna Fail-led coalition would be able to deliver a
constitutional change as long the unionists and the British government can
make real concessions to protect the interests of the minority community in
Northern Ireland.
The constitutional change that Mr Paisley is seeking would seem to be within
his reach, but he is also under pressure to reveal some of his own
negotiating cards at the table.
The art of face-saving requires that he does so without appearing to have
done so.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Lamont may stir Tory Euro-fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY tensions over Europe may be highlighted at the party conference next
month with a speech at a fringe meeting by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
He will speak about Europe at a conference event organised by the
Conservative Political Centre.
His reputation as a closet Euro-sceptic will ensure that his words are
carefully scrutinised for the slightest hint of deviation from the
government line. He has not yet had to make statements expressing loyalty to
the government's position on Europe.
The Tory leadership yesterday continued its efforts to keep as much as
possible of the party united on Europe. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman,
emphasised the need for European Community governments to heed public
opinion.
In a speech in London to MEPs of the European People's Party, the
centre-right group, Sir Norman said people wanted 'a Europe which accords
with their interests and does not trample over their traditions and national
identities'.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Public expenditure committee shapes up for spending battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's public expenditure committee will meet for the first time
next week, although the occasion is expected to be largely procedural.
The Treasury has yet to decide whether spending ministers should be invited
to attend to make their cases - as they were under the 'star chamber'
arrangements - or whether they should simply submit papers.
Bilateral discussions between spending ministers and Mr Michael Portillo,
the chief secretary, will still be continuing when the committee meets, so
the results of those discussions will wait until the second meeting, which
is scheduled for the beginning of October.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will chair the committee, whose membership
the Treasury had originally hoped could be confined to 'trusties' - Treasury
ministers or ministers with very small departmental budgets.
However, Mr John Major insisted the spending ministers should be represented
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary. The committee will submit options to the cabinet, which
will decide on fund allocation between departments.
Increases in the public-sector borrowing requirement are to be limited by
linking spending to the expected low economic growth in the next few years.
The cabinet has agreed that for 1993-94 the government should keep to the
planning total of Pounds 244.5bn announced last November.

FT  11 SEP 92 / BR faces complaint of abuse of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTERAIL, the private freight train operator, which is on the brink of
financial collapse, has lodged a formal complaint with the European
Commission alleging an abuse of monopoly power by British Rail.
The complaint has been made under Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome which
prohibits abuse of a dominant market position and which can lead to fines
and action in national courts.
Charterail ceased operations at the end of last month when it ran out of
money. It said BR was to blame for charging too much for the locomotives and
crew that hauled Charterail's freight trains over BR's tracks.
The company says the rates charged were consistently higher than indicative
prices quoted by BR when Charterail was formed. They also failed to fall as
road haulage rates did.
Last night Mr Robin Gisby, Charterail's managing director, said there were
two main grounds for the company's complaint to the EC. He alleged that in
some instances BR had refused to quote rates for new traffic, and in others
had not quoted fair prices based on an objective view of their costs.
Charterail's complaint appears to be aimed at putting pressure on BR to
negotiate a new set of lower rates that will enable the company to go back
into business.
Mr Gisby said Charterail had succeeded in finding investors who were
prepared to plug the company's funding gap if a viable business could be
re-established.
'The missing element is the new rate structure from BR,' he said. 'We are
waiting to hear from BR on what basis they are prepared to restart the
operation of our trains. If it is on the same basis as it was two or three
weeks, ago, the numbers will clearly not add up.'
In that event, Mr Gisby said that the company would go into liquidation.
Charterail's complaint to the EC is doubly embarrassing for BR because the
corporation is a 22 per cent shareholder in the company. The rest is owned
by a range of private-sector interests led by GKN, the industrial group.
BR said it would look at any new proposals from Charterail, but its
rail-freight operations were unsubsidised and it was under an obligation to
cover its costs.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, yesterday
predicted that two more InterCity routes - between Plymouth and Penzance and
Crewe and Holyhead - would be cut.
He also told delegates at the TUC Congress that privatisation was not
inevitable. 'Rail privatisation will be the poll tax of this parliament,' he
said.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Early hurricane claims to Lloyd's put at Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES FROM Hurricane Andrew are expected to cost the Lloyd's non-marine
underwriters less than Pounds 500m, a senior underwriter said yesterday.
Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of the Lloyd's Non-marine Underwriters'
Association, said overall insured losses on land from the hurricane, which
late last month devastated parts of Florida and Louisiana, would probably
amount to between Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.55bn) and Dollars 8bn.
Losses offshore, sustained as a result of damage to oil rigs, for example,
will also affect Lloyd's, although marine underwriters have yet to provide
estimates of potential losses.
Although reinsurers are likely to pay Dollars 6bn of the loss, Lloyd's
underwriters are expecting to pay no more than 15 per cent of that amount,
leaving them with maximum losses of Dollars 900m.
Mr Lloyd-Roberts said Lloyd's was less exposed to Hurricane Andrew than it
was to Hurricane Hugo, which caused claims of more than Dollars 5bn in 1989.
US insurers had bought less reinsurance after rate increases. In addition,
the spiral reinsurance market, in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies
reinsure each other's high-level catastrophe exposures, had collapsed.
The market would be able to gauge the extent of claims from Andrew much more
quickly than with Hurricane Hugo.
'We're looking at a finite situation,' Mr Lloyd-Roberts said. 'We know how
much reinsurance the US companies have bought.'
By September 9, London market reinsurers had paid claims of Dollars 152m.
Lloyd's underwriters had paid out Dollars 72.96m.
Lloyd's said yesterday it hoped that 'loss review' investigations into
syndicates that were overwhelmed by claims from Hurricane Hugo and other
catastrophes between 1987 and 1990 might be ready in the next few weeks.
A loss review team investigating the losses of two of those syndicates - 216
and 833/834, which were managed by the Devonshire agency - issued an interim
report last month.
The report said that Names - the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's
underwriting - on syndicate 216 had already received cash calls amounting to
Pounds 56.86m for 1989 and Pounds 14.14m for 1990, while those on syndicate
833/834 had been asked to pay Pounds 21.73m in 1989 and Pounds 11.04m in
1990.
Separately, the Lloyd's council has approved new regulations that will allow
syndicates to make greater use of quota share reinsurance bought from
outside the Lloyd's market.
Syndicates will be able to underwrite up to 125 per cent of their premium
income limit (the maximum amount of premiums they are allowed to underwrite)
if they have re-insurance in place to cover all premiums above 100 per cent.
The arrangement will allow syndicates to underwrite more business at a time
of rising premium rates.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology: Gemini's exchange rate hope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of the Gemini Project, an international astronomy collaboration,
could depend on foreign exchange rates.
Gemini aims to be the first of a new generation of large, eight-metre
diameter mirror telescopes needed to take infra-red astronomy into the next
millennium. Two telescopes are required to scan the entire sky and the
proposed sites are at Mauna Kea on Hawaii and Cerro Tololo in Chile. Both
telescopes should be operational by 2000.
Half of the Dollars 176m (Pounds 89m) in funding for Gemini has been
contributed by the US, 25 per cent by Britain and 15 per cent by Canada,
leaving 10 per cent to be found. Chile has sent a letter of intent offering
another 5 per cent, but the remainder still needs to be raised.
While several countries have expressed interest none has so far committed.
In view of previous successful joint ventures, a formal invitation has been
issued to Australia which is still deliberating over whether to accept.
Even if no new parties come forward, the project could be rescued by the
weak dollar - a suggestion proposed by Lawrence Randall, Gemini's project
manager. As the project is budgeted in US dollars, Canada and Britain
between them would have sufficient funds to buy the remaining share simply
by taking advantage of the relative strength of their currencies.
However, Geoffrey Moore, head of public relations at Britain's Science and
Engineering Research Council, said: 'We are confident that another country
will take up the shortfall. If we did take advantage of the exchange rates
we would have to bear the cost if future rates became unfavourable and we
cannot take that risk.'
The new telescopes will have four times more light-collecting capacity than
their predecessors so that known objects can be surveyed in a quarter of the
time and new, fainter objects become visible.
The viewing range has been considerably increased, extending from
ultraviolet through visible to infra-red light at wavelengths well beyond
those used previously. Also, the mirror arrangement within the Gemini
telescopes allows larger measuring instruments to be installed.

FT  11 SEP 92 / People: McKinnon joins Morrow, again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, the combative boss of gas industry regulator Ofgas,
seems to be making the most of his friendship with Sir Ian Morrow.
Since they met many years ago through the Scottish Institute of Chartered
Accountants - of which they have both been president - Sir James has now
joined two boards of which Sir Ian is chairman. Earlier this summer,
McKinnon, who has said it may not be appropriate (in the light of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission's wide-ranging inquiry into British Gas)
for him to see out his term to September 1994, became a non-executive
director of evening primrose oil manufacturer Scotia Holdings (previously
Efamol). Now he is also joining the board of MAI, the money-broking to media
conglomerate of socialist peer Lord Hollick.
Sir James, finance director of Imperial Group from 1967-1986, says he has
always been 'fascinated' by the money markets, and relishes the idea of
getting back into the 'mainstream business'. The prospect of television -
'from the other side' of the camera' - also interests him. 'I am intrigued
about how you go about acquiring and keeping a franchise.' MAI holds a
majority share in Meridian which has successfully bid for an ITV franchise.
While some have seen him as a possible successor to 80-year-old Sir Ian in
the chair at MAI, Sir James, himself 63, vigorously denies any such
ambitions. 'He (Sir Ian) is incredibly energetic and capable, and looks as
if he will go on for ever.'
With Sir Ian playing the Liberal Democrat to Lord Hollick's Labour views,
Sir James will not divulge what colour he will contribute to the
kaleidoscope of political views already represented on the board of MAI. 'My
Ofgas job renders me apolitical,' he says cagily.

FT  11 SEP 92 / People: Edington says can-do for British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel is raising the stakes in its struggle to fight back against
the threat from aluminium by poaching its new technical chief, 53-year-old
Jeff Edington, from Alcan Aluminium in Montreal.
British-born Edington, a career metallurgist who travels on an American
passport, joined Alcan in 1982 after spells at the Batelle Memorial
Institute in Ohio and Cambridge University, where he was a fellow of Darwin
College. As Alcan's vice president, research and technology, Edington played
a big role in developing the group's aluminium can business.
In terms of size, the world steel industry overshadows aluminium by a factor
of 40. But the growth in consumption of aluminium outstrips that of steel
and Edington sees part of his job as redressing the balance.
'Almost everything I learned in aluminium can be transferred across,' says
Edington, who replaces the recently retired Frank Fitzgerald as British
Steel's managing director, technical.
In terms of beverage cans, he says that aluminium has already won the battle
in the US and is now in the process of mounting a serious assault in
Britain. As British Steel's top technical man, Edington will play a big part
in developing new steel products to meet the challenge.
Providing steel for the car industry is another big area where the
competition between steel and aluminium is very visible. 'There is a lot of
life left yet in steel,' says Edington, who is very conscious of the
environmental challenges of providing more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Edington, who has spent over half his working life in North America, refuses
to say whether he took a pay cut to return to Britain. However, he says he
was educated at taxpayers' expense in Britain and feels strongly that a
healthy steel industry is important if Britain's manufacturing industry is
to prosper.
If the infrastructure in Britain, the US and eastern Europe really is to be
rebuilt, then Edington is optimistic that steel can become a growth industry
again.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology: Now that's fast - Fujitsu's new supercomputer is
capable of 350bn calculations a second
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer company, is set to take a spectacular lead
in the race to build the world's most powerful computers.
Yesterday it announced a new supercomputer which it claims is more than 20
times faster than its nearest competitor, a staggering margin in a business
where millions of dollars are spent to yield only a few percentage points'
improvement in performance.
The new machine makes extensive use of superfast chips fabricated in gallium
arsenide, a substantial technical first for the Japanese manufacturer.
Gallium arsenide chips are faster than silicon but are expensive and
difficult to make.
If the machine is as fast and as easy to operate as Fujitsu says, it will
mean that for the first time the Japanese have a significant technological
advantage over the American companies which have dominated the supercomputer
market for the past 20 years.
It will confirm the fears of US experts who three years ago predicted that
Japan would have caught up with the best US companies by 1994 and lead the
market by the turn of the century.
The power of supercomputers is measured in terms of their ability to carry
out arithmetical calculations - 'gigaflops' or billions of floating point
operations a second. Fujitsu says its new machine, the VPP500, runs at a
maximum of 355 gigaflops. By comparison, the fastest US-built commercial
supercomputer, the Cray C90, runs at only 16 gigaflops.
The Japanese company believes its new technology will enable it to build a
computer capable of more than a thousand billion calculations a second
(teraflops). Tadashi Sekisawa, Fujitsu president, said this week: 'We expect
to offer 10 teraflops' performance before the end of the decade.'
Computing power of this magnitude is hard to appreciate. The VPP500 is aimed
at the so-called computational 'grand challenges' including global warming,
drug development, seismic data processing, vehicle crash simulation and
weather forecasting, problems which mean hours of processing time on the
largest machines available today.
Sekisawa says the new machine 'will permit scientists and engineers to
tackle and solve hitherto unapproachable computational problems'. The
company will begin shipping the new machines early next year; it believes it
can sell 50 units over the next three years at between Dollars 10m and
Dollars 50m a unit.
But can the VPP500 fulfil the ambitious performance claims Fujitsu is making
for it? Until the first systems are installed and running it is impossible
to say, but experts warn that Japanese supercomputers have a reputation for
running faster on paper than in the data centre. They point out that while
peak speed may be impressive, overall performance when tackling real-life
problems is often at a much lower level.
Some supercomputers manage an average of only 5 per cent of their maximum
speed on some problems. Cray Research has managed to hold its 63 per cent
share of the world supercomputer market as much because of the quality of
its software as the speed of its hardware.
Fujitsu argues the novel design of the VPP500 guarantees sustained
high-level performance. Supercomputers today typically get their speed from
either vector processing, where the same mathematical operation is applied
to strings of numbers, or parallel processing, where many processing units
carry out calculations simultaneously.
The new Fujitsu machine, however, combines the two approaches in a
technology called 'vector parallel processing'. The VPP500 comprises from
seven to 222 vector processors arranged in parallel. Each processor, which
is about the size of a small suitcase, can deliver 1.6 gigaflops. The
processors are linked together by a network through which data can be
squirted at 800 Mbytes a second.
The future of supercomputing is thought to lie in 'massively' parallel
systems where hundreds or thousands of small, simple processors work
together. They are powerful but difficult to program.
The VPP500 uses a relatively small number of processors, each roughly
equivalent to a conventional supercomputer. Programming is, therefore,
fairly straightforward. The operating system is Fujitsu's version of Unix,
UXP/VPP and the system supports Fortran 77, the standard scientific
programming language.
Fujitsu is introducing its new machine to a supercomputing world in turmoil.
Cray Research of the US, a vector processing specialist, is still the market
leader, but it no longer sets the agenda. It has been forced to introduce a
less powerful, entry-level, model to compete with 'minisupercomputer'
manufacturers, companies making machines which deliver much of the power of
a supercomputer at a fraction of the cost.
At the other end of the scale it has been forced to answer the challenge of
massively parallel computer makers, among them companies as different as
International Business Machines and the semiconductor manufacturer Intel.
Cray is planning to launch next year its own design of massively parallel
machine based on Digital Equipment's Alpha chip. The Alpha chip is the
fastest available, but Digital has yet to demonstrate its ability to make
the chip in quantity.
Meanwhile Seymour Cray, designer of the world's first supercomputer, has run
into trouble. As the driving force behind Cray Research until he established
Cray Computer Corporation in 1989, he has had to scale back plans for the
construction of the Cray-3, an innovative machine based on gallium arsenide
chips and novel cooling techniques. His first  - and only - customer for the
new computer, a US government laboratory, cancelled the order at the
beginning of the year because of uncertainties over progress.
Gallium arsenide chips run at about three times the speed of their silicon
equivalents but they are tricky to manufacture. Fujitsu, one of the world's
most skilled semiconductor makers, has managed to fabricate gallium arsenide
chips for the VPP500 with 25,000 logic elements on each chip. It cools the
system with nothing more complicated than air and water.
The Japanese company has been in the supercomputer business since 1977, and
today has 50 per cent of the Japanese market and 23 per cent of the world
market.

Sensor technology is becoming increasingly important in the beverage
industry, and now producers have a quick way to distinguish between the
various fluids in the pipes and tanks that form an important part of their
manufacturing process.
A new German opto-electronic process, being launched in the UK by Carel
Components, measures the refractive index of liquids to indicate what fluid
the tip is in contact with.
The product, says London-based Carel, has a specific application in CIP
(clean-in process or clean in-place) because it can sense the difference
between beer, water and cleaning fluids. Carel Components: UK, 081 946 9882.

Just as commuters habitually find something more interesting in their
fellow-passengers' newspapers than their own, workers in open plan offices
often find it hard to resist stealing a glance at their colleagues' computer
screens.
But help is at hand for those who handle confidential or proprietary
information, or workers in open plan or public areas, who cherish their
privacy. A new screen filter from 3M is claimed to be the first to combine
privacy, glare reduction and radiation protection.
The 3M Privacy Plus Filter allows only an operator seated in front of a
computer screen to see the information displayed. The privacy protection
feature uses 3M 'microlouvre' film, containing microscopic louvres which
make the screen look dark when viewed from the side.
The filter, along with three others offering combinations of the three
features, is made of glass, with a simple 'squeeze' adjustment to custom-fit
them to the monitor. They will be sold initially through accessory
catalogues. Action Computer Supplies: UK, 0800 333333; Orion Media

FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Camera eyes up the photographer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Photography buffs can now buy a camera that senses what part of a picture
the photographer's eye is focused on, writes Michael Kenward.
The new Canon EOS-5 incorporates an intelligent automatic focusing system
which homes in on the area of the image where the eye is looking. A small
infra-red light-emitting diode in the single-lens 35mm reflex camera
illuminates the eye as it looks into the viewfinder.
Sensors in the camera analyse the pattern of reflected light and discover
where the eye is looking. The camera's electronics then pick out which of
five focusing points is nearest to where the eye is directed, and the lens
automatically focuses on that point.
The EOS-5 sells for Pounds 499.99 and goes on sale in the UK next month.
Canon: UK, 081 773 3173.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Tourist Authority no doubt expected its campaign to promote
London as a friendly and affordable city to be greeted with scepticism. So
accustomed have Londoners become to running their city down that they barely
notice they are doing it. Mr William Davis, the BTA chairman, yesterday
declared London to be a great capital, apparently forgetting his own annual
report in which he trotted out the usual complaints about a litter-strewn,
tired and tarnished city.
It is this view of London which is tired and tarnished, but if the BTA
cannot point that out, who can? Foreigners, perhaps. A poll published by
Business Traveller magazine this week named London as the world's best city
in which to do business. Earlier this summer, Le Monde's UK correspondent
wrote approvingly of London's green spaces, gardens and village-like
suburbs.
Londoners tend to reward such praise with incredulity. Perhaps the BTA can
find a way of turning Londoners' unique self-laceration into a tourist
attraction.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Hard choices for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl did not promise that German unity would be a bed of
roses. Two years ago, he warned that the eastern and western halves of the
country faced a 'fatal, if not catastrophic' risk of being divided by the
economic pressures of unity. The prescience of that warning now looks
remarkable - as does the chancellor's insouciance in not taking better heed
of it. Mr Kohl's greatest mistake was in telling Germans in the east that
the economic benefits of unification would become apparent relatively
quickly, and in promising Germans in the west that the benefits would be
generated without additional taxes. Neither forecast proved correct.
To make unification a success, Germany will need to maintain public sector
transfers from west to east of at least DM100bn (Pounds 35.8bn) a year until
the end of the decade. The monetary strains caused by high German public
sector deficits are exporting deflation throughout Europe, and are now
raising the risk of recession at home too. To prevent further damage, Mr
Kohl has no choice but to organise a sounder method for financing recovery.
The 'solidarity pact' he is trying to negotiate with industry, trade unions
and the opposition Social Democrats is a worthwhile effort to spread the
burdens. All participants, however, face some hard choices. This time, they
must not be shirked.
First, significant reductions in the central government budget deficit
during the next few years will not be possible without specific measures to
raise extra revenues. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is relying above
all on spending curbs to reduce the deficit by 1995. But, in a bleaker
economic climate, the assumptions underpinning these plans could soon look
unrealistic.
Mr Waigel may be able to avoid an across-the-board tax increase of the sort
temporarily put into effect in 1991-92. But he urgently needs to take charge
of a cacophonous debate about alternative financing sources. A plan for a
compulsory bond to tap the better-off, launched by the subtle mind of Mr
Wolfgang Schauble, the conservative parliamentary floor leader, has been
brushed aside for the moment, but Mr Waigel may have to give it serious
thought.
Second, wage restraint in both east and west Germany is now high on the
agenda. Excessive wage increases in east Germany have been a prime factor
spurring high unemployment there. Trade union agreement to shelve the accord
to bring pay for east German metalworkers up to west German levels by 1994
should be an important part of any 'solidarity pact'. If the price for this
agreement is higher taxes in the west, then this price is worth paying.
Third, Mr Waigel must clear up the opacity caused by multiple 'shadow
budgets' for unity financing established during the last two years. Worries
about fast rising public indebtedness will not be assuaged as long as doubts
persist over the size of the debts being created in the east which will
eventually be borne by central government.
In trying to form a cohesive policy to master Germany's challenges, Mr Kohl
cannot avoid some degree of understanding with the Social Democrats. Without
this, much-needed restructuring of the financial system for distributing
resources around the 16 German lander will be impossible. An SPD imprimatur
will also be necessary for any deal with the unions.
The Social Democrats, resentful at Mr Kohl's high-handedness towards them
during the unity negotiations two years ago, are in no mood to bargain away
cheaply support for an unpopular government. Mr Kohl refuses to have any
truck with the idea of a Grand Coalition with the SPD, and the Social
Democrats themselves are still in the preliminary phase of weighing up the
benefits and disadvantages. Yet if Germany's difficulties persist,
power-sharing between the two main parties, at some stage before the 1994
general election, may prove to be the only way to forge a national
consensus.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Apple-pie curriculum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not know what you expect of our schools, but I want children to be
stretched. They should be taught mathematics. They must know when
calculators go awry. In Britain they should become proficient in the native
English tongue, which is still a useful dialect of standard American. They
should be in touch with western culture, which implies an acquaintance with
at least the Bible, Shakespeare and the best of modern literature. A little
science, a smidgen of history and a dip into French, German or another
European language would all help. It may be too much to hope for, but it is
desirable that they also absorb a set of values, a sense of the difference
between right and wrong.
Ten years ago such a menu of aspirations would have been regarded as
eccentric, the product of an incorrigible elitist. Some would have labelled
it reactionary, or neo-fascist. Today it is becoming standard pedagogic
fare. Only the promotion of religious education and basic values is still
seriously disputed. This historic turnabout is the product of a decade of
debate that followed a challenging speech by the last Labour prime minister,
Mr James Callaghan, in 1976. At that time the avowed purpose of
'child-centred' classroom teaching was to facilitate self-awareness. Today
it is to impart knowledge, or to transfer skills. The development of the
self may follow.
This revolution in what happens in the classroom was made possible by Mr
Kenneth Baker's education act of 1988, but the process is incomplete. The
new machinery will not settle down until nearly the end of the century. In
consequence we are in the midst of a decade of turmoil in education. There
is no escape. The alternative was to continue with a system of state
schooling that betrayed the children it ought to have served. All political
parties are now agreed that that was not acceptable.
The pace of change is quickening. Mr Baker was a poor administrator, so the
implementation of his act was left to a department that did not believe in
telling teachers what to do. Early versions of the national curriculum were
unworkable. His successor, Mr John MacGregor, started to tackle this but had
little time in the office. It was the next minister, Mr Kenneth Clarke, who
packed the statutory advisory bodies invented by Mr Baker with people who
believed in the changes the government wanted, rather than good folk the
civil servants knew.
I recite this history in order to put the recent headlines scored by the new
education secretary, Mr John Patten, in their proper place. Fate has indeed
smiled on Mr Patten. He may succeed, but it will be at least partly because
his predecessors handed him success on a plate.
He finally made it to the cabinet on April 10, well-placed to take forward a
programme arrived at after 10 years of debate and four years of hesitant
starts. He found his new department at a new address, to which Mr Clarke had
moved it over Christmas. It was the ideal occasion for a politician's coup.
The old-think networks of officials have been swept away. What was called
the department of education and science is now the department for education.
A white paper - a new mission statement - was published in July. A new
high-flying permanent secretary will arrive next January. Previous education
ministers were frustrated by the department. Now, Mr Patten believes, the
revolution has conquered the apparatchiks themselves.
This increases the chances that he will be the author of a huge
administrative blunder. His populist plan for most schools to opt out of
local authority control has little to do with education. It is pure Tory
ideology. Yet enhanced political control over his department also makes it
almost too easy to pick up applause for pursuing his job with rigour. He
will review the standards of the examining boards. He will send the science
curriculum back to be tightened up. He can even be quite daring. Before the
April election a plan for all 14-year-olds to display some knowledge of
three specified Shakespeare plays, plus a good grasp of grammar and
spelling, would have been loudly assailed as narrow and restrictive. This
week just such a proposal was put forward. There have been mere squeaks of
protest.
He is also able to make a bow to moralist Conservatives, the equivalent of
'family values' Republicans in the US. At lunch in Cambridge on Monday Mr
Patten asked Sir Hermann Bondi, the president of the British Humanist
Association, for advice on teaching values. Sir Hermann, who has founded a
group for that purpose, opened the discussion to other guests, including the
Catholic Bishop of Leeds. Their apple-pie notions may find their way into
the curriculum before long. They seem harmless: do as you would be done by;
respect the person and so on. I do not scent incipient authoritarianism
here, not yet. But I have to report that Mr Patten has taken to referring to
himself, we must hope in jest, as 'the nation's headmaster'.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Milk shaken
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ONE OF the most humdrum British household commodities
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
milk - is about to undergo a shake-up with proposals to reform the Milk
Marketing Board for England and Wales. But the milk industry is having
difficulty agreeing a new structure to satisfy itself, let alone consumers.
The MMB has its origins in the early 1930s, when it rescued dairy farmers
from the depression by giving them monopoly power over milk supplies. Since
then the board and the Dairy Trade Federation, representing the dairies and
processors, have enjoyed a cartel, which has survived several shocks,
including the UK's entry into the European Community.
In 1984 the introduction of EC milk quotas halted the MMB's production
expansion. In 1986 a government-commissioned report criticised aspects of
Dairy Crest, the MMB's wholly owned subsidiary which has 25 per cent of the
UK market for manufactured dairy products. The report was prompted by
concern among other dairy companies that the MMB had become not only a
monopoly supplier, but also the biggest processor of milk.
It was clear that reform was needed. But when the MMB was invited by the
government to come up with reform plans in 1990, its only proposal was for
the MMB to transform itself into a voluntary co-operative. This was
unacceptable both to the EC Commission and the DTF, which criticised it for
replacing a statutory monopoly with a voluntary one.
Some urgency was added by a challenge to the monopoly from the EC Commission
over sales of low-fat milk, which now account for 40 per cent of liquid milk
sales. The EC gave a 'reasoned opinion' that the MMB did not hold the
statutory right to buy and sell low-fat milk. Mr John Gummer, agriculture
minister, rejected the opinion, but used his decision to put further
pressure on the DTF and MMB to agree on reforms.
Last month the MMB published another proposal to turn itself into a single
voluntary co-operative, this time promising to hive off Dairy Crest. The DTF
is still not happy with the plan. Last week it highlighted some of the more
obvious concerns, not least that the co-operative would be incompatible with
the free-market policies of the present government, since it expects to
attract 80 per cent of the country's 30,000 dairy farmers.
Aside from these worrisome aspects, the MMB has given no details of the type
of contracts it expects the co-operative to have with dairy farmers. Its
attempts to reform Britain's arcane milk pricing system also collapsed last
month, leaving no obvious alternative. Behind these pricing problems is the
fact that the milk market is not free because supplies are restricted by the
EC's quota system. But this distorting system of production control also
reduces the importance of eliminating the MMB monopoly, since greater
competition in the market for milk cannot affect the quantities supplied.
The only part of the MMB proposal welcomed by the DTF is the spinning off of
Dairy Crest. But again, crucial details are lacking, such as the basis on
which shares in the company will be allocated to farmers who supplied the
MMB in the past.
The agriculture ministry has said it will make no comment until after
September 18, the deadline for responses to the MMB's proposals. At the
moment a bill is supposed to come before Parliament this autumn. In theory
it could be given the Royal Assent next June, leading to the end of the MMB
monopoly in mid-1994. But with the present deadlock, this looks a wildly
unrealistic timetable. It is time for the ministry to take a firmer lead. If
it has insufficient ideas of its own, perhaps the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission should be asked to lend a hand.

FT  11 SEP 92 / How dreams turned to dust: Two of Scandinavia's insurers
have fallen victim to the effects of deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life is full of surprises' has proved a grimly prophetic advertising slogan
for Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, which last month sought
protection from its creditors.
Scandinavian financiers and regulators have been shocked by the
deterioration in the fortunes of two of their biggest insurance companies,
the latest victims of turmoil in the financial markets.
The upheaval is in part a result of the forces unleashed when the markets
were deregulated in the 1980s. Insurers, like the banks which experienced
difficulties last year, have struggled to come to terms with deregulation,
lost money on credit insurance and suffered from the general fall in
confidence this year in Scandinavian property and equities.
Their problems are vividly illustrated by the story of two men: Mr Jan Erik
Langangen, the ousted head of Uni Storebrand, and Mr Per Villum Hansen, his
counterpart at Denmark's Hafnia, who dreamed of creating financial
conglomerates big enough to withstand competition from bigger rivals as
Europe's internal trade barriers came down.
Uni Storebrand and Hafnia have been pushed to the brink of collapse by the
ill-fated efforts of their leaders to merge or take over two companies,
Skandia of Sweden and Baltica of Denmark.
During 1990 Mr Hansen built up a DKr4.5bn (Pounds 418m) stake in Baltica,
controlling more than 34 per cent of Denmark's biggest insurance company. In
the same year Mr Langangen merged Uni and Storebrand, creating Norway's
biggest insurance company.
Last autumn he persuaded Mr Hansen to join a scheme to take over control of
Skandia, and by November 1991 they had spent more than SKr7bn (Pounds 688m)
for a combined stake of nearly 43 per cent of the Stockholm-based insurer.
But neither Baltica nor Skandia was keen on linking with smaller rivals. The
resulting market uncertainty led to sharp falls in Skandia and Baltica's
share prices, leaving Uni Storebrand and Hafnia nursing significant
investment losses. Last month Hafnia joined Uni Storebrand in seeking
protection from its creditors.
'In the eyes of the world there must be something seriously wrong,' says a
senior banker in Copenhagen. 'But the insurance business is not a
catastrophe. Speculation is the problem. Uni and Hafnia have been destroyed
by tycoons.'
Mr Per Villum Hansen, the 46-year-old chief executive of Hafnia who resigned
in April, fits the tycoon bill most neatly. He is described by industry
colleagues as a 'natural gambler'. A racehorse owner and a regular at the
Sunday meetings at the Klampenborg racetrack near Copenhagen, Mr Hansen
wanted to use the financial muscle of Hafnia to transform Danish corporate
life.
The son of a provincial blacksmith, he joined Hafnia's finance department in
1976 after a spell in the finance department of AP Moeller, the blue chip
Danish shipping and energy company. After he took over as chief executive in
1980, Hafnia stepped up its investments in equities. In Scandinavia's bull
markets of the 1980s the company's assets grew strongly, from DKr35.8bn to
DKr58.2bn between 1987 and 1990.
Mr Hansen also spearheaded a diversification at the traditionally
conservative company, establishing a real estate operation and a merchant
bank in the late 1980s, which worked on two successful ventures - M D Foods,
a dairy company, and Tulip, a meat producer - to develop part of the
country's agribusiness industry. When Mr Hansen turned his attention to
Baltica, he had become a powerful figure in Denmark's financial scene.
For the company's biggest shareholders, Mr Hansen could do no wrong. 'The
board had complete confidence in this guy. He was admired like a small god,'
says one insurance industry observer.
By contrast Mr Langangen, the 42-year-old boss of Uni Storebrand until July,
is regarded as a visionary whose aims reflect his links with the public
sector and government. Mr Langangen honed his management style at Statoil,
the country's publicly owned oil company, which has enjoyed almost limitless
resources to finance its expansion.
There, he forged close links with government, especially with Labour party
prime minister Gro Harlem Bruntland, to promote the merger of Storebrand - a
company which he joined in 1983 - with Uni. An expert on Norwegian classical
literature who frequently quotes its most famous playwright, Henrik Ibsen,
Mr Langangen persuaded the government that Uni Storebrand's expansion plans
were in the interests of the Norwegian economy and could help the country
redress Sweden's traditional domination of Scandinavia.
Despite their differences, the two men decided to co-operate in their joint
bid to take over Skandia. All the expansion plans - including Uni's merger
with Storebrand and Hafnia's assault on Baltica - were based on the idea
that big was not only beautiful but necessary for survival in post-1992
Europe.
'If Hafnia hadn't done anything we would simply have been run over by the
European competition,' explains a colleague of Mr Hansen at Hafnia.
The aims of the two were summed up in a simple slogan: 'If you are strong
you can choose. If you are weak you will be chosen.'
The Skandia deal, however, was an unprecedented gamble. First, by acquiring
such a big combined stake in Skandia, both Uni Storebrand and Hafnia became
increasingly dependent on the region's insurance market, both as insurance
companies and investors. At the end of 1991 Hafnia's combined investments in
Skandia and Baltica of more than DKr7bn were almost double its shareholders'
equity of DKr3.9bn.
In addition, Skandia's unusual shareholding structure - in which voting
rights are restricted - made it a high-risk target. The provision limiting
the maximum votes of any shareholder to 30 meant, according to one analyst,
that even after acquiring more than 40 per cent of the shares, Uni and
Hafnia had 'no more votes than the Skandia typing pool'.
Moreover, neither Mr Hansen nor Mr Langangen discussed his ideas with Mr
Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia's chief executive. Mr Wolrath says there was no
contact with Uni Storebrand before September 1991 when Mr Langangen told him
by telephone that he had acquired 11.4 per cent of the company's share
capital.
In October Mr Wolrath went to a meeting of Skandia's 'major shareholders' in
Oslo. But in what was evidently a bad-tempered meeting, little progress was
made. 'Nothing was presented on the plans and ideas of Uni Storebrand. It
made the meeting completely useless,' says Mr Wolrath.
'Mr Langangen was extremely pushy. He had all the answers. He had a study
drawn up by management consultants and said we could just get on and
implement it.'
Three weeks later, in November last year, Uni Storebrand and Hafnia
completed their purchase of 43 per cent of Skandia's shares and held a press
conference to announce the formation of what they termed 'Nordic
Co-operation'.
Mr Langangen and Mr Hansen calculated that Mr Wolrath would, at least, cede
a minimum of three seats on Skandia's 14-man board to the new investors. But
that proved a disastrous mistake. Even though relations thawed when talks
between the three companies continued in December, the disagreement and
confusion served to frighten off investors.
By the time the three companies came close to agreeing a joint strategy in
April, based on the complete integration of all three companies' Nordic
operations, the markets had already baulked at the notion of Scandinavian
insurance co-operation.
Uni Storebrand and Hafnia had acquired their Skandia shares at an average
price of more than SKr200. By April this year the price had sunk to SKr123,
leaving both Uni Storebrand and Hafnia with investment losses totalling
almost SKr3bn.
Disgruntled international investors were in no mood to provide the fresh
capital necessary to push through a merger, however. Mr Jonathan Walker of
Baring Securities says: 'Our clients are not interested in Scandinavian
financials at any price.'
Mr Johan Hiller, the investor relations manager of Skandia, says the affair
has paralysed the markets. 'Everything has been forgotten apart from who
controls Skandia. It's a soap opera in a way.'
Worse was to come. In April Skandia agreed a complex financial deal which
would have given it majority control of Hafnia. The deal fell through when
Hafnia's shareholders objected at the imposition of Swedish control.
Instead, they agreed a restructuring, sacked Mr Hansen and sought to
recapitalise through a DKr2bn rights issue.
The financial markets were unimpressed. The share prices of all four
companies continued to slide. Skandia sank to a new low of SKr91.50 in July.
Baltica's share price fell from DKr790 at the beginning of last November to
DKr458 by the end of June, compounding Hafnia's problems. Fresh investment
losses at Hafnia stemming from the overall fall in Scandinavian equity
markets wiped out the whole of the new capital within six weeks.
By last month the liabilities of both Hafnia and Uni Storebrand exceeded
their assets, and both companies were forced to suspend payments to
creditors. Creditors, shareholders and state-appointed administrators now
have a few months in which to sell the companies' assets. If they are
unsuccessful, a long and complex liquidation of life insurance and non-life
insurance operations is in prospect.
Critics accuse Mr Langangen and Mr Hansen of overambition. Skandia's Mr
Wolrath says they had a false impression of their own power. 'They were so
big in their home markets that they thought they were Batman.'
But defenders of the two men point to deeper causes. A former colleague of
Mr Langangen says domestic media reaction reflected Norwegian suspicion of
individual achievement and entrepreneurship. 'It shows that what Norwegians
call Jante Loven is alive and well,' he says, referring to a fictional moral
code devised by the Scandinavian novelist, Aksel Sandemose.
The code, which governs social relations in a Norwegian rural community of
Jante, has among its commandments: 'Don't think you are something because
you are not; don't think you are wiser than us; don't imply that you are
better than us.'

Did Italy's new treasury minister Piero Barucci have a hand in choosing
Credito Italiano, the country's sixth biggest bank, as its first main
candidate for privatisation? After all, he spent two years as joint managing
director at its Milan HQ before his surprise summons to replace Guido Carli
at the treasury.
Among his plans for the company was to give it a higher profile. Although
respected and profitable, the 120-year-old bank has always tended to
languish in the shadow of its slightly bigger Milanese sister, Banca
Commerciale Italiana. Pushing Credito to the forefront through privatisation
could hardly be bettered as a way of making it more prominent.
On the other hand, the signs are that the decision was at least as much
forced on the government as that it was Barucci's choice.
At last weekend's European Community finance ministers' meeting in Bath,
Barucci's counterparts congratulated him on the new Italian government's
attempts to get to grips with the country's vertiginous budget deficit and
to defend the lira. But they also emphasised that the best indicator of the
government's good intentions would be to take the bull by the horns and
privatise a prime state-owned asset in earnest.
Four days later, the treasury obliged.

The cabinet mole didn't say whether ministers expressed any views on Sir
Anthony Jacobs's interesting pump-priming proposal to give tax relief on all
personal sector borrowing. But provided they've been able to tear their eyes
away from the tabloids, they can hardly have missed his ads in the serious
press.
Sir Anthony, who sold his British School of Motoring for Pounds 40m a couple
of years ago, spent Pounds 25,000 on 'An Open Letter to the Chancellor of
the Exchequer'. Sir Anthony is not an economist or a crank. He is a
chartered accountant who used to be a big wheel in the Liberal party and was
once an adviser to John Pardoe. However, he stresses that his ideas were not
vetted by any political party. They may be daft, but they are his own and he
is not representing any vested interests.
But why waste money on an advert? Sir Anthony never has much difficulty
getting to see ministers. 'They don't skimp you with their time, you can
normally get an hour, ' he says. But the problem is the civil servants.
'They don't like radical ideas and as soon as you leave they spend their
time demolishing them,' says Sir Anthony who was concerned his idea wouldn't
see the light of day.
So he has decided to go public with his views. 'I've never done anything
like this before, and will probably not do again,' says Sir Anthony. Good
luck to him.

So what subject aroused the keenest discussion in yesterday's meeting of
Britain's cabinet - the first since the summer vacation? Not the recession,
nor even the turmoil on the foreign exchange markets, Observer's mole
advises.
True, Norman Lamont explained his strategy for beating off the currency
speculators. But his recital excited no more than nods of assent and
murmured hear-hears when John Major congratulated the chancellor.
The hot topic was what the assembled company had done on their holidays. It
turned out that the great bulk of them had visited France and wanted to air
their personal judgments of the Maastricht referendum campaign.
But not even Euro-sceptic Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, was
bold enough to suggest that their personal straw polls pointed to a No vote.
Instead, the general consensus was that President Mitterrand could count on
a narrow victory. The only one to venture that the result would be a
resounding Yes was William Waldegrave, and he hadn't been to France.
The name of the minister who then spoilt the fun by reminding the cabinet of
the entirely unexpected humiliation of President de Gaulle in the late 1960s
must sadly remain anonymous.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter: Index will further the cause of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is with dismay that I note your imminent introduction of a medium
capitalisation index to be followed by a family of real-time market sector
indices ('New UK share indices to join existing benchmarks', September 2).
These new members will further the cause of derivatives which are already
threatening to undermine the functioning of the underlying market. At the
same time institutional managers will be further opting out of their
responsibilities by increasing the scope for index-tracking. By definition
these funds can only react to previous price movements, thereby exaggerating
trends and increasing volatility undesirably.
Performance management will become more detailed but the additional
statistics may only serve to confuse. In my years as a fund manager, we were
paid to attempt to outperform the future rather than to concentrate on
jobbing backwards. Emphasis on historic mathematics must also be very
discouraging to the management of quoted companies and, I suggest, provide a
classic case of the tail wagging the dog]

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to the feature, 'India: a penitential ride to Madurai' (August
29). Intelligent travel writing presupposes prior spade-work by the writer;
a degree of sympathy with the subject; and, above all, humour that is
neither frivolous nor offensive. I am afraid the feature fails on all
counts. Why ever did Mr David Pilling visit India? Surely, it could not have
been his intention to dissuade people from visiting India, since he appears
to have secured facilities from the Indian Tourist Office.
This is hardly the place to give him a rudimentary idea of Hinduism. Suffice
to say that it is not 'like a railway system' - whether Indian or some
other. No religion deserves such an uninformed and unwarranted comment.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter (2): Smaller companies put at risk by insider dealing
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From P G EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The proposed UK legislation on 'insider dealing' has all the hallmarks
of taking a sledge-hammer to crack a nut. For the objective of catching the
tiny minority (1 per cent?) of sharp operators, the whole UK investment
industry's future appears to be put in jeopardy at a time when the City of
London is trying to become the financial centre of Europe.
For nearly 50 years UK fiscal policies have favoured investment in housing
rather than industry and by institutions rather than individuals. Regular
deficit financing by UK governments and generally lax funding policies have
led to constantly higher rates of inflation than our main industrial
competitors. This in its turn has resulted in a significantly higher price
for long-term capital and consequently a lower level of investment by our
industry.
To these existing burdens the government now apparently wishes to turn
investment based upon knowledge and regular appraisal into a crime.
Isn't it about time that the mandarins of Westminster and Whitehall got off
our backs and out of our pockets and gave the country a chance?

FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter (1): Smaller companies put at risk by insider dealing
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM DRAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The 'Tougher legislation on insider dealing' (September 9) has serious
implications for smaller quoted companies. It will lead to a further
withdrawal by institutions from funding smaller and medium-sized UK
companies, just at a time when their requirement for funds is at its
greatest and their ability to raise money from the banks is limited.
Institutional investors in smaller companies have become increasingly
concerned by the lack of liquidity in the shares of these companies. The
effect of the legislation will mean that neither stockbrokers nor
institutions will be able to have direct contact with companies except in
respect of published information, and the institutions' compliance
departments will probably insist that institutions do not buy shares on the
recommendation of brokers, given that the brokers might have had some direct
contact with the company.
For these reasons, institutions will withdraw from direct investments in
smaller companies, liquidity will decline, and institutions will be
unwilling to fund placings, rights issues, etc.
In the long term, no doubt, methods of financing can be devised similar to
those in the development capital industry, which will provide equity funds
for companies. However, by the time this change in our system occurs many
worthy companies will either have gone to the wall or have been unable to
pursue attractive commercial opportunities through lack of funding.
I strongly advise directors of smaller quoted companies to lobby the
government to change its mind.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter: Unrealistic rates of exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAG LINDSKOG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'Nordic paths diverge' (September 9), on the Finnish
devaluation you write of the similarities between Finland and Sweden: 'The
two countries confront remarkably similar problems . . . It follows that
their respective exchange rate policies are unlikely both to be right.'
Your first statement is correct. Finland and Sweden face debt deflation,
negative growth and rising unemployment. Just like the UK.
Your second statement is wrong. After the breakdown of the Bretton Woods
system and throughout the 1970s, the average exchange rate between the
Swedish krona and Finnish markka was 1.15. In the 1980s the markka soared to
1.55 in 1990.
Such sustainable appreciation can only be justified by very favourable
Finnish cost development in comparison with Sweden. However, OECD statistics
show costs developed in similar ways. Accordingly, the Finnish markka
gradually became substantially overvalued during the 1980s.
How could this go on for so long and collapse so quickly? The answer is the
earlier huge bilateral trade with the former Soviet Union which sheltered a
large part of Finnish industry from foreign competition. The warning signals
from rapidly increasing costs became too weak, but blew up when the
bilateral trade recently ended.
The new exchange rate between Sweden and Finland is again 1.15 and fully
justifiable. That is not true of the Finnish decision-makers' handling of
the exchange rate policy, however, as they have tried in vain to maintain an
unrealistic rate.
The natural collateral is that the Swedish krona should not be devalued. But
the central bank's extraordinary monetary policy must be given support from
a tighter fiscal policy.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Day of judgment for Thailand's generals: The winners in
Sunday's general election will inherit a divided society and a series of
economic problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devils and angels are evenly matched in the battle for Thailand's soul,
according to the latest opinion polls.
In the language of Bangkok liberals, the 'devil parties' competing in
Sunday's general election are those which formed a coalition government
after the previous poll in March, chose the army chief as prime minister and
supported the military when troops killed 50 pro-democracy protesters in the
capital in May.
The 'angel parties' backed the demonstrators and succeeded in forcing the
resignation of General Suchinda Kraprayoon from the premiership. Their
victory led to the dissolution of parliament and this weekend's election.
Pollsters and analysts, grappling with the complexities of an election
contested by 12 parties, have made conflicting predictions about the
outcome. But all agree that the next Thai government will again be a fragile
coalition between parties on both sides of the political divide.
Whoever emerges as the new prime minister will need to attempt to heal the
wounds inflicted on society by the May violence. They will also need to
redress the planning failures which have left Thailand and its fast-growing
economy with an inadequate education system, a poor transport infrastructure
and a deteriorating environment.
If the 'devils' do well on Sunday the most likely candidate for prime
minister is Mr Chatichai Choonhavan, a former premier who now leads a party
called Chart Pattana (National Development).
Mr Chatichai presided over a notoriously corrupt administration until he was
overthrown by Gen Suchinda in the February coup. He is therefore opposed by
foreign businessmen and by the increasingly liberal and middle-class
population of Bangkok.
Among the so-called angels, there are three probable candidates for the
premiership: Mr Chamlong Srimuang, leader of Palang Dharma (Moral Force); Mr
Chuan Leekpai, who heads the Democrat Party; and Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
leader of the New Aspiration Party.
Their chances are thought to have improved since the March election, which
left them with insufficient seats to form a government. Distrust of the
military and weariness of corruption seem to be spreading to provincial
towns from the liberal strongholds in Bangkok and southern Thailand.
However, the loose alliance of anti-military parties forged during the May
crisis has been weakened by rivalry between Palang Dharma and the Democrats.
Mr Chamlong, an anti-corruption campaigner and devout Buddhist, is accused
by some Democrats of leading the Bangkok marchers to their deaths in May in
pursuit of his own political ambitions. Mr Chuan is criticised by members of
Palang Dharma for failing to take bold action outside the confines of
parliament at the crucial time.
Mr Chavalit has difficulty articulating clear policies and his party's
reputation has been damaged by allegations of vote-buying.
But despite the talk of heaven and hell, the policies of the parties on each
side of the political divide are often indistinguishable. Most MPs are
elected on the basis of their personal influence rather than their party
affiliation.
With Mr Chamlong as prime minister, there would certainly be a drive against
corruption. He has also promised to stamp out the country's vice trade by
enforcing existing laws against prostitution.
Three of the four leading contenders for the premiership are retired
generals - Messrs Chatichai, Chamlong and Chavalit - a useful experience for
a prime minister wanting to keep the military, and its civilian critics,
under control.
The armed forces themselves, which have launched or attempted to launch 18
coups d'etats in the past 60 years, are keeping a low political profile,
although some of the generals are openly resentful of attempts to curb their
power since May. They have been stripped of many of their business sinecures
by the interim government of Mr Anand Panyarachun. Only this week the Anand
administration took control of Thai Airways International, the partially
privatised national airline, from the air chief marshals who long dominated
the board and regarded the company as their private fiefdom.
The economy has survived this year's political turmoil with less damage than
originally feared, and the latest official estimates suggest that real gross
domestic product will rise by slightly more than last year's 7.5 per cent.
Businessmen and economists, however, are concerned by the failure of
successive governments to implement long-term plans to improve education and
infrastructure. Professor Ammar Siamwalla, president of the Thailand
Development Research Institute, the country's leading think-tank, has been
analysing the evolution of this problem.
He told a pre-election seminar that Japan's experience showed a country
could 'have sustained economic growth continuing on with a relatively
backward political system'. Thailand's economy, he said, had grown rapidly
despite corruption because a system was in place which allowed professionals
to control macro-economic policy while elected politicians ran ministries -
such as transport and telecommunications - where there were opportunities
for graft.
But there were two dangers in this system, Prof Ammar said. First, the
corruption could become 'too indecent', as it did when Mr Chatichai was
prime minister, and second, rapid economic growth had created a need for
long-term policy-making, which Thailand lacks.
One of the results of this failure is an educational system which is
inferior to those of Thailand's regional competitors and which is failing to
produce enough of the skilled workers and managers needed to maintain the
country's rapid development. Even by the year 2000 three-quarters of the
workforce will have only primary education or less.
Economic reform was likewise often neglected until the arrival of Mr Anand,
a businessman. During his two short terms as unelected prime minister after
the 1991 coup, he launched a series of reforms, including trade
liberalisation, a value-added tax and the establishment of a Securities and
Exchange Commission.
This week all four prime ministerial hopefuls said they would invite
professionals rather than elected politicians to run important economic
portfolios in a new government. There is also broad consensus that Mr
Anand's vigorous programme of economic reforms should be pursued.
In one of his final speeches before retiring from politics - for the second
and, he hopes, the last time - Mr Anand singled out education, the
environment and the need to strengthen political institutions as the
priorities for future governments.
Whoever wins - and the outcome is likely to depend on delicate negotiations
about forming a coalition - resolving these problems will require angelic
temperament and devilish cunning.

AIR CANADA is poised to become the North American link in a big
international airline alliance after negotiating a merger with Canadian
Airlines International, its main domestic rival.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada's chief executive, confirmed that the
Montreal-based carrier has had discussions with Lufthansa and Air France in
its pursuit of a deal with a European airline.
Air France and Lufthansa have had close links with Canadian Airlines
International in areas such as joint marketing and baggage handling.
However, they declined to comment yesterday. Lufthansa said it 'has had
discussions with everybody'.
Air Canada expects to have a clearer idea soon of the chances of success for
its recent bid, with a group of Texan investors, for control of Continental
Airlines, the ailing US carrier.
Air Canada also recently signed a marketing agreement with United Airlines,
which it says will not be affected by its bid for Continental or by its
plans for a link to a European carrier.
Canadian Airlines' holding company, PWA Corporation of Calgary, agreed to a
merger earlier this week after failing to conclude a deal with American
Airlines.
Plans for an employee buy-out also collapsed.
Air Canada and PWA had combined revenues of CDollars 6.4bn (Pounds 2.66bn)
last year, with 185 aircraft and 36,000 employees. They also control about a
dozen commuter airlines in Canada. Both have been in the red for the past
year and have a combined debt of about CDollars 3.6bn.
The merged company will initially maintain the identity of both airlines but
will seek to cut costs by sharing services and eliminating duplication of
routes.
The fleet is likely to shrink substantially, and Air Canada predicts that as
many as 6,000 people will lose their jobs.
The merger must still be cleared by the two companies' shareholders and by
numerous regulatory agencies, including the competition bureau.
An Air Canada official said yesterday that a comprehensive merger proposal
should be finalised within the next month for presentation to the regulatory
authorities.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Italy signals a break with the past: The government has
chosen speed over caution for the privatisation of Credito Italiano
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, is a methodical man. 'I like to
have figures next to the facts; only then can I make up my mind,' he says.
But in deciding to kick-start the country's privatisation programme with the
surprise sale of Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth biggest bank, where Mr
Barucci was joint managing director until his appointment to the treasury
two months ago, the government has chosen speed over caution.
Rather than waiting until mid-October, when the team of six prominent
economists and bankers appointed to advise the treasury on privatisation was
due to present its findings, the government has shifted gear in advance.
The announcement that IRI, the state holding group which owns 67 per cent of
Credito Italiano's ordinary shares, is to sell part, or all, of its stake,
comes in spite of Mr Barucci's caution and signs that the Bank of Italy
would have preferred the restructuring of the country's financial
institutions to take place before, rather than after, big privatisations.
Circumstances have dictated otherwise. Pressure on the lira has forced
ministers to send a further signal of their determination to confront the
country's structural economic problems, notably the huge budget deficit.
'It's mainly marketing,' says one analyst. 'The sale will demonstrate that
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, is intent on change.' Selling a bank,
rather than one of the dozens of other companies controlled by IRI, will
reinforce that image.
Public-sector banks, which dominate Italy's financial system, have long been
used by politicians for patronage. In spite of Bank of Italy supervision,
gaining influence over a state or municipally owned bank has been a target
for political parties.
Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), the two most
prestigious public-sector banks based in Milan, have partly resisted such
influences. However, disposing of the state's majority stake in either is
one of the most powerful instruments for signalling a break with the past.
Privatising a bank should also appeal to the bourse. This year, share prices
have tumbled almost 27 per cent; trading volumes have dwindled; and costs
have risen sharply owing to tighter regulations and new technology.
Brokers have already indicated their appetite for a bank privatisation. Last
month, BCI's shares leapt 7 per cent in a matter of hours on rumours that
Mediobanca, the big Milan merchant bank, was studying its privatisation.
Suggestions this week that Credito Italiano would be sold triggered a 14 per
cent jump in its shares on Wednesday, when they were suspended at L1,390.
The choice of Credito Italiano, rather than the better-known BCI, is less
clear. Credito Italiano has always been the less prominent of the two. Its
clientele, though predominantly corporate like BCI's, does not comprise the
same range of blue-chip companies. Nor is it as international as its
slightly bigger sister.
Politics may have played a part. Mr Amato, a Socialist, may have been swayed
by his party's aim of merging BCI with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the
Rome-based bank identified closely with the Socialists. Alternatively, Mr
Barucci may have wanted to start the privatisation ball rolling with his
former company.
Whatever the reasons, Credito Italiano, founded in Genoa in 1870 and still
rooted in northern Italy, has no reason to be bashful. Its market
capitalisation is around L2,000bn (Pounds 850m) and its role as one of the
main bankers to northern Italy's industrialists was underlined by the recent
presence of Mr Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, on its board.
Moreover, analysts have tended to prefer Credito to BCI. While corporate
business remains its keynote it has developed other activities such as
leasing. The branch network, now more than 700 units, has been expanded to
develop retail banking. Group total assets were L94,347bn (Pounds 44bn) at
end-December.
Earnings for 1991 were disappointing, largely because of a L155bn jump in
the tax bill at group level to L266.4bn and a L15bn fall in extraordinary
items. As a result, net group profits after minorities fell to L297bn from
L337.6bn in 1990. However, analysts were relieved to see an increase of more
than 18 per cent in operating profits to L640.4bn.
This year promises much worse. Interim results, will be published later this
month, and it is likely the bank will have to make higher provisions because
of Italy's economic slowdown and reduced earnings on bonds.
Potential investors are more concerned with the terms for the share sale.
Last year, IRI disposed of most of its Credito Italiano non-voting savings
shares via an international placement led by Goldman Sachs, reducing its
holding of savings stock to just 17 per cent.
Some details of the latest transaction may emerge following an IRI board
meeting today and a domestic and international placement via top merchant
banks seems likely. Two other factors look certain. IRI will dispose of the
remaining savings stock, and cut its portion of ordinary shares below 50 per
cent.
That implies selling an initial tranche of 20 per cent of the ordinary
shares, which may be sold in 'units' along with some savings stock. When
share prices recover, more - possibly all - is likely to go. For while
'privatisation' in Italy often used to signify raising cash from the market
while retaining control, under Messrs Amato and Barucci, it is set to take
on a new meaning.

FT  11 SEP 92 / BTR advance helped by Hawker Siddeley acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR, the industrial conglom-erate, yesterday reported a 7 per cent increase
in interim profits as benefits from last year's Pounds 1.55bn acquisition of
Hawker Siddeley offset a small fall from the group's old businesses.
Sir Owen Green, chairman, said acquisitions had provided an 'oasis of
opportunities' in the economic desert.
Mr Alan Jackson, chief executive, said BTR should be ready to make another
acquisition next year and that recession would allow the group to 'go after
another large underperforming industrial company'.
In the six months to end-June, BTR's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 512m
to Pounds 548m on sales 33 per cent higher at Pounds 4.3bn.
Earnings per share rose 1.7 per cent to 17.7p and the interim dividend is to
be raised 3.3 per cent to 7.75p.
Without Hawker Siddeley, BTR's sales would have fallen about Pounds 100m and
profits about Pounds 40m. This deterioration was almost entirely because of
the 'dreadful' construction sector, the company said.
BTR also used acquisition accounting to add another Pounds 160m of goodwill
write-offs to the Pounds 270m of provisions already set up last year after
the Hawker Siddeley purchase. The latest write-off covered Pounds 110m of
provisions, some for contingent liabilities and a Pounds 50m adjustment to
property values.
Miss Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said the latest provisions,
flagged at the end of the last financial year, would be the final ones
relating to Hawker.
The group cut net debt from Pounds 2.13bn to Pounds 1.90bn - and gearing
from 89 per cent to 79 per cent - helped by better working capital control
and Pounds 230m of proceeds from disposals.
Operating margins fell from 15 per cent to 13.9 per cent overall. But at
Hawker Siddeley, cost cutting - rather than the usual BTR price increases -
led to margins rising from about 6.7 per cent to the low teens.
Mr Robert Faircloth, chief operating officer, said signs of recovery earlier
this year in the US had not materialised. In the UK, which now accounts for
a larger proportion of BTR's sales after the Hawker acquisition, the economy
was 'flat - I would like to believe it is not declining'.
BTR's shares rose 19p to 425p.

trading profits increased 17 per cent from Pounds 1.104bn to Pounds 1.29bn.
However, Mr Ernest Mario, deputy chairman, admitted both figures had
benefited from currency changes. The US dollar had been Dollars 1.76 on
average during 1992 compared with Dollars 1.86 in 1991. At constant exchange
rates, the increases would have been 18 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively. Volume growth, excluding price increases and exchange rates,
grew 16 per cent.
Sales in all four of Glaxo's established therapeutic areas - anti-ulcerants,
respiratory, antibiotics and dermatological medicines - showed healthy
increases, said Sir Paul Girolami, chairman.
Margins fell from 32.4 per cent to 31.4 per cent as the company increased
its investment programmes. Sir Paul said the company had invested Pounds
595m on operating expenses for research and development during the year. A
further Pounds 300m had been spent on capital projects related to R&amp;D. The
group has set up an R&amp;D centre in Japan.
Sir Paul said such investment was the key to the future. During 1993, the
group would spend Pounds 700m on capital investments, of which 35 per cent
would be on R&amp;D projects and 45 per cent on manufacturing. Between 1993 and
1997, the group would spend about Pounds 2.5bn on capital projects.
Additional marketing costs had also squeezed margins. The company has added
500 representatives to its US salesforce.
Mr Stewart Adkins, pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers, said higher
than expected research and development and capital expenditure would reduce
interest receivable in the future. In 1992 it fell 22 per cent from Pounds
179m to Pounds 140m.
Mr Mario refused to be drawn on when Serevent, an asthma drug, and Imigran,
a migraine treatment, would be licensed in the US, Japan and Germany, and on
negotiations with the French on Imigran.
Earnings per share rose 13 per cent from 30.4p to 34.3p. Earnings per ADR
increased only 7 per cent from Dollars 1.13 to Dollars 1.21 because of
currency changes. The board proposed a dividend of 17p for the year, an
increase of 21 per cent.

FT  11 SEP 92 / GPA sets out share issue details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA Group yesterday unveiled its plans for a convertible preference share
issue to raise between Dollars 300m (Pounds 152m) and Dollars 350m at a
meeting of its key institutional shareholders at its headquarters in
Shannon, the Irish Republic.
Although the conversion price is still to be agreed next week, shareholders
were told that it will be less than Dollars 12 a share.
The yield on the new shares at the issue price is expected to be 7 1/2 per
cent, which is significantly higher than the yield on the current shares.
GPA said a group of 15 of its biggest shareholders have agreed to underwrite
the planned share issue. Since GPA's aborted flotation, when it tried to
raise Dollars 800m by offering shares at a price of Dollars 20, most of its
shareholders have accepted that the value of their shares have fallen by at
least Dollars 5 to Dollars 15.
The shares are currently being quoted on the Dublin grey market at between
Dollars 6 to Dollars 8, although no deals have taken place.
Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman, said: 'We tabled outline plans for an
equity placing primarily directed at our existing shareholders. We are
considering the views of our major shareholders and expect to advance the
matter further with them over the next few weeks.'
Nomura International, global co-ordinator to the aborted flotation in June,
and Davy Stockbrokers in the Irish Republic, are advising the company on the
new share issue.
Aer Lingus and Air Canada, which control 18 per cent of the group's shares,
told GPA's management that they are likely to take part in the convertible
preference share issue.
They emphatically rejected reports that their own financial problems ruled
out their participation in any new share issue.
Their involvement could be crucial to the success of the share issue as many
of the group's institutional shareholders said they would only participate
if all the group's shareholders took part.
GPA yesterday said that the injection of fresh equity was part of an overall
recovery programme which includes two more asset-backed securitised issues
and the renegotiation of its aircraft acquisition programme.
The group has placed Dollars 12bn of aircraft orders for the rest of the
decade.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Enterprise first-half plunge to Pounds
34.6m gets market welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Enterprise, the independent oil company, yesterday jumped 19p to
317p in spite of the company's announcement of a near-halving of after tax
profits from Pounds 60.3m to Pounds 34.6m in the first half of 1992.
The company blamed the twin effects of recession and weak sterling oil
prices for the fall. But the net income figure was close to the top end of
analysts' forecasts, and with a maintained dividend of 6.5p, prompted a
recovery in the share price. The shares had lost 13p in the last two days on
fears of a dividend cut.
Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive, said the company was on
track almost to double its daily oil production to more than 260,000 barrels
a day by 1995.
Enterprise is developing a number of North Sea fields to add to the 20
already producing. The two biggest, the Scott and Nelson fields in the
central North Sea, are due to come on-stream late next year and in 1994.
The company will also benefit from its interests in the Elf Enterprise joint
venture, whose Piper, Saltire and Chanter fields are due to begin producing
next year.
Production in the first half of 1992 rose by 5.9 per cent to 135,500 b/d,
but a drop in average oil prices from Pounds 12.13 to Pounds 10.59 a barrel
caused turnover to fall from Pounds 244.4m to Pounds 239.5m.
Net interest income also fell, reflecting an increase in capital expenditure
from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 133.4m.
Despite the increase in spending, however, gearing dropped to 46 per cent
from 49 per cent at the end of last year, due largely to a successful
Dollars 172m US preference share issue. Earnings per share fell from 13.2p
to 7.9p.
COMMENT
Barring disaster, Enterprise should almost double its oil production by 1995
and is comfortably financed. Its management also has a reputation for
prudence and shareholder loyalty, which has helped the share price to hold
up in an otherwise severely depressed exploration and production sector.
Moreover, with Enterprise expected to run large cash-flow surpluses from the
mid-1990s, patient shareholders should be rewarded by strong dividend
growth. In the shorter term, the expected sale of its stake in the Hudson
field for about Pounds 25m will be required if full-year forecasts of about
Pounds 74m are to be achieved, while increased costs and expenditure may
reduce earnings and raise gearing next year. But Enterprise is in a better
position to maintain its dividend than, say, rival Lasmo. At a yield of 6.7
per cent, Enterprise is still seen as the stock to be in in the E&amp;P sector.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Speculation rises over disposal of Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH SPECULATION that the Storehouse retailing group was considering
selling its Habitat business circulated yesterday after a French newspaper
reported that Au Printemps was interested in buying Habitat's French arm.
Storehouse has suggested in the past that it might dispose of Habitat if a
suitable buyer could be found but declined to comment on the report. Au
Printemps, the French retailer owned by the Pinault group, also refused to
comment.
Analysts expressed surprise that Storehouse should consider selling Habitat
France individually - given that it was the most profitable part of the
furniture business - but suggested that any sale could realise up to Pounds
100m.
Ms Julie Ramshaw, retail analyst at stockbrokers Morgan Stanley, said: 'I do
not believe that Habitat has a long term future with the group but I do not
think there is any urgency about selling it.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cadbury beats forecasts with Pounds 126m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY SCHWEPPES, the confectionery and soft drinks company, increased
pre-tax profits by 13 per cent from Pounds 112m to Pounds 126m in the six
months to June 13, helped by a strong performance in American beverage
markets.
The company said the result, which exceeded analysts' forecasts of about
Pounds 120m, was achieved despite difficult economic and trading conditions
in all its main markets and the weak dollar.
The adverse impact of exchange rates in the second half was expected to
affect full-year results by 4 per cent.
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said the company was 'cautious but
confident' about the outlook for the second half; much would depend on
trading over the Christmas period.
He expected confidence to recover earlier in the UK among consumers than
among retailers, who had responded to recession by tightly controlling stock
levels.
The company confirmed that it had looked at the French mineral water assets
which the European Commission was forcing Nestle to sell, but said the price
was unrealistically high.
Sales in the first half rose to Pounds 1.47bn (Pounds 1.42bn). Earnings per
share of 10.27p (10.16p), reflected dilution due to the recent share issue.
Trading profit in the Americas rose 51 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds
16.9m), helped by the acquisition of Aguas Minerales in Mexico, a
reorganisation of US operations and improved productivity at the Mott's
juice business.
However, confectionery profits fell by 2 per cent.
In the UK, trading profit rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 51.8m). A late surge in
demand due to good weather helped the Coca Cola-Schweppes Beverages joint
venture raise profits by 63 per cent, while confectionery benefited from
strong Easter sales. However, chocolate sales volumes fell 4 per cent in a
declining market.
In the rest of Europe profit declined by 32 per cent to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds
30.5m), reflecting tougher competition in beverages in France and and poor
weather Spain.
Cadbury also increased marketing expenditure in confectionery in response to
product launches by Nestle.
The contribution from the Pacific Rim contracted 12 per cent to Pounds 25.2m
(Pounds 28.7m) on an 8 per cent drop in sales, reflecting poor weather in
Australia and tougher conditions in Japan.
Rising drinks sales in South Africa raised profit in the rest of the world
to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.9m).
Net debt, at Pounds 491m, was Pounds 25m lower than a year earlier. The
interim dividend is raised to 3.3p (3.2p).

Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, yesterday confirmed anecdotal evidence

However, he said there had been no significant changes in the group's other
businesses, which span property development in Europe and electrical

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Walker creditors' meeting adjourned for two
weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Walker, former head of the Brent Walker property and leisure
group, survived another round in his fight to avoid bankruptcy yesterday
when a meeting of his creditors was adjourned for two weeks.
Creditors have put in claims exceeding Pounds 150m. Mr Walker has proposed a
voluntary arrangement which he said would give creditors more than they
would receive under bankruptcy.
It would require a 75 per cent majority, by value, of creditors to accept Mr
Walker's proposal.
Mr Michael Colman, of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, said that creditors
representing Pounds 40m of debts, just over 25 per cent, had indicated
opposition.
Mr Raymond Hocking, an insolvency partner of Stoy Hayward, who was appointed
by the court to investigate Mr Walker's proposal and who would supervise the
voluntary arrangement if agreed, had decided that the voting was too close
to put Mr Walker into bankruptcy yesterday.
He is to spend the next two weeks examining the claims again to decide
exactly how the votes should split between creditors.
Under the voluntary arrangement, Mr Hocking has estimated the creditors
could recoup Pounds 14.7m whereas only Pounds 96,767 would be available if
Mr Walker was declared bankrupt.
Mr Walker has promised to give half his after tax income from his new job,
as chief executive of a company recently incorporated in the CIS, to
creditors for the next three years. He expects an income in 1993 of Pounds
100,000.
He has also pledged his 1.5m shares in Brent Walker and shares in two
private companies, two properties, his one-sixth share in an apartment in
Switzerland, and the proceeds of a legal claim in France expected to produce
Pounds 14.5m.
He has promised that any other assets he had would go to creditors as well,
such as the proceeds of claims against Brent Walker which would not proceed
if he was declared bankrupt.
Mr Walker said his house in Essex was in his wife's name because it had been
a wedding present from her father in 1964, when it had cost Pounds 3,000.
Mr Walker said that the creditors which opposed the arrangement were the
banks - including TSB Bank, Standard Chartered, Lloyds, Svenska, Credit
Suisse and Hill Samuel - which were also the main bankers to Brent Walker.
He said he thought these banks opposed the arrangement because they believed
he was lying about his assets.
In the proposal put to creditors he said that any material non-disclosure
would be a ground for default on the arrangement and the supervisor or any
creditor could then present a bankruptcy petition against him.

FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Emess passes dividend after 15% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emess, the lighting and electrical accessories company, has passed its
interim dividend after a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
1.3m to Pounds 1.1m, for the half to June 30.
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said: 'We will consider a payment of a final
dividend in light of the full-year results.'
Although the second half is traditionally the stronger period, Mr Meyer
remained cautious.
He is pessimistic about the outlook for the US economy, which affects Alsy,
the consumer lighting company. 'Every month is a slog in the US,' said Mr
Meyer. 'We are battling against an awful recession.'
US losses fell slightly to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.4m). Trading profits in the
UK were unchanged at Pounds 4.1m.
Losses from the consumer lighting division rose to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
800,000). Margins at its German business, Brilliant, continued to fall.
Trading profits at the commercial lighting division fell from Pounds 3.1m to
Pounds 2.8m, and in electrical and graphics operations from Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 1.3m.
Borrowings were static at Pounds 33m, representing gearing of 57 per cent.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Lira falls below floor despite German-Italian intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian and German central banks failed to stop the lira falling below
its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday, despite intervening to buy the Italian currency on the foreign
exchange markets.
The forced intervention by the Bank of Italy and the Bundesbank came even
though the Italian government decided earlier this week to seek emergency
powers from parliament which would allow it to rule by decree in the event
of an economic emergency.
Yesterday, the four parties in the Italian government coalition appeared to
accept assurances from Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, that his
request for special powers to tackle an economic emergency would not
infringe the sovereignty of parliament.
But neither this, nor the recent rise in Italy's discount rate by 1.75
percentage points, could steer foreign currency speculators away from a
growing conviction that the lira is a prime candidate for devaluation,
whatever the result of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on
September 20.
The Italian currency closed in London last night at L765.7, below its ERM
floor against the D-Mark of L765.4. Both the Bundesbank and the Bank of
Italy will be forced to support the lira through intervention today if the
Italian currency is still at this rate when ERM trading opens.
The Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy conducted a modest intervention on the
foreign exchanges to support the lira, as is required under ERM rules.
But Mr Carlo Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, revealed new tension
with the Bundesbank by saying that German interest rates were 'excessively
high' and should be cut. Mr Ciampi told a parliamentary committee that 'in
Germany the task of rebuilding the east must not prevent interest rates
falling from their current levels.'
Mr Amato appeared before the Senate yesterday morning to explain his
proposal. He said the government needed measures to take rapid decisions to
cope with fast changing market conditions at a time of economic crisis. He
based the idea on a June 1967 decree introduced by the West German
government.
He suggested the Senate and Chamber of Deputies should form a commission,
each providing 15 members, in the event of an emergency being invoked to
monitor government actions. Under the proposal, the governor of the Bank of
Italy would decide when circumstances warranted resorting to the emergency
powers.
The government gave no indication on the timetable for submitting the decree
to parliament. But if Mr Amato is confident he has the backing of his four
party coalition with a 16 seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it will
be processed quickly.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Bush sets 'agenda for American renewal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush claimed yesterday that a 1 percentage point
across-the-board reduction in US personal income taxes was achievable if
Congress agreed to his proposed cap on mandated federal spending.
Presenting in a speech in Detroit what he called his 'agenda for American
renewal', Mr Bush acknowledged that the country felt 'uneasiness' about the
current state of the economy.
The answer, he insisted, lay in 'the power of regeneration' inherent in
individual initiative and the benefits of a freely trading global economy.
What he branded as 'the mirage' fostered by Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, that government should accumulate capital
and redistribute it, was no solution.
Mr Clinton promptly dismissed Mr Bush's plan as 'really just more of the
same' in its promises of large tax cuts for the wealthy (Dollars 14,000 for
someone on Dollars 200,000 a year) and little for anybody else. He said it
would mean a bigger deficit and lower growth.
Mr Bush's speech mostly consisted of a recitation of existing policy
proposals, with two or three new twists - including an aim to reach trade
agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, an offer to cut the
White House budget by one third if Congress did the same and a recommended 5
per cent pay cut for all federal employees earning more than Dollars 75,000
a year.
It was intended to lay out an economic and social programme for a second
term to combat what is widely seen as the weakest element in his bid for
re-election.
Wall Street stocks rose sharply as some investors drew comfort from the
speech. the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 33.77 points at 3,305.16.
But the speech's impact may have been diluted only hours before Mr Bush
delivered it as the White House sought to play down his own commitment of
the day before not to raise taxes again 'ever, ever'.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this 'wasn't a pledge'
never again to raise taxes, but only to acknowledge he made a mistake in
accepting the 1990 tax increase.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, the democrats' chief spokesman, pointed out that
if Mr Bush's notorious promise of 1988 - 'read my lips, no new taxes' - was
null and void his new commitment could hardly be taken seriously.

MR CYRUS VANCE and Lord Owen, the Yugoslav peace mediators, had five hours
of talks in the battered Bosnian capital of Sarajevo yesterday, but warned
of further obstacles ahead in international efforts to end the ethnic
conflict in the Balkans.
After making a hazardous 190-mile overland journey from the Croatian port of
Split, the two envoys set out for more talks in Belgrade, capital of Serbia
and of the rump Yugoslav federation.
Although both sounded a cautious note, France later announced that they had
gained agreement for a provisional ceasefire in Sarajevo, which has been
under siege by Serbs for five months. But previous ceasefires have been
broken.
Reflecting international frustration at repeated peace initiatives in the
former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator, said he
could hold out little hope of an early end to the siege of Sarajevo.
Mr Vance, the United Nations special envoy, said: 'It has been a somewhat
successful day but there are a lot of pitfalls ahead.'
The two negotiators, wearing blue flak jackets and helmets, first met
Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic and then went to a Serb garrison
to meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
Lord Owen appeared shaken by Sarajevo's devastation. 'You see the whole
wanton destruction, tower blocks shot to smithereens, and you realise so
much of it has come from the top and not from street fighting,' he said.
In New York, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, recommended an
enlarged peacekeeping force to escort relief convoys in Bosnia. He gave no
precise numbers, but said the 1,500-strong force in Sarajevo could increase
as much as fivefold.
Mr Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, will today ask the UN and the
EC to send international observers to monitor air bases in Serbia and
Montenegro, the two republics which form the new Yugoslav federation. He
wants them to be able to prove that Yugoslavia is not supplying back-up to
Serb forces in Bosnia.
Mr Panic, who is anxious to establish his control and authority over the
federation, will today meet Mr Vance and Lord Owen.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic accused Moslems of shooting down the
Italian relief aircraft that crashed last weekend, claiming they used a
US-made Stinger missile originally supplied to US-backed Afghan rebels,
Reuter reports.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Hurd and Clarke back growing demand for press privacy bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD has joined Mr John Major, the prime minister, in adding his
voice to those in the government ready to back a privacy law to restrict
press coverage of the personal lives of the Royal Family and other public
figures.
The foreign secretary's support increases the prospect that ministers will
support the principle of legislation when an independent commission on press
freedom, chaired by Sir David Calcutt QC, reports in January.
Ministers insist that no decisions will be taken until after the report is
delivered. They nevertheless believe that the latest press coverage of the
private life of Mr David Mellor, the heritage secretary, who is responsible
for overseeing the media, will strengthen a tide of opinion among MPs
running in favour of legislation.
Whitehall officials said Mr Kenneth Clarke, who as home secretary would have
a crucial role in any decision on statutory regulation, is among others
favouring a privacy bill.
Some cabinet members still believe that it would be impossible to draw up
legislation protecting an individual's private life while allowing proper
scrutiny of the behaviour of public figures.
Mr Major, who will spend the weekend with the Queen at Balmoral, has
signalled his anger at the intense scrutiny by the tabloid press of the
marriage difficulties of Prince Charles and Prince Andrew.
Mr Hurd, who was responsible for the press as home secretary before his move
to the Foreign Office, has consistently opposed the idea of a privacy law,
but it is understood that he changed his position during the summer after
the blanket coverage by the tabloids of the royal marriage.

Zantac accounted for 44 per cent of the company's sales last year and
perhaps 60 per cent of its profits. They might also worry that the migraine
treatment Imigran has not yet received US approval and that the anti-emetic
Zofran, while doing well, has a limited market. But that would be to ignore
the marketing power of the company; Zantac may be no spring chicken, but
sales rose by 13 per cent last year. Clearly longer term prospects are
governed by the success of drugs such as Imigran, and while the size of the
market is not yet clear, the indications are that they too will be money
spinners. Given the large US holding in Glazo, UK fund managers who are
underweight may feel the pain in their performance statistics.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: RTZ
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most interesting feature of RTZ at present is its sensitivity to
currency movements. The metals company went to some lengths at its half-year
presentation yesterday to demonstrate that the impact of foreign exchanges
on its earnings is generally less than it seems, and that the long-term
economic value of a shareholder's investment can often be broadly unchanged.
Cynics will say that the exercise was designed to explain the 12 per cent
under-performance of RTZ's shares since the end of June; the rejoinder is
that the company may be talking itself out of a rebound in its price if the
dollar recovers, or if sterling devalues within the ERM.
RTZ's analysis is as relevant to other overseas earners. It makes the often
forgotten point that when one bilateral currency relationship changes,
others do not necessarily remain constant. Thus, while a 10 per cent fall in
the US dollar against the pound might typically knock Pounds 50m off
half-year earnings, an accompanying 10 per cent fall in the Australian
dollar saves Pounds 17m in costs. Though difficult to quantify, a falling US
currency tends over time to lead to a rise in commodity prices, a
development which might add back a further Pounds 18m in the above example.
Finally there is the lower sterling value of foreign currency debt, of which
RTZ has Dollars 1.8bn.
The message is clear. The shares may be fair value on a 5.5 per cent yield
and above average earnings multiple. They should not be chased uncritically.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury's interim results confirmed its status as one of the quality stocks
in the food manufacturing sector. Items such as the Pounds 14m fall in
working capital indicate strong management grip, and the digestion of the
Aguas Minerales acquisition in Mexico seems to be progressing well. As well
as adding new brands to the stable, the hope must be that such purchases
will allow Cadbury to grow organically by selling existing products through
the acquired companies.
But there are problems. Competition in soft drinks is fierce and getting
fiercer, as the 44 per cent fall in European beverage profits shows. The
decline of the dollar is also likely to hurt in the second half, and
full-year earnings may not be much higher than last year. Given the
non-cyclical character of the sector, an economic recovery is unlikely to
boost sales dramatically, so the outlook for earnings growth is sluggish. On
top of that the much-vaunted prospect of a bid has receded with US predators
hamstrung by the low dollar.
Investors must thus decide whether Cadbury's premium rating to the market
arises from its trading outlook or the scarcity of good food stocks. While
the price is undoubtedly boosted by fund managers trying to avoid less
successful food manufacturers, Cadbury's has a valuable portfolio of
well-run brands. On that basis yesterday's 14p fall in the shares increases
their attractions.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: A provisional success
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of looking at BTR. One is to focus on its undoubtedly
well-honed skills in industrial manufacturing. The other is to put it in the
category of companies which cannot resist the blandishments of acquisition
accounting. Yesterday's 5 per cent rise in the share price suggests the
market prefers the former view, and not entirely without justification.
First-half operating profits in BTR's traditional businesses fell only 7 per
cent despite fierce recession in some of its most important markets. Yet the
rest of the story is marred by the extent to which provisions are being made
and used against last year's Hawker Siddeley acquisition.
Hawker's contribution to pre-tax profits was probably not much more than
Pounds 120m. Yet BTR drew Pounds 90m from the Pounds 270m of provisions
taken through the balance sheet following the purchase. Yesterday it
announced a further provision of Pounds 110m, bringing the total to roughly
a quarter of the Hawker price. BTR is, of course, perfectly entitled to
behave in this way. It is also scrupulously explicit. Still, its recourse to
provisions is large enough to raise questions over its quality of earnings.
It would be a comfort if the company were generating more cash. BTR has
instituted a squeeze on working capital, though that means the second half
is unlikely to see the usual seasonal improvement. Meanwhile it is heavily
dependent on disposals to finance capital spending and reduce gearing.
Perhaps BTR will generate more cash after the integration of Hawker which is
going ahead at commendable speed. But investors might prefer to wait and see
before pushing the shares much higher, especially since margins on the
Hawker business are unlikely to rise much further.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: While The Sun Shines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no recession in Birmingham, or at least not if you judge by the
splendidly refurbished Old Rep Theatre. True, Wednesday was a gala evening,
yet here was an occasion where one felt embarrassed not to be in a dinner
jacket. Ladies wore diamonds, officers wore uniform. By contrast, London
looks drab.
The play was appropriate, too: a revival of Terence Rattigan's While The Sun
Shines. The piece ran for over 1,000 performances in the West End starting
on Christmas Eve 1943, and starring such names as Michael Wilding, Ronald
Squire and Brenda Bruce. It has not been much seen since.
Rattigan called it a light comedy, which is what it is, bordering on farce.
It lacks the pathos and excitement of another of his wartime plays, Flare
Path, which was revived at the King's Head in Islington a couple of years
ago. It now seems over-long and a trifle slight, but it is wonderful to have
the chance to catch up with it.
Practically all the characters are titled, whether by hereditary peerage,
military rank or both, for this is the war where the aristocracy does its
bit but is not always promoted. The Earl of Harpenden cannot rise above the
rank of a lowly naval rating because he cannot satisfy the Admiralty that he
knows how many tuppenny- ha'penny stamps can be bought for half-a-crown.
Still, he lives in the Albany off Piccadilly, where his family has had
chambers for over a century, and has a man-servant loosely modelled on
Jeeves.
There is an American airman and a French lieutenant, both of whom fall for
the same girl, daughter of the Duke of Ayr and Stirling, who is already
betrothed to Harpenden. Then there is Mabel Crum, the woman who is
universally generous with her favours and remains a thoroughly good sort
throughout.
The mood is nostalgic. 'Run Rabbit Run' and 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'
are played on the piano before the start and the audience wants to sing
along. The theatre is dotted with ARP wardens warning what to do if there is
an air raid. Wartime posters are spread around the foyer.
In the play itself, the main action is the competition for the girl, Lady
Elizabeth Randall, by the American and the Frenchman. Harpenden, as a true
reserved Englishman, does not fight as hard as he might. Anyway, there is
always Mabel Crum in the background to fall back on. Those were the days
when Pounds 2m, Harpenden's income from his London properties, translated
into Dollars 8m. On his country estates, of course, he always made a loss.
The humour is pretty straightforward: jokes about the American being
astonished to meet an English earl and the socialist Frenchman believing the
English aristocracy is doomed.
Harpenden curiously takes The New Statesman and expects to lose his wealth
to 'Mr Chancellor' when the war is over. It is all very good-natured. As the
title suggests, there might be worse things to happen to English life than
war.
The pleasure of such an innocent play is in the performances and the
craftmanship. Neal Foster, who has founded the new Birmingham Stage Company,
plays Harpenden with much more versatility than one has any right to expect
from a straight male lead. Lucy Scott as Lady Elizabeth looks as attractive
as she possibly can be in military uniform.
Tastes change. In 1992 I think it might have been funnier if the Duke of Ayr
and Stirling (Ernest Clark) had not spoken French in such a parody of an
English accent and if the French lieutenant (Michael Goron) had been allowed
more natural Gallic charm and looked less like a frog. Yet the Birmingham
audience loved it just the way it was.
Direction is by Granville Saxton and the new company will play at the Old
Rep for 20 weeks a year. If the city can support it, this is a marvellous
development.
At the Old Rep, Birmingham, (021) 236 2392, until October 3

One's heart scarcely lifts at the thought of yet another police series, but
the opening episode of Between The Lines last week was extremely impressive.
Perhaps the time is ripe for a series which looks specifically at those
internal units intended to police the police themselves, in this instance
London's CIB: Complaints Investigation Bureau. In today's episode (9.30
BBC1) policemen shoot dead an armed man who is trying to force his way into
his girl friend's flat and are accused of operating a 'shoot to kill'
policy.
Rumour has it that Paul Merton is planning to have a night's sleep some time
in 1996. Meanwhile he continues to participate in every series which has any
connection with new comedy. He is credited as co-writer on C4's new vehicle
for Julian Clary, Terry And Julian (10.30), which is followed by a repeat of
Paul Merton: The Series (11.00).
The Fall Of The House Of Usher (12.10 BBC1) is that rarity, a rather good
horror movie. It remains fairly faithful to the book, stars Vincent Price at
the top of his form in 1960, and achieves an effective atmosphere without
straining to terrify the life out of you as today's shockers do.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: Cos fan tutte - British Youth Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a fund-raising gala at Covent Garden and an Arts Council Grant to its
name, British Youth Opera is making notable headway in funding a fledgling
opera company. Its aim is to give singers not far up the professional ladder
an opportunity to climb a few rungs further in fully-staged productions.
This is a trickier proposition than it may seem. The music colleges already
put on opera productions open to the public. Protected from the need to fill
large theatres on a commercial basis, they are able to give often
outstanding performances of rarely-seen operas, as the Royal Northern
College did recently with Vaughan Williams's The Pilgrim's Progress and the
Guildhall School of Music with Prokofiev's The Duenna.
British Youth Opera's two new productions are not on that level. In order to
lure an audience to Sadler's Wells, the company has chosen Mozart's Cos fan
tutte and Bizet's Carmen.
The singers include names already noted at the music colleges, but asked to
perform in popular repertory works such as these, they face difficult
challenges, which show what a gulf remains before students reach
professional standards.
I saw the production of Cos fan tutte on Wednesday. The ambitions of the
company's undertaking, as in everything it does, were laudable: the version
of the score was more complete than usual and an experienced production team
had been assembled, an essential feature if the young singers are to gain
the maximum benefit from participation.
Unfortunately, Jamie Hayes's setting of the opera as Cos-on-Sea, taking the
sisters on holiday to a down-market British seaside resort at the height of
what seemed to be Falklands fever, failed to make anything of its updating
of the story. The English translation, credited as the old Ruth and Thomas
Martin version but horribly tarted up, had every cliche in the book.
The strength of the evening lay entirely with the young performers. Susannah
Glanville was a radiant Fiordiligi and Nathan Berg a vocally resonant
Guglielmo, both singers of notable promise.
Emma Selway's unexaggerated Dorabella and Andrew Burden's sure Ferrando made
an able second couple. Liza Pulman and John Neale judged well the character
roles of Despina and Don Alfonso. The talent is there and British Youth
Opera has assembled some of the best.
Sadler's Wells season lasts until Saturday. Box Office (071) 278 8916

FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: A place where history is not forgotten - Northern
Ireland's museum trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO describe Northern Ireland as off the normal beat for arts writers is
perhaps an understatement. However, an unusual promotion, a brochure
entitled Museums of Ulster, The European Connection, sponsored by the
European Arts Festival, hopes to change that.
Nine museums in Ulster have collaborated in the making of the brochure which
is funded by an EEC grant of Pounds 10,000. Their aim is to put their
permanent collections on the tourist map. From any other region of the UK,
such a modest initiative would appear worthy but dull, but because this is
Northern Ireland, matters looked more promising.
For a start, given the perception of the province in the wider world, an
invitation to 'take a voyage through the history of Ireland and Europe'
appears more in the nature of a challenge. And then there are the
interesting questions such a voyage raises. How is history to be packaged
for presentation amid a population bitterly divided by memories, grievances,
prejudices, and bloodshed?
The brochure picks up the European theme of the Festival by highlighting
exhibits which illustrate Ireland's cultural links to continental Europe.
A visit to Derry brought education in treacherous place-names. The 'London-'
on the roadsigns along the road to the city has been painted out, and the
brochure referred to the new Tower Museum at Derry in County Londonderry. So
in at least one official circle, it looks as though the use of Londonderry
for the city has been dropped, in deference to the nationalist view that it
is an indefensible, unhistorical Anglicisation.
The Tower Museum, opening at the end of this month, surveys the history of
Derry, one of the oldest cities in Ulster. It dates back to the 6th Century
in the eyes of those who see its founder as St Columba. Derry's more recent
history that has blackened its reputation. In the Troubles in the 1970s,
one-third of Derry's city-centre was destroyed. However, since the mid-1980s
there has been much rebuilding and a determined attempt, using funds from
the EEC, to promote the city's heritage to attract tourism.
The plan deserves to work. Except for its bad days, mercifully rare in the
past four years, Derry appears as a charming and congenial place. The old
city, up high overlooking the valley of the River Foyle, has streets of
well-restored Georgian town-houses, the only intact city-walls in Ireland,
and an exuberant arts scene which leaves Belfast looking decidedly stodgy.
Brian Lacey, director of Derry's museums, sees his task as made easier for
having one world-famous event to promote: the Siege of Derry of 1689. At the
siege, King James II and his Catholic army (including troops sent by Louis
XIV) were frustrated by the dogged endurance of the Protestant defenders of
Derry, who for 105 days held the city for William III.
It needs tact and a certain courage to make a museum display out of an event
which rates with the Battle of the Boyne as sacred moments in the annals of
Protestant Ulster. Lacey himself is from the Republic, something not at all
uncommon in the museum world, where cross-border links are getting closer.
The majority of the inhabitants in Derry is Catholic and nationalist, so
Lacey had no idea what to expect when he mounted an exhibition in 1989
devoted to the Siege.
On the day of the opening, the Provisional IRA blew up a pub by the museum
car park. It was a warning: this could have been your museum. Since then,
Lacey's feeling is that the atmosphere in Derry has improved considerably.
The Tower Museum itself is a curious structure, built in the 1980s as a
symbol of Derry's renewal.
The finale remains to be settled. It may come up as far as the late 1970s,
and include rubber bullets, posters and letters written on lavatory-paper by
Bobby Sands, the republican hunger-striker who died in 1981, and smuggled
out of prison. But a video made about the Troubles has already fallen foul
of the politicians. Some of them urge that the subject be dropped
altogether, a solution Lacey reprehends as 'dishonest and lopsided'.
Even without it, local sensitivities could always be inflamed, very probably
by the effigy of Lundy. A 'lundy' in Northern Ireland parlance is a traitor.
According to the Protestant version, Robert Lundy was the governor who
during the siege treacherously betrayed King William's trust by shinning
down a pear-tree which grew beside the city wall and disappearing.
Until recently, Lundy was a - literally - explosive symbol of Protestant
supremacy, because every December the Apprentice Boys used to stuff his
effigy with fireworks and hang it from the Walker Pillar.
Down in the mean, terraced streets of the Bogside, the Catholic population
returned the fire - metaphorically on this occasion - by setting their
chimneys alight. Nine years ago, the Provos blew up the Walker Pillar, so
Lundy now meets his annual fate on the steps of the court-house.
At the charming Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Holywell, County Down,
pains are being taken to get the denominational mix correct in
reconstructing historic churches in the expanding 'village' which is the
centrepoint of the museum.
Museum staff talking as if simply to get Catholics and Protestants under the
same roof to enjoy the same experiences, marks a victory - whether it be
jewellery from the famous Armada wrecks at the Ulster Museum in Belfast or
wildlife videos at the recently refurbished Fermanagh County Museum at
Enniskillen.
On this simplest of criteria, museums hardly need to tackle difficult
subjects. Their justificiation for seeking larger grants from local
authorities, central government, and the EEC is their contribution to
'Education for Mutual Understanding', or Emu.
At Down County Museum in Downpatrick, staff regularly teach children from
Protestant and Catholic schools, folk-traditions, such as the rituals for St
Brigid's Day. On March 17, St Patrick's Day, a strange medley of events,
from pipe bands to tractor clubs, brings over 3,000 visitors to the museum,
a stone's thrown from the legendary burial place of the saint.
Director Brian Turner demurred at my suggestion that he was bringing the two
communities together. For him there is just the one community, and no reason
whatsoever why it should not take pride in the mysterious, but mercifully
ecumenical, figure of St Patrick, 'one of the few things in Northern Ireland
which is a world attraction.'
In all these museums, one senses a particularly strong emphasis on reaching
out to children. In 1991, a survey conducted in Northern Ireland on public
attitudes towards museums showed that four in 10 adults said they never went
and 'most of the remainder' visited only once every two or three years.
Protestants went more than Catholics.
However, the survey also showed that Protestants and Catholics alike see
museums as a vital resource for preserving the province's history and
cultural traditions, and that they consider museums give an unbiased
presentation of history. In terms of Emu, then, school outings seem to be
the crux of the relationship between museums and their public. On the other
hand, time alone will tell whether taking children to museums has any
lasting impact on the social stereotypes, incomprehension, and hatred.
Meanwhile, at the Ulster Museum in Belfast, an astoundingly profitable
exhibition bought in from the US has pulled in more than 150,000 visitors
this summer, mostly children, to gawp at lunging, roaring dinosaurs.
Director John Nolan's gamble has paid off and this expensive show have wiped
out seven years of accumulated debt. He answers critics by pointing out this
blockbuster also plays its part in contributing to Emu by attracting so many
people, often first-time callers, to the museum.
The problem is the pressure on space which means masterpieces of the
museum's fine art collection, such as Turner's The Origin of Christianity,
are put in store. There is pressure for a separate art gallery to be built
in Belfast. This month, the Museum offers compensation with a large
exhibition of its own drawings and watercolours, previously seen in the US,
and Sir James Lavery's bequest of his paintings goes on show in November.
But for the genuinely curious visitor from abroad, even dinosaurs make their
point about life in Northern Ireland. On a damp August morning, there was
not a soldier to be seen as queues waited for the museum to open. Inside,
the dinosaurs' lair was a pandemonium of children screaming with delight.
Every day people had been asking me, 'So how do you find the place?'. Right
then - but not for the only time - my answer would have been 'just like
anywhere else'.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Management: Chewing over the expense account - In the latest
of our series on power lunching around the world, Robert Thompson finds
restraint and excess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the most powerful of all power lunches, the monthly gathering of the 29
Mitsubishi group heads, the fare is often humble 'curry rice', a
gently-spiced, dun-coloured dish which is also the staple of the average
office worker in a hurry.
The Kinyokai, as the Mitsubishi meal is called, reflects the general
restraint exercised by the Japanese executive at lunchtime, when few deals
are done and the emphasis is on quick and sober consumption.
Such modest daytime habits are a source of frustration for those foreign
competitors who hope that luxury and decadence will undermine the Japanese
work ethic.
But while there may be no wine bottles on the table at lunch, after dark the
picture is very different, for Japanese business people do their best
networking at night. In the evening there will be as much beer, sake and
whisky as the body and expense account can bear.
Relationships will be lubricated in exclusive clubs after dinner guests have
been jollied in the private rooms of traditional-style restaurants. With
important decisions often requiring the approval of more than one executive,
the back rooms allow the company the space to seat all who must reach a
consensus.
The real entertaining - not the novelty sampler presented to most visitors -
tends to be aimed at servicing already-established links and making a
contact aware of an impending deal. Indeed, the deal could even be done with
a knowing nod between courses.
However, there are some signs that the current lavish entertaining could be
under threat. These are supposed to be tough times for executives who are
taking ritual salary cuts to express their grief for plunging profits.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Japan's largest bank, announced recently that directors
would take a 5 per cent drop in pay, but an unkinder cut was the 20 per cent
reduction in the entertainment budget.
For a top manager in Japan, a chauffeur and fat expense account have always
been the expected rewards for 35 years of dutiful service, particularly
given that many executive salaries are, by western standards, modest. But
now, if the anecdotes of bar owners are to be believed, instead of drinking
at two or three different clubs in an evening, managers are restricting
themselves to just one venue.
Back at the Mitsubishi lunch table, even in the bleakest times the group's
presidents could probably have champagne with their curry if they demanded
it. But they appear genuinely more content with a cup of green tea or a weak
coffee.
A secretary charged with arranging the Mitsubishi lunches explains that the
food is supposed to be consumed within 30 minutes, giving the executives
about an hour to divide up the world's riches. But if participants are to be
believed, the talk is as innocuous as the menu, for they say they are more
likely to listen to a lecture or discuss the use of the Mitsubishi logo than
corner markets or create cartels.
Says the secretary: 'They don't like me to order food that's difficult for
them to chew. They generally prefer something warm. They may have a bowl of
noodles or rice with raw fish or sandwiches.'
In most Japanese offices on most days, the lunch of champions comes in a
lacquered box with quaint little compartments. The centrepiece of this boxed
lunch, called an obento, could be strips of eel, sushi or a rissole, livened
with shredded cabbage, pickled vegetables, a slice of a sweetish omelette,
rice and a small pile of cold spaghetti.
If a meeting is destined to drift into lunchtime, a Tokyo obento specialist
such as Yumeya or Hisago would be called, and the lacquered boxes delivered
on the back of a motorcycle. For guests, perhaps Y2,500 (Pounds 10) would be
the appropriate amount to spend, while the desk-bound worker ordering his or
her own would probably opt for a cheaper version with more rice and less
substance.
Takashi Taniguchi, manager of the Yamamaru restaurant, a favourite among
business people who eat out, offers set lunches ranging from Y1,200 to
Y3,500.
He says one consequence of economic downturn is that bills are being split,
reflecting the supposedly lower ceilings on expense accounts.
The National Tax Agency reported that expense account claims last year rose
a record 13 per cent. The agency's report early next year will prove the
best guide to the success or otherwise of the cost-cutting campaign on the
feverish evening entertaining that companies feel is necessary for the
cementing of long-term business relationships.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Management: Why diversity is a dirty word in some circles -
A look at the pros and cons of one of the most powerful corporate concepts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The principle that a diverse portfolio of investments is the best hedge
against bad times, for companies as well as for individuals, is as old as
the hills. But so, at least in the corporate world, should be the
recognition that diversity can be dangerous. It is now more than a decade
since a string of research studies, at the Harvard Business School and
elsewhere, began to demonstrate conclusively that most diversifications fail
 -especially those which are not related (or only distantly so) to the
company's 'core' activities and skills.
Hence, in part, the drastic purge of past diversifications which most
companies have carried out in the past few years. For the majority of them,
diversity is now out of fashion. Focus is the new watchword.
So it was quite a surprise late last month to read a statement supposedly
made by the chairman of WH Smith, the British retailing group which, in the
face of deep recession, has just produced a remarkable 27 per cent rise in
annual profits. 'Chairman attributes result to wide diversity of group
activities,' it read.
What the man said was rather different. But more of that later. The reality
is that diversity has come close to being a dirty word within WH Smith. This
is not surprising, since it has spent much of the past year reducing its
diversity by the sale of several peripheral but problem businesses which it
built up in the 1980s. The most peripheral one which still remains, its
do-it-yourself joint venture with Boots (called 'Do It All'), is causing
considerable problems.
The 'd-word' has cropped up several other times in the past week, notably in
commentary on the results of Williams Holdings, the UK
engineering-to-building products combine, and IMI, the engineering group. To
confuse matters further after the WH Smith misunderstanding, the word was
used positively to explain why their 1992 profits are running better than
some people expected.
With BTR, one of Britain's longest-surviving exponents of apparent
diversity, reporting yesterday, the time is ripe for clarification of what
people mean by diversity these days - or, rather, what they should mean.
Back in the expansive 1960s, the word was used more or less synonymously
with the term 'unrelated'. But then the business school boffins got to work
and divided diversity into two types: that which is 'related' to one's
'core' business (another piece of decidedly elastic jargon), and that which
is 'unrelated'. WH Smith's diversification into recorded music retailing was
related to its core book, newspaper and magazine retailing business, whereas
its moves into TV and travel were more or less unrelated.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was considerable progress
towards understanding what, if it was to have any meaning, 'relatedness'
involved. It was applied to three facets of a diversification: product,
technology, and geography. Studies aplenty during the 1980s showed that if a
company's diversification was unrelated to its existing businesses on more
than one of these three counts, it was dangerously risky.
Though most conglomerates crashed or unwound themselves in the 1980s, a
handful continued to thrive, notably Hanson and BTR. The reason for this
puzzled the boffins until a couple of them (plus some bright consultants)
came up with the answer. It was that though the products, industries and
technologies of many of the businesses owned by such conglomerates were
unrelated, there was a close relatedness (or 'focus') in the type of
managerial 'parenting' which the businesses required from group HQ.
Thus Hanson has been less diverse than it looks. It has concentrated on
mature, low-technology, short-cycle businesses which are not very
capital-intensive. These are most suited to its natural hands-off parenting
style - which the academics call 'financial control', as opposed to the
'strategic control' or 'strategic planning' styles of more interventionist
head offices. BTR has operated a somewhat similar approach, though for
'low-technology' read 'lowish'.
In the last 13 months, however, both BTR and Hanson have confused their
proven roles as focused corporate parents. BTR has announced the intention
of encouraging what it calls 'the cross-flow of knowledge' between
businesses - an approach which needs more head office intervention, as well
as more inter-business communication, than BTR is used to providing. In
other words, it requires a pretty unrelated type of parenting.
BTR has also said it intends to trade businesses more readily than in the
past - which, on several grounds, may interfere with its 'business
cross-flow' objective. It also means behaving more like Hanson. Meanwhile
the latter is moving in the opposite direction by declaring an intent (at
least in the US) to become less of a trader, and instead expand its 'core
businesses' - a role at which the famous Hanson skills are, at best,
unproven.
By contrast with this confusion, WH Smith has become crystal clear about the
role its head office should play and the type of businesses to which it
really can add maximum value. What its chairman actually said a fortnight
ago was three things: that the group had become more focused in the past
year or two; that it had drawn strength from the relative 'breadth' of its
retailing portfolio; and that there were still plenty of scale benefits to
come from sharing distribution and other systems between its businesses.
In such a context, 'breadth' means something quite different from
'diversity'. To coin a risky pun, WH Smith may have a thing or two to teach
BTR and Hanson about the dangers of trying to 'do it all'.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Watchdog issues 150 hints on judging efficiency of councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 150 indicators for comparing the performance of local authorities
were announced yesterday by the Audit Commission, the local government
watchdog.
The indicators, a key part of the Citizen's Charter, are intended to enable
people to judge the relative efficiency and effectiveness of their local
services.
They cover the 40-odd services provided by local councils - everything from
the quality of refuse collection and street cleaning to school meals; the
speed at which police respond to emergencies; and the accessibility of
public buildings to wheelchairs.
The commission is inviting comments on the proposed indicators before the
end of next month.
It will issue a final version in December, and councils will be obliged to
provide the information from the 1993-94 financial year.
Mr David Cooksey, Audit Commission chairman, said: 'We want to produce a
balanced set of indicators which will answer citizens' questions about what
is going on at their local authorities but without being simplified to the
point of nonsense.' The aim, he added, was to balance cost and quality.
Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service, welcomed the indicators.
'The introduction of performance indicators into local government is at the
heart of the Citizen's Charter commitment to giving the ordinary citizen
more information about the operation of local government services,' he said.
However, many of the indicators are straight comparisons of the quantity
and/or regularity of provision, which could lead to demands for increases in
both - and thus in local government spending.
Ms Margaret Hodge, vice-chair of the Labour-run Association of Metropolitan
Authorities, said the indicators were inadequate.

that has been made towards healing a four-year-old rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THEY DIDN'T say yes and they didn't say no. But delegates to the annual
conference of the Trades Union Congress made clear this week that they are
ready to make at least some of the compromises necessary for the readmission
of the EETPU electricians and thereby reunification of the trade union
movement.
The likelihood is that by the time they meet again next year, the EETPU will
be back in the TUC and one of the most damaging splits in the labour
movement will be over.
Nevertheless, there are some tough negotiations ahead and it is just
possible that the AEEU, formed last year through the merger of the EETPU and
AEU engineering workers, engineers, will end up outside the TUC.
The TUC general council resolution agreed merely to set up a framework for
negotiations on the AEEU's affiliation. Several unions, including the Prison
Officers' Association and the Ucatt construction workers, have strong
grievances against the EETPU.
The electricians have a long tradition of going their own way. Mr Paul
Gallagher, their new general secretary, repeated yesterday that he has still
to make up his mind about whether he will recommend affiliation to members
next year.
His executive colleagues at the AEU - the two former unions are still run
largely as separate organisations - believe he wants to be back in the TUC
club.
Even so, he has frequently questioned whether it would be worth the AEEU
paying the Pounds 1m TUC affiliation fees, and some actions he has
sanctioned as general secretary seem to indicate indifference.
Even after the EETPU merged with the AEU, it was involved in merger
negotiations with Cabin Crew 89, infuriating the TGWU general workers, from
which the airline workers in Cabin Crew 89 split three years ago. The merger
talks were abandoned after the intervention of Mr Gavin Laird, general
secretary of both the AEU and AEEU.
Mr Laird's attitude is that the EETPU must behave as if it were a TUC
affiliate after the formation of the AEEU in May, and that means not taking
members from other unions.
The remaining obstacles to negotiations arise because of the EETPU's
recruitment of other unions' members prior to the merger.
Controversy over the issue which led to the EETPU's expulsion - failure to
withdraw from two single-union deals - seems to have died down. More
difficult is the issue of members of other unions the EETPU has recruited
since its expulsion.
The Prison Officers' Association reckons that it has lost about 200 members
to the Prison Service Union, set up four years ago by former POA officials.
Mr David Evans, POA general secretary, says the PSU undermines its
negotiating position with the Home Office. 'We want our members back,' he
says.
Ucatt adopts a similar stance on former members recruited by the EETPU
during the past year, after its decision to hire 12 Ucatt officials. Mr
George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, estimates that there are at least
3,000 former members involved. 'The EETPU could not have recruited them if
it had been in the TUC,' he says. 'We want the EETPU to dismantle its
construction section and we want our members back.'
In the coming negotiations, both the Bridlington arrangements, which cover
inter-union disputes, and the government's proposed legal changes will work
in the AEEU's favour.
Even as presently constituted, the Bridlington arrangements cannot be used
to force unions to hand over members to other organisations. However, the
TUC has on some occasions told a union to cede members when it considers
another union has a more legitimate claim to them.
That is likely to become more difficult, perhaps impossible, after the
government introduces legislation allowing individuals to join the union of
their choice.
Members excluded against their wishes may be able to take their case to an
industrial tribunal.
The legislation is unlikely to be in force before next April, however, when
members of the AEEU are due to vote on TUC affiliation. Some unions will
want at least some concessions from the EETPU. They may be unwilling to
endorse a deal by which the electricians remain intact.
Difficult though all these issues will be, the pressure for a deal is
enormous and, theoretically, union leaders should have the skills to
conclude one. As one general council member said this week: 'You have to
remember that most of us made our reputations through our negotiating
abilities.'
The trouble is, that was also true in 1988 when the EETPU was expelled.

FT  11 SEP 92 / BMA will not fight London hospitals axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals to close some of London's most famous hospitals will
not be obstructed by the British Medical Association even though many
doctors' jobs will disappear.
At a meeting this week with Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, BMA leaders
accepted the case for hospital closures and concentrated on trying to ensure
that they take place in a planned and orderly way.
A report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of the Northern Regional
Health Authority, on hospital provision in London is due to reach the
government by the end of next month.
With Sir Bernard's deadline for completing his study approaching,
speculation is mounting over which hospitals might close. A report in the
London Evening Standard yesterday said that the Tomlinson report would lead
to the disappearance of St Thomas', St Bartholomew's, Charing Cross and the
combined University College-Middlesex hospitals in their present form.
Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA consultants committee, said the
association recognised that there had to be change in London hospital
provision. 'It has to be properly managed and planned around a sensible
timetable.'
The big London teaching hospitals are in increasing financial difficulty now
that, under the government's health reforms introduced last year, health
authorities outside the capital have greater incentives to treat patients
locally. In addition, Mr Chawner said, they were experiencing 'planning
blight' as a result of the Tomlinson inquiry. Health authorities were
reluctant to place contracts with a hospital that might be earmarked for
closure.
Doctors in London estimate that between 600 and 700 consultant posts, plus
the jobs of numerous other junior medical staff, are likely to disappear as
a result of the Tomlinson rationalisation.
Plans to close famous London hospitals are certain to meet opposition from
their staff, but BMA leaders will not back individual hospital campaigns.
They will concentrate their energies on issues arising out of the closures.
Those include:
Opening up opportunities in other parts of the country for medical staff who
lose their jobs in London.
Protecting the future of specialist clinical and research units housed in
teaching hospitals selected for closure.
Ensuring that the surviving hospitals contain a proper balance of services
to meet the needs of the capital.
The position adopted by the BMA even before the Tomlinson report has been
published shows the extent to which the new financial structure of the
government's health reforms has undermined the London teaching hospitals.
London has proportionately more hospital beds than the rest of the country.
Mr Chawner said the government had recognised decisions could not be based
on the failure of particular hospital managers to balance their books, and
had to be properly planned.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Row over return of EETPU avoided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress yesterday cleared the way for readmission of the
EETPU electricians' union, which is now a section of the merged AEEU
engineering workers' and electricians' union.
Delegates accepted a formula that allows considerable room for manoeuvre in
affiliation talks. A damaging row over the the union's reaffiliation was
avoided when the NUJ journalists' union agreed not to table a motion which
might have led to the AEU engineering workers' union, the EETPU's partner in
the new AEEU, quitting the TUC.
Nonetheless, Mr Colin Bourne, an NUJ delegate, was given one of the warmest
receptions of the week-long conference when he made a speech that included
strong criticism of the EETPU.
He accused the electricians of trying to build an alternative to the TUC and
basing it on 'every tiny scab union they could lay their hands on'. The
electricians would be welcomed back only if the issues that 'have made them
such pariahs are resolved to the satisfaction of the members of the club
they seek to join'.
The NUJ's motion would have imposed tough conditions on the talks, requiring
the EETPU to give up members it has recruited from other unions.
The debate was watched from the visitors' gallery by Mr Paul Gallagher,
EETPU general secretary. Afterwards he said he was not surprised at the
strength of feeling shown in the debate. But in areas where it matters
'people have forgiven and forgotten'.
He said the EETPU would obey TUC rules if it rejoined.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Top NHS man sent to health authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to send Sir Roy Griffiths, one of the National Health
Service's most senior figures, to strengthen the management of the West
Midlands Regional Health Authority.
Sir Roy's appointment follows a critical district auditor's report on a
cost-cutting study on which the authority spent Pounds 2.5m. The auditors
found that the study - which managers admit yielded few benefits - was badly
managed and involved Pounds 350,000 of expenses including entertainment.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said last night that Sir Roy,
deputy chairman of the NHS policy board, would help the authority discharge
its role efficiently and effectively for the future. He would help it
'continue to strengthen and improve its management structures and controls
so that they command public confidence.'
The contract criticised by the auditors was intended to identify ways of
saving up to Pounds 50m through better purchasing and efficiency. It was
awarded to United Research Group, a consultancy run by Mr Chris Watney,
former director of the authority's supplies division.
Sir James Ackers, chairman of West Midlands Regional Health Authority, said
yesterday that Mr Watney had left the authority in June last year, after an
internal review.
Mr Stuart Fletcher, the authority's recently appointed managing director,
said the auditors' report showed that the project was badly managed with
'serious shortcomings' in budgetary, financial and managerial control. Very
few of the projects involved in the cost-cutting study had brought any
lasting benefit to the NHS. 'Clearly there were failures in the handling of
this contract.'
Action since the report, Mr Fletcher said, had included efforts to recover
any overpayment on expenses, a review of the actions of officers, and
revision of contracting procedures.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Museums seek lottery aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MUSEUMS and Galleries Commission appealed yesterday for about half the
expected Pounds 500m income from the national lottery when it is set up in
1994.
Mr Peter Longman, the commission's director, said it could spend Pounds 250m
a year from the lottery for 10 years on improving museums.
The commission set out a national policy yesterday for the UK's 2,000
museums in a document, Museums Matter, that it is delivering to Mr David
Mellor, national heritage secretary. Similar lobbying is expected shortly
from the Arts Council and the Sports Council.
Mr Longman believes that, over a decade, the national museums need at least
Pounds 1bn to maintain deteriorating - mainly Victorian - structures.
He says the underfunded local-authority, university, and independent museums
require a similar sum, while Pounds 500m is needed to create endowments for
important private museums such as the Dulwich Art Gallery and Charleston
Farmhouse, the shrine of the Bloomsbury Group.
He said that independent museums should receive 'fair treatment' when
lottery proceeds are shared out. 'This would accord with the government's
expressed intention to safeguard our national heritage with the proceeds of
the lottery.'
Museums at present cost national and local government slightly more than
Pounds 400m a year, with two thirds going to the 19 national museums such as
the British Museum and the National Gallery.
Mr Greene pointed out that museums attracted 74m visitors a year. 'More
people visit museums each year than go to football matches and the theatre
combined,' he said.
The commission has grown in influence and importance in recent years.
In 1982 it had a revenue of Pounds 700,000. It now receives Pounds 9m from
the government and would expect to distribute the museum share of lottery
income if existing institutions were used for the task in preference to the
establishment of a Lotteries Commission.
The commission wants a Pounds 25m annual increase in museum purchasing
grants, frozen since 1985. That should make sure no work of national
importance goes overseas.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Vietnam may lift investment curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM is considering liberalising its foreign investment law, according to
Professor Nguyen Mai, vice-president of the State Council for Co-operation
and Investment.
He told a conference in London yesterday the proposed changes included:
allowing foreign investors to lease land for up to 50 years instead of 20;
permitting the sale of shares in some state enterprises to foreigners -
thereby creating a new category of foreign investment;
giving preference to joint venture investments, spread around the country.
Mr Mai said he had brought to London a list of 548 projects for investors to
consider.
There were 416 joint-venture projects in operation at the end of August,
involving capital investment of Dollars 3.35bn, for which Dollars 1.69bn has
been raised.
The main foreign partners, Mr Mai said, came from Taiwan, Hong Kong, France,
Netherlands, Japan, Britain, Australia, the Commonwealth of Independent
States, South Korea and Canada.
Of the 416 projects, 233 (with capital investment of Dollars 1.11bn) were in
industry, 18 (Dollars 900m) in oil and gas, 41 (Dollars 660m) in hotels and
tourism, and 55 (Dollars 166m) in services.
A report* issued at the conference said Vietnam could become one of
South-East Asia's most important tourism destinations if hotel building
plans were fulfilled.
It said 40 hotels had opened in Ho Chi Minh City and 40 more were to be
built.
The total number of visitors to Vietnam in 1991 was about 850,000, including
300,000 from western Europe, South-East Asia, Japan, Australia and North
America.
The figure for tourism was 36 per cent higher than in 1990 - with
indications that in 1992 the figures would grow by at least that amount
again.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Rabin ready for Golan concessions to achieve peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday said he was ready
for territorial compromise in exchange for peace with Syria, the clearest
indication to date that he would make significant concessions on the Golan
Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and later virtually annexed by Israel.
Mr Rabin was careful not to go beyond a general commitment, which fell far
short of the complete withdrawal from the Golan demanded by Syria. He also
stressed that territorial concessions would only be discussed once Syria
committed itself to the principle of a full peace treaty with Israel.
'We have said that in exchange for a peace treaty which promises an end to
war and opens the borders between Syria and Israel, diplomatic relations and
normalisation, Israel is ready to implement (UN Resolutions) 242 and 338 . .
. This implies, of course, some sort of territorial compromise,' Mr Rabin
said.
Since the Washington talks broke for a 10-day recess earlier this month, Mr
Rabin has spoken almost daily of what he calls 'important progress' made in
the last round with Damascus. Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, called it
'nearly sensational'.
As if to prepare public opinion for Israeli concessions, Mr Rabin has warned
that 'peace for peace' would be impossible to achieve. He says he is willing
to consider interim steps if a full peace treaty is not immediately
available.
Israeli hopes of a breakthrough have been prompted by a document presented
by Syria in Washington, which Israeli officials said expressed for the first
time in writing Syria's willingness to make peace, and acknowledged Israel's
security concerns.
One possibility being canvassed in Jerusalem is that Syria might accept a
period of continued Israeli control in most of the Golan in exchange for a
formal acknowledgment of Syria's sovereignty over the strategic range of
hills. This would allow Jewish settlers on the heights - increasingly
concerned for their future - to stay at least for some time.
However, Damascus has given little indication so far that it will settle for
anything less than a complete return of the heights. Mr Farouk al-Shara,
Syrian foreign minister, reiterated yesterday that his country would make no
territorial compromise with Israel on the occupied Golan Heights.
He said the implication of some sort of territorial compromise was
'completely unacceptable and contradicts the substance and the spirit of the
peace talks . . . that aim for a full withdrawal.'

FT  11 SEP 92 / Japanese angered over Yeltsin cancellation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese government was left in shock yesterday as political leaders
puzzled over the diplomatic significance of Mr Boris Yeltsin's decision to
abruptly cancel his visit to Japan, scheduled for this Sunday.
Mr Kato Koichi, chief cabinet secretary, insisted that relations with Russia
would not change, despite disappointment over the cancellation.
Mr Kato also said Japan would not soften its demand that Russia recognise
Japanese sovereignty over the four Kurile islands which Soviet forces seized
at the end of the second world war. Mr Yeltsin is widely believed to have
cancelled the visit because of Japan's insistence the issue be solved before
it can extend significant economic aid.
Mr Yeltsin's behaviour in the affair has confirmed long-standing Japanese
distrust of Russia, which has deep historical roots. The manner in which
news of Mr Yeltsin's decision came to light was most embarrassing, with
senior ministers rushing to the prime minister's official residence to
receive a phone call from Mr Yeltsin, only to have to wait over an hour
before the call came through.
The fact that Mr Yeltsin phoned President Mr Roh Tae-woo of South Korea to
tell him of the cancelled trip before informing Japan was also seen as an
unsubtle diplomatic snub.
The Asahi Shimbun, the daily newspaper, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry
official as saying: 'This proves Russia's diplomacy is inept. We should not
take what the Russian government says seriously from now on.'
On the other hand, there was also plenty of criticism of what appeared to be
Japan's diplomatic ineptitude over the territorial issue, in which it pushed
Mr Yeltsin into a corner and obtained nothing as a result.
Mr Takahiro Yokomichi, the governor of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main
island, told the Mianichi Evening News: 'The Japanese government aimed at
100 per cent but actually scored zero points even though the Russian
government made a special effort to improve the relationship.'
Despite government assurances that nothing has changed, there is widespread
fear that relations between Japan and Russia, which were only just begining
to thaw, have been put back into the freezer. There is also fear that an
historic opportunity to cement Russo-Japanese relations and shore up Mr
Yeltsin's presidency may have been lost.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Iran opens rift with Arabs over islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OPEN row has broken out between Iran and the six Arab members of the Gulf
Co-operation Council over the control of three islands near the mouth of the
Gulf.
Iran repeated yesterday its claim of sovereignty over Abu Musa, together
with the Great Tumb and Lesser Tumb Islands. The statement from Tehran came
in response to an earlier communique from the GCC states (Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar) deploring what they
described as the 'virtual annexation' by Iran of the islands.
Since 1971 Abu Musa has been jointly administered by Iran and Sharjah, part
of the UAE. However, earlier this year Iran began pressing expatriates
employed by the UAE to leave the islands and increasing the number of its
own nationals. Last month Iran turned back a ship carrying passengers from
the UAE.
Iran added yesterday that 'residents of Abu Musa holding Sharjah citizenship
can continue their life there with their Iranian brothers and sisters.'
Diplomats were at loss to explain Iran's provocative action at a time when
it was generally improving relations with the other Gulf countries,
especially Saudi Arabia, and promoting a more pragmatic image around the
world.
The renewed claim to Abu Musa may in part reflect Iran's eagerness to
exploit the relative weakness of the Arabs in the Gulf in the wake of Iraq's
defeat. It could also be designed to test the US which now dominates the
region militarily.
Iran has deplored the increased US presence in the region, but will probably
be looking to take political advantage of the allied air exclusion zone over
southern Iraq by aiding the Shia population. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein
has moved additional forces to the border to deter infiltration.

FT  11 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Seconds out . . . - The first shots
have been fired in a battle to boost the image of London Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the right hand corner stands Knocker, a man who buys his Christmas cards
in the January sales and thinks Concorde should never have taken off. Facing
him is Docker, who believes the Channel Tunnel is a good idea, even if it
only means that you get a better croissant, and that an office is not just
space, it is a 'wavelength'.
The battleground is London Docklands: Knocker wishes it were never built;
Docker welcomes every penny spent on it. Round one got under way this week.
Knocker and Docker are the characters in a quirky advertising campaign
launched this week in national newspapers aimed at beefing up the image of
London Docklands. After the battering docklands has received in the past
year - the collapse of Canary Wharf and thousands of square metres of office
space awaiting tenants - it needs this shot in the arm.
The campaign has been greeted with as much derision as acclaim. Admirers
conceded that it would be hard to identify with either stereotype. If
anything, Knocker, the rational, thrifty and conservative dullard, is more
in tune with recessionary Britain than his trendy, cavalier counterpart.
But D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, the advertising company which created the
campaign for the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC), thinks the
advertisements will help overcome the prejudice surrounding docklands. More
important, the Pounds 600,000, four-week campaign is designed to attract the
attention of businesses considering relocation.
'All we can hope to do is to get people to open their minds. I think we have
a neat way of pricking people's consciences,' says Mr Graham Hinton, joint
chief executive of DMB&amp;B. Ironically, the company has had problems in
persuading its own staff about the merits of its planned move to Canary
Wharf.
The Docklands campaign is perhaps the most prominent of several new property
marketing drives to be launched this autumn.
Property marketing became big business in the buoyant late-1980s. Marketing
a property once involved producing a simple brochure and placing an
advertisement in a trade magazine. In the mid-1980s this gave way to lavish
launches, elaborate brochures, hoardings, radio advertising and extravagant
'freebies'. Agents were - and sometimes still are - enticed to receptions
with the promise of free whisky, shirts and televisions.
But with the industry reeling from the effects of recession, the pendulum is
now swinging back to more austere ways. At a time of financial stringency,
the effectiveness of marketing - and the thousands of pounds spent on
launches and advertising - has rarely been under greater scrutiny.
As a result, developers are cutting back their advertising budgets and
increasingly relying on agents to market their building. 'In the heyday,
developers would spend Pounds 1 a square foot on marketing,' says Mr Charles
Okin of Edward Charles, a West End property agency. 'It is now down to half
that.'
Today, property owners are not even convinced they need to advertise to
attract tenants. MEPC, for instance, argues that in the current state of the
market, companies which are looking for new premises do employ agents. Since
the agent's job is to know which property is on the market, advertising is
often an avoidable expense. Many other landlords believe that since they
already pay agents to market their properties, there is no reason why they
should duplicate efforts by doing their own marketing.
The marketing specialists, not surprisingly, reject this viewpoint. 'The
developers who are stopping marketing are shooting themselves in the foot,'
says Mr Rob Gilbert of Gilbert Doyle, one of Europe's largest property
advertising agencies.
He argues that not all potential tenants employ agents. Moreover, a landlord
who relies on his own agent to market his property may receive a poor
service because agents often have dozens of properties on their books - all
of which must be marketed.
The core of Mr Doyle's argument is that marketing costs relatively little
compared with the costs of keeping an office block empty.
Landlords, of course, are only too aware of this. But that does not diminish
the challenge for the agents, marketing, public relations and advertising
specialists in persuading property owners that they can secure tenants.
It is a sign of the times that none of these specialists can be too boastful
about their efficacy. After all, skilled marketing cannot overcome
deficiencies in the product or its location.
In Docklands, for instance, every advertising strategy has been tried and
found to be flawed. At one end of the scale there are brash advertisements
about the cheapness of premises; Wyn-Ro Investments used such tactics to
market South Quay Plaza last year. At the other end of the scale is Canary
Wharf, which employed senior figures from advertising and banking who still
found it difficult to attract tenants.
Specialists point to some basic guidelines when marketing a property. Most
fundamental is that properties need to be in their best condition when being
viewed. 'Inspections are like gold dust. You can't waste the opportunity,'
says Mr Charles Okin.
Another important point is to play on the building's merits. If a building
is architecturally or environmentally distinguished, this should be
emphasised. Landlords should also employ direct methods to reach potential
tenants, bypassing their agents. 'More and more we are trying to get
directly to tenants,' says Mr Rob Gilbert of Gilbert Doyle. He suggests that
brochures, letters and research findings should be sent directly to managing
directors of companies looking for new premises.
A more subtle if less well-targetted approach than sending out junk mail is
enticing potential tenants to see the building on another pretence.
Drama, exhibitions and even wine tasting are common baits. One example is
the National Museum of Cartoon Art, which opens its first exhibition next
week in a 19th century office block owned by Lynton, the property arm of
BAA. As well as attracting possibly influential people to the building,
there is a 'feel good, altruistic' message about benefitting the arts, says
Mr Iain Taylor of Hudson Sandler, Lynton's publicity adviser.
Another tactic, this time for Imry's building in Grosvenor Street, is wine
tasting in conjunction with Grants of St James, the up-market wine seller.
'It is important that the invitation comes from Grants of St James,' says Mr
Taylor. He says the costs of such an event are comparable to placing an
advertisement in the trade press, but generate 150 viewings at a stroke.
It is hardly a surprise that landlords should be cynical about marketing;
but at the same time they know they cannot ignore it. As Lord Leverhulme,
founder of consumer products group Unilever, once famously remarked, half
the money spent on advertising is wasted; the difficulty is knowing which
half.

FT  11 SEP 92 / US Senate report set to attack Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 600-PAGE US Senate report on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
affair is likely to be sharply critical of the role of the Bank of England
and could embarrass the UK government, write Alan Friedman in New York and
Robert Peston in London.
The US report on the corrupt international bank is to be published on
September 23, so is likely to pre-empt publication of a UK report on whether
BCCI was supervised properly by the Bank of England and the UK government.
The UK report - by Lord Bingham, recently appointed Master of the Rolls - is
not due out until mid-October, according to a senior official. The Bingham
report is also critical of the Bank of England.
The US report is being prepared by Senator John Kerry who, since 1989, has
spearheaded US Congressional investigations of BCCI.
His 200,000-word report is likely to deal with relations between western
intelligence services and BCCI; with the behaviour of US and British bank
regulators in the period up to July 5 1991, when BCCI was shut down; and
with the role of Price Waterhouse and other former BCCI auditors.
A federal judge in Washington yesterday ruled that Mr Clark Clifford, the
former US defence secretary facing criminal charges regarding the collapsed
BCCI, should first stand trial in New York before facing a federal
indictment in Washington. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Judge Joyce Hens Green granted a prosecution request that the Washington
trial of Mr Clifford be postponed until at least next March, so that he can
first be tried on the more serious New York charges of accepting bribes,
conspiracy to commit fraud and misleading bank regulators. The New York
trial is expected to begin in early January.
Justice Department officials have said the Washington case might then be
dropped.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US President George Bush's campaigning thumbs-up at Middletown, New Jersey,
did not reflect the bad news yesterday from both the nation's economy and
some of the country's leading economists. Jobless claims for the week ending
August 29 showed a persistent weakness in the labour market, after
adjustment for several distortions in the data, reports Reuter from New York
and Washington.
For the week, 394,000 initial state claims were filed, an increase of 8,000
over the previous week. But that figure did not take into account 11,587
claimants who filed under a new federal emergency programme, so claims were
more than 400,000, economists said.
Meanwhile, Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a group of influential economists
often cited by the White House, said the economy is deteriorating and that
Mr Bush will not win re-election in November.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Bending young twigs in a different way: Political rumpus in
Mexico over how national history is being taught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 20m Mexican children returned to school last week to discover that
their smart new history textbooks have become the centre of a political row.
The books have been roundly condemned for having betrayed Mexico's
revolutionary past and crudely promoted President Carlos Salinas's
technocratic view of the world.
The official rewriting of Mexican history has scandalised the leftist
intelligentsia, for whom a nationalist, anti-US interpretation of the
national past is central to their opposition to Mr Salinas's economic
reforms. They charge (with characteristic exaggeration) that the new
textbooks downplay the Mexican revolution of the early years of this
century, skip over a difficult and antagonistic relationship with the US,
and worst of all, portray Mr Salinas as a national hero.
The books are mandatory reading for children aged 10-12, and are treated
with great sensitivity in a country where debate about history shapes, and
reflects, political opinions. Ask a Mexican for his views on Hernan Cortes,
the Spanish conquistador of the 16th century, Porfirio Daz, the dictator of
1877-1911, and Emiliano Zapata, the revolutionary hero, and his attitude to
modern politics becomes clear.
The row, dominating Mexican newspapers, has been exacerbated by allegations
of favouritism and sloppy research. The president's pet intellectual, Mr
Hector Aguilar Camn, from the editorial group Nexos, was put in charge of
the historians who wrote the text. He is claimed to be much too closely
involved with the government to be critical of it. Nexos runs a television
station, a monthly magazine, a publishing house, and is said to be bidding
for the government newspaper, El Nacional.
The texts were written in just two months, without consulting teachers, and
contain widely-publicised historical errors.
The old textbooks faithfully reflected the nationalist, inward-looking
Mexico that Mr Salinas is trying to leave behind. These indignantly
described how the US stole half the country's territory (Texas, California
and New Mexico) in the last century; they vilified Porfirio Daz for having
sold out to foreign capital and worsened inequality of incomes; they praised
such revolutionary figures as Zapata, Pancho Villa and Flores Magon; they
described the period since the 1940s as one of uninterrupted progress.
The new textbooks try not to apportion blame and, as such, are meant to be
less ideological. They point out that most Texans in the 1830s wanted to
leave Mexico, and maintain that the northern parts of what was then Mexico
were unconnected to the rest of the country. By implication, the loss of
half the territory to the US was not such a blow.
Porfirio Daz is congratulated for having attracted foreign investment that
promoted economic development, for having pacified the country and built
railways - praise only partly offset by criticism. The revolutionary heroes
are described briefly, even dismissively. The antagonism between the US and
Mexico over the latter's nationalisation of its oil in 1938 is skipped over
lightly.
The treatment of the post-1940s has created the most controversy. For the
first time, the official textbook describes the massacre at Tlatelolco,
where the army killed 200-300 protesters in 1968, but the text merely says
the army opened fire - without saying whether it was acting on government
instructions.
No mention is made of the alleged fraud widely held to have characterised
the 1988 presidential election that brought Mr Salinas to power. President
Salinas's government 'has showed energy and followed a clear course', and is
praised for having brought down inflation, increased growth and spent money
on alleviating poverty.
Many acknowledge the new books are an improvement on the old, but they
certainly reflect the Salinas view of the world. Political figures who
promoted economic growth are considered more favourably than those who
fought for social change.
But, if Mr Salinas hoped a bit of historical revision would legitimise his
government, he may have miscalculated. The government has been so stung by
the criticisms that it is already back-tracking, saying the books will be
revised after consultations with teachers and parents. The presidential
chances of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, education secretary and former budget
minister, are thought to have suffered.
