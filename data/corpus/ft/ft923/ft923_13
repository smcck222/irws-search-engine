FT  07 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Unemployment data spur rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE latest US jobs data could not have been worse. Against expectations of a
rise in August of about 150,000, employment actually fell by 183,000 -
excluding seasonal distortions caused by federal jobs programmes.
Non-farm employment was down by 83,000 and the weakness of the US economy
proved to be an across-the-board affair, with jobs being lost as speedily in
the manufacturing industry as in the retailing sector. Factory employment is
now at the lowest level since 1983.
For President Bush, the latest unemployment numbers offered more bad news on
the electoral front. For challenger Bill Clinton, another opportunity was
served up for attacks on the Bush Administration's economic record.
Back in the real world, the Federal Reserve, having last cut the discount
rate last July, found its options limited due to the weakness of the US
dollar, now the bargain basement currency of the world foreign exchange
market.
While the White House struggled to put a favourable spin on the penultimate
set of jobs data to be released before election day, the Fed injected money
into the banking system and signalled a quarter point reduction in the
target range of the Fed funds rate, from 3 1/4 to 3 per cent.
The jobs data and limited Fed action spurred a sharp rally in the Treasury
bond market on Friday. The price of the 30-year benchmark Treasury issue
gained nearly a full point on the day and the yield fell to 7.28 per cent, a
level seen briefly last month, but more recognisable as the yield on offer
more than five years ago.
Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, was meanwhile criticised harshly by some
economists who feel the economy needs shock treatment rather than more
gradualism in monetary policy. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities in New York, said the dollar should be damned and the Fed should
act to cut interest rates still further.
'The true culprit here is the Fed and the blame must fall on its leader,
Alan Greenspan,' said Mr Brusca. 'The Fed has been behind in providing for
the economy's needs since before the recession started. Here we are, 25
months after the recession began, with nothing that looks remotely like even
the worst post-war recovery we have seen - and with a currency crisis to
boot. The Fed has bungled away all its flexibility to reduce interest rates,
and now, with little firepower left, the dollar is sinking - despite low
inflation.'
At Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, sentiment was less vitriolic. The Fed, said
DLJ, had no choice but to react to the disastrous jobs data by easing
monetary policy. Whether or not the absence of a discount rate cut was
dictated by foreign exchange considerations or mere logistical timing
considerations remained to be seen. 'We suspect the latter,' said DLJ.
The bond market may be happy at the effect of more bad economic news on
prices. But in broader terms, the outlook for the US economy seems gloomier
than ever. Nor are September jobs figures, to be released in early October,
likely to look improved. In fact they could be even worse since they will
include many who were thrown out of work in Florida by Hurricane Andrew.
The bottom line, both for the politicians and the economy itself, may be
that even much lower rates are not sufficient to stimulate spending by those
many terrified and debt-burdened American consumers and companies who are
struggling through the present deflationary environment. The genuinely
structural - rather than cyclical - nature of America's economic woes is
finally becoming apparent.

FT  07 SEP 92 / UK Gilts: Novel borrowing plan eases pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gilt-edged market has had an agonising summer, worried sick by the two
bugbears of sterling weakness and funding pressure. Last week, the
government succeeded in dispelling those fears in one fell swoop: it
announced that it would borrow the equivalent of Ecu10bn in D-Marks and a
range of other foreign currencies, using the funds to support sterling in
the foreign exchange market and to fund government spending.
The borrowing plan consists of a three-year multi-currency revolving credit
facility with a group of international banks and a longer-term
multi-currency note issue programme. The Treasury said the government would
borrow about DM5bn 'over the next few days', converting the proceeds into
sterling, and that a further DM5bn would be drawn in the same way later this
month. The second part of the borrowing operation is due to begin next month
when the multi-currency note issue programme comes into play.
The Treasury's plan sent three important signals to the gilt-edged market:
it emphasised the government's commitment to supporting sterling;
it removed the threat of an imminent hike in the base rate;
it cut the equivalent of about Pounds 7.3bn from the government's gilt
funding programme.
The recent weakness of sterling against the D-Mark has been a source of
considerable worry in the gilt-edged market and had left many investors
worried about the possibility of a sterling devaluation. In the days before
the Treasury made its borrowing announcement, sterling had come close to
scraping its DM2.778 floor in the European exchange rate mechanism. By the
end of last week, sterling had strengthened to DM2.80.
'The government has removed all doubts in the minds of the foreign exchange
market that sterling will be devalued, at least in the near term . . . As a
result, sterling should trade at above DM2.80, at least ahead of the French
referendum (on ratification of the Maastricht treaty) and we anticipate a
trading range of DM2.80-DM2.85,' says Mr Steven Bell, economic adviser to
Deutsche Bank Gilts. Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities
adds that the Treasury's borrowing plan demonstrates the strength of the
government's resolve to avoid a sterling devaluation, regardless of the
outcome of the French referendum.
By removing the threat of a devaluation, the government may woo some foreign
investors back to the gilt-edged market. Bank of England figures on gilt
sales over the last few months show that the bulk of the sales have been to
domestic investors. 'We've seen heavy selling of gilts by foreign investors
recently - they have no problem believing the UK can manage meeting the
convergence criteria implied by the Maastricht treaty but they are terrified
of a realignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS,'
says one fixed income analyst.
By showing the government's determination to support sterling, the borrowing
plan also helps to reduce the risk of a base rate rise. The weakness of the
lira last Friday meant the Bank of Italy was forced to raise domestic
interest rates again, having only recently lowered the discount rate - and
clearly Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, does not want to be put in the
embarrassing position of raising UK interest rates in order to defend
sterling.
There is still a risk that UK interest rates may be forced upwards if the
French vote against the Maastricht treaty and set off another bout of
turbulence in the financial markets. But for the moment at least, the
borrowing plan buys time for the government - and if France votes in favour,
then the prospects for the gilt market should improve as most economists
expect Germany to start lowering interest rates next year.
The third way in which the gilt-edged market benefits from the Treasury's
novel plan stems from the fact that the financing will be used to fund
government spending, significantly reducing the level of funding that the
government will need to do in the gilt market. The Ecu10bn is equivalent to
about Pounds 7.3bn - or roughly three gilt auctions. According to Mr
Shepperd, estimated gross gilt sales for 1992/93 have been reduced from
Pounds 37bn to Pounds 29bn as a result: since the Bank of England has
already secured about Pounds 19bn of funding, this leaves only Pounds 10bn
to be funded in the rest of the financial year.
'At only Pounds 1.4bn a month, this implies a major deceleration in the pace
of funding,' says Mr Shepperd. Other economists believe the funding
requirement may be even smaller than this. But the important point is that
the Bank will be under far less pressure to issue gilts. Over half of the
gilt issuance so far this year has been at the long end of the market, and
not surprisingly this is the area which has showed the strongest gains on
the basis of the lower funding requirement with long-dated gilts jumping up
to two points on Thursday after the announcement.
Early on Friday morning, the Bank decided to take advantage of the gilt
market's buoyant mood to issue four tranches of existing stock amounting to
Pounds 750m and covering a range of maturities. One of the tranches - Pounds
150m of the 8.75 per cent gilt due 1997 - was exhausted on the same day. The
Bank's action was reminiscent of its behaviour at the time of the general
election when it seized the opportunity to sell gilts during the night as
soon as it became clear that the Conservatives had won another term in
office.
Clearly, the Bank will use any favourable opportunity to issue gilts,
leading some economists to suggest that even though the government's funding
requirement has been reduced by the foreign currency borrowing, the Bank
could use the favourable market conditions to bring forward some of the
funding for the next financial year.

FT  07 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Can lessons be drawn from 'Carter
Bonds'?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury's foreign currency borrowing operation has an interesting
precedent in the 1970s in the US, where foreign currency bonds designed to
help defend the dollar were dubbed 'Carter bonds'. Between October 1978 and
January 1980, the US issued Dollars 6.4bn of Carter bonds, of which Dollars
5.2bn were denominated in D-Marks and Dollars 1.2bn in Swiss francs, sold
only to legal residents of Germany and Switzerland respectively. Can any
lessons be drawn from the US experience? The dollar did rally, but only
temporarily and not necessarily as a result of the Carter bond programme:
during the summer of 1978, the discount rate was lifted several times in
conjunction with the Carter package. Even then, most economists believe it
was the imposition of tighter monetary policy which finally helped support
the dollar.
'(Carter Bonds) do not serve as a model because the US has never been in the
position of the tail wagging the dog - where currency strength is the single
most important factor, superceding the domestic economy,' said Mr George
Magnus, chief international economist at SG Warburg.

FT  07 SEP 92 / International Bonds: UK decision excites foreign interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Treasury's decision to borrow Ecu10bn in foreign currencies,
announced last week, represents an unusually bold step to support a currency
by tapping the international capital markets. While other countries have
indirectly supported their domestic currencies by borrowing abroad, rarely
has that intention been so directly expressed.
Further, the move runs counter to the current trend among most of the
world's leading economic powers. Most G10 countries have reduced their
dependency on foreign currency borrowings in recent years. On the other
hand, smaller sovereign borrowers, such as Belgium and Finland, and emerging
economies like Mexico, have tended to be more active in foreign bond
markets, often because their domestic markets are still too small or too
restricted to meet their financing needs.
However, in the wake of the UK Treasury move last Thursday, investment
bankers called a number of sovereign borrowers in an attempt to whip up
interest in similar projects.
Top of the list of potential copy-cat borrowers is Italy, which had to lift
interest rates again on Friday. The Italians have been active borrowers in
the international capital markets but have never raised D-Marks.
Even though they have been keen to tap the D-Mark sector for some time, the
Italian treasury would only issue under Italian law. Until August,
Bundesbank rules required all borrowers to issue D-Marks under German law,
effectively barring the Italians from the market. The scrapping of that
requirement on August 1, as part of a series of rule changes by the
Bundesbank, effectively opens the way for the Italians to borrow in D-Marks.
Bankers said that some Scandinavian countries might also consider borrowing
in D-Marks to support their currencies. However, for Sweden, this would mean
a reversal of a decision to avoid foreign bond markets, as part of its debt
reduction programme.
Finland, which devalued the markka earlier this year, expects to raise half
its planned Dollars 12bn funding programme this year in foreign currencies.
Finland launched a DM2bn bond issue earlier this year, though not with the
explicit aim of bolstering its currency.
But, with the exception of Italy (which had gross debt of Dollars 1,167bn at
the end of 1991, more than 100 per cent of its GDP), most G7 countries are
expected to stay away from foreign bond markets.
Countries like Germany, Japan, and the US, with large internationally-traded
government bond markets, have little incentive to change this policy. Apart
from its politically-motivated Ecu bond programme, France has also stuck to
its domestic currency. Canada last tapped the Eurobond market in 1986,
leaving room for its provinces to raise funds overseas to meet their own
heavy financing needs.
The UK Treasury is also unusual in choosing to borrow directly from banks,
by arranging a syndicated facility. 'Most sovereign borrowers now only use
banks for short-term funding, although there are plenty of private bilateral
agreements,' one banker said. Syndicated loans have in recent years proved
substantially more expensive for sovereign borrowers than the bond markets.
For the Treasury, however, a syndicated facility, through which the UK is
raising DM10bn this month, was needed to provide flexibility and speed of
execution, as well as to accommodate the size of the transaction. The D-Mark
financing underlines the government's commitment to underpinning the pound
and the sale of the D-Mark proceeds for sterling will provide tangible
support in the foreign exchange market. A bond offering would have had a
fixed maturity date, and foreign exchange dealers would have known when the
Bank of England needed to buy D-Marks to repay the debt. Borrowings under
the three-year facility can be rolled-over and refinanced at various stages
throughout the three-year life of the facility.

FT  07 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Europe stays out of step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European 'triumphs' of the past few days will look very odd in the
history books. First the Bank of England reminded us that it still has some
of its old, low cunning, got out the banners and the brass band, and went
long on sterling. The markets cheered.
This gesture is meaningless in economic or even in financial terms. The
effect of the official currency borrowing is exactly the same as the effect
of using our own reserves, or even of leaving the Germans to use theirs, as
they are obliged to do under the EMS arrangements: it saves interest, but
will lose on capital if sterling is revalued. However, it knew its markets:
they were longing for anything, even an empty gesture, to celebrate. This
might have made a nice curtain-raiser for the finance ministers' meeting in
Bath had not the US produced some simply dreadful employment figures, and
cut dollar interest rates still further.
But the ministers could not allow this reminder of reality to disturb their
agenda. Despite a possible triple-dip across the Atlantic, and the EC's
sharp downward revision of its own modest growth forecast, the ministers
agreed to make things worse. They accepted an unchanged German policy of
sado-monetarism as a concession, and agreed to go on trying to deflate any
'weaker' economy which still shows some signs of life. Not one word about
growth. It could almost be a plot to secure a French Non, and save a lot of
ministers from having to eat a lot of words.
This collective obsession with the problems of the 1980s would be easier to
understand if it were general; it is hard to break out of a world consensus.
The fact is, though, that the consensus has moved, and the change will in
due course make European policy intolerable even to its authors. The
Americans have for several years pursued a determined policy of devaluation
 -and this remains quite explicit. After the rate cut on Friday, a Fed
governor was on hand to explain to the Press that this would further weaken
the dollar, and so help exports.
Competitive devaluation was the standard slump remedy of the 1930s. In those
days it was a zero-sum game; now it is unilateral, and moderately effective,
because nobody else is joining in. It has not yet produced a strong US
recovery, partly because European demand is falling even faster than the US
can gain competitiveness; the US machine tool industry, for example,
recently reported a 30 per cent fall in export demand, although home orders
are rising.
But the US still enjoys some growth, despite flat incomes, swingeing defence
cuts, and a debt crisis. What is more, US inflation is still falling. The US
authorities seem to remember what they learned in first-year economics: that
in a recession, devaluation does indeed change the terms of trade. This
truth is denied to our own gurus, still guided by models full of data from a
different age. They should go back to school.
A different example is being set on the other side of the world: the
Japanese have rediscovered Keynes. The Y10,700bn Comprehensive Economic
Measures announced the week before last are the real thing, much more
ambitious than expected. This is an emergency package designed above all,
admittedly, to save the banking system; but it is also liable to transform
the economy.
For the Japanese Ministry of Finance this marks a U-turn on a truly heroic
scale - something which makes the Volcker monetary relaxation of 1982 look
cautious and half-hearted. It shows, not for the first time, that the
Japanese system can change strategy sharply when required. The US central
bankers' conference in Jackson Hole last month, which concentrated on growth
strategies, was a straw in the same wind of change, which would soon turn to
action if Clinton wins.
Europe, though, is likely to sit this one out, too uncompetitive to share in
a US recovery, irrelevant to a Japanese infrastructure programme, and too
depressed internally to mount its own recovery. Sooner or later the pfennig
will drop. Until then, aggressive international diversification looks like
the cautiously responsible policy.

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car group, is launching a Dollars 600m syndicated loan
which will replace an existing facility and help to extend its debt maturity
profile.
The new credit consists of three separate tranches: a Dollars 150m 364-day
revolving credit; a Dollars 200m five-year revolving credit; and a Dollars
250m five-year term loan.
The short-term revolving credit has a commitment fee of 12.5 basis points
and a margin of 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate.
The five-year revolving credit has a commitment fee of 22.5 basis points and
a margin of 45 basis points over Libor.
The five-year term loan also has a margin of 45 basis points over Libor and
front-end fees ranging from 7.5 to 12.5 basis points.
Credit Suisse First Boston, the arranger of the transaction, said the credit
facilities are intended to replace a Dollars 700m credit facility which was
set up in 1988 and which is due to expire shortly.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Many UK companies fail to reveal R&amp;D costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY British companies are not showing the amount they spend on research and
development in their annual accounts in spite of an accounting standard
normally requiring its disclosure.
An analysis for the Financial Times by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monitoring service of accounts, shows that 10 per cent of
quoted companies with evidence of R&amp;D expenditure do not publish the amount
they spend.
But SSAP 13, a UK accounting standard, says R&amp;D expenditure on the profit
and loss account should be disclosed and analysed between spending in the
current year and that capitalised over future years.
There are notes on the treatment of R&amp;D in the accounting policies section
of the latest accounts for companies including Rothmans International and
Tate &amp; Lyle but no disclosure of amounts.
Mr Jan Du Plessis, group finance director at Rothmans International, said
his company did not provide a figure for R&amp;D because the amount was
insignificant. It disclosed its accounting policy on R&amp;D because that was
'prudent'.
Similarly, references to R&amp;D are made in the directors' reports of companies
including Asda, RMC, BET and Forte, but none shows how much is spent. J
Sainsbury's directors report says only that R&amp;D expenditure 'exceeds Pounds
4m'.
From 597 companies which reported in the past year, 236 or 40 per cent refer
to R&amp;D spending, usually in the directors' report or the accounting
policies.
However, 58 companies, or 25 per cent of those which show some evidence of
R&amp;D, do not disclose the sums they spend.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: Reformers run the gauntlet of politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manmohan Singh and Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance ministers of India and
Pakistan respectively, are both bold reformers. They are attempting to steer
their countries away from socialist-inspired bureaucracy and to shift the
impetus for growth to the private sector.
They are eloquent and sincere technocrats rather than career politicians.
But their reform policies at present enjoy a political consensus. Each has
the enthusiastic backing of his prime minister, and the grudging
acquiescence of opposition parties.
Their tasks are huge, and the achievements already significant.
Since elections in October 1990, Pakistan has abolished licensing
(bureaucratic sanction for corporate investment); undertaken rapid
privatisation of industry and banks; removed virtually all restrictions on
currency movements and foreign investment; deregulated interest rates;
started to dismantle trade barriers; and begun big improvements in physical
and social infrastructure.
Since India's elections in June 1991, the government has abolished
licensing; cut the fiscal deficit; removed most restrictions on foreign
investment; made the rupee partially convertible; relaxed import curbs and
begun to cut tariffs; reduced subsidies and deregulated interest rates; and
started the restructuring of state industry, with tentative steps towards
privatisation.
Mr Aziz and Mr Singh are trying to maintain a momentum which will prevent a
variety of special interests - bureaucrats, industrialists protected by
tariff barriers, labour unions - from regaining the initiative and tilting
back towards the cosy excesses of public sector domination.
Yet the international response to their programmes has generally been to
applaud the intent, but to await further evidence of the practice.
Some multinationals, already familiar with the region, are interested in
expanding capacity with a view to export. However, many companies simply see
big domestic markets which they would like to supply if the profit prospects
are good.
Investors who want more than just a quick turn on the stock exchange have to
look at the overall environment, and not simply the sudden absence of
barriers to their presence. And in spite of the political honeymoon, the
fact is that politics is never far away.
In India's democratic cauldron, the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.27bn) stock market
scandal has become embroiled in politics, with a joint parliamentary
committee raking over complex transactions already investigated by at least
two other bodies.
Mr Singh has spent months dealing with the scandal. But, asked whether the
speed of reform has started to slip, he says 'there is not much of substance
in what is being said on this subject'.
The pace, he insists, is exactly in line with the programme of reform first
set out last year.
Nevertheless, key elements of reform - privatisation, reduction of
fertiliser subsidies, restructuring or closure of loss-making state
industries - are very tricky to push through politically.
Old assumptions in all areas of society about the role of the state have to
be delicately addressed, and a consensus for change sought.
The politicisation of the scandal has exposed intense suspicion of links
between the private and public sector.
If senior officials are found to have spoken on the telephone with private
sector businessmen, the almost automatic assumption is that corruption is
involved. Foreign ventures of Indian businessmen are treated in the press as
though they were suspect.
Clearly, this ingrained attitude is a hangover from the days when the
'license raj' meant that the private sector did depend on the favour of the
bureaucrats, with the possibility of corruption.
The economy's isolation and protection meant that foreign links and foreign
assets probably involved circumvention of restrictions and 'black money'.
The restrictions may have been swept away, but the mindset instilled by
decades of bureaucracy and public sector domination takes longer to kick.
In Pakistan, Mr Aziz and the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, are frustrated
that they have not seen more foreign investment when they have created, as
they see it, an environment among the most liberal in Asia. They have sought
the advice of several public relations consultants on how to trumpet their
message abroad.
Again, the political background is important. Pakistan's tortured political
history leaves outside observers unsure of the relative influence of the
elected government, the army and the president - the so-called 'troika'.
They are also uncertain of the future role of Islamic practices in the
financial system. The taxation structure is a mess, and it is not clear that
the political will exists to tackle it. The bureaucracy is still ponderous
and interfering.
What both finance ministers need is faster economic growth and exports to
bolster the domestic political argument at the same time as lower fiscal
deficits to satisfy international lending institutions.
This is a tall order, especially when export markets are depressed.
How galling it must be for these democracies to see export-oriented foreign
investment pouring into China, which has been engaging in similar economic
reforms while firmly keeping the lid on political expression.
It is true that other considerations apply. The Chinese labour force may be
thought to be cheaper and more productive. Much of the investment in China
is from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Investors are betting the Chinese communist party is not going to collapse
like its Soviet counterpart, so they feel they can expect stability even if
they are uncomfortable with the politics. Also, China's reforms have not
come overnight: they have been underway for 13 years, and they still have a
long way to go.
This means that the sub-continent's reformers have to be patient and stay
the course, provided that they can maintain the political advantage.
Meanwhile they deserve all the help they can get from the outside world.

FT  07 SEP 92 / A high flyer with his feet on the ground: Alitalia's chief
executive, Giovanni Bisignani, talks to Haig Simonian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of Italy's state airline, Alitalia,
betrays none of the enthusiasm, let alone egomania, that infects some
executives once they get their hands on an airline.
Judging by the pie-charts on his computer or the neatly presented
information at hand, Alitalia, with 29,000 staff and 1992 sales of L6,000bn
(Pounds 2.8bn), could just as well be a steelmaker or a phone company as
something exotic like an airline.
Mr Bisignani became chief executive in 1989, and recently climbed even
higher to become chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA),
which links the continent's scheduled carriers. As the industry spokesman he
addresses issues such as deregulation and international air traffic control.
He is outwardly forthright on both subjects but, as head of a company with a
virtual monopoly on major domestic routes, is more open about air traffic
control than deregulation.
'The problem is not technical but political and it lies in the hands of
national governments and the European Community,' he says.
'There are 54 control centres with 31 different systems, supplied by 18
computer manufacturers, with 22 different operating systems in over 70
programming languages. All this makes the European system not only
complicated, but expensive to manage and extremely inefficient.'
The AEA has pressed for action to sort out Europe's fragmented ATC. Mr
Bisignani welcomes the commission's July go-ahead for a plan to harmonise
the system. The first target - compatible computerised radar systems by 1996
 -would replace antiquated methods whereby data about an aircraft in flight
are passed by phone between centres.
But he remains cautious: the proposal has to be approved by EC transport
ministers, and governments are loath to give up sovereignty over their
skies. Commercial interests mean each country would like its own version to
be the model for Europe's harmonised system. 'We need to see action now,' he
says.
He is equally forthright on deregulation, but within the boundaries of
Alitalia's rather one-sided view of 'open skies'. 'Europe's airlines must
avoid the mistakes made in the US following deregulation. All they've done
is to move from an oligopoly based on four names to a new oligopoly based on
four other names. It's not good for the industry, it's not good for
passengers'.
The culprit, for Mr Bisignani, is Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code,
which allows a company to continue trading while under protection from its
creditors. 'The strong carriers build up cash until one of them decides to
launch a fares war in the hope of driving out weaker rivals. But they can
survive thanks to Chapter 11. The result is a mess. We mustn't do the same.'
His concept of deregulation differs from the virtual free-for-all in the US,
and, increasingly, among privatised European carriers. He makes much of the
'freedom of the skies' over Italy, claiming Lufthansa already flies to more
destinations in Italy than in its home market and that Alitalia faces
domestic rivals.
In fact, the company has fought successfully to fend off challengers. Under
a deal with the government last year, it renewed its near monopoly of major
routes for a further decade, with smaller regional carriers being offered
the crumbs. Such lack of direct competition perhaps explains why internal
services, though improving, remain poor by other airlines' standards.
Mr Bisignani is wary of big airline mergers, in spite of the British
Airways-US Air tie-up and the threat to Europe's carriers by US
'mega-carriers'. Surprisingly, he draws comfort from BA's deal with US Air,
although it probably spells the end of its 1990 marketing pact with
Alitalia.
But the accord has not altered his scepticism about alliances. Recent
European enthusiasm for mergers has come from airlines which either lack a
large domestic market or which have the market, but are less productive than
their counterparts.
'People used to think that airlines could overcome efficiency problems
simply by growing. That's no longer possible. The market is not expanding
like before, and yields are falling. The only way to drive down costs in a
market which has become more volatile is to be flexible. The danger is that
greater size leads to less flexibility.'
He has been trying to instill flexibility in Alitalia. Multi-year contracts
with pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have cut strikes, although it still
suffers from industrial action by outsiders.
The new contracts mean pilots will fly around 520 hours a year, comparable
with other European airlines with similar networks. Accusations of
unreliability are met with AEA figures showing it was Europe's most punctual
airline in 1990. - a fact that would surprise many domestic travellers.
Earnings, though still in the red, recovered 'better than any other airline'
from the shock of the Gulf war, he claims.
The company, ploughing L5,000bn into a five-year investment programme, 80
per cent of it to update and expand its fleet, has become so bullish that it
has introduced a frequent-flyer programme to raise 'brand loyalty'.
Such confidence shapes Mr Bisignani's views on mergers. 'A national airline
today needs a critical mass. That means between 25m and 30m passengers a
year and a substantial home market. Alitalia should carry at least 21m
people this year and still has to concentrate on improving productivity and
service.' When its targets are met it might start thinking about
partnerships 'on an equal basis'.
With privatisation very much in the air in Italy, might Alitalia, with
almost 16 per cent of its shares quoted, be poised to float more equity on
the back of greater efficiency and profits?
The company is hardly an investor's dream, having failed to pay a dividend
since 1988. 'This year we will have a positive result,' says Mr Bisignani.
But he declines to be more specific as to whether he means before or after
tax - probably the best indicator it has some way to go.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Ryan returns to helm in GPA shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, has announced a
wide-ranging management shake-up following its aborted stock market
flotation in June.
Mr Maurice Foley, the chief executive appointed two months before the
planned flotation, has been replaced by the company's chairman and
co-founder, Dr Tony Ryan.
The company said yesterday: 'The board has decided that it is in the
company's best interests that there should be just one leadership focus.
'Accordingly, Dr Tony Ryan will resume the position of executive chairman
and the role of chief executive with immediate effect.'
The change follows mounting problems for GPA which, denied the proceeds of
the flotation, is seeking other ways to raise money to meet its committments
to buy new aircraft.
Mr Foley will continue as deputy chairman with responsibility for
relationships with institutions and shareholders, and for strategic
planning.
Mr Jim King, former deputy chief executive for leasing, has been promoted to
vice-chairman. His main task will be to try to reschedule some of the
Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6bn) GPA is committed to spend on aircraft orders with
the world's major manufacturers up to the end of the decade. About Dollars
7.1bn of the total will have to be found by the end of 1994.
Mr Colm Barrington is promoted to chief executive responsible for GPA
Leasing and GPA Capital.
The reshuffle was apparently decided at a board meeting a month ago. An
industry source said Mr Foley was seen as 'too cerebral' and a tougher, more
market-driven approach was needed.
In the lead-up to the flotation, a row broke out between the company and its
stockbrokers over the offer price. The company was aiming for Dollars 25 to
Dollars 30 per share but, after a public row, had to settle for Dollars 20
to Dollars 24, which could would have raised up to Dollars 1bn.
Difficult market conditions led to a lack of interest especially by US
investors, forcing the company to abandon the flotation.
Since then the company has looked at ways to raise money, although the
likely value of GPA shares is understood to have fallen considerably.
The company outlined three priorities: a private placing of new shares;
cancelling or rescheduling some aircraft purchase options and firm orders at
a minimum cost in penalties; completing further aircraft securitisation
packages under which groups of aircraft are sold to investors with leases
attached.
The first such package, known as Alps 1, raised Dollars 500m in June. The
company hopes to have a similar package, Alps 2, completed this autumn.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage traders have a mixed reputation among companies, but the Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation must be wondering what it can do to
encourage them. HSBC's sterling shares are now trading at a 7 per cent
discount to the Hong Kong dollar-denominated version. Since the securities
carry identical rights in respect of voting and dividends, and are available
in London and Hong Kong, the anomaly is puzzling. There are some technical
differences in the way the shares trade: the Hong Kong stock exchange uses
rolling settlement, for example. But this would hardly account for such a
significant discrepancy in price.
Another factor may be consistent selling of sterling stock by former Midland
Bank shareholders who reluctantly accepted the HSBC offer. Against a
background of generally weak trading volume this steady supply of stock
could easily depress the sterling share price. Both classes of shares have
moved roughly in line with local indices, so indexed funds may be supporting
the Hong Kong dollar stock. Fears of a sterling devaluation and hopes for a
dollar recovery may also play a part; although the discount has actually
widened as the Hong Kong dollar has weakened, and equities are not usually
held as a proxy for currency exposure.
Whatever the explanation, arbitrage traders have so far been unwilling to
close the gap. Thin trading volume of the sterling shares in Hong Kong may
be discouraging even bargain-conscious Far Eastern investors from buying the
cheaper stock. Meanwhile, the differential is something of an embarrassment.
Midland shareholders who accepted HSBC paper under the offer might
justifiably feel short-changed. For the rest of the market, arbitrage
traders or not, the cheapest route into HSBC is through the sterling stock.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Using a price cap formula to regulate privatised utilities has brought
significant benefits. Companies have exploited this incentive to cut costs,
and in many cases shareholders have seen the results in dividend payments.
However, the RPI-X system has thrown up some anomalies, where apparently
similar businesses currently offer very different rates of return. British
Gas's pipeline operation, the regional electricity companies and the
National Grid are all reasonably comparable businesses with similar risks
and growth prospects, yet on a current cost basis the RECs return around 10
per cent, the grid is said to earn around 6 per cent and the Ofgas regulator
wants to pin British Gas to 4.5 per cent.
True, there are some reasons for the difference. It is arguable that Gas's
assets were privatised too cheaply, so the return on existing assets ought
to be correspondingly lower. But the company is unlikely to invest in new
pipelines at a return no better than that on index-linked gilts. British Gas
clearly hopes that the monopolies inquiry will take the point, though it
faces an uphill struggle because any improvement in pipeline returns will
have to come out of gas marketing margins or customers' pockets.
Part of Gas's problem is historical. The company was told to encourage
competition after flotation, and so kept pipeline profits down and marketing
margins up to attract a limited amount of competition. However, it has since
been forced to give up far more of the gas market than it anticipated,
cutting into profits. There is probably room for Gas to expand pipeline
returns at the expense of the marketing competition, though unless and until
the MMC sees things that way, the shares are in limbo. For the electricity
companies, life is brighter. Although it is not formally targeted, their
rate of return is bound to be cut in the Periodic Review in 1994. But by
then dividend cover will be over three times, and the companies can maintain
progressive dividends by simply cutting cover. Shareholders may not even
notice the bump to profits.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Paris shares the pain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many international investors remain overweight in French equities, which
gives added spice to the outcome of this month's referendum on Maastricht.
The implications of rejection are debated everywhere, discounted nowhere.
Suffice it to say that the Paris stock market would fall - probably quite
sharply - as the Mitterrand government pushed up interest rates to defend
its hard-earned position inside the EMS.
The idea that France might join a general realignment under the guise of a
D-Mark revaluation looks implausible on fundamental grounds: if anything
German costs have risen more than French ones since the last realignment in
1987. Suggestions that turmoil in financial markets following a No vote
would soften the Bundesbank's heart - and accelerate a monetary easing
across Europe - sound like so much wishful thinking.
The more pertinent question is how much bounce is left in the bourse if the
treaty gets the go-ahead. A combination of more encouraging opinion poll
trends, the wheeling out of the political big guns, and a solid if
unspectacular presidential performance on television on Thursday night seem
to have convinced the market that voters are likely to say Yes.
The differential between French government bonds and German bunds at the
10-year maturity had narrowed by Friday night to around 90 basis points,
against a recent peak of 125-130 basis points. Dragged up in this fixed
interest wake - and helped by the squeeze on investors caught with short
positions - the CAC-40 Index ended the week 5.4 per cent higher.
If all goes well on September 20 a further narrowing of the long-term
interest rate differential might be expected, providing another modest boost
to equities. Whether there would be much else to drive share prices, though,
is another matter.
Earnings forecasts for the current year have already been drastically scaled
back, but the market has little confidence even in its revised estimates. As
recent half-year results from the likes of Elf, Total and Accor have
underlined demand in the economy has fallen away. There is certainly scope
for export growth, but this is curtailed for the moment by weakness
elsewhere.
On fundamental grounds - and relative to other European markets - the French
bourse looks historically cheap. But until there is a sharp and decisive
downward move in German interest rates Paris looks unlikely to fulfil the
promise of earlier this year.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Major pledges commitment to EC: Speech sets out scope for
development if French reject Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will today emphasise the scope for further development within
the European Community even if the result of the French referendum is a No
to the Maastricht treaty on European union.
The prime minister will restate his commitment to the agreement as the best
way forward for the Community and his desire to see it ratified. He will
also use a speech at a London conference on the future of the EC to
highlight the other ways, such as inter-governmental co-operation, in which
links between the 12 EC members can be strengthened.
The speech is also likely to seek to underline commitment to the exchange
rate mechanism. UK ministers are keen to ensure that the ERM survives in the
long term as well as whatever disturbances in the markets would follow a No
vote.
Mr Major will spell out the tasks remaining on the EC agenda, irrespective
of Maastricht. These include enlargement, changes to financing and
decision-making arrangements, and completion of the single market.
'If the French vote No, the world would not come to an end,' one minister
said yesterday.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president, warned both sides in
the referendum campaign against playing on fears of German domination. That
was 'a grave error' which 'can do us great harm', he said on television,
urging a Yes vote in the September 20 referendum.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing's appearance, following a television appeal last
Thursday by President Francois Mitterrand, came as another poll showed a
small advance in the proportion of voters - 56 per cent - in favour of
monetary and political union.
Yesterday's poll, by Ipsos for Journal du Dimanche, showed a 1 percentage
point advance in the Yes vote on a CSA poll on Friday. The outcome is still
in the balance because 24 per cent of the total polled by Ipsos did not know
or did not indicate which way they would vote - a level in line with most
polls taken since Mr Mitterrand announced the referendum in early June.
The 56 per cent majority in yesterday's survey is a proportion of those who
stated an opinion.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing, president of the centre-right UDF opposition party,
stressed that the treaty could not be renegotiated in the event of a No vote
on September 20.
It was a painstakingly fought compromise between the 12 EC governments and
renegotiation was 'impossible'.
Three quarters of people who say they would vote if the UK had a referendum
on closer ties with Europe would oppose such links according to an opinion
poll in today's Daily Star. The telephone survey carried out by ICM also
found that two thirds of those questioned thought the UK should have a
referendum, while only 30 per cent believed that parliament should decide.

FT  07 SEP 92 / TUC may face hitch with plan to readmit electricians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BLACKPOOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS BY the Trades Union Congress to readmit the maverick EETPU
electricians' union appeared to be running into difficulties last night as
delegates gathered for the start today of the 124th annual TUC congress in
Blackpool.
Several large unions decided they were willing to back a resolution imposing
tough conditions on the readmission of the electricians. Both the EETPU and
the Amalgamated Engineering union, with which it merged earlier this year,
have said the conditions are unacceptable.
Failure to agree terms for the EETPU's readmission would lead to a damaging
split among trade unions, with the possibility that the AEU could join its
partner outside the TUC.
Although Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was last night trying to
persuade the National Union of Journalists to withdraw the motion, the
likelihood was that he would fail. Unions deciding to support the
resolution, if tabled, include the MSF general technical union and the Nalgo
public services union.
The resolution, due for discussion on Thursday, seeks to exclude from
membership anyone or any organisation recruited from other unions since
1988. Approval of the NUJ resolution by congress would not necessarily lead
to the end of TUC talks with the EETPU.
Last week the TUC general council approved a resolution which would restrict
negotiators far less than the NUJ resolution seeks. Even if the NUJ motion
were carried, congress would be likely to adopt the general council's
policy. Nonetheless, the NUJ resolution would considerably sour the talks.
Leaders of the EETPU have indicated that they are unsure about whether they
want to reaffiliate.
In a pre-congress press conference, Mr Willis failed to damp speculation
that he was preparing to step down, either on his 60th birthday in January
or when, and if, the electricians are readmitted.
He said he was extremely engaged in his job. He repeated that he had made no
decision when to leave, although he would be stepping down before his 65th
birthday.
Mr Willis said he was confident that outstanding issues with the EETPU could
be dealt with. The union's reaffiliation would be the 'best thing that has
happened in my eight years as TUC general secretary'.
Divisions between unions in the future almost certainly guaranteed failure,
he said.

FT  07 SEP 92 / UK airline passengers to clear US immigration in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL airline passengers flying to the US from London's two main airports will
clear American immigration before leaving Britain following a UK-US
agreement to ease border controls, the US Immigration and Naturalisation
Service said at the weekend.
The move, backed by the airports operator BAA and involving all scheduled
airlines flying from Heathrow or Gatwick to the US, follows a separate UK
commitment last week to relax border controls for European Community
nationals.
Under the scheme, due to be launched early next year, US officials will
check passports at airport departure gates so that passengers will be
officially 'admitted' to the US while still in London.
Negotiations are continuing in London between INS officials, the Home Office
and BAA to iron out any remaining difficulties following 'pre-inspection'
experiments last year.
BAA officials said they welcomed any move to ease congestion but were
anxious to avoid importing the problems of long US immigration queues to
London.
Minimum standards for immigration control, meanwhile, have been introduced
at Heathrow. 'EC nationals should queue for no more than three minutes and
non-EC nationals for no more than 10 minutes,' BAA officials said.
BAA is seeking flexibility in staffing to increase the number of immigration
officers on duty at peak times. Fixed shifts for airport security staff have
been abandoned but similar moves for Home Office employees could encounter
union opposition.
The INS is recruiting non-union immigration officers to oversee introduction
of the US scheme, which it hopes will be fully operational by spring 1993.
Mr Richard Kenney, chief of INS public affairs, said passengers arriving
from Britain would avoid queues caused when several flights arrive at a US
hub close together. The costs of the scheme are expected to be passed on to
airline passengers, who will pay a Dollars 5 (Pounds 2.50) ticket surcharge,
Mr Kenney added.
While welcoming the immigration initiatives for US-bound travellers,
American executives have called for reciprocal arrangements at US airports.
'Business travellers would like to clear UK immigration in the US. If they
could avoid the lines at Heathrow they would jump at it,' said Mr Joe
Brancatelli, executive editor of Frequent Flier, the New York magazine
published by Official Airline Guides and distributed to 320,000 US
businessmen.
The Home Office in London said it would consider such proposals but had not
received any formal applications from airlines for such a scheme.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What's the world coming to if a country has to cancel it's annual cocktail
party? Its almost as bad as hauling down its flag, especially when there is
a crisis on back home.
Hence, a certain incredulity at the explanation given for the abrupt
cancellation of one of the highlights of London's summer cocktails season -
today's annual celebration of Brazil's independence day. Paulo-Tarso Flecha
de Lima, Brazil's ambassador to London, is having to stay in Brazil on
account of 'force majeure'. It is understood that he is not the only
Brazilian ambassador to be suffering from FM.
When pressed, de Lima's officials explain that he has problems back home on
his farm. Given that de Lima is one of Brazil's most senior diplomats and a
close ally of President Fernando Collor, who is insisting on making an
appearance at today's national day parade in Brasilia, de Lima's excuse
sounds rather lame.
It certainly wouldn't wash with Sir John Kerr, the UK's urbane permanent
representative to the European Communities. The see-saw of French opinion
polls - tilting the future of Europe this way, then that, with  nearly half
of voters unable to make up their minds - has the Brussels Eurocracy on
edge.
But Britain's man in Brussels insists that come what may, his cocktail party
on the day after the French referendum, will go ahead as planned. Make mine
a large one, Carruthers.

</HEADLINE>

Problems are piling up for Tony Ryan, the embattled founder of GPA - the
world's largest aircraft-leasing group. Not only has he had to snatch back
the controls from chief executive Maurice Foley, but his sons' airline -
Ryanair - has hit yet another pocket of turbulence.
For once Ryanair's problem is not too few passengers, but too many. It seems
that one of its promotional fares - the Flying Start travel voucher scheme -
has been too successful. Under a joint promotion with Bord na Mona, owners
of Ireland's peat bogs, Ryanair's passengers were urged to collect tabs from
their bales of peat briquettes which they could redeem against Ryanair
travel vouchers.
Since a heavy user could get through as many as five bales of peat a
week(costing around Pounds 1.40 apiece) and each bale offered a Pounds 1
voucher which could be used to pay for up to 55 per cent of the cost of a
non-discounted Ryanair fare, the scheme seemed almost too good to be true.
Certainly this was the view of many would-be Ryanair passengers who have
exchanged 3m of their peat tabs for travel vouchers. When Ryanair tried to
curb the promotion, Bord na Mona took it to court and there the matter
resides. One problem for Ryanair is that the promotion seems to have been
backed by a verbal agreement, and some of the executives involved have moved
on.

Talk about the boast of heraldry.
On its members' behalf, Britain's Federation of Small Businesses is urging
government to provide a practical shield against the bankruptcies it says
are occurring at the rate of one every six minutes. On its own behalf, it is
taking up a purely symbolic shield in the form of a coat of arms.
The design - by former federation chairman Bernard Juby, a keen historian
and genealogist who has traced his family history back several centuries -
is claimed to epitomise many of the qualities of small-business owners.
Two animals figure prominently. One is a hard-working beaver. The other, a
badger, represents not only the federation's lobbying on behalf of its
members, but also the badgering of same by bureaucrats in their turn.
The pair of them support a shield depicting one quarter of the union flag,
to mark the 25 per cent of the British workforce employed by small
businesses and the similar share of the gross national product they
generate. Meanwhile more obviously symbolic bees buzz around.
The arms are completed by the federation's motto which, given its latest
complaining, has a somewhat quizzical ring. Nihil fortus - semper eadem, it
goes, 'We are the strongest, and will never change'.

While Observer hopes not, Norway's Peter Lorange may live to regret writing
a book on how to manage academic institutions such as management schools.
True, the 49-year-old strategy professor has practical success in the field
behind him, being president of the Norwegian Business School after having
run part of Wharton in the US. But while neither of those jobs can have been
a doddle, the one he is to take up next year looks to be something else
again. He is to head the Institute for International Management Development
in Switzerland, uneasily assembled two years ago from the IMI school in
Geneva and the rival Imede in Lausanne.
The amalgamation's first head, Juan Rada, quit in the spring after a
disagreement with the parent foundation's ex-IBM chairman Caspar Cassani.
One contentious issue was apparently the balance of power between the
director-generalship and the executive director's job which, perhaps
significantly, was held by another alumnus of IBM.
Lorange says the director-general title will henceforth be changed to
president, to 'make clear who's in charge.'

Taking on entrenched interests is nothing new to Joel Joffe, the former
Allied Dunbar executive who has launched an attack on his former life
assurance industry pals.
A South African by birth, he emigrated to the UK after accepting the brief
to defend Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia trials in 1963. Very few white
barristers were prepared to take part in the trial, and Joffe effectively
ended his career at the Johannesburg Bar by doing so.
He came to the UK instead of his original choice of Australia after the
South African government confiscated his passport. Along with fellow South
Africans Sir Mark Weinberg and Sir Sydney Lipworth, he set up one of the
forerunners of Allied Dunbar. More recently, he has become a big wheel in
Oxfam.
Joffe hopes that his latest crusade has a better chance of success than some
before. 'It's a lot less dangerous than defending Nelson Mandela', he says.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: Weekend in Bath
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is six years since Britain last held the EC presidency. But judged by the
weekend's meeting of finance ministers in Bath, those charged with running
the show have not forgotten how to entertain.
Take for instance the official outing for participants' spouses to Wells
Cathedral. No problem there, you would think, except that - as the local
paper gleefully pointed out - Norman Lamont is buried there. This was not a
bad joke at the expense of the British chancellor's funereal briefing style,
but the final resting place of Sir Norman Lamont, a local MP from an
earlier, more civilised era.
The present Norman Lamont, by contrast, got a much rougher ride. Whenever
the Chancellor stepped out of the peace and quiet of the finance ministers'
meeting, he was barracked by protesters ranging from the right-wing Freedom
Association to the Revolutionary Communists.
The meeting closed in the shadow of balloons launched from near the city
centre. As observers were quick to point out, they sent a mixed signal to
the earth-bound ministers and the EC economy: buoyant, drifting, or - given
that the meeting overran by more than an hour - just full of hot air?

FT  07 SEP 92 / Personal View: Why German policy hurts at home as well as
abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD MCKINNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is German monetary policy too tight? The casual observer might answer with a
re-sounding 'yes' in view of the turmoil in the European Monetary System and
the dollar's fall against the D-Mark.
It must be remembered, however, that the Bundesbank's mandate is to
stabilise the level of German prices. Nonetheless, in terms of this narrowly
domestic objective, is the Bundesbank's monetary policy still too
restrictive?
Without doubt, high German short-term interest rates are putting great
pressure on other EMS members. Countries with a tradition of higher
inflation, such as Britain and Italy, have seen their currencies fall to the
bottom of their EMS bands. The value of the dollar, meanwhile, is being
driven well below its purchasing power parity with the EMS bloc. If the
dollar falls further, to well below DM1.40, US long-term interest rates
could jump. If international investors come to believe that the dollar
exchange rate is again heading for a free fall, they will demand a much
higher yield on dollar assets, and that would threaten US economic recovery.
The Bundesbank does not directly take into consideration such short-run
international circumstances. Rather, its priority is to stabilise the
D-Mark's future purchasing power. Moreover, containing German price
inflation, the Bundesbank would argue, will indirectly benefit the rest of
the world. German price stability represents the anchor necessary for the
success of the EMS. In addition, maintaining Germany as a beacon of
financial rectitude can benefit the world economy - for example, by putting
pressure on the improvident US to be less inflationary.
The Bundesbank's focus on price stability in Germany is thus here to stay.
Consequently, if the German monetary authorities are to ease their policies,
they must be convinced that they are violating their own mandate. And that
is precisely what I believe the Bundesbank is doing. Present German monetary
policy is unnecessarily tight for stabilising domestic prices in the longer
term. By implication, the German and world economies are experiencing
unnecessary financial trauma.
First, consider Germany's rate of price inflation, running at 1 to 2 per
cent measured by the producer price index, and at 3.5 to 4 per cent
according to the consumer price index. While modest, these numbers are still
too high if they continue indefinitely. To be consistent with a fixed
exchange rate regime such as the EMS, all participating countries should aim
for zero inflation in their producer price indices (ie, the price of
tradeable goods). So the German authorities are right to be concerned.
In west Germany, however, inflationary pressure has been temporarily
increased by the system of collective wage bargaining and inflexible labour
markets. Wages in east Germany will continue to rise quickly until 1994
when, in many sectors, they will equal those in the west. Although this wage
pressure could explain the modest increases in producer prices now apparent,
it need not persist.
But wage pressure is not the only problem. Central bankers must divine
inflationary pressure in the future by looking at current portents. Since
the level of interest rates has proven ambiguous for this purpose, this
leaves just two plausible yardsticks: the value of the D-Mark in the foreign
exchange markets and growth in the German money supply.
At DM1.40 to the dollar, the D-Mark is strong. Purchasing power parity would
be about DM1.90 to the dollar. As every tourist knows, the German price
level is high relative to the dollar area - and much of world trade is still
invoiced in dollar terms. International commodity arbitrage should,
therefore, eventually generate downward pressure on the German producer
price index.
German economists recall that the previous periods of significant D-Mark
strength against the dollar - in 1973 and again in 1978 - were followed by
substantial worldwide inflation. Yet the previous episodes were different.
In the 1970s, inflationary pressure from the US was much higher than in
Germany. In contrast, in 1992 inflationary pressure in the US is subdued and
lower - both on the producer price (in the US, wholesale price) and consumer
price measures.
The second monetary indicator available is money growth. The monetary
aggregate central to German decision-making is M3 (equivalent to M2 in the
US), which is growing at about 9 per cent a year. The Bundesbank believes
this portends future inflation. But there is good reason to believe that
German M3 is sending out a false signal.
In contrast to the US, Germany now faces an inverted yield curve in its bond
markets: German short-term interest rates at about 9.75 per cent are
considerably higher than long-term bond rates of 8.5 per cent or less. This
unusual phenomenon means that German investors have incentives to reduce
normal holdings of long-term bonds in favour of short-term bonds and
interest-bearing bank deposits, and the last is the largest component of M3.
Thus the temporary high growth in M3 in part reflects a shift in demand in
German savers' portfolio preferences in favour of time and savings deposits.
It need not reflect excess monetary creation.
But that is not the end of the story. In the US, the yield curve is sloping
upward unusually sharply. Very short-term interest rates of about 3.5 per
cent are much less than long interest rates of about 7.5 per cent on safe
government bonds. Pensioners and other individuals seeking higher yields are
shifting from short-term interest-bearing bank deposits (and bonds) into
longer-term bonds and equities. Thus growth in US M2 over the past year has
been about zero. But this portfolio shift (which shows up as a rise in the
velocity of M2) hardly reflects a tight money policy in the US; US policy
has, in fact, been very easy.
Because D-Mark assets have long been considered the principal alternative to
holding dollars, we must also consider the two countries together.
International currency substitution tends to magnify the bogus signals
thrown out by the monetary indicators in each country. American investors
see what they think is a pitifully low yield on short-term dollar bank
deposits. They switch into short-term D-Mark deposits to capture yields that
are more than two and a half times as great - perhaps with the help of
international money-market funds. And German investors reduce their 'normal'
holdings of short-term dollar deposits in favour of higher-yield D-Mark
equivalents.
International currency substitution, therefore, further magnifies monetary
growth in Germany - while reducing it in the US. This is perfectly
acceptable, provided neither the US Federal Reserve nor the Bundesbank puts
any weight on M2/M3 growth as a monetary indicator of future inflation.
Unfortunately, the Bundesbank thinks that its money supply is growing too
fast, which explains its unnecessarily tight monetary stance. Very high
short-term German interest rates are not only threatening the framework of
intra-European and worldwide monetary co-operation. They are also
undesirable from a domestic German perspective.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Uneven pattern in pay restraint by top directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A W VERNON-HARCOURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on a recent study by PIRC on the pay of top directors in
the FT-SE 100 companies ('Salary restraint hits top earners', September 2)
suggested that the average pay rise for the best-paid director in 94 of the
companies was 2 per cent for companies reporting in the past 12 months.
While our research supports the conclusion that companies have exercised
commendable restraints, our analysis of pay increases in the annual reports
of some 90 FT-SE 100 companies shows somewhat higher figures. A quarter of
the companies reported a reduction in the earnings of best-paid directors,
the biggest reduction being 22 per cent. The median increase, when the
percentage increases are ranked in order of magnitude, was 8.5 per cent. A
quarter received increases of 22 per cent or more.
It should be noted that decisions on base pay increases now being reported
in company accounts were often made as long ago as October 1990, when
average earnings were rising at around 9 per cent to 10 per cent. At that
time we were encouraged to believe the recession would be short term.
Our figures show that bonuses are removed when performance deteriorates. We
should also be encouraged that, in spite of the recession, some companies
continue to make good profits and can justify high bonuses.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIK VANDENBROELE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your survey of the aerospace industry (September 2) there is a point
regarding the future of European transport that needs to be clarified.
Your article points out that 'the Commission is planning to introduce Value
Added Tax on intra-Community airline tickets . . . at around 9 or 10 per
cent'. This may, out of context, seem excessive. However, in the context of
the wider European transport sector and its future harmonisation, it makes
good sense. Moreover a number of the Community railways have for some time
been subjected to this form of community taxation. Similarly, the airlines
have been exempted for excise duties that most European railways have not.
Community-wide harmonisation is also being negotiated in this area.
While we sympathise with the European airlines, in the wider context we can
only commend and welcome the Commission's initiative in attempting to create
an environment that encourages rather than distorts competition among all
modes of intra-Community transport.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: R&amp;D needs of different sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr R C WHELAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Sawers' article, 'Blind faith in R&amp;D' (September 2), questions
the perceived wisdom that R&amp;D investment is an important measure of future
manufacturing competitiveness. The R&amp;D intensity necessary to maintain
competitiveness varies markedly between manufacturing sectors. Aggregate
inter-country comparisons, as presented in the article, disguise variations
in importance of specific manufacturing sectors and of their differing R&amp;D
requirements.
Moreover, for sectors like chemicals, automotive and electronics,
underinvestment in R&amp;D (albeit in conjunction with other factors) does have
significant economic consequences. Between 1980 and 1988 the industrial
output in electronics and electrical goods, within the US, Japan and EC
combined, increased at an annual rate of 6 per cent in contrast with the
UK's 3 per cent. UK companies, despite having a 4 per cent share in
industrialised world electrical and electronics output, choose to spend less
than 3 per cent of all world R&amp;D in this sector.
This form of analysis supports the contention that focusing on industrial
R&amp;D investment, in conjunction with the mechanisms for its subsequent
exploitation, is a key element of any governmental industrial policy.

This is not the policy of the ANC.
In view of the revelations by the various commissions of inquiry, the press,
the churches and the sworn statements by numerous victims of South African
police, and especially in recent times by members of the police force
themselves, the African National Congress has acted with utmost restraint.
We have consistently called for the police to be subject to law and to be

FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Pitfalls in pursuit of quality standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr L M TEASDALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's article, 'Badge of Quality' (September 1), reflects
some of the doubts being felt within smaller companies of establishing a
quality system conforming to BS5750. However, the article dwelt only on
doubts arising from costs and complexities of getting approval; not on the
growing doubts over the benefits which approval can bring.
This association was among the first to agree a sectorial scheme for
approval of quality systems. Some of the expected benefits such as reduced
incidence of errors, improved understanding, productivity, etc, have
emerged, but did not require an external assessment to bring them about.
However, instead of an expected reduction in the number of assessments, with
customers accepting the result of the independent external assessor, many
customers still insist on carrying out their own assessments. This involves
time and cost to the manufacturer.
The emergence of EC approval arrangements for products under various
directives can involve regular reviews of the manufacturing process, as do
other independently established bodies implementing their own product
approval requirements. It does not matter if these are treated as
requirements additional to BS5750. To a manufacturer, each is a different
quality system, and still involves a separate assessment.
A major influence driving the adoption of the BS5750 arrangements was to
improve the customer's certainty that the desired quality would be achieved
and so save the cost and interruption of multiple inspections. There is a
real danger that multiple inspections are simply being replaced by multiple
assessments with the heavy costs of implementing and maintaining a BS5750
system on top.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A role for trade unions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH EMPLOYEES are getting a raw deal from their trade unions. They
deserve efficient and relevant services in the workplace, but they also need
an authoritative voice on work issues which transcend the individual
contract of employment: subjects like safety at work, pensions, training,
the trade-off between pay and jobs, hire and fire rules, and more. The union
leaders gathered in Blackpool today for the start of the 124th Trades Union
Congress are, with few exceptions, not providing it. TUC unions now
represent only about one-third of the workforce but they are still easily
the largest pressure group for employees. Judged by the standard of many
other pressure groups, they have not delivered.
It is not all their own fault. Some are locked into declining industries,
most are weakened by unemployment or radical changes in the public services.
But they have compounded their current weakness by failing to concentrate
their limited human and financial resources on the issues they are best in a
position to understand and which most affect their members as employees. No
longer the bogeymen of a strike-prone society, the union bosses have simply
become irrelevant. Their hopes of salvation in the form of EC social
policies have also been frustrated.
Some, though not all, of the shortcomings can be blamed on poor leadership.
For example, the TUC still has several committees monitoring national
political developments which take up far too much of the time of senior
union leaders. The effect of opted-out schools on teachers is a legitimate
concern of the teaching unions, but the TUC does not also need an education
committee to produce position papers on the subject. After the Labour
party's fourth election defeat, it is also more urgent than ever that the
unions escape from the constraints required by the shadow cabinet and
discover a distinctive voice that speaks for union members, rather than
seeking to anticipate the nuances of Labour's policy review process. The
idea of working more closely with the Confederation of British Industry is
in tune with this broader approach.
When it come to the efficiency of basic services, there are signs that
unions are moving in the right direction. For instance, MSF, the general
technical union, recently said it would apply to join the British Standards
Institution's corporate quality assurance scheme; others may follow.
It is not yet clear whether this healthy trend will be strengthened by the
other big development in the union world - itself, oddly, not the subject of
debate at this week's conference - the shift towards a smaller number of
ever larger unions. These actual or proposed mergers may offer economies of
scale, but they could also turn into distant conglomerates, with little of
the functional expertise that members want and out of touch when it comes to
gauging union members' true interest in important national debates. Even
worse, the 'super unions' could end up by distracting the unions with more
internal politics as they try to weld very different organisations into one.
British trade unionism cannot afford another big mistake.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The canny engineers of survival: A batch of good results in
the engineering sector offers a ray of hope amid the gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news is a rare and precious commodity for the bosses of UK engineering
groups as they struggle to keep their companies at least one step ahead of
the receiver.
Sterling's difficulties and the threat of higher interest rates are adding
to a sense of gloom caused by the longest and deepest recession many in the
industry can remember. Last month's pessimistic forecast from the
Confederation of British Industry highlighted the weakness of the economy.
Meanwhile, there could be further bad news this month, traditionally the
busiest for UK company results.
But there has been a glimmer of hope in some recent figures from the
engineering sector, and while they may not offer grounds for too much
optimism, any good news from UK manufacturing is worth closer examination.
The first to lighten the gloom was BBA, the component maker for the
automotive, aviation and industrial markets. Early last month it announced
first-half pre-tax profits up 26 per cent to Pounds 33m. Soon afterwards,
GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial services group,
surprised the City with a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
65.1m.
A week later, Birmingham-based Glynwed International, a producer of consumer
and building products, plastics, and tubes and fittings, revealed a 48 per
cent rise in half-year profits to Pounds 15.4m. Then, at the end of last
month, Weir Group, one of the world's largest pump and valve makers, notched
up a 23 per cent profit advance to Pounds 18.5m.
The numbers are encouraging but should be viewed with some caution. The
half-year statements of the engineering groups carry a clear message for
other British manufacturers - cutting costs and raising productivity are
essential to give any hope of raising profits in the current environment.
Indeed, there is little to suggest any improvement in market conditions in
the coming months. 'We do not expect the demand pattern we are currently
experiencing in our principal markets to change materially in the next few
months,' said Sir David Lees, GKN chairman.
At Weir, chairman Lord Weir also stressed the importance of low-cost
manufacturing and cash generation in generally hostile trading conditions.
'Although we are doing better, it is bloody difficult,' he said.
Another important point is that, in an industry as diverse as engineering,
there are always 'niche' opportunities for companies to make money even when
general conditions are tough. The real question is whether a company has the
ability to exploit them, as Weir has illustrated by taking advantage of
buoyant conditions in the Asian power equipment market. This is a good
example of an infrastructural sector which operates under a much longer-term
business cycle than many other parts of engineering.
There are also some special reasons for the rosy results. Glynwed, for
example, cut group borrowings by about Pounds 12m in the first half of the
year by selling three non-core businesses. Reduced interest charges thus
contributed to the big rise in profits.
Even so, it would be churlish to disparage profit figures which are a timely
reminder to pessimists that the UK engineering sector is not about to
disappear. The results are also a lesson to some smaller engineering
companies which have been slow to take difficult decisions on cutting costs,
says Mr Tim Bennett of the Birmingham-based stockbroking firm Albert E
Sharp.
After their experiences in the recession of 1980-81, the larger groups
understood that they would need to move quickly to reduce production
capacity in line with falling demand soon after the current recession began.
GKN slashed its UK workforce from 64,800 to 40,600 between 1980 and 1982.
While the cuts overall have been less severe in the current recession, none
of the companies has shied away from cutting its workforce this time.
The four companies' strong first-half performances, relative to the rest of
UK manufacturing, bear witness to their improved management over the past
decade. Nowhere is this better illustrated than at Weir, where management
shortcomings brought the company to the brink of collapse in 1981. The
company was forced into a drastic restructuring. High interest rates, the
level of sterling and the weaknesses of domestic demand were contributing
factors, but the main problem was weak management.
Weir, says Mr Bennett, is 'probably the best example of an engineering
success story. They've done it through good management of existing
businesses and selective acquisitions.' Its low-cost manufacturing plant in
Glasgow is competitive at current exchange rates, an important achievement,
as its main competitors are German and Japanese. Meanwhile Weir has
rejuvenated Hopkinsons, the UK's biggest producer of specialist valves and
boiler fittings, which had been wracked by labour disputes before it was
acquired in 1989.
Such achievements are due partly to the tough-mindedness of executives such
as Sir David at GKN, Mr Ron Garrick, the Weir chief executive, and Mr Gareth
Davies, Glynwed's chairman, who have not shirked painful restructuring
decisions.
But the profit performances are due as much to a policy of
internationalisation, intended to reduce dependence on a declining base of
UK manufacturing customers. This is particularly apparent at the radically
restructured GKN, where overall employment has plunged from 101,600 in 1980
to 31,400 last year. Sales in both years were almost identical at Pounds
1.92bn, but the overseas sales component, along with exports from the UK,
jumped from 44 to 71 per cent. Even Glynwed, which still generates 70 per
cent of its turnover in the UK, has had notable successes overseas,
especially in its plastics business.
There have been other big engineering groups to unveil favourable results
recently. Last week, Senior Engineering Group announced an increase of
almost 15 per cent in first-half profits to Pounds 10m. And T&amp;N, the motor
components and engineering group, boosted pre-tax profits by 71 per cent to
Pounds 34.7m owing to cost-cutting and successful investment in the US.
A few more good results are likely over the coming weeks. Unfortunately,
however, there is no evidence to suggest that the majority of big UK
engineering companies could improve their results by emulating GKN, BBA,
Weir and Glynwed. Most of them are already doing the right things - reducing
costs, modernising their management and production techniques and seeking
new opportunities overseas - but none of this can guarantee maintained
profits, let alone increases, if conditions are depressed worldwide.
The experience of the engineering sector has shown that UK manufacturers
need to build their own bridges to profits. The sector will emerge weakened
from the recession - whenever recovery occurs - but its standard-bearers
will be those which can exploit every opportunity for growth in increasingly
competitive world markets.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SUBSIDIES AND distortion are deeply rooted in energy markets
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the legacy of attempts by successive governments to promote particular types
of fuel. The nuclear levy is one of the most costly such distortions, and it
was right of Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to draw
attention to it last week. At Pounds 1.3bn a year, it amounts to a large
hidden tax on electricity consumers in England and Wales, and puts a
questionable burden on industry.
But it is not so easy to argue that it should be abolished. Virtually all of
it goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which operates the 12
nuclear power stations in England and Wales. The money will pay for the
decommissioning of stations when they come to the end of their lives.
The essential question is whether decommissioning costs are a legacy of
bygone policies and should therefore be borne by the government and so by
all taxpayers or whether they should be treated as a direct production cost
of electricity for which the present-day consumer should pay.
It is evident that the Treasury will not rush to replace a levy which few
people even know about with a more open tax, so reform will be resisted in
that quarter. Furthermore, there are already plans to phase the levy out by
1997, so there is a case for leaving existing arrangements undisturbed.
But there are other considerations, not least the imminent privatisation of
British Coal. The ending of effective subsidies to the coal mining industry
through artificial long-term coal contract prices will leave Nuclear
Electric with very special advantages which are hard to justify. Aside from
the levy, NE enjoys priority access to supplying the electricity grid
because nuclear generators cannot be switched on and off as easily as other
sources.
Far better to draw a line under old policies and reconstitute Nuclear
Electric in such a way that it can operate as a free-standing commercial
enterprise. This would entail making a distinction between the declining
Magnox power stations which Nuclear Electric inherited and those which form
part of its new commercial strategy. The cost of decommissioning the former
would be borne by the exchequer, the latter out of NE's operating profits,
which are growing. Proposals for new nuclear stations would be assessed
economically on the basis of all their costs, including decommissioning.
Aside from creating a more level playing field in the energy market, this
arrangement would also shape the right setting for a government review of
the nuclear power industry in 1994. Scottish Nuclear, which owns Scotland's
two nuclear power stations, does not benefit from the levy. The sooner
Nuclear Electric can be viewed as a commercial rather than a subsidised
concern, the more likely that sensible decisions about the longer-term
prospects for nuclear power can be made.

THREE WEEKS ago, Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, declared that
his country's 1993 budget would be 'neither Shakespeare nor Verdi'. In fact,
the plot centred on Italy's chronic fiscal deficit seems now to be rapidly
heading towards a final act rich in drama and desperation. The Bank of Italy
on Friday failed to resuscitate the lira despite a 1.75 percentage point
increase in interest rates. The weekend declarations at the Bath finance
ministers' meeting may calm nerves on the foreign exchanges for the time
being. But Italy will be fortunate if it limps through the fortnight before
the French Maastricht referendum without a further intensification of the
country's financial crisis.
Mr Giuliano Amato's government had hoped that last month's L30,000bn
emergency package trimming this year's deficit would buy breathing space in
which to tackle the still more exacting challenge of the 1993 budget. In its
plans for next year, to be presented to parliament by the end of this month,
the government is looking for total spending cuts and extra revenue
amounting to roughly three times the 1992 deficit reduction. The government
aims to realise most of the savings through structural reforms in the civil
service and regional administration, as well as in the increasingly
expensive health and pensions systems. All these changes will be painful and
unpopular. But only by approving them can Italy's parliamentary deputies win
the credibility the country needs to weather the current monetary turmoil.
Other options do not exist. A lira devaluation would be folly unless it were
accompanied by action showing Italian voters and foreign investors that the
country really has switched fiscal course. The renewed monetary squeeze, on
its own, will prove self-defeating, since higher interest rates dampen
economic activity and tax revenues and add drastically to debt service
costs.
Mr Amato must use the sense of impending financial calamity to press his
budget plans through parliament with the utmost urgency. The desire to
remain aboard the journey to European integration gives Italy an additional
incentive. More than that, Europe's drive for economic convergence is the
only thing that gives Italy's reform efforts a semblance of credibility; the
weakness of the lira is being exacerbated by uncertainty as to whether the
Maastricht treaty will survive. The message from the financial markets is
that this really is Italy's last chance. If they judge that Italy has become
irrevocably cut adrift from the process of European convergence, then its
fate, both political and economic, will be dire indeed.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Cloudy skies at Farnborough: One of the world's biggest air
shows takes place against a background of uncertainty in the aerospace
industry
</HEADLINE>

Mr Jean Pierson, the chairman of Airbus, was offering a bottle of champagne
for the first serious customer to walk into the European aircraft
consortium's hospitality chalet at the Berlin air show in June. He is likely
to double the offer at Farnborough today.
Airbus, like the rest of the industry, is scrambling for new orders at a
time when the overlapping and growing difficulties of both the civil and
defence sides of the business are accelerating a radical reshaping of large
sections of the industry.
The last Farnborough air show two years ago was dominated by the impact of
the sharp defence cuts on the military business that followed the collapse
of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the cold war. This time, the focus of
concern has shifted to civil aviation which has so far failed to recover
from its worst recession in 40 years.
'Frankly, the financial health of civil aviation worries me more than the
fall-off in the military market,' said Mr Brian Rowe, head of the US General
Electric company's aero-engine activities. For Mr Rowe, the military
slowdown was not unexpected although it occurred much faster than
anticipated. 'The question is how do we continue to develop large commercial
engines when our customers are losing multi-billions of dollars a year and
it appears they are still a few years away from relief,' he added.
Mr Maurice Foley, deputy chairman of GPA, the Irish leasing group which was
forced to shelve its flotation this year because of the depressed state of
the commercial aircraft market, said the industry's financial situation was
a disaster.
'Since mid-1990, the world airline industry has lost at least Dollars 10bn,
an amount roughly equivalent to its entire earnings in the previous six
years. For any industry, such a setback would be a significant blow: for one
which must finance over Dollars 30bn worth of new assets a year on average,
it is a catastrophe,' he said last week.
A big gap is emerging between the airline industry's financial resources and
its needs. In turn, airlines' growing difficulties in financing new aircraft
acquisitions is becoming one of the main challenges facing aircraft
manufacturers. Unless new sources of financing are developed, the industry's
more optimistic long-term growth forecasts are unlikely to be realised,
warns Mr Adam Brown, the Airbus planning director.
The industry continues to believe that air traffic will grow by 5 per cent a
year on average during the next 10 years and that the world aircraft fleet
will need to expand accordingly.
Airbus last week predicted that during the next 20 years 90 per cent of the
world's current inventory of about 7,800 jets will be replaced. Most will be
retired. Airbus is now forecasting that world airlines will order more than
9,000 additional new aircraft during the next 20 years. This represents
business worth about Dollars 850bn at today's prices.
But this bright future hinges on the industry overcoming its short-term
difficulties. Although passenger traffic has picked up since the air travel
slump caused by the combination of the Gulf war last year and economic
recession, business has failed so far to recover sufficiently to match the
overall rise in capacity which is still outstripping passenger demand.
Simply put, too many aircraft are flying with empty seats. After falling by
3 per cent last year - the first decline in air traffic since the
introduction of the jet aircraft - passenger traffic has increased so far
this year by 8 per cent compared with 1990, the year before the collapse
provoked by the Gulf conflict. But according to the International Air
Transport Association (Iata), overall capacity is 12 per cent higher than in
1990.
Airlines are engaged in what Mr Gunter Eser, Iata's director-general, calls
a 'kamikaze fare discounting war' to maintain market share in anticipation
of an eventual traffic rebound and to position themselves in an increasingly
deregulated international aviation market.
The Association of European Airlines (AEA), which groups together 24
European carriers, also noted last week that the current weakness in the
market has coincided with a surge in capacity by US airlines. This, in turn,
has created a renewed fares war to attract US traffic hit by the falling
value of the US dollar. In Europe, even the Olympic Games and the world
trade fair in Spain failed to regain the lost momentum in air travel, AEA
added.
Excess capacity is also unsettling aircraft manufacturers. 'Air travel may
experience much stronger growth than we now project, but our best guess
today is that there is no foreseeable shortfall to 2010 in commercial
aircraft manufacturing capacity,' said Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's
vice-president of planning and international development.
'It seems clear that the growing problem of excess capacity will have a huge
impact on our industry over the next five to 10 years and we will probably
see a change in both the composition of the airframe manufacturers and their
relationship with suppliers,' he added.
The contraction in the defence industry is expected to continue spawning new
ventures in commercial aerospace, putting even greater pressure on capacity.
This is likely to take place not only among the big western manufacturing
industries but also in Russia and other countries, especially those in the
Asia-Pacific region with aerospace aspirations.
Russia is mounting an unprecedented marketing drive to sell military and
commercial aircraft in the west at Farnborough this year. More than 400
Russian officials are attending the show. At least 20 Russian aircraft will
be exhibited, including seven never shown in the west before.
During the last cyclical expansion, airlines and leasing companies ordered
more than 1,000 aircraft a year between 1988 and 1990. This has created an
order backlog equivalent to five years of future production for the big
three airliner manufacturers - Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas. This
compares with a historical average of just over two years for the industry.
Although the big three manufacturers have lost some firm orders through
cancellation and have been forced to reschedule deliveries of new aircraft
as well as reduce production on some programmes, they are still confident
that their huge order backlog will ultimately be delivered over a longer
than originally envisaged timescale.
Manufacturers still expect to deliver a record total of about 800 new
aircraft this year. But Airbus now acknowledges that deliveries will decline
to some 400 aircraft a year in 2004 before rising again when the next
aircraft replacement cycle pushes the number up to 600 a year by 2008/2010.
But the industry is not only facing overcapacity. It is also having to cope
with a sharp increase in new product development costs. 'Driven at least in
part by the increasing complexity of airworthiness regulations, the
non-recurring costs necessary to conceive a new product and to bring it to
the market have been growing far more rapidly than general cost inflation,'
says Mr Brown of Airbus.
This is expected to lead to a sharp reduction in commercial aircraft
programme launches - a mirror of the trend in the military aircraft
industry. In the US, the world's largest aerospace market, the number of
combat aircraft programmes in production has already fallen from 11 in the
1970s to seven in the 1980s and probably to no more than one or possibly two
in the 1990s.
On the commercial side, there have been a total of 19 important new product
launches in the past 20 years. 'I find it difficult to envisage more than a
quarter of this number - that is, at a maximum four or five - of major
product launches in the next 20 years,' said Mr Brown. He also expects the
focus in the industry to shift from new product development to improving
existing aircraft programmes.
Excess capacity and increasing development costs have forced the pace of
restructuring in the industry. The past few months have seen Deutsche
Aerospace, the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz group,
negotiate a partnership with Fokker of the Netherlands which is expected to
lead to a significant realignment in the European regional aircraft
industry. McDonnell Douglas has been striving to forge an alliance with
aerospace manufacturers in the Far East to form a new international
commercial aerospace partnership to match Boeing, which controls 55 per cent
of the world market, and the European Airbus consortium which has built up a
26 per cent share of the market during the past 20 years.
The pressures of the market are also driving companies into broader
cross-border alliances and forcing them to retrench around their core
activities. General Dynamics, the biggest US defence contractor, took the
lead when it decided to shed all its non-strategic defence activities,
including those in the commercial sector, to refocus itself on its principal
military businesses.
British Aerospace is in the throes of a similar process. It is expected to
announce later this month a restructuring programme aimed at focusing the
company on its core military and large civil airliner business. And Boeing,
the world's dominant commercial aerospace company with a long 'do-it-alone'
tradition, is now openly talking of expanding international collaboration.
The industry both in the US and Europe believes that future market
requirements for more technologically and environmentally efficient
aircraft, including a new generation of 600-seater jumbos and supersonic
jets, will require significant government support. This summer the European
aerospace companies have already urged the European Community to fund a
five-year Pounds 1.2bn programme to develop advanced new aircraft
technologies. In turn, the US industry has called for more consistent
political support for aerospace companies.
Ultimately, however, there is bound to be a significant shake-out both in
the civil aviation and defence industries. Sir Colin Marshall, the deputy
chairman of British Airways, believes the industry will eventually be
dominated by 'no more than 10-12 global airline combines, perhaps less'.
On the manufacturing side, Mr Rowe of GE believes that 'out of the ashes of
1991 and 1992, a more streamlined, cost-efficient industry has to emerge'.
Mr Pierson of Airbus gave a blunter prediction: 'If you want to make a small
fortune in aerospace these days, you better start with a big one.'

Festival

<TEXT>
ONCE MORE into the Vale of Tears, dear readers. Thanks in part to the
European Arts Festival, Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal have
returned to Britain for the first time in 10 years - at the King's Theatre.
Cafe Muller, though by no means the best of Bausch is the current offering,
both popular and echt.
Cafe Muller is set in an empty cafe. Wooden chairs and tables litter a large
box set. Early on, two important scenes occur. A woman, eyes closed,
sleepwalks barefoot in her nightie, her hair flowing, and an earnest young
man, in spectacles, keeps shifting furniture, to save her from blundering
into it. She seems driven by deep personal need - but, though he keeps
guarding her, her need never includes him. Instead, she finds another
unseeing sleepwalker, and it is this man who is plainly her destiny. The
scene tinges Romantic somnambulism with violently neurotic urgency.
As soon as she and this new man blindly embrace, the next episode begins. A
third, older man enters and rearranges their limbs. He is, evidently, an
artist. No sooner does he walk away than the woman tumbles from the position
into which he has put her. And no matter how often he arranges her, she
tumbles every time. A funny scene, this at once introduces us to Bausch's
talent for irony. It's absurd that a man should model these two sleep-lovers
as if they were clay (but isn't that what choreographers do?). It's absurd
they let themselves be models. It's absurd the modelling doesn't last.
The contrast between these two episodes is a sign of Bausch's theatrical
mastery. But the fact is that these scenes, with the few meanings (however
strong) they offer, occupy some 20 minutes. And the rest of Cafe Muller is a
series of obvious repetitions and variations on these two situations. The
two sleepwalkers are sado-masochistic. They throw each other against walls,
they grieve, they are never happy - but they seek only each other. Other
people - voyeurs and/or manipulators and/or helpers - try to draw their
attention, but these lovers keep eluding anyone else who enters their
spheres.
The six participants in Cafe Muller are excellent performers, unflinchingly
committed. But, even though this piece asks them to do little real dancing,
it still shows that they are simply terrible dancers - poorly co-ordinated,
effortful (big lumpy calf muscles are a Bausch trademark), imprecise. But
then, if Bausch had better dancers, she wouldn't know how to use them. Like
so many European theatre artists, she has made a house style out of strain,
hysteria and technical inadequacy.
As a theatre artist, Bausch is important and can be haunting. In dance (for
want of a better word), she has had a fell influence far and wide. She
herself performs the most isolated and lonely role in Cafe Muller. It is odd
to watch this bleak, unhappy, middle-aged waif and to realise that this is
the earth-mother of Eurotrash.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Revival brings Yan Tan Tethera into sharper
perspective - Music theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS 10 years since Opera Factory burst upon London's staid sensibilities
with David Freeman's startling production of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy. In
the last decade, the company has established itself as a vital third force
in the capital's operatic life, clinging on without ever receiving the level
of financial support it deserves, yet scoring a good many more invigorating
hits than misses in its catholic range of stagings. One of those successes
from 1986 is currently being revived in the Queen Elizabeth Hall - Yan Tan
Tethera, Birtwistle's 'mechanical past-oral' to a text by Tony Harrison.
It is a slender tale. A northern shepherd, Alan, comes south to settle among
the sarsen stones of the Wiltshire downs with his wife, Hannah, and
white-faced sheep. His success there attracts the envy of the local
shepherd, Caleb Raven, whose black-faced flock fails to thrive; Caleb
enlists the support of the Bad Un to steal away Alan and his newborn twin
boys. In the end, of course, northern intuition and faith triumph over
southern evil and avarice: Hannah's reliance on the old magic and the
potency of traditional counting ('yan, tan, tethera, methera, pimp')
restores Alan and her children to her; Caleb is trapped by his own greed,
and the rest live happily ever after.
At the premiere six years ago it seemed a rather undramatic, unfocused
piece, especially when set against the theatrical magnificence of
Birtwistle's Mask of Orpheus, which had finally been staged at the Coliseum
only two months earlier. But the revival puts everything into a much sharper
perspective; Yan Tan Tethera can be now appreciated strictly on its own
terms and the Opera Factory production seems altogether more tightly and
confidently worked, with the orchestral contribution made far more telling.
The cast is almost entirely new; only Tom McDonnell, as the Ram leading the
wonderfully observed chorus of sheep, has survived. The portrayals this time
are, in general, less severe and their fluid style adds yet another layer to
the complex dramatic web. Birtwistle's hieratic musical treatment, full of
overlapping cycles and a likewise magical belief in the power of counting,
Harrison's emphatically rhymed text and the strict ritualised scenario
combine to create a subtle clockwork of its own. There may be a viable way
of presenting Yan Tan Tethera that follows the prescriptions of the libretto
more closely (in what was originally conceived as an opera for television),
but Freeman's carefully detailed naturalism gives it positive life and
energy.
As it is, Geoffrey Dolton's Alan, full of wonder and naive hope, and Marie
Angel's passionate, unflinching Hannah bring the central characters alive in
a way that the piece originally seemed to preclude. Dolton delivers his
counting rhymes with vivid certainty, while Angel's luscious tone and
compelling stage movement make every phrase into an adventure in itself.
Patrick Donnelly does as much as he can to flesh out Caleb's character;
Harry Nicolls flits around effectively as the pipe-playing Bad Un. The
chorus, steeped in sheep body-language, is a constant fascination and, an
occasional ill-judged Larry-the-Lamb phrase apart, sings with great
intensity.
The musical success of the revival stems from the conducting of Mark
Wigglesworth and the playing of the Premiere Ensemble, who invest the score
with intense lyrical detail.
The music is typical of Birtwistle's writing in the early 1980s: beautifully
wrought, absolutely free of unnecessary rhetoric and conjuring a succession
of striking images - haunting wind figures, webs of unfurling string lines,
sudden stark percussive attacks. Here they are all fitted into a perfect
dramatic context; the scale and ambition of the piece are exactly matched.
Queen Elizabeth Hall; further performances September 7, 8, 11 and 12.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Monuments to genius and history - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEST kind of architecture is hard to compare with anything else.
However, what good buildings have in common is that they clearly express a
moment of history. From the Pantheon in Rome to the Guggenheim Museum in New
York, architects have produced landmark buildings that measure history and
yet are independently distinguished. Publishers are now understanding that
there is a good niche for books that concentrate on individual masterpieces
rather than books that generalise about a period.
Architectural history is marked by individuals of genius who produce
occasional buildings of genius. A German publisher, Ernst und Sohn Verlag
fur Architektur und technische Wissenschaften, has seen the point of this
sort of publishing and for around DM30 (Pounds 10.70) you can find elegant
enlightenment about a series of good buildings. I was very struck by the
volume on Rudolf Steiner, Goetheanum, Dornach photographed by Thomas Dix and
written by the Cologne architectural historian Wolfgang Pehnt.
The Goetheanum is undoubtedly one of the icons of the Expressionist movement
as well as being the key work of the great anthroposophist Rudolph Steiner.
This book shows the building looking like a mountain lit from inside. In
different lights the Goetheanum on its hillside near Basel becomes
completely organic - strange, beautiful and always suggestive of some other
worldly place.
On a much more homely level is the volume of the Ernst and Sohn series
dedicated to the houses at Fredensborg in Denmark by Jorn Utzon, the
architect of the Sydney Opera House. This is a book that makes the caring
Sixties, when these houses were built in quiet courtyards with a community
centre, look like ancient history. How we could learn today from these
modest but sensitive houses] What a sense of peace and order and
Scandinavian calm.
The other most beautiful thing that the sensitive photographs of Jens
Frederiksen reveal is the acute awareness of the landscape. There is none of
that isolated 'landscaping' - more a sense of perfect harmony with the land
and a strong sense of the scale of the walls being carefully considered with
the scale of the trees.
The Ernst and Sohn series is known as the Opus series; it is well produced
and the volumes are written in German and English. It will range widely,
from a volume on Fatehpur Sikri to one on Zurich railway station by the
Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. They are available at good art
bookshops
A book of an apparently more coffee table appearance is Great Irish Houses
and Castles by Jaqueline O'Brien and Desmond Guinness, (Weidenfeld and
Nicolson, Pounds 30). But do not be put off by the gloss and glamour of this
book. Although it deserves the old accolade of sumptuous it is more than
that. Mr Guinness knows these houses perhaps better than anyone in Ireland
and the photographer, who has been whizzing over the houses in helicopters
and taking her lights into the great rooms, is famous for her photographs of
horses. But she is not daunted by the difficulties of architectural
photography. The results are very beautiful.
Having stayed in some of these houses, I was a bit surprised by the pristine
order that they all appear to have acquired for the camera . . . But Irish
houses, especially the great Georgian ones such as Russborough, Florence
Court and Castletown, demonstrate that the classical house is habitable and
elegant and comfortable. Mr Guinness, with his first wife, founded the Irish
Georgian Society - one of the most entertaining and effective conservation
bodies in the world. He wears his knowledge and enthusiasm lightly; his book
makes you want to be in Ireland.
The world of the modern architect in Britain is now the subject of
considerable scholarly research and publishing. RIBA Publications have just
published a monumental volume about one of the heroes of modernism in this
country. Berthold Lubetkin Architecture and the Tradition of Progress by
John Allan (Pounds 60) is an amazingly thorough book which is interesting as
social history as well as architectural history.
Lubetkin was born in Russia in 1901, fleeing first to Paris and then to
London in 1931. He is famous for the Penguin Pool at London Zoo and for the
work of his firm Tecton - which includes the Highpoint flats in Highgate,
London, as well as much public housing and health building for the Borough
of Finsbury. He seemed to be perfectly fitted to design the mining town of
Peterlee, County Durham, for which he was the master planner, in the late
1950s. Its social programme fitted his beliefs - 'that architecture can be a
committed driving force on the side of enlightenment.'
But he failed and had to resign, a disillusioned man who abandoned
architecture and took to farming. His Russian emotionalism won the day and
he was sadly embittered until the end of his life in 1990. Mr Allan's
tribute is a daunting but effective biography of the man and his period,
essential reading for anyone interested in what went right and wrong
architecturally and socially in 20th century Britain.

<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY the second of the Royal Concertgebouw's Albert Hall Prom
appearances brought the rarity of the concerto for oboeist, flautist and
orchestra, Grande Aulodia (1970), by the Italian composer/conductor Bruno
Maderna (1920-73). Earlier came a work with some stylistic kinship to
Maderna's, the beautifully wrought, romantic early orchestral Passacaglia by
Webern and, later, a work with none, the fifth symphony of Tchaikovsky.
The conductor was the orchestra's chief, Riccardo Chailly, who shaped the
Webern piece with passionate precision, drawing it beautifully to a climax
on which the high trumpets set a seal of excellent musicianship, just as the
other brass players had earlier contributed memorable muted snarls and
rasps. The work's gradient, from the barely audible opening pizzicati to the
sonorous massifs towards the end, was defined with an ease of which only the
best of orchestras is capable.
The concerto's soloists, Paul Verhey and Maurice Bourgue, must each play
four instruments, Verhey the flute, piccolo, flute in E flat and alto flute;
Bourgue the oboe, oboe d'amore, cor anglais and musette, akin a bagless
bagpipe.
The wealth of solo sonorities is given scope by the relaxed formal structure
 -one critic justly termed the work the 'cadenza concerto' - and was
splendidly produced by these two virtuosi, completely at home with Maderna's
often pointillistic idiom: even the musette was remarkably eloquent. The
large orchestra, in a special arrangement on the platform, periodically
chips in a kind of buoyant textural refrain reflecting one or other
instrumental sub-group - jagged dance-like carolling for massed strings,
brass volleys, tuned percussion expostulations, and so on. But the work ends
unexpectedly on a sustained passage of almost Ivesian mystery and stillness.
Chailly negotiated the interplay of solo and orchestral sections with care,
and the work came over as gratefully suave if not deeply substantial. His
reading of the symphony was deliberated and restrained. The music's
pessimism was favoured over its struggle for life. But for all the finesse
with which this interpretation was advanced, one couldn't but regret the
deficiency of musical red corpuscles.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Don't be put out for Jack's Out - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Danny Miller's first play, an 'old-fashioned thriller' set in the
Brighton underworld (under the Pier, perhaps), Jack is out rather sooner
than people had been hoping. The cast-list betrays the fact that we're not
to meet him: like 'George and Margaret', the long-expected guests in the old
farce, he reaches the threshold just as the lights go down for the last
time. By then, the four characters still alive and present have excellent
reasons for not wanting to meet him either.
It is an old-fashioned thriller, if 'old-fashioned' takes in not only film
noir, but the specialised vein of criminal diction that goes back to Runyon
and Orton, with a late flowering in 'Arfur' Daley - archly elaborate,
stuffed with sinister euphemisms. When Kieron Forsyth's shifty Jules
declares that in school he was no good at 'the words', he must be lying:
like everybody else, he is hell bent to put a spin and a wink on every
single phrase.
James Clyde's pretty-boy Luke has rashly taken up with Jack's girlfriend
Barbara (Georgiana Dacombe) during Jack's enforced absence. They supply the
film noir element, even a bit of Greenery; and there is a practised
performance by Richard Tate as Chunky, the shameless old fence. John
Challis's looming Frank supplies the real menace, and for all the script's
verbal high-jinks he delivers the only real laughs too.
There is a strong whiff of television about all this, and one can't help
reflecting that TV could have got it into one tidy hour. Jack's Out is
longer than that, though the tightening screw of the plot is just about
enough to bring you back after the interval to see what happens. I shouldn't
recommend a long crosstown trip to watch it, but if you live nearby,
Miller's deft script may offer some wry pleasure. Ken McClymont directs;
Graham Johnston's inelegant set serves its purpose.
Presented by Barmont Productions at The Bush, London W12; until 26 September

Unless you are already immersed in the mini-series A Woman Named Jackie
about Jackie Kennedy/Onassis (8.00 with more at 10.40, ITV) this is not a
night for fiction lovers. Bags of fact programmes, though. Out Of Darkness
is the first in a series which promises a 'critical' look at the efforts
being made to re-shape African societies, opening with Angola (7.50 BBC2).
The Velvet Claw is another new series (8.30 BBC1), this one using animation
and computer graphics to illustrate the sort of carnivores which dominated
the earth once the dinosaurs disappeared.
This week's programme in C4's Travellers' Tales shows comedian Jimmy Tingle
driving from Canada to Mexico in a Ford convertible (9.00).
Panorama (9.30 BBC1) considers the decline of British racing, asking whether
the crisis stems from lack of business sense or the unwillingness of bookies
to pay their share. This will need to be good to match BBC2's recent

FT  07 SEP 92 / Management: Gastronomic Edinburgh, behind closed doors:
James Buxton says discretion is called for if you do not want to be
recognised by other lunchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holding a business lunch in a restaurant in Edinburgh or in Glasgow can be a
hazardous undertaking: it could cost you business. The Scottish business and
financial communities are so small that you are bound to be recognised by
other lunchers. You may not wish to have your lunch with a potential client
witnessed by a rival.
The danger is particularly acute for the dozen-odd fund management companies
based in Edinburgh, whose staff ought to be thronging the city's eating
places. As Ross Lidstone, partner in Baillie Gifford, explains: 'I wouldn't
dream of taking a new client to a restaurant in Edinburgh. Someone would
recognise us and the game would be up.'
Baillie Gifford and other companies have private dining rooms into which
guests can be sprited with little fear of being seen by the opposition. The
same caution is exercised by lawyers, bankers and other deal-makers engaged
in any entertaining where the identity of the lunchers could be significant.
Of course the same danger exists in London but although important lunches
there take place in private, eating in restaurants is less risky because
there are far more people and many more restaurants. Even the most
gregarious Scot who has worked in both London and Scotland will confess that
he lunches out much less in Edinburgh and Glasgow than in London.
But there are still plenty of restaurants in the Scottish cities, and except
during the Edinburgh Festival you can usually get a table in Edinburgh at
short notice. The atmosphere (especially in Edinburgh) may be rather more
restrained than in London and Scots may be a little brisker than the English
in getting down to the subject in hand. But a Scottish business lunch is
still likely to be aimed at making acquaintances and cementing relationships
rather than doing deals.
'It oils the wheels,' says Giles Weaver, of Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow
fund managers, 'enabling you to get the nuances that you may not get at a
hard meeting in a business-oriented room'.
The meal itself is likely to be light but sustaining, and is unlikely to be
overtly Scottish, though locally produced meat and fish are emphasised.
Having a single glass of wine rather than a bottle is becoming more common,
for those people who do not confine themselves Calvinistically to Highland
Spring or Strathmore mineral water (the Scottish equivalents of Perrier).
The meal will be much cheaper than London, better value for money and a tip
of not more than 10 per cent will usually be well received. An excellent
three course lunch for two with wine at the Grill in the Balmoral,
Edinburgh's new five star hotel, costs less than Pounds 40.
Gourmets might go to L'Auberge, a French restaurant which a Michelin
inspector would think upheld his national standards. The top restaurant in
town is probably the Pompadour at the Caledonian hotel, but people only go
there when they want to be really grand.
A special pleasure is Martins, small, bright, personal (Martin Irons, the
proprietor, is always in friendly attendance) and with an emphasis on herb
flavourings, organic vegetables and Scottish cheeses. It has a private room
for which there is no extra charge for those wanting discretion.
For more bustle there is the Oyster Bar, off St Andrew's Square, a fish
restaurant with no hang-ups about using butter and cream, heavily patronised
by people from the Royal Bank of Scotland head office next door.
The fact that someone with a little knowledge of the Scottish business scene
should be able to put a name to a fair number of the lunchers in one of the
good restaurants adds to the spice of the occasion.
Nowhere would that be easier than in the New Club, the Edinburgh club where
the high command of the Edinburgh establishment and lawyers, bankers,
accountants and art gallery directors all sit down together for lunch.
'You're not supposed to discuss business but people do,' says an informant.
In Glasgow a jollier atmosphere is noticeable the moment you step off the
train. The financial community congregates at Rogano, an art deco restaurant
in Exchange Place. If you want to experience the new Glasgow, go to the
Ubiquitous Chip in the city's West End; for luxury and superb food go to One
Devonshire Gardens, a sumptuous small hotel in the same area. Glasgow's
equivalent of the New Club is the Western Club, full of advocates and men of
affairs. The food may be a little stodgy but each day after lunch there are
two or three tables of bridge players, where people cut in at end of a
rubber.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Management: Flexibility is all in a year's work / A look at
one company's experience of introducing an annualised hours system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joe Pluck cannot call his free time his own. 'Whatever you are doing,
however special the occasion, they can ask you to come in and work. It
really is selling your soul to the company,' he says. In January 1990, his
employer, Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens, a margarine-making subsidiary of
Unilever, switched from calculating his hours per week to hours per year.
His total of 2,061 hours includes 282 which the company does not timetable.
Pluck is paid whether he works the hours or not but he may have to work them
at very short notice as stand-by for unexpected absence or surges in demand.
Pluck, a shop steward, recommended the annualised hours system and measures
to aid flexible working to the 750-strong workforce. Since then, he has had
some second thoughts, especially about being on stand-by, but both he and
most employees broadly support the new system.
Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens is typical of employers which introduce annualised
hours. The transformation of working practices has been self-financing while
the workforce has declined to 680. The company moved from five- to seven-day
working, increased productivity and output while at the same time, it
abolished the paid overtime which had added as much as 100 per cent to the
basic pay of some employees.
The annualised hours system is spreading and now covers 6 per cent of
British employees, according to the Department of Employment. The system was
first introduced by continuous process manufacturers in paper and board,
glass, cement and chemicals. Now, white-collar employers such as the Bristol
and West Building Society and various media organisations are adopting it.
Andy Speak, personnel manager at Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens, says: 'We no
longer have overtime working and we are using our assets to expand the
factory.' However a 1991 study by the Incomes Data Services research group
found employee reaction to annualised hours was more mixed in spite of the
advantages of a shorter working week and more predictable earnings.
At the margarine plant, the transformation has certainly been radical. In
the first eight months of 1989, average overtime per head was between 48 and
66 hours a month. In the same period in 1990, the average number of stand-by
hours, a form of pre-paid overtime, was 0.7 and 2.4 hours per person per
month.
The unions estimate that about 40 per cent of employees, mainly those who
did a lot of overtime, saw their earnings decrease - by between Pounds 200
and Pounds 3,000 a year. They were generally prepared to exchange cash for
leisure time and the security of a regular monthly pay check.
Pluck, whose own earnings dropped by about Pounds 5,000 a year to Pounds
20,500, says: 'We may have had high earnings before but it was no quality of
life having to work all the time to maintain that income'.
Most early glitches in the scheme were associated with the unpopular
stand-by system. Attempts by management to call in people to cover for
people on training courses, when the company began a total quality
management course, were met with fury.
Originally employees rostered on stand-by were required to stay by their
telephones. Many found good reasons why this was impossible. Eventually the
company introduced a freefone and employees on stand-by are now required to
telephone the plant regularly.
As Danny Pyman, also a shop steward, says: 'It is very difficult to make it
clear to people that they have already been paid for the extra 12-hour shift
they were called in for at very short notice and which has ruined their
plans for a family barbecue.'
IDS says workers at some companies have complained that annualised hours
discriminates against part-time workers with family responsibilities, but
nobody believes this has been a problem at Van den Berghs and Jergens.
However, groups of specialist employees have found the stand-by system
particularly onerous. A more fundamental problem, but not one specific to
annualised hours agreements, has been new managers appointed with little
understanding of the spirit of the original agreement, say the unions.
Pyman, who was involved in negotiating the original deal, speaks of the
atmosphere at the time with a nostalgic reverence: 'It was a whole new way
of life. They would trust us and we would trust them. For most of the 28
years I have worked for this company, I completely distrusted management and
they completely distrusted me. But we were committed to a new start.'
Pyman says the pioneering ethos led him to agree to the management's request
that there should be some slack in the contract. 'The personnel manager said
to us that he didn't want everything written in tablets of stone and we
agreed.' It is a decision he now regrets saying that newly-appointed
managers are sticking to the letter and not the spirit of the agreement.
Some older workers left because they were unable to cope with the weekend
working and their pensions were pegged to the higher basic wages they were
paid when overtime ended. Similarly, employees who fall ill no longer face a
dramatic drop in income because sick pay reflects earnings more accurately.
Pyman is clear that he began negotiations because he feared the consequences
of outright rejection and hoped to minimise job losses. Today he is facing
early retirement which the company says is voluntary. He says the
contraction in the workforce following increased efficiency from the new
package has given the management the grounds to argue that the plant no
longer needs full-time union officials: 'We sold the damn deal to a
sceptical membership, loyalty is poorly rewarded,' he says.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JT DESIGN BUILD has been awarded an Pounds 8.8m contract to design and build
a 300 metre long passenger pier and a 300 metre long link bridge at Terminal
4, Heathrow Airport.
The structure will connect Terminal 4 with four aircraft stands. The
contract also includes a departure lounge, a cafe, toilets, staff
accommodation, plantrooms and stores. Both link and pier structures will be
a combination of precast concrete and steel frames with precast concrete
flooring.
The building will be clad internally and externally with profiled steel
sheeting with high levels of insulation to achieve both thermal and acoustic
insulation. Internally, passenger conveyors will be provided at both
arrivals and departures levels.
The departures level has a barrel vaulted ceiling through its whole length
with a continuous curved bulkhead concealing services.
To be completed on a fast-track 48-week programme, the structures will be
built alongside a number of passenger facilities that will remain
operational.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading M25 motorway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACER CONSULTANTS, based at Guildford in Surrey, has been awarded a Pounds
160m contract by the Department of Transport to undertake the Stage 3 design
and supervision of the M25 motorway improvements between Junction 16 (M40)
and Junction 23 (South Mimms).
The contract, which involves project management, engineering design,
environmental studies, and traffic and economic appraisals, will be
completed totally in-house.
Following work on the M4 widening between Junctions 4b and 5, which has been
brought to tender stage, Acer will now undertake the widening of the M25 to
dual four-lane carriageway throughout, with narrow lanes at select
locations.
Assessments of all major structures will be undertaken, whilst overbridge
demolition will be restricted to a practical minimum.
Improvement of traffic movements between Junction 21 and Junction 21a will
be investigated as part of the commission, with the provision of direct
links between the M1 and the A405 favoured.
TecnEcon, economic and transport consultants and an associate member of the
Acer Group, will carry out all traffic and economic studies.
The project is about 36 kilometres long and will be divided into two
sections at the design stage which will eventually form two contracts at the
construction stage. Priority will be given to the section from Junction 16
to 19, followed by Junction 19 to 23.
The design for the first section is scheduled to take some 18 months with a
similar period identified for the second section. Supervision contracts are
scheduled to take two years.

BAA's commitment to retailing as a core source of future growth has been
sealed by the promotion of Barry Gibson, group retailing director, to the
main board, with the airport operator aiming to earn more than half of its
revenue from Gibson's area by the end of next year.
Gibson, 40, who joined BAA in 1989, worked initially as commercial director
at Heathrow Airport. There he began the 'value-for money' drive and also
started to introduce 'branded retailing concepts that the public
recognises'. At the end of last year, shortly after industry regulator CAA
unveiled its pricing formula for BAA's traditional revenue source of airport
charges, he was moved into a newly created job, in charge of group
retailing.
While BAA cannot claim to remain unscathed by the recession, its captive
audience of relatively high-spending consumers has helped to insulate it;
half of the passengers passing through BAA airports are foreign, and of the
domestic portion, over half are from the AB social groups.
With plans to add half a million square feet of retailing space between now
and 1996, Gibson says the thrust is to replace the anonymous Skyshops and
the like with branded retailers and caterers.
Before joining BAA, Gibson had cut his teeth in retailing at Littlewoods and
then at Burton, where he had been retail director of Top Shop. In 1983, he
launched what he now refers to as a 'me-too Top Shop', Surprise, a
'typically 1980's BES enterprise' sold in 1987 to Barker &amp; Dobson. He spent
a year at Vivat Holdings, preparing Jean Machine for sale, before joining
BAA.

David Bucks, a former deputy chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, has joined the
board of troubled chemicals group MTM as non-executive deputy chairman.
Bucks, who retired from Hill Samuel in June 1991, says that despite the
manifest problems, he is joining a virtually new management team of 'very
competent people who are well versed in the chemical industry'.
He was introduced to chief executive Ken Schofield and chairman David
Swallow through his old merchant bank, which has picked up MTM as a client
since the management restructuring earlier this year.
Other non-executive directorships that Bucks, 58, has picked up since
retiring include First Leisure and Dobson Park Industries. He is also
chairman of Grosvenor Development Capital.
Hugh Hughes and Roger Hornett, European equity specialists who had been
toying with the idea of launching their own boutique, have joined Societe
Generale, to set up a London brokerage unit. Societe Generale Equities
International (SGEI) will provide research, trading and sales for
cross-border transactions in continental European equities.
Notwithstanding low trading volumes and highly uncertain times for Europe's
bourses, Hughes, the new chief executive of SGEI, says SocGen is proceeding
with its plan to pull together its capital market operations on the
continent, thereby hoping to capture a slice of the 'pan-European
generalist' business. SGEI will be based in London rather than Paris,
operating from the offices of, but remaining separate from, UK equities
broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
Hughes, 40, says the aim is to attract clients 'who want to talk about
Europe as a one market - and a lot of those clients still like to be managed
out of London'. The former European director of Savory Milln, who says his
wife is French - 'which means I speak a modicum of French' - had spent a
year with Paribas in London after leaving Swiss Bank Corporation (which had
acquired Savoury Milln). Roger Hornett, 45, formerly international director
of James Capel, had moved on to the UK arm of Singapore-based stockbrokers
Sassoon, but left last year.
The two were planning to set up their own business when SocGen approached
Hughes to do some consultancy work, from which the new unit and two job
offers emerged.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Warning over equal earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between men's and women's earnings is set to increase unless the
government forces employers to upgrade women's pay, according to an Equal
Opportunities Commission report published today.
The decline of centralised collective bargaining in many sectors, the
casualisation of the labour market and the introduction of performance pay
in recent years are all working against the closing of the pay gap, the
organisation says. The absence of a statutory minimum wage also continues to
disadvantage women, it adds.
The commission wants to see the existing, highly complex equal-pay
legislation replaced by more simple and more effective laws to require
employers to demonstrate they are not discriminating against women. Mrs
Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who also has cabinet responsibility
for women's issues, is more sympathetic to the idea of legislative reform
than her recent predecessors.
Women in full-time work earn about 77 per cent of the full-time average
hourly pay of men. The commission argues that an increase of 10 per cent in
women's hourly earnings would result in an increase in the UK's total wage
bill of only 3.1 per cent. This is because women work shorter hours and
receive lower basic pay.
The research, carried out for the commission by Dr Jill Rubery, senior
management lecturer at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, says similar wage-bill increases are frequently accommodated
within the economy.
Mrs June Bridgeman, deputy chair of the organisation, said the study showed
it would be good value for money to correct the harmful bias in the way
women's work is valued. 'It also shows that the gap between women's and
men's earnings will go from bad to worse if it is left to the caprice of an
imperfect pay market,' she said.
Progress in closing the pay gap is unlikely to come as a result of existing
equal-pay legislation and the pursuit of individual equal-value cases, the
report concludes. Instead, it calls for examination of schemes such as the
one operated in Ontario, Canada, which obliges companies to allocate 1 per
cent of their wage bill each year towards pay equity increases.
Mrs Bridgeman said there had to be 'a better way than the law of the jungle
or the jungle of the law to tackle women's disadvantage when it comes to
getting a fair rate for the job'.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Western carrier may buy Russian
cargo aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INQUIRIES ABOUT possible purchases of the Tupolev Tu 204-200, a new Russian
aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce engines, have been received from at least
one western carrier. It is understood to be Federal Express, the US air
cargo specialist.
The aircraft, being shown in the UK for the first time at Farnborough, is
made and sold by the British Russian Aviation Corporation (Bravia) which is
50 per cent owned by Flemings Russian Investment, part of the Robert Fleming
investment group, 25 per cent by Aviastar, a Russian airframe manufacturer
privatised last year, and 25 per cent by the Tupolev Design Bureau.
Rolls-Royce is supplying its RB211-535 engine for the aircraft.
Mr Valentin Klimov, general director of Tupolev Design Bureau, said that
Bravia aimed to sell the 204-200 at between 20 per cent and 30 per cent less
than the Boeing 757, which typically costs between Dollars 50m (Pounds
25.1m) and Dollars 60m.
Mr Phil Condit, the new president of Boeing, said the company was prepared
to compete with any Russian competitors on price.
A price war between the two aircraft makers is, however, only a remote
possibility because the Tu 204-200 has yet to undergo rigorous certification
by the world's aviation authorities.
If Federal Express buys the 204-200, it will be a cargo derivative capable
of lifting 30 tonnes of freight. Certification for use as a cargo aircraft
is less stringent than for passenger aircraft.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GULFSTREAM Aerospace of the US, builders of the market-leading G-IV business
jet, yesterday announced two models that direct its development thrust
squarely at the trans-Pacific market.
The Gulfstream V will have a non-stop range of 6,300 nautical miles, giving
it the capability of flying from New York to Tokyo or London to Singapore.
Gulfstream's second announcement was the replacement of the G-IV with the
G-IV-SP (Special Performance). The SP offers a 53 per cent improvement in
payload range performance over the G-IV.
Gulfstream emphasises that the SP is available now, while the G-V will be
ready for delivery in 1996.
Throughout next year, the company promises to sell the SP at the present
price of a G-IV: Dollars 23.5m. It quotes the price of a G-V as Dollars
29.5m in 1993 dollars. This price is without cabin outfitting, which adds
anything from Dollars 3m upwards to the price.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Taiwan move threatens China deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH efforts to sell Mirage combat aircraft to Taiwan are holding back a
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 750m) deal to sell European Airbus wide-body aircraft
to China, Paul Betts writes.
Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus chairman, said yesterday that he hoped to sign a
firm deal with China for the sale of six A300-600 and six A330 jets by the
end of this year. However, the deal was being delayed because of 'political
problems between two governments'.
Airbus, whose shareholders include British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of
France, Casa of Spain and Deutsche Aerospace has already signed two
preliminary agreements to sell the 12 airliners but China has yet to make a
firm commitment to buy the aircraft.
China appears to have become increasingly irritated by efforts on the part
of western aerospace companies to sell military hardware to Taiwan.
Aerospace experts said that the US government's decision this year to supply
Taiwan with F16 multi-role combat aircraft could also spark retaliation from
China against sales of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas commercial jets.
Mr Pierson said Airbus had clinched an order at the weekend for two A320
narrow-body twin-jet aircraft, worth about Dollars 100m, from Shorouk Air, a
joint venture between Egypt Air and Kuwait. That brings total firm orders
booked by Airbus so far this year to 79 airliners.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the founders of Allied Dunbar, the company which has revolutionised
life insurance sales techniques, has sent the Office of Fair Trading a
submission calling for tougher controls on the industry.
The move comes as a response to the OFT's consultation exercise on the
Securities and Investments Board's retail investment review, which ended
last week.
Mr Joel Joffe, who retired as deputy chairman of Allied Dunbar last year,
said he was disappointed with SIB's review. He said the evidence for
mis-selling was overwhelming and that consumers received bad value for
money.
The Association of British Insurers strongly rebutted Mr Joffe's charges,
describing some of them as 'factually inaccurate'.

FT  07 SEP 92 / DoE sets Pounds 400 council tax goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of the Environment is to open its bidding in the public
spending round on council tax on the basis that the average bill for a home
in the middle property band should be at the Pounds 400 figure produced by
the department last year, Alison Smith writes.
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has estimated that
meeting this target would cost an extra Pounds 2.3bn in government grants to
local authorities. That is calculated without the further cost of a
transitional relief scheme to help those worst affected by the change from
the poll tax to the property-based tax.
The department will call for the bulk of the extra money to come as
government grants to authorities rather than being spent on transitional
relief.
Ministers are keen for the new tax to avoid the unpopularity of the poll
tax. They believe that there is more political mileage from a lower overall
level of bills than from a generous scheme which will help only those
especially badly affected and for only a limited period.
The department will also argue that providing additional funds as grants
instead of transitional relief will ease the potential problem of London and
the south-east having a higher relative tax base than other parts of the UK,
and therefore getting a smaller proportion of grant.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, will return to the department
this week and will assemble the initial bid in the next few days.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Tunnel's cash deadline may be missed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL and contractors building the Channel tunnel appeared unlikely
last night to beat a deadline of tonight for resolving their latest
financial crisis.
Contractors said there were no plans for the two sides to meet, although
that could change following talks in Paris yesterday between bankers and Sir
Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive.
The banks have said they may prevent Eurotunnel drawing further funds for
the project unless agreement is reached quickly over contractors' claims for
more than Pounds 1bn in extra payments. The next Pounds 100m of loans is due
to be drawn on September 30.
Although banks have urged both sides to settle by tonight, Eurotunnel and
contractors believe talks could continue for several days.
Transmanche-Link, a consortium of five British and five French contractors,
says extra cash is needed to meet the increased costs of the project which,
including finance charges, have risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more
than Pounds 8bn.
The dispute could lead to another intervention by the Bank of England, which
has previously acted as a referee in cost disputes between contractors and
Eurotunnel.
Leading banks in the consortium of 206 banks which have agreed to provide
Pounds 6.8bn to Eurotunnel have informed Mr Pen Kent, an associate director
of the Bank of England, of their latest ultimatum.
They stressed yesterday that the Bank was not actively involved in attempts
to find a solution but did not rule out the possibility that Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, might eventually arbitrate.
The latest dispute is over contractors' claims for additional payments of
Pounds 1.2bn at 1985 prices. This includes Pounds 800m to cover the
increased cost of fitting out rail tunnels and building passenger terminals
at Folkestone, Kent, and Sangatte, northern France.
The other Pounds 400m has been claimed to cover higher costs in other parts
of the project, some of which Eurotunnel has already agreed to pay.
In total, Eurotunnel is thought to have offered the equivalent in 1985
prices of an extra Pounds 550m to Pounds 600m in cash and Pounds 200m in
equity, likely to be a convertible debenture. This would make the package
worth Pounds 750m to Pounds 800m. The deal is thought to be about Pounds
150m less than the contractors have indicated they might accept.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Recession forces Airbus to delay
launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS INDUSTRIE, the European aircraft consortium, has been forced to delay
the launch of a smaller derivative of its A320 narrow-body aircraft until
the end of this year, or possibly next year, because of the financial
difficulties of airline customers.
Although the European consortium has launched a marketing campaign with
seven airlines, Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman, said yesterday that
the consortium would not achieve its original target of securing sufficient
commitments for its new A319 airliner by the end of this month.
The A319 is designed to expand the Airbus narrow-body airliner family with a
shortened derivative of the 150-seat A320. Airbus is already developing a
180-seater derivative of this aircraft, the A321.
Mr Pierson acknowledged at the Farnborough Air Show that Airbus had
underestimated the length and breadth of the airline industry recession.
He said: 'Back in January last year, we did not believe the industry would
face such a difficult time.' The industry's problems had been increased by
the continued airline fares war and over-capacity in the market.
Airbus would have to review its production programme before the end of this
year to make the necessary adjustments in the face of the industry's
short-term problems. But it did not expect to be forced to make drastic
production cuts because it had already launched a production adjustment
programme.
It expects to deliver between 163 and 165 new aircraft this year, about the
same as last year. Mr Pierson said sales would show a modest increase from
Dollars 7.4bn in 1991 to Dollars 7.5bn this year. Airbus also expects to
show an operating surplus of around Dollars 250m. By the end of this year
Airbus expects its order backlog to total about 900 aircraft.
Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets and Airbus's
principal competitor, is also being forced to reduce production.
Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's new president, confirmed that the US company
would cut production of its 737 narrow-body jets from 21 to 14 a month next
month and also planned to reduce production of its larger 757 narrow-body
airliner from 8.5 to 7 a month next year.
Boeing had received commitments for 147 airline orders so far this year and
its backlog of firm orders stood at about 1,500 aircraft.
Boeing is also preparing to step up competition in the narrow-body airliner
market by proposing to develop a larger version of the 737 to compete
against the Airbus A320.
Both Boeing and Airbus confirmed they were continuing to study the
development of a 600 to 800-seater jumbo airliner.
The two companies said the launch of such aircraft, not expected before
1997, would depend on market demand. However, many industry executives
believe the development of super jumbos would have to entail significant
international collaboration, including possibly even between Boeing and
Airbus, because of the development costs.
The Farnborough show is open to the public from tomorrow until Sunday.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Patten steps up GCSE attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, educ-ation secretary, yesterday stepped up the pressure on
the schools examinations boards by hinting that he would change the GCSE
exam system if they failed to.
The furore last week about a critical report by the schools inspectorate led
Mr Patten to ask the boards to decide this month on changes to be made to
the marking and grading for next year's GCSEs. The report expressed only
'limited confidence' that standards were being maintained, following GCSE
results showing more than half of all pupils achieving the top three grades.
'The general public would explode in anger if at the end of the month they
came back and said there was nothing wrong at all and that nothing needs to
be changed,' Mr Patten said on LBC radio.
While making clear that he did not control the boards themselves, Mr Patten
highlighted his own 'quite severe' powers to intervene in the system if he
was not satisfied with whatever the boards proposed.
Mr Patten's comments are part of a deliberately tough attitude towards the
boards. 'We tried the 'softly, softly' approach last year, when Mr Tim Eggar
(then education minister) just made a speech urging the boards to pull their
socks up,' an official at Mr Patten's department said. 'But the result was
less than nothing because the results seem to have been worse this year.'
Managers want A-levels replaced with a broader exam covering academic and
vocational subjects, according to a survey published today by the British
Institute of Management, John Willman writes.
A survey of members of the 80,000-strong institute carried out last year
reveals widespread dissatisfaction with the A-level, the principal
examination for school-leavers entering higher education in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland.
Only 15 per cent wanted to retain the present A-level system with 46 per
cent calling for a new integrated programme of academic and vocational
qualifications.
The institute says A-levels waste talent by catering for fewer than 20 per
cent of young people. It calls the exams a barrier to raising overall skill
levels and a wasteful allocation of government spending.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Discrepancies in audit fees reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDIT fees paid by quoted companies over the last year were
substantially higher than those paid by private companies, a survey has
found.
In companies with turnover of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 3bn there was no
difference in fees between public companies and private companies, but in
companies with turnover of less than Pounds 1bn fees for quoted companies
were much higher.
The analysis is based on the audit fees disclosed in the latest sets of
accounts of a sample of 4,000 private companies and more than 200 public
companies by JDH Consultants, a Glasgow-based organisation.
The average audit fee for quoted companies with a turnover of about Pounds
1m was Pounds 9,000, three times the level for private companies. For those
with turnovers of Pounds 10m, the fees were twice those of private companies
at Pounds 22,000 and for those with turnovers of Pounds 100m, fees were
three times the level at Pounds 150,000. For public companies with turnover
of around Pounds 1bn, fees were Pounds 650,000 against Pounds 470,000 for
private companies.
Auditors claim that it is impossible to make comparisons of audit fees based
simply on turnover because so many other factors determine the fee.
However, the study shows a consistent connection between size and fees, and
a clear differentiation between public and private companies.
The survey highlights that there are also wide variations in audit fees
charged by private companies by industrial sector. For companies with sales
of around Pounds 100m, fees were greatest in printing and publishing,
mechanical engineering and textiles, and lowest for the wholesale and retail
trade and food and drink manufacturers.
It also shows the dominance of auditing even in small companies by the
larger accountancy firms. Although there were 1,674 different auditing firms
for the 4,000 private companies, 29 per cent by number and 58 per cent by
fee were controlled by just 12 firms.
Two Midlands accountancy firms are merging to become a regional firm with 16
partners and fee income of about Pounds 6m. Cooper-Parry, Watson, Sowter &amp;
Co, based in Derby, and Prior &amp; Palmer of Nottingham will become
Cooper-Parry, Prior &amp; Palmer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOMBARDIER, the Canadian transport, defence and financial services
conglomerate, has reorganised its aircraft building interests into a single
division, David Boggis writes.
Its new regional aircraft division, announced yesterday at Farnborough, will
market and support the Canadair Regional Jet 50-60 passenger twin and the
Dash 8 30-50 passenger twin-turbo prop.
Bombardier also said it would deliver its first production regional jet in
about six weeks to Lufthansa CityLine, commuter arm of the German airline.
Lufthansa CityLine contracted in 1990 to buy up to 35 regional jets.
The reorganisation enables Bombardier to deal with the regional jet and the
Dash 8 as a single-product range. Mr Robert Wohl, division president, said
there were about 470 orders and options for the regional jet and the Dash 8
from a total of 60 customers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU electrical and engineering union is set to be the first union to
open a stall at the CBI employers' conference in November and three
companies will foot the bill.
Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, said the aim was to promote the
union 'at source'. He added: 'We want to demonstrate the progressive face of
trade unions.'
The move is in line with the union movement's efforts to open dialogue with
employers such as the TUC's unprecedented invitation to Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the CBI, who will address delegates in Blackpool this
week.
The AEEU is understood to have won about Pounds 20,000 in sponsorship from
Centurion, the printing company which specialises in union journals; Fraser
Williams, the computer software company, and Brian Beekes, suppliers of
company cars.
Mr Laird added: 'We will take money from anyone except Gadaffi.'

FT  07 SEP 92 / Move to boost women's pay urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP between the earnings of men and women is set to increase unless the
government forces employers to upgrade women's pay, according to an Equal
Opportunities Commission report published today.
The decline of centralised collective bargaining in many sectors, the
casualisation of the labour market and the introduction of performance pay
in recent years are all working against the closing of the pay gap, the
organisation says. The absence of a statutory minimum wage also continues to
disadvantage women, it adds.
The commission wants to see the existing, highly complex equal-pay
legislation replaced by more simple and more effective laws to require
employers to demonstrate they are not discriminating against women.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, who also has cabinet
responsibility for women's issues, is more sympathetic to the idea of
legislative reform than her recent predecessors.
Women in full-time work earn about 77 per cent of the full-time average
hourly pay of men. The commission argues that an increase of 10 per cent in
women's hourly earnings would result in an increase in the UK's total wage
bill of only 3.1 per cent. This is because women work shorter hours and
receive lower basic pay.
Mrs June Bridgeman, deputy chair of the organisation, said the study showed
it would be good value for money to correct the harmful bias in the way
women's work is valued.
The report concludes that progress in closing the pay gap is unlikely to
come as a result of existing legislation on equal pay and the pursuit of
individual equal-value cases.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Support rattles out for Willis / Examining the unusual
policies of the TUC's second-smallest affiliate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Society of Shuttlemakers will visit the Trades Union Congress this week
to back both Mr Norman Willis, the organisation's embattled general
secretary, and the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran.
The arrival of the shuttlemakers on their first visit to the annual congress
in 50 years of TUC membership is unlikely to create more than the smallest
ripple. With only 17 members, the union is the second-smallest in the TUC,
but continues to guard its independence in an era of large-scale mergers.
Mr Leslie Illingworth, general secretary of the 101-year-old organisation
based in Colne, Lancs, has never heard of Mr John Monks, the TUC deputy
general secretary widely tipped as a successor to Mr Willis.
'There is no reason for Willis to resign,' Mr Illingworth said. 'He's a
decent bloke. He speaks his mind.'
Shuttlemakers produce the wooden devices which drag weft through warp to
weave cloth. The advent of shuttleless looms and the closure of local mills
saw the market for shuttles decline and the union's membership dwindle from
almost 600 in the 1940s to today's meagre total.
The link with the Mujahideen arises because the support of small unions is
sought at every TUC congress by the professionally oppressed. Groups such as
the dissident People's Mujahideen offer small unions a morsel of kudos in
exchange for a back door to possible support from the TUC in the form of a
vote by delegates in favour of the dissidents' case.
The Shuttlemakers were telephoned by the Mujahideen and agreed to add a
clause to a motion submitted by the larger Bakers' Union criticising the
Iranian government's record on human rights.
The union is undeterred by its small size and sees nothing odd in its role.
'A lot of big unions would be quite envious of us,' said Mr Dennis
Horsefield, the union's treasurer - who at 63 is the oldest working member
of the Shuttlemakers. 'They are in over their heads whereas we have got
about Pounds 25,000 in the bank - and we are sticking to our money.'
The shuttlemakers say they do not want to be absorbed by one of the big
unions that would like to swallow them up. They say they have already
rejected advances from the TGWU and GMB general unions. 'What do they know
about shuttlemaking anyway?' says Mr Horsefield.
To sceptics who think the union is as dead as the industry which supports
it, Mr Illingworth says: 'The comical part of it is that everyone has said
such a small union can't last for long, yet over the last nine months we
have been making shuttles at a rate I haven't seen since the 1950s.'

FT  07 SEP 92 / Council to end national bargaining for some
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAMSHIRE County Council is to take 480 manual workers in its direct
service organisation out of national collective pay bargaining arrangements
in a move which will lead to pay cuts for some, Michael Smith writes.
Although other councils have varied terms for small groups of manual
workers, the move to implement a local pay deal for all workers in a DSO is
unusual. The county implemented a local deal for another 800 or so workers
in the DSO earlier this year.
Not all DSO employees will suffer, and the overall pay bill will remain
steady. For example in the landscape gardening department 26 will receive
pay rises, against 12 who will lose.
The rates will take effect from October 1 and be reviewed next year. The
council has reached agreement with Nalgo, the public-services union, but not
with Nupe, the other union involved.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Return of redundancy cash sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOCAL AUTHORITY whose enhanced severance scheme was ruled unlawful by the
High Court is to ask some former employees who volunteered for redundancy to
return part of their payments.
Having failed to reverse last year's test-case court ruling, North Tyneside
Council has now received counsel's opinion that it must act in the fiduciary
interest of its chargepayers by seeking recovery of the payments.
A full meeting of the council on Thursday is expected to decide that it has
to follow its legal advice. The council will have to target selectively
those ex-employees from whom it believes it has the best chance of
recovering sums which merit the effort involved. Unions representing council
workers oppose the move.
The redundancy payments, ranging from a few hundred pounds to about Pounds
12,000, were made almost two years ago.
Enhanced payments were made to 332 volunteers in 1990-91 when the council
faced cuts of Pounds 6.8m because of charge-capping. The scheme was
suspended after a challenge by the district auditor.
Counsel for the district auditor told the High Court that the council had
authorised Pounds 2.54m in payments under the scheme, of which Pounds 1.81m
was without specific statutory authority. Payments were on average about 3
1/2 times as great as the council was authorised to pay.
Mr Brian Flood, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said that the
repayments drive which Mr David Allsop, the district auditor, had required
was 'absolute nonsense'. He said: 'Enhanced redundancy payments are a
recognised management tool throughout private and public enterprise.'
Thursday's meeting will also hear details of a proposed council
restructuring costing up to 1,000 jobs, equivalent to 10 per cent of the
workforce. North Tyneside, which has exhausted its reserves, will face a
deficit of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m in 1993-94.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Check-off rules change could cut membership by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Labour's fourth consecutive election defeat the unions are looking
elsewhere for any scrap of influence they can find - with employers, in the
European Community, and even with the post-Thatcher Conservative party.
But while the unions seek every opportunity to talk to the government there
is not much evidence that anybody in government is listening. There have
been some discreet delegations from the Trades Union Congress to Mrs Gillian
Shephard, employment secretary, and to the Treasury, without obvious
results. The unions were not consulted recently when the government proposed
a shake-up of how industrial tribunals operate.
More important, in spite of Mrs Shephard's claim that the war with the
unions is over, she will this autumn introduce a bill which could be more
devastating in its effect on union membership and finances than anything
produced in the Thatcher years.
The TUC conference in Blackpool will today and tomorrow debate union
legislation past and future. But overhanging that debate will be one jargon
phrase: 'automatic check-off'. Nearly 80 per cent of union members are
covered by check-off, the automatic monthly deduction of union dues from pay
packets by employers.
Almost all employees give initial written permission for the deduction to
take place, and can stop it whenever they wish but there have been some
abuses of the system, especially in the construction industry, which
prompted Mr Michael Howard, when employment secretary, to decide to place
reform of check-off in the bill.
The reform requires each employee to give written permission for check-off
within 12 months of the bill becoming law and subsequently every three
years. Every time a union increases subscriptions the member will have to be
informed.
This may not sound like a revolution but it could cut union membership,
already in sharp decline, by more than 20 per cent at one blow. Professor
Paul Willman of the London Business School, an expert on union finances,
believes that unions could lose around 1m members or 15 per cent of the
total. But when Wandsworth council in south London decided to abolish
check-off for 2,000 members of the local-government union Nalgo, the drop in
membership was closer to 30 per cent.
Regular reconsideration of check-off is tantamount to regular
reconsideration of union membership. Many people who have short-term
grievances against their union will now have an easy way to withdraw.
Check-off has grown quickly since it was introduced in the 1960s, and now
covers about three quarters of union members with the rest paying via direct
bank debit or to a shop steward. Some public-sector unions such as Nupe have
almost 100 per cent of their members on check-off, and the two big general
unions, the GMB and the TGWU, both have more 90 per cent.
They all stand to be badly affected by drop-outs. Even worse hit will be
unions which have a transient membership such as Usdaw, the shopworkers
union, which recruits many part-time workers. After painful rationalisation
most of the big unions are now back in the black, but the change may push
many back into the red and may give another twist to economy-driven union
mergers.
The best placed unions will be those such as Bifu, the banking union, which
has more than 50 per cent of its staff on direct debit. Other unions will
try to follow Bifu's example.
Employers have shown no great enthusiasm for the change, and the Engineering
Employers' Federation has actually opposed it. as Many employers hold the
money on deposit for unions for quite long periods, earning useful interest.
But some officials fear that the slowly increasing number of employers
considering union de-recognition will find it easier to push ahead if
check-off, a symbol of employer acceptance of unions, is constantly being
called into question.

FT  07 SEP 92 / BR to revive old routes to London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL is working on plans for a package of new rail services linking
the south and west Midlands with London from May next year.
One proposal is likely to put the expanding town of Kidderminster in
Hereford and Worcester on the InterCity map for the first time.
Another will see the re-introduction of direct passenger services between
London and Birmingham on the old Great Western Railway line through High
Wycombe and Banbury.
The plan to give Kidderminster an InterCity link with London is unexpected
because it comes when other InterCity services, such as those to Shrewsbury,
Cleethorpes and Blackpool, are being cut.
BR is understood to be planning one InterCity 125 service early each morning
from Kidderminster to London Paddington via Worcester and Oxford with a
return service each evening.
In addition, Regional Railways and Network SouthEast plan to run one of BR's
new Networker Turbo express trains from Birmingham Snow Hill to
Kidderminster, Worcester, Oxford and London Paddington each morning, with a
return trip in the afternoon.
Kidderminster's InterCity service will be at the expense of one of the two
daily InterCity services running each way between Hereford and London.
In its place, Hereford passengers will be provided with a Sprinter train
connecting with the Kidderminster service at Worcester. BR also plans to
increase direct links between Hereford and London by introducing some of its
new Networker Turbo express trains to the route.
Regional Railways said of BR's other big innovation - reviving through
services on the former Great Western line - that it expected the services to
make money in spite of the recession. 'We are in the business of starting
services up, not closing them down.'
The line fell into disuse for through services after the electrification of
the alternative route running from London Euston to Birmingham New Street
through Rugby and Coventry. Now, Regional Railways and Network SouthEast
plan to introduce four trains a day each way between Birmingham Snow Hill
and London Marylebone using Networker Turbo express trains.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Travelling without let or hindrance: The new technological
rigours behind relaxed passport controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW technology and initiatives to ease border controls could make Her
Britannic Majesty's demand - inscribed in every British passport - for
passage 'without let or hindrance' a thing of the past.
From one end of the European Community to another, frontier formalities are
being lifted. Brussels is encouraging member states to allow unhindered
travel without officials giving even a cursory glance at passports.
Britain will not be so accommodating. The government last week reserved the
right to scrutinise documents at British ports of entry, although it has
pledged to relax controls on EC nationals.
Community officials are trying to solve the British dilemma: how EC citizens
can be identified without queues and delays at passport desks.
Travel industry analysts say the problem offers Britain the opportunity to
use new technology to ease immigration procedures not only for Community
nationals but also for frequent visitors from countries such as the US and
Japan.
Mr Dan White, an analyst for County NatWest, said the Home Office should
pursue a scheme pioneered at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, where passengers
can avoid queues by using 'smart cards' which can be read by computers.
Dutch travellers who use the airport at least five times a year can opt for
a card containing passport and fingerprint details. The software could be
installed at any EC airport.
BAA, the UK airports operator, is discussing the introduction of such
systems with the Home Office but says it could be some time before 'smart
cards' are available to British travellers.
Immigration officials are also looking at a US scheme which is due to
undergo tests at New York's JFK and Newark airports next month. It relies on
biometric technology, which stores the 'hand geography' of frequent
travellers.
At US immigration passports of computer-registered passengers will be
scanned, while a second system will read their palms to verify that the
passport is not being used by another person. The new European Community
passports will be compatible with this system.
The scheme could cut waiting times at airports, but British officials
believe it would be costly and difficult to introduce at sea ports.
The Home Office is co-operating with a separate US initiative to ease
congestion for airline passengers crossing the Atlantic. From next year all
passengers from London's Heathrow or Gatwick airports to the US will pass
through US immigration before leaving Britain.
US Immigration and Naturalisation Service officials will 'admit' passengers
to the US before they depart. The move is based on a scheme launched at
Shannon in the Irish Republic in 1988 and follows extensive tests in the UK
last year.
The scheme has prompted calls for reciprocal arrangements in the US for
travellers flying to Heathrow airport, where the arrival of several
transatlantic flights between 7am and 9am can lead to delays at passport
control.
'We'd like to see the same pre-inspection immigration in the US,' said Mr
Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of Frequent Flier, the New York magazine.
'There are a lot of complaints about Heathrow,' he added. 'The lines can be
impossible and Paris can also be nasty. We haven't seen advances that should
have been in place five or six years ago. Only Frankfurt seems to be
efficient.'
In London, minimum standards introduced by the Home Office for passport
control show that US passengers will continue to face longer delays than
their EC counterparts. The targets suggest that non-EC passengers should
wait no longer than 10 minutes at immigration while EC citizens can expect a
three-minute wait.
The Home Office said it would consider proposals to pre-inspect passports of
UK-bound passengers in the US. But an airline would have to apply for such a
scheme before formal negotiations could begin.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Consumer confidence 'has sunk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER confidence in Britain has 'collapsed' in the four months since the
Conservatives' election victory, and household spending intentions are at a
lower level than at any time in the past 18 months according to a survey to
be issued today.
PA Cambridge Economic Consultants says in its latest quarterly survey of
household economic confidence that the main uncertainty undermining consumer
confidence appears to be the fear of increased interest rates.
'This has extremely serious implications for the prospects of an upturn in
consumers' expenditure,' the private-sector economic research group says.
'The very fact that an increase is possible is enough to dampen the
likelihood of a recovery in consumption this year. If interest rates are
forced up in practice, the implications for economic recovery could be even
more severe.'
The survey was unveiled as Labour launched a fresh attack on Mr John Major's
'seven broken promises' since election predictions of an early end to
recession.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the seven promises included the
promises of a post-election economic recovery and of a 'classless society'.
Mr Major had also pledged an end to most home repossessions and provision of
places on Youth Training and Work Experience schemes along with extra
spending on a range of public services.
The Tories, he said, were guilty of a 'breach of trust with the electorate',
and even their own supporters had become disillusioned.
The 'broken promises' theme will dominate the opposition's campaigning over
the autumn, with the message being taken to constituencies as well as being
driven home in Westminster.
'Ministers must now admit they misled the public and tell us how they will
change policy to honour their promises,' Mr Brown said.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Society chief criticises Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Britain's second-largest building society yesterday criticised
the government for lacking a housing policy and urged it to intervene with
radical measures to revive the flagging housing market.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said
on Channel 4 that he believed the market had bottomed out and would
eventually right itself. He added that government assistance would help to
speed the recovery in the housing market and thereby stimulate the economy
as a whole.
There was also a 'golden opportunity' to remove some of the anomalies that
were partly responsible for the present difficulties in the market.
Mr Melville-Ross proposed a mortgage benefit - comparable to housing benefit
 -for homeowners on low incomes, an increase in mortgage tax relief for
first-time buyers and ways to stimulate the rentals market.
He suggested that mortgage benefit might be tapered according to income
rises alongside housing benefit, which is available to lowincome tenants
still in employment.
He said that would 'solve a lot of problems for many people whose mortgages
are currently in arrears who have found that they are just unable to cope.'
Mr Melville-Ross also proposed mortgage tax relief for first-time buyers for
a limited period in order to encourage entrants to the market. He said the
current tax relief, which applies regardless of income level, should be
restructured to target more first-time buyers and those who actually need
it.
He also suggested measures to revive the private-rented sector, such as
arrangements that would make it more attractive for institutions to provide
rented housing.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Installations up again: FT Satellite Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1m homes have acquired satellite television in the past year
bringing the total for those able to receive multi-channel television to
just over 3m according to the FT Satellite Monitor.
It estimates that 73,000 satellite TV systems were sold or rented last month
compared with 58,000 in July. Sales and rentals in August last year ran at
about 12,000 a week.
There are 2.54m homes in the UK in which a satellite dish is owned or rented
according to the monitor. Moreover, Independent Television Commission
figures show satellite channels are received in 552,000 homes through cable
networks and communal aerials. Since 1989 satellite availability has grown
from one in 50 homes to one in seven.
The increase in sales last month is likely to have been linked with an offer
on Sky Sports which has exclusive rights to Premier League football games
and which has become a subscription channel. Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a stake in British Sky Broadcasting, which shows Sky television
channels.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Morocco votes to reform constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RABAT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOROCCO has over-whelmingly endorsed constitutional reforms aimed at
liberalising one of the Moslem world's oldest monarchies, where all power
has traditionally been vested in the head of state.
However, the size of the majority officially reported - up to 100 per cent
in some areas - is likely to be met with some scepticism abroad.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, 99.96 per cent of the vote in
Friday's referendum endorsed the reforms. This rose to 100 per cent in the
main cities. The ministry also reported that three of the four Western
Saharan provinces, which, though occupied by Morocco since Spain left in
1976, are not recognised as Moroccan by the United Nations and the main
western powers, also voted 100 per cent in favour.
This comes even though leading opposition parties called on their supporters
to abstain and the two main trade unions urged a No votes.
The 100 per cent figures smack of eastern Europe before the fall of
communism, and, in the Western Sahara, such figures could make UN efforts to
implement plans for a referendum even more difficult.
As for Morocco's well-wishers abroad, they can only be embarrassed. While
the country has travelled a long way towards modernising its economy, the
need for a more modern political systemis pressing. King Hassan is well
aware of that need, but his powerful minister of the interior, Mr Driss
Basri, may not have helped by providing such neatly tailored results.
Nevertheless, the referendum was considered by many Moroccans as a trial run
for three elections due in the next few months: for local councils, and
professional bodies (which provide a third of all members of parliament),
and then a general election.
The reforms would not turn Morocco into a western-style constitutional
monarchy, but King Hassan has indicated he wants to delegate some powers in
recognition of changes in the kingdom over the past 20 years, requiring a
more modern political machine.
The new constitution requires Moroccan governments to reflect the balance of
forces in parliament and submit their programme to a vote of confidence. his
New laws will automatically be promulgated a month after they are approved
by parliament rather than await the monarch's approval, which some never got
or got only belatedly.
The new constitution has a strong commitment to human rights, but the
unofficial Moroccan human rights organisation, Organisation Marocaine des
Droits de l'Homme, says there are still at least 300 political prisoners.
The authorities deny this.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Devaluation candidates if the ERM realigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S finance ministers are adamant. There are no plans for a realignment
of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism. But the markets
have not been convinced, as the weakness of sterling and the lira and the
very high level of Italian interest rates demonstrates. If a realignment
makes no sense, why are the markets so nervous? And if it would help, why
are finance ministers so stubborn?
The currency markets are old hands at the devaluation game. They know that
most devaluations lead directly to higher inflation. And while commitment to
the ERM parities is supposed to preclude the inflation option, the markets
also know that inflation is the normal escape route for economies saddled
with heavy public or private debts.
Yet the exchange rate is not solely a tool for monetary policy. The
interaction of the exchange rate and the level of domestic prices also
determines industrial and export competitiveness and profitability. If the
internationally fixed price of a traded good is DM2.95 or Pounds 1, but the
domestic price of labour and other non-traded inputs needed to make it is
Pounds 1.20, then the manufacturer will be unprofitable and will go out of
business. This ratio of non-traded goods prices, largely wages, to traded
goods prices is known as the real exchange rate.
Too high a real exchange rate spells trouble. But what is too high?
Measuring competitiveness is a tricky business. But the two charts offer an
unscientific attempt to discover which countries currently have a
competitiveness problem within Europe.
The left-hand chart shows two indicators of industrial profitability: the
fall in producer prices relative to overall consumer prices and the rate of
return on capital over the period 1987-1991. The dashed line shows the
weighted European average for each measure.
Below average spells competitiveness problems: and the UK is the only
country which has depressed profitability on both measures. UK producer
prices have fallen by 6.3 per cent relative to consumer prices since 1987
compared with 4.5 per cent in France and only 1.5 per cent in Germany,
implying a tighter squeeze on the profits of UK manufacturers. Italy has a
similar fall in relative traded prices but a higher level of business
profitability. Spain's high rate of manufacturing productivity growth
explains both its high profit rate and the fall in traded goods prices
relative to less productive services.
Depressed profitability can lead to a shrunken manufacturing sector and
persistent trade problems. Germany's profitable manufacturing sector is
large and delivers above-average trade surpluses as a percentage of gross
domestic product as the right-hand chart shows. But the UK, Italy and France
have smaller manufacturing sectors and persistent trade deficits relative to
the European average.
The UK and Italy, and possibly France, probably needed a real exchange rate
devaluation in the late 1980s. But France, unlike the UK or Italy, has been
suffering slow economic and real wage growth for a number of years in order
to reduce the relative price of non-traded goods and rectify its
competitiveness. France has eschewed the alternative: a rise in the relative
price of traded goods via a devaluation, because of the risks of re-igniting
inflation. The UK and Italy still have all the pain to come. And devaluation
is a tempting risk. But do not tell the markets.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Collor fiddles while public opinion burns: Brazil's
president remains impervious to demands that he quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY can fault Brazilian President Fernando Collor for determination.
Since the publication two weeks ago of a congressional report accusing him
and his family of receiving millions of dollars from an influence-peddling
racket, Mr Collor has remained impervious to huge street demonstrations and
demands for his resignation from lawyers, intellectuals, business
organisations, bishops, trade unions, students and leading newspapers.
Last week, as impeachment proceedings began, a poll indicated that 69 per
cent of the population no longer trust him. The Brazilian Karate Association
even wants to strip him of his black belt.
Despite such isolation, Mr Collor remains ensconced in his office on the
third floor of the modernist presidential palace, tenaciously clinging to
power as if sheer force of will can save him. In the last 67 years, only one
civilian president has ever finished his mandate.
Such is Mr Collor's bravado that he is insisting on attending today's
Independence Day parade even if he has to travel by helicopter and reach the
platform through a tunnel to avoid contact with the public.
So nonchalant does the 43-year-old former playboy seem that observers
conclude that he must either be supremely arrogant or is failing to grasp or
believe what is happening. Ministers say that he refuses to read the papers
and last week he described the situation to Argentine television as
'absolutely normal'.
Mr Collor's cabinet is less confident. The group of so-called 'ethical
ministers,' led by Economy Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira, is now
referred to as the 'Politburo,' having effectively wrested power, signing a
pact of governability to ensure the running of the administration while the
crisis continues.
Mr Collor has formed a political team comprising a group of people
frequently portrayed as gangsters by Brazilian cartoonists. They include Mr
Ricardo Fiuza, a well known political operator and the social action
minister, Mr Eraldo Tinoco, the education minister, and the presidents of
the state-owned Banco do Brasil and the National Savings Bank. Their task is
to win the support of 168 congressmen, the number Mr Collor requires to
withstand impeachment in the vote expected to take place in the next six
weeks.
While the ethical ministers try to maintain a tight grip on treasury
coffers, Mr Fiuza has been spending. Last month alone he directed Cr59.1bn
(Pounds 6m) to projects in municipalities where congressmen are standing as
candidates in next month's elections. With no new money available under the
government's austerity plan, funds are instead being 'redirected' from other
ministries. Economy Ministry officials admit that, in the last two months,
Cr6,000bn has been redirected.
There is little attempt to mask this strategy. At a dinner of congressmen
last week, Mr Collor crudely promised to 'benefit later those who support me
now.' His time is spent breakfasting, lunching, dining and cajoling the very
type of porkbarrel politicians that he always said he detested. To avoid
photographers they are smuggled in and out of Mr Collor's bunker in the
palace through a side door or tunnel.
Nearby, in the offices of the Attorney General,staff are sifting through
40,000 cheques and other documents, to decide whether a criminal process
should be started.
Perhaps the most important focus of attention is the Army Ministry. The
current crisis is the first this century in which the military has not
intervened, but the forces' insistence on sticking to a constitutional
solution may be weakened if the crisis is prolonged.

<TEXT>
SOME 2,300 employees at a General Motors' metal-stamping plant in Ohio were
back at work yesterday after the leading US motor vehicles group reached an
agreement with the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union to end a nine-day
strike.
The end of the strike, perceived by some Wall Street analysts as a test of
GM's ability to cut staff and costs, came with less drama than might have
been expected.
Ms Linda Cook, a GM spokeswoman, said GM's key concession was to agree to
keep a tool-and-dye shop at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant operating until
January 1994 rather than to close it down this autumn. The tool-and-dye shop
employs 180 people.
The ending of the strike means that car assembly operations, employing
nearly 43,000 GM workers at nine plants across the US, will begin
functioning again this week. GM had shut down the plants because of a
shortage of components caused by the strike.
The first car assembly plants - manufacturing the Saturn model and some
Pontiac and Chevrolet models - will begin running again tomorrow .
The UAW said a skeleton crew was back in the Lordstown facility by Saturday
evening. Agreement between the UAW and GM had been reached just after 1
o'clock on Saturday morning.
GM, which made a Dollars 4.5bn loss last year, wants to close a series of
plants in the US and remove 74,000 jobs from its workforce to slash costs.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Israeli budget proposals attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S central bank yesterday delivered a sharp attack on the Labour-led
government's 1993 budget plan - its first broad economic policy initiative
since coming to power in July - saying the proposals lacked the right
measures to stimulate growth and employment in the immigration-burdened
economy.
Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, was released from hospital where
he was being treated for a leg infection to present his Shk98bn (Pounds
20bn) budget to the cabinet. It is meant to shift the emphasis laid by the
previous Likud government on construction - especially in Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories - towards increasing employment in the private
sector within Israel 'proper' where unemployment is running at more than 11
per cent.
A package of proposals for significant structural reforms, including
liberalisation in the capital markets, the import regime and the state's
monopoly in telecommunications, was also presented to ministers. The budget
encompasses a Shk800m tax cut and a modest shift to greater spending on
infrastructure.
But Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the Bank of Israel, told the cabinet
it did not go far enough. 'A greater increase of investments in
infrastructure, additional tax reductions which will increase employment in
the business sector and additional investments in human infrastructure by
increasing education budgets are required,' he said. 'In the budget
submitted today there is no satisfactory concentration of such steps.'
Mr Frenkel said the government should be willing to cut the welfare and
defence budgets to finance extra investment. Both areas, which together make
up almost half of government expenditure, were largely untouched in Mr
Shochat's proposals. Nonetheless, leftist members of the government attacked
the budget for not allocating more to social spending.
They also called for deeper cuts on spending next year on Jewish settlements
which is estimated to total around Shk2.5bn, mainly on housing envisaged by
the previous government.
Mr Shochat's reform proposals included: abandoning preferential government
bonds issued to trade union pension funds; breaking the monopoly of Bezeq,
the state telecommunications company, on international telephone links and
mobile phones, and freeing imports of petrol and meat.

FT  07 SEP 92 / 'Open skies' accord could set trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'open skies' agreement between the US and the Netherlands reached on
Friday should be a mould-breaking accord and a model for future aviation
pacts.
It is expected to intensify the controversy in Europe over negotiation of
future bilateral aviation agreements with the US.
Instead of the usual bilateral restrictions on destinations to which
carriers can fly, KLM, the Netherlands' flagship carrier, for example
essentially gains authority to fly into any US city. US carriers will be
offered unrestricted access to any Dutch destination.
Mr Andrew Card, the new US transportantion secretary, described it as 'a
very significant event in international aviation' while 'a dream treaty' was
the description from Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, the Dutch transport minister.
But while this may not be the last 'open skies' agreement signed in the near
future, there now seems little likelihood that a host of similar deals will
follow - especially with more significant European nations.
Relations between the US and France on aviation reached a low ebb this
summer as the French demanded tighter control on US carriers' insatiable
appetite for international access.
The position with Germany is broadly similar.
British Airways, the UK's flagship carrier, currently stands accused of
sneaking around bilateral restrictions with its plan to invest Dollars 750m
in USAir, a sizable US domestic carrier, in return for a minority stake.
'Open skies' has been a clarion call in US aviation policy for many months.
It has, however, been prompted by self-interest rather than high-minded
principle. As US airlines know to their cost, travel within the domestic
market is depressed.
The big US carriers such as American, United and Delta have spent hundreds
of millions of dollars acquiring international route authorities. And, for
once, luck was on the buyers' side: financial problems at the likes of Pan
Am and Trans World Airlines turned these airlines - once flagships for the
US industry abroad - into forced sellers.
But the large surviving US airlines would like to do more than merely take
over the routes which their ailing brethen used to serve. The obstacle is
restrictive bilateral agreements which govern the access of airlines to
non-domestic markets. Hence, the pressure for 'open skies'.
The US transportation department a month ago summarised the key provisions
of 'open skies' as:
Open entry and unrestricted capacity or frequency on all routes - including
the right to operate services between any point in the US and any point in
the relevant foreign country.
Flexible fare-setting arrangements.
Liberal charter and cargo arrangements.
Open code-sharing opportunties and non-discriminatory access to computer
reservation systems.
The right of any carrier to run its own handling operations at the overseas
airport.
The ability to convert and remit overseas earnings.
However, the DoT's final order then muddied the waters. First, government
officials suggested that 'depending on the characteristics of a particular
bilateral relationship, we might find that additional elements beyond those
listed ..would have to be included'.
Second, they said that they would assess case-by-case whether each criterion
had to be present for an 'open skies' relationship to exist.
Some industry watchers view these qualifications as a disappointment. 'The
entire effort to develop a firm definition of open skies appears to have
been a waste of time,' said Avmark, the US-based aviation consultancy,
'since decisions will still be made on a case-by-case basis, permitting
flexible interpretion of the eleven points, and taking into account other
factors, such as airline ownership and control.'
The thorny matter of foreign ownership is, in fact, left out on the 'open
skies' definition altogether. At present, US rules limit foreigners to a 25
per cent voting interest in any US carrier, although equity stakes of up 49
per cent can be held without automatically being deemed foreign control.
Some parties had urged the DoT to make liberal ownership provisions part of
any 'open skies' agreeement. But, again, the DoT fudged: 'We feel that the
best way to proceed is to address these matters on a case-by-case basis,' it
said.
Yet, in the light of the BA-USAir plan, it seems that ownership and control
are becoming the relevant subjects.
US carriers, having read the fine details of the BA investment agreement,
note that its board presence would allow it to block all key decisions to be
made by USAir - its annual budget, for example, or big capital expenditures.
Moreover, they contend, if BA is allowed to make the purchase, this
'controlling interest' in USAir, the British government will have no
incentive to negotiatea more liberal bilateral agreement. If the nation's
only major airline has effective access to the US market, why should it be
moved to grant US carriers be granted additional inroads into the UK?
BA retorts that this is all anti-competitive, driven by the Big Three's
desire to maintain dominance in their domestic market and starve USAir -
debt-burdened and lossmaking - of new capital.
The European commission is pressing for development of a common European
external aviation policy to coincide with the European single market next
year, and to enable the EC to negotiate as a block aviation accords with
other industrial blocks like the US and Japan.
But EC officials have warned that unilateral action by some member countries
risks undermining this move towards a common aviation policy. They also fear
some member states may negotiate new bilaterals with the US, which may be
favourable to their national flag-carriers but would weaken the broader
interests of the Community at large.
Meanwhile, the DoT has yet to rule on the BA/USAir deal - indeed, it has not
even determined a procedure for the decision-making.
The skies may be opening in Holland, but elsewhere the clouds are just
gathering.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Tajikistan torn apart by communal war: Weapons flow freely
to criminal groups
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAJIKISTAN, the former Soviet Union's poorest republic, is being torn apart
by communal warfare and political and economic chaos.
In Kurgan-Tyube, an agricultural region in the south, communal fighting
rages, while in the capital Dushanbe, President Rakhmon Nabiyev has gone
into hiding in an attempt to avert the latest effort to topple him. In the
north and south, independent armies have formed as central authority has
crumbled. Weapons flow freely over the Afghan border to Tajik political
groups and crime syndicates.
In the south-east, dairy farmers are reportedly dumping milk into rivers
because a fuel shortage stops them getting it to market. 'Everybody comes
here and nobody helps us,' says Mrs Tamara Ramkin, who lives 300 yards from
the centre of fighting in Kurgan-Tyube, a region of 80,000 people. 'Take us
with you. They have even closed the hospital. Today a woman had to give
birth in the basement here.'
Residents say they were without milk, bread or fuel for three days last
week.
Today, Tajikistan's parliament will try to end the latest crisis. Opposition
leaders trying to dislodge Mr Nabiyev believe that while he is unlikely to
resign, they will muster enough votes to transfer his powers to the
parliament and council of ministers.
Constitutionally Mr Nabiyev will be president until he quits. Even if the
opposition succeeds, transfer of power is unlikely to end the chaos.
For the second time this year, the opposition has tried to seize power. The
first stand-off, which left scores dead, ended in May when Mr Nabiyev
surrendered eight of the most powerful jobs in his 24-member cabinet to
opponents. Trouble resumed immediately with the communal war in
Kurgan-Tyube, in which 2,000 people have died since May.
The opposition, a coalition of Democratic and Islamic parties, has succeeded
only in running Mr Nabiyev out of his palace and pushing back his militia in
Kurgan-Tyube.
Since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, Tajikistan has struggled to
recover its Persian, Islamic past. It is a struggle to defeat entrenched
communism and to overcome fears among potential foreign investors and donors
that its religious liberalisation presages an extremist government.
There is a regional issue as well. Concerned about arms flowing from
Afghanistan, Moscow and three central Asian republics last week vowed to
take 'any necessary steps' to prevent Tajikistan from plunging into civil
war.
The fighting has begun to isolate the nation of 5m people who share a
1,100-mile border with China and Afghanistan. In July, the neighbouring
republic of Uzbekistan halted flights to Tajikistan.
Mr Nabiyev, Tajikistan's ex-communist party boss, is popularly blamed for
his country's problems. His support has dropped steadily since he won
election last November with 60 per cent of the vote. Today, he has broad
support in only one of Tajikistan's five regions, Kulyab. The republic's
economy shrank 13 per cent in the first quarter of this year and 20 per cent
in the second. The fuel shortage has raised the price of what petrol can be
found to five times the Moscow level.
In the Pamir mountain region, hospitals have closed, according to reports
from the area. Lorries carrying fresh produce, such as grain and milk, are
finding it impossible to reach remote regions.
Aside from troops from the Commonwealth of Independent States, there is no
security force in Dushanbe. Robberies and kidnappings have surged. Two
regions have formed their own security forces.
Mr Nabiyev's native region, industrial Leninabad, has taken control of
central government offices in the north and set up a 2,000-strong army. Mr
Nabiyev has formed a militia in Kulyab. The force is now fighting in
Kurgan-Tyube, led by Mr Safarov Sangak who, before his current job, spent 23
years in jail.
In Kurgan-Tyube, the streets are deserted. Sniper fire whistles overhead.
Tartar and Tajik women wail they have no part in the war. 'What did I do?'
one asks. 'Why am I guilty?'

FT  07 SEP 92 / Whisky sales push ouzo makers to seek markets in Europe:
Confidence is returning to the larger producers as exports find their way
onto more supermarket shelves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is nothing as Greek as ouzo, the aniseed flavoured fiery liquor which
is the traditional drink of the country. But there is nothing modern Greeks
like better than whisky, and that has stimulated the ouzo industry to seek
new markets in Europe.
A surge in whisky drinking over the past decade has transformed the Greek
spirits market, traditionally dominated by ouzo and locally produced brandy.
The Greeks are now among the world's largest per capita consumers of whisky,
and drink considerably more vodka and other imported spirits than they used
to.
Ouzo accounts for just over 30 per cent of liquor sales, down from 70 per
cent in the mid-1980s. Another 30 per cent is covered by whisky, followed by
vodka and gin.
A recent study by Icap, a Greek market research company, found that ouzo
consumption in Greece dropped to 13.6m litres in 1991 from 24.3m litres five
years earlier. Small ouzo producers who relied on bulk sales or were unable
to distribute outside a regional network suffered most from the change in
drinking habits.
However, there is returning confidence among larger ouzo producers. Not only
is their product now recognised abroad as exclusively Greek, but their
request to retain a reduced VAT rate was upheld in last month's provisional
European Community agreement on indirect taxation.
Exports have shot up, mainly to Germany where ouzo is no longer drunk only
by expatriate workers from Greece and Turkey, or in the country's 6,000
Greek restaurants. Ouzo is on the shelves of a number of large supermarket
chains.
In addition, Greece's export promotion board has financed a Dr200m (Pounds
578,000) advertising campaign this summer to promote ouzo in Germany. But,
after consultation with ouzo-makers, the campaign's designers were careful
to avoid the 'blue sea and bouzouki music' imagery associated with Greece.
'There is only so far you can go with a tourist souvenir product. We're more
interested in positioning ouzo in its own right, as a unique drink,' says Mr
Dimitris Papazimouris, brand manager of Ouzo 12, the leading ouzo
manufacturer.
Last year, 10.3m bottles of ouzo were sold in Germany, a sharp rise from
5.6m three years ago. Germany now absorbs 70 per cent of ouzo exports, while
other traditional markets, mainly the US and Australia, show little change.
The turn towards exports even extends to a traditional ouzo producer on the
remote Greek island of Lesvos. The Distillers' Union of Mytilene (Epom) is
spending Dr200m on a new production line for its ouzo plant.
After several years of rapid sales growth in the Athens area, where
competition is fierce among ouzo manufacturers, Epom plans to boost exports.
It hopes it will be able to carve out a niche in an expanding ouzo market in
northern Europe.
Epom's turnover doubled to Dr1.3bn over the past three years, largely as a
result of selling directly to cafes and restaurants in Greece. Mr Nikos
Kalamidiotis, sales director, says: 'If we can keep up with the big mainland
producers, we can certainly sell more abroad, where quality is appreciated
and margins are much higher.'
Lesvos has a reputation for producing good quality ouzo with a distinctive
aroma that comes from flavouring with mountain-grown aniseed. Some Greek
distillers claim that ouzo, exported to France in the late 19th century,
inspired the invention of other aniseed-flavoured aperitifs, such as Pernod.
Epom, owned by 17 local ouzo-making families, developed a brand much lighter
than traditional ouzo, with an alcohol content of 36 per cent. Most ouzos
are over 40 per cent alcohol.
'We may have an edge in quality, but our disadvantage is in being 18 hours'
sailing time from Athens. We have to keep much bigger alcohol stocks in case
of transport problems. Overall, our production costs are about 5 per cent
higher,' Mr Kalamidiotis says.
There are other obstacles to expansion. Getting permission to extend the
Epom factory on the outskirts of Mytilene, the island's capital, is
time-consuming because it is built over the ruins of the ancient port.
The stainless steel vats for storing alcohol cannot be kept underground
because of objections by the archaeological service.
At the other end of the scale, Ouzo 12, with a 40 per cent share of the
domestic ouzo market, was acquired last year for Dollars 40m by Grand
Metropolitan, the British food, drinks and retailing group which already
owns Metaxa, the leading Greek brandy producer.
A relaunch for Ouzo 12 is planned for next year, both in Greece and across
Europe. The company's elderly copper stills are being transferred from its
factory in Thebes in central Greece to a new computer-controlled distillery
at the Metaxa plant in Athens.
As a result of gaining access to an international distribution network, Ouzo
12 sales have already grown in the rest of the European Community. Last
year, over 1m bottles were sold in western Europe, mainly in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Britain.
Mr Papazimouris says: 'We think that ouzo has the potential to become an
international brand. With the right support, there's no reason why it
shouldn't become as popular as tequila.'

Borsellino and Mr Giovani Falcone, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Mr Madonia
has been wanted by police since 1984. The Madonia family controls the city
of Gela in Sicily. Yesterday, police said Mr Madonia was probably number two
in the Cosa Nostra hierarchy.

Venezuela's economy posted 8.5 per cent real growth in the first half of
1992, against the same period last year, the state planning ministry
Cordiplan said, writes Joe Mann in Caracas. At the current rate of growth,
Caracas expects economic expansion for the year to exceed its 4-5 per cent
estimate. The private sector grew 15.5 per cent, with construction up 33.8
per cent, distribution of goods up 22.8 per cent, and industry up 14.2 per

INTERNATIONAL mediators have given Bosnian Serbs until next weekend to place
their heavy weapons around four key Bosnian cities under UN control, they
said yesterday. The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, who are
chairing a new international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia,
issued their statement in Geneva.
They called on Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic to 'honour the
seven-day deadline by concentrating the weapons concerned at notified
locations around the four cities' - Sarajevo, Gorazde, Bihac and Jajce. In
Sarajevo yesterday, the 380,000 inhabitants were trapped without water
supplies while the humanitarian airlift to the Bosnian capital stays
suspended.
Mortar shells destroyed a truck at a UN supply warehouse and UN officials
said it seemed the relief effort was being deliberately targeted. Doctors in
Sarajevo said cholera and hepatitis had broken out. People collected
rainwater after water supplies were cut off on Saturday.
Snow fell in the city, warning of an early winter. The last lifeline to the
Bosnian capital was severed on Thursday when an Italian aid flight crashed
west of the city. UN teams are trying to determine if the aircraft was shot
down. UN officials said food supplies were extremely low in the city, where
six people were killed on Saturday.

Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
The Yugoslav delegation, representing Serbia and Montenegro, rejected the
condemnation, saying the movement had 'changed the document after adoption'.
Before the final draft, the communique had not singled out the Serbs as
responsible for ethnic cleansing. The Yugoslavs called the changes
'deplorable', insisting 'all three sides to the conflict, including Croats
and Moslems in Bosnia-Hercegovina, are involved in such practices'. Some
member states want to expel Yugoslavia. Croatia, Slovenia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina re-applied for full or observer status.

<TEXT>
VIETNAM'S dispute with China over maritime boundaries has worsened, with
Hanoi accusing Beijing at the weekend of establishing an illegal drilling
platform to explore for oil in Vietnamese waters in the Gulf of Tonkin.
China and Vietnam restored 'normal' relations in November after years of
tension, but the rapprochement was quickly soured by territorial disputes on
land and at sea.
In May, China signed an agreement with Crestone Energy of the US to explore
for oil in an area of the South China Sea between Vietnam and Malaysia and
1,000km south of the Chinese island of Hainan. Vietnam said the zone was on
its continental shelf.
The latest dispute concerns a Chinese rig and seismic survey ships working
off the northern Vietnamese province of Thai Binh in the Gulf of Tonkin.
'I think China will have to respond to the Vietnamese requests for an
immediate halt to the oil-drilling and other activities in Vietnam's
territorial waters,' Mr Le Mai, Vietnamese deputy foreign minister, told
Reuters at the non-aligned summit in Jakarta.
Asked if Vietnam would use force, he said: 'We do not want to seem as if we
are preparing for confrontation. The question of territorial sovereignty is
sacred to every nation.'
On Saturday the Chinese foreign ministry said the Chinese ships were
exploring in waters under Chinese jurisdiction. 'This is not something new,
but the continuation of the oil exploration that has been going on there for
quite some time,' it said.
Even if Hanoi wanted to retaliate, Vietnam's navy is apparently too weak to
mount operations against Chinese incursions or deter further encroachments.
Instead, Vietnam is seeking common cause with other countries concerned
about possible Chinese expansionism.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Russia takes hard line in Kuriles dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a breakthrough on the Kurile Islands row between Japan and Russia
were further dampened yesterday when Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned
Japan not to expect him to hand back any of the islands when he visits Tokyo
next week.
Failure to resolve the problem has become a stumbling block in efforts to
improve ties. Japan has refused to contemplate large economic aid to Russia
until it recognises Japanese sovereignty over the four islands. Mr Yeltsin
was speaking on Japanese TV via a satellite link-up. An international report
on the Kuriles plumps for transfer of the islands to Japan. The report was
written by experts drawn from Russia, Japan and the US, co-chaired by
academics from each of the three countries.
It has no official status, but all three chairmen, Prof Graham Allison of
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, Prof Hiroshi Kimura of the
International Research Centre for Japanese Studies at Kyoto, and Dr
Konstantin Sarkisov, head of the Russian Centre for Japanese Studies, have
'ties to their countries' policy communities' and are likely to be taken
seriously.
They call on Mr Yeltsin to apply the principles of 'law and justice' to the
issue by offering to hand over two of the four islands (the Habomais group,
and Shikotan) at once, negotiating the handover of the remaining two
(Iturup/Etorofu and Kunashir) within a fixed one to two years.
The report proposes Japan set up a comprehensive economic co-operation and
aid programme to help Russian reforms, at a cost of Dollars 50bn (Pounds
25bn) over the next 10 years. It urges Japan to lead the Group of Seven
nations in providing assistance in converting defence plants to civilian
use, investment and aid to the Far East region, and expertise on
de-nuclearisation and environmental clean-up.
Mr Yeltsin's overall tone was cordial. He wished to discuss a wide range of
issues, not focus on the territorial dispute. 'Some people have been making
hysterical remarks about the dispute, but I have no plans to cancel the
visit,' he said. He is likely to find any talks rough going unless he brings
a compromise on the islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and
the Southern Kuriles in Russia.
The experts' report argues that a referendum in Russia on the issue, sought
by opponents of a handover, is not constitutionally essential. In an
appended working paper, Mr Vassily Saplin, deputy director of the Pacific
and South-East Asia department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, says
opponents of the present government would blame Mr Yeltsin for
'capitulating'. This could 'become a serious destabilising factor for
Yeltsin's government'.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Kohl acts to end rifts over unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl last night summoned his German coalition partners for
top-level talks to reconcile deep divisions in the government, primarily
about how to finance the ballooning costs of German unification.
The meeting, which ended after midnight without announcement of any
agreement, follows a surge in criticism of Mr Kohl's leadership from within
his own Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and a rash of speculation about
the need for a 'grand coalition' of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats
(SPD) to handle the country's growing problems.
The talks were specifically intended to co-ordinate the coalition position
before the Bundestag reconvenes today after the summer break and plunges
directly into the annual budget debate tomorrow. The leaders of the three
ruling parties, who are due to report to their respective followers this
morning, were also likely to discuss the malaise in their coalition, which
includes the Free Democrats (FDP) and Bavaria-based Christian Social Union
(CSU) as well as the CDU.
The coalition partners have come to a belated recognition that Germany's
yawning fiscal gap, which has grown because of transfers to east Germany
currently running at a net DM150bn (Pounds 53.7bn) a year, must be reduced.
They cannot agree how.
The parliamentary leadership of the CDU, led by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, has
proposed a compulsory bond or levy to be imposed on the better paid to help
finance east German recovery - an idea which may appeal to the opposition
SPD, but is not universally supported in the CDU.
The minority CSU, led by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is adamant
that no new measure should be compulsory. Mr Waigel has suggested a
voluntary 'Germany bond' which would earn a low interest rate, tax free. The
FDP, led by Mr Otto Lambsdorff, vacillates in the middle.
Even if the party leaders could agree, it is unclear how a compulsory bond
could be introduced. Mr Kohl will do anything to avoid the impression that
he is considering a new tax to finance unification - something he and Mr
Waigel have repeatedly said was out of the question.
Criticism of Mr Kohl has grown within the CDU because of the coalition's
uncertain handling of the recent extreme rightwing violence against
asylum-seekers in eastern Germany, and its inability to agree on how to
finance subsidies to east Germany.
It emerged at the weekend that Mr Kohl was sharply attacked by members of
his own CDU national executive at a two-day closed meeting near Bonn last
week. According to Der Spiegel, the news magazine, regional party barons
accused him of having 'lost control', and the government of being
'planless'.
The meeting failed to reach a clear agreement on plans for either a
compulsory levy or voluntary tax-free government bond. The CDU leadership
was only able to accept a vaguely worded call for a 'solidarity pact' with
east Germany.
The debate amounts to a considerable embarrassment to Mr Kohl, who has
always insisted that the costs of unification can be borne without a further
tax increase. Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the SPD, has stepped up the
challenge to the chancellor by proposing a 'grand coalition on issues'.

FT  07 SEP 92 / EMS faces fresh test of credibility: Doubts emerge over
effectiveness of efforts by EC to stabilise financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Monetary System faces a new test of credibility this week
following the strongest reaffirmation to date of existing exchange rates by
European Community governments.
Doubts surfaced yesterday as to whether the latest effort by EC finance
ministers to buttress the EMS and calm financial markets would be effective
after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, appeared unconcerned
over the outcome of informal weekend talks in Bath.
The discussions among ministers and central bankers, dominated by recent
currency turmoil and growing signs of weaker EC economic activity, secured a
pledge from the Bundesbank that it would not increase its interest rates 'in
present circumstances'.
However, Mr Schlesinger, speaking yesterday on BBC radio, declined to give
explicit support to a statement issued by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
that the EMS countries would not realign their currencies.
Mr Lamont, as chairman of the meeting, announced that the ministers had
decided to:
Reaffirm their August 28 agreement not to realign the EMS currencies in the
exchange rate mechanism.
Intervene if needed in exchange markets, 'exploiting as fully as necessary
the means and instruments' provided under the EMS.
Emphasise the importance of EC member states implementing economic policies
to curb budget deficits and inflation.
Take advantage of any opportunity to reduce interest rates.
Speaking on Saturday after nine hours of hard bargaining, including
concerted pressure on Germany to cut interest rates, Mr Lamont said he hoped
that the Bundesbank's promise would contribute to stability on exchange
markets.
Officials believe it could change expectations in financial markets by
making clear that the next move in German rates would be downwards. But Mr
Lamont made clear that Britain would raise its interest rates if necessary
to safeguard ster-ling.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said all countries agreed that
they should move to lower interest rates. 'That's a great novelty,' he said.
He stressed that EC central bankers, who are in Basle today and tomorrow for
regular monthly meetings at the Bank for International Settlements, have
'immense means' to steady currencies. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish
finance minister, said: 'We are betting that the results of the meeting will
give enough confidence to markets to re-establish stability.'
On the BBC's World This Weekend yesterday, Mr Schlesinger appeared to cast
doubt on his commitment to ruling out a realignment of currencies in the
European ERM.
He said the question went to his heart and the answer was therefore
something which he would not make public.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of Global Currency Research at UBS, the Swiss bank,
said: 'Not enough has been done.'
He added that European central banks would have to be prepared to sell
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) or Dollars 10bn-worth of D-Marks a day for one or
two days to convince the markets that they were serious about stabilising
currencies.
Mr Gerry Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers in
London, said the Bath talks were 'not likely to dissipate the feeling that
the Bundesbank is not prepared to modify its policies for international
reasons.'

FT  07 SEP 92 / Rescue plan for Eurofighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL CHANGES in the European Fighter Aircraft programme, including a
switch to one engine instead of two, are being considered by industrial
partners in an attempt to rescue the Pounds 20bn project.
Mr John Vincent, managing director of the Eurofighter consortium developing
the aircraft, said studies were under way to see if performance targets
could be matched by a single-engine fighter.
At the Farnborough Air Show, he said different radar systems for the
aircraft were being considered. These included the variants of the current
ECR90 radar being developed by a consortium led by GEC-Ferranti of the UK.
The radar choice was decided two years ago after a row between Germany and
the UK. Germany said this summer that it would abandon the EFA programme
after the development phase was completed and would not go ahead with
production. The other countries involved are Britain, Italy and Spain.
Mr Vincent said yesterday that despite Germany's position, 'the four-nation
element of the entire programme is still being maintained'. Senior British
officials, however, say they have little or no hope of bringing Germany back
into the project as it is currently conceived.
Mr John Weston, chief of British Aerospace's defence division, said the
performance requirement still pointed to an aircraft 'very similar' to the
EFA.
It is thought that the strong position taken by Mr Volker Ruhe, the German
defence minister, would exclude any aircraft resembling the EFA project.
Mr Weston said the partners were looking at every possibility for cost
reduction but still had 'a long way to go' in preparing their studies. These
are expected to be finished by the end of October in order to be forwarded
to ministers of the four countries.
He denied reports that the studies included a possible equity stake in the
project by Saudi Arabia.
Mr Roberto Mannu, the Italian chairman of Eurofighter, said the partners
aimed to provide 'a kind of shopping list' of elements which partners could
draw on to obtain different variants of the planned fighter.
The partners in Eurofighter - BAe, Deutsche Aerospace, Alenia, of Italy, and
Casa of Spain - were studying ways of rationalising work-shares and possible
gains by buying components off the shelf, he said.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Ford to spend Dollars 1bn on Spanish plant for new engine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, is to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) for
development and production of a new small engine range in Valencia, Spain.
The new plant, which will have capacity to build up to 550,000 engines a
year - 2,550 a day - is expected to start production in May 1995 on an
existing site, with full production to be reached in 1997.
The engines will be used mainly in Ford's Fiesta and Escort cars and will
replace the group's HCS small engine range, also produced in Valencia.
The investment is a further step in Ford's ambitious plan to replace most of
its European engine range by the mid-1990s and follows the launch late last
year of its medium-sized Zeta engines, which are being produced at its
Bridgend plant in south Wales, where about Pounds 300m has been invested.
The Dollars 2bn Zeta engine programme is for a 1.6-2.0 litre family of
engines. They will also be produced in Cologne, Germany, and in Mexico. In
Europe they are already being fitted in the Escort/Orion and will also power
the replacement car for the existing Sierra to be launched early next year.
The Sigma engine to be built in Valencia, will be a four cylinder, 16 valve,
twin-cam power unit, with an aluminium block and cylinder head. It will be a
range of 1.0-1.4 litre engines.
The new engine has been designed and developed for Ford by Yamaha of Japan,
which won a contract for the full development of the engine up to the
prototype stage. Yamaha is responsible for about a third of the total
development work on the engine.
This is the first time Ford of Europe has contracted out such an important
element of its mainstream engine development programme to an outside
engineering company and the first time it has turned to Japan.
Ford says the scale of its existing commitments to develop new engines made
it impossible to develop the entire Sigma engine project with its own
engineering resources in Europe. Ford itself will carry out the testing,
evaluation and production engineering for the engine.
It has previously indicated that it could invest in a second production
phase for the Sigma engine with an additional capacity for 300,000 engines a
year, which would probably be built at Valencia or at Bridgend.
Ford's engine programme is being drastically updated, however, and it is
also working to develop the Orbital two-stroke engine as an alternative unit
to power small cars, including a possible minicar smaller than its Fiesta
supermini.

FT  07 SEP 92 / Pretoria seeks backing for federalist plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's ruling National Party will today host a conference of
right-of-centre political parties in an attempt to build a united front
behind the demand for a federal constitution for post-apartheid South
Africa.
The issue of federalism - the degree to which political power is devolved to
regional and local level in the new South Africa - is likely to prove the
most contentious issue to be resolved whenever formal talks on a new
constitution resume between the National party and its main black opponent,
the African National Congress (ANC).
Though the ANC pays lip-service to the concept that power should be devolved
to regions, it nevertheless envisages a highly centralised state where most
important decisions are taken at central government level.
The power to levy taxes would also be highly centralised, undermining
further the political power of regional parliaments.
The National party, along with federalist allies such as the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party, the governments of black homelands such as
Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, and some of the many Afrikaner separatist
movements, believe that South Africa's highly fractious multi-ethnic society
cannot be governed peacefully by a majority party ruling from the centre.
Under a federal constitution, these ethnically based minority parties would
retain a far greater share of power than in a centralised, unitary state,
and for this reason, the ANC remains highly sceptical of such a
constitution.
ANC officials say government uses federalism as camouflage for its real aim:
to preserve white privilege in a black state, by guaranteeing the National
party a disproportionately large share of power. Many also oppose federalism
because it would give the ANC's arch-rival, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of
the Inkatha Freedom party, probable control over what is now Natal Province
(boundaries would be redrawn under a new constitution).
The ruling party will today try to counter these criticisms by presenting
proposals on how political and fiscal power should be distributed between
central, regional and local level.
The other main participants at the conference will be Inkatha and other
black homeland parties, as well as the new Afrikaner Volksunie party, formed
after last month's split in the ultra-right Conservative party.
The liberal Democratic party, which has long advocated federalism, will send
only an observer delegation; it says it is reluctant to join a National
party coalition against the ANC.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gill hits back over payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN GILL, who retired last week as general secretary of MSF, the general
technical union, yesterday hit back at critics who accused him of hypocrisy
by accepting a lump-sum leaving payment of more than Pounds 50,000 on top of
his pension of two thirds of his final salary of Pounds 55,000.
Several other union leaders have recently received even more generous
pay-offs, sometimes related to leaving early, and usually as a result of
generous clauses for officials in union merger agreements.
Mr Gill, a former chairman of the TUC's equal rights committee, said the
payment to him was based on a formula of 1.5 per cent of salary for every
year's service which applied 'to all staff and officials of MSF'.
When the union was formed out of the merger of ASTMS, the white-collar union
and Tass the technical union, in 1988, all Tass staff - plus Mr Gill the
general secretary - received the superior benefits enjoyed by ASTMS,
including the leaving payment formula.

FT  05 SEP 92 / NHS managers' wage bill soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday defended increases
of more than 900 per cent in salary costs of National Health Service
managers over the past five years.
Critics of the government argued that the increases proved NHS reforms were
adding to costs rather than directing resources to patient care.
Department of Health statistics show that general managers' salary costs
rose from Pounds 25.6m in 1987 to Pounds 251.4m last year. This is a much
sharper rise than for other groups of NHS employees - the medical staff
salary bill rose by about 50 per cent over the same period.
Mrs Bottomley said that for every Pounds 1 spent on managers the NHS spent
Pounds 43 on health professionals, and that compared with other
organisations the service was still 'relatively light' on managers. But, she
said, it needed good managers, and the employment of more managerial staff
had led to cuts in waiting lists.
The Institute of Health Services Management, which represents the managers,
said general management costs represented only 2.2 per cent of the NHS wage
bill.
The NHS did not begin introducing a conventional management structure until
the mid 1980s, and there are now far more staff in managerial grades. The
number of people classified as general and senior managers rose from 700 in
1987 to more than 13,000 last year.
The bulk of the sharp rise in the managerial salaries bill took place in
1990 and 1991 - the period in which the government's health reforms were
being introduced.
Some of the increase undoubtedly represents the more competitive market
salaries being offered by trust hospitals and health authorities to attract
chief executives, finance directors and other senior staff. Health
department officials say, however, that most of the rise can be accounted
for by existing NHS staff - such as nurses with managerial responsibilities
 -being transfered to the management payroll.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said it was an 'absolute
disgrace' that the commercialisation of the health service was leading to
public money being spent on higher salaries for senior managers rather than
on the care of patients.
Nupe, the public service union, said paperwork had 'multiplied
several-fold'.

FT  05 SEP 92 / House prices fall by 0.7 percent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell last month according to figures published yesterday by
Halifax, the country's largest building society, Andrew Taylor writes.
The society said prices fell on average by 0.7 per cent last month compared
with July, when there was a 0.4 per cent fall.
'There are still no signsof any recovery in the housing market,' Halifax
said. 'If interest rates remain at around current levels thereis little
likelihood of house prices recovering before next year.'
The society warned that any rise in the market would be muted next year
unless the national economy started to recover. Halifax said that prices in
real terms, after allowing for seasonal variations, fell only 0.3 per cent
last month. Nonetheless prices had been 5.4 per cent lower than in August
last year.
The society's figures also showed a sharp fall last month in the price of
new homes which were 1.1 per cent lower than in July. That followed
increases of 0.8 per cent and 1.1 per cent in the previous two months.
The latest round of reductions may reflect the renewed concern of builders
to generate sales in a difficult market although Halifax warned against
reading too much into a single month's figures.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Housing boost fades quickly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE SALES rose for 48 hours last month as buyers rushed to beat the
deadline for the reimposition of stamp duty on August 19.
Wilson Bowden, the Midlands-based housebuilder, has estimated that it earned
almost 8 per cent of this year's expected turnover in two days. Other
housebuilders have reported similar increases.
In the week to August 19, Persimmon, the seventh-largest housebuilder in the
UK, sold 92 homes - double its normal average. The rise was short-lived,
however. The following week the group's sales slipped back to 24, or half
its normal rate.
Many builders, which are spending hundreds of millions of pounds on special
offers and incentives in an effort to stimulate sales, report that sales
have sagged again since the end of the stamp duty 'holiday' on homes worth
up to Pounds 250,000.
Housebuilders' advertisments in local newspapers are full of offers of
part-exchange deals, low-cost mortgages, offers of removal and legal costs
as well as money-off and holiday vouchers.
Such offers provide the clearest evidence that recovery in the housing
market is as far away as ever.
Mr Duncan Davidson, chairman of Persimmon, estimates that selling costs had
risen since the late 1980s - thanks mainly to increased sales incentives -
from Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 5,000 a home. That was equivalent to an
additional Pounds 8m a year off the company's pre-tax profits, he added.
Sales would normally increase after the school summer holidays, but few
builders expect any recovery before next spring. House prices, which have
fallen by up to 30 per cent in East Anglia and 25 per cent in south-east
England, will take even longer to recover and are unlikely to show any
significant increase until 1994.
Builders are unlikely, therefore, to reduce the level of incentives on offer
to would-be buyers. That is in spite of a last-minute rush to take advantage
of stamp duty concessions.
Wilson Bowden, which this week announced a fall of 33 per cent in first half
pre-tax profits to Pounds 10.1m, said it sold 100 homes worth about Pounds
8m during the 48 hours before the stamp duty holiday ended.
Before that the group had been averaging about 25 sales a week. The gain,
however, was brief, with the company selling only a dozen homes in the week
after the end of the concession.
Although other builders reported a short-lived increase in sales in the
middle of August, the overriding view remained that there had been no let-up
in the recession.
Mr John Low, managing director of Ideal Homes, part of the Trafalgar House
construction, property, shipping and hotels group, said: 'The end of the
stamp duty holiday had virtually no effect apart from bunching-up of legal
completions.'
He appealed to the government to abolish stamp duty and raise mortgage tax
relief to help the housing market. He said parts of the market in southern
England and East Anglia had been in recession for the best part of four
years.
Builders fear that unless help is forthcoming, house sales will continue to
languish in spite of the growth in special deals and offers.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Names see hope in 'damning' report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES who have suffered multi-million pound losses from catastrophe
reinsurance believe evidence from a Lloyd's investigation will help them win
compensation.
The interim report into the losses of Devonshire syndicates 216 and 833/834,
prepared by a a committee headed by Mr Anthony Blake of Neville Russell, the
accountancy firm, is one of several being prepared by Lloyd's to examine the
losses of syndicates which participated in spiral reinsurance in which
syndicates and companies reinsured each other's catastrophe losses.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, a Devonshire Name and leader of the Lloyd's Names
Association Working Party, which links action groups of lossmaking Names,
described it as 'utterly damning'.
Names, the individuals whose capital supports the Lloyd's insurance market,
have suffered heavy losses from spiral reinsurance business.
Lloyd's expects to disclose three reports - into the Feltrim, Gooda Walker
and Rose Thomson Young syndicates - over the next four months.
The Devonshire report alleges that underwriters bought inadequate
reinsurance and that the former board of the Devonshire agency failed 'to
properly discharge its responsibilities'.
During 1989 and 1990 losses by Devonshire syndicate 216 amounted to Pounds
338m compared with a stamp capacity (or capital base) of Pounds 43.4m, while
the losses of syndicate 833/834 amount to Pounds 151m, compared with a stamp
of Pounds 43m.
The report says that both syndicates have had difficulty in making
recoveries from reinsurers.
Both syndicates place substantial reinsurance with the Korea Foreign
Insurance Company, a North Korean company, and have experienced a
'considerable delay in the payment of certain claims'.
The report alleges that syndicate managers breached Lloyd's regulations by
failing to disclose details of the syndicates' business to Names.
Mr Stockwell, who is calling for talks to resolve Names' heavy losses, said
the report 'contained clear evidence that supports the Names for
litigation'. But he is also pressing Lloyd's to revive negotiations for an
out-of-court settlement.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Ferry order for Tyne yard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced yesterday that it had won
an order worth almost Pounds 1.4m for a new cross-Tyne ferry.
The 200-tonne vessel's size is modest by the standards of the warships Swan
Hunter is known for, but its clinching of the deal signals the company's
entry into the small ships market where it hopes to win further work.
Swan Hunter Engineering, part of the Wallsend-based group, overcame stiff
competition from six UK yards and one in Germany. It will be the smallest
vessel to be built by the company since privatisation in 1986.
The Tyne ferry will be among the first to incorporate safety measures
developed by the Department of Transport following the sinking of the
Marchioness on the Thames in London in 1989. Fifty-one people died in that
incident.
The contract, placed by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive,
will provide work for 40 men for eight months at Swan Hunter. Work starts
next month but will not stave off job losses.

FT  05 SEP 92 / National Power agrees to sell gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the electricity generator, said yesterday it had signed a
deal with Bord Gais Eireann, the Irish Gas Board, to supply it with natural
gas in the event of unexpected shortfalls, Neil Buckley writes.
The generator is ready to supply BGE with up to 1.2m therms of gas a day at
short notice in times of high demand. The five-year agreement - the first of
its kind - will be in autumn next year.
Gas will be supplied from National Power's portfolio of supplies using
British Gas's transmission network to Moffatt, southern Scotland, from where
it will be delivered through the interconnector pipeline being constructed
beneath the Irish Sea.
Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said the value of
international co-operation in energy supplies could be enhanced by increased
liberalisation of energy markets.
The deal is further evidence of increasing crossover between the electricity
and gas sectors since the government's energy privatisation programme.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Car sales rise 'remote'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of new cars in August showed 'very clearly that there is no underlying
recovery in demand,' according to Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor
industry economics at Cardiff Business School.
'It would be a very brave man who forecast any significant recovery before
the last quarter of 1993,' he said.
UK new car sales peaked at 2.3m in 1989, but Prof Rhys warned that sales
were unlikely to reach even 2m before 1995.
The motor industry had hoped that August would mark the end of the
three-year decline in demand for new cars, but sales rose by only 1.7 per
cent compared with August last year. The month traditionally accounts for
between a fifth and a quarter of annual new car sales, because of the change
of registration prefix.
Ford, the UK market leader for new cars, expects sales in the whole of 1992
to total only 1.55m, a 2.5 per cent decline from 1.59m last year.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that new
car sales in the first eight months of the year at 1,175,600 were 2.5 per
cent lower than in the same period a year ago.
Registrations have fallen by 32.7 per cent in the past three years, the
steepest decline in the post-war period.
Sir Hal Miller, the society's chief executive, said that 'a change in public
perception of the prospects for the UK economy is the only remedy' for a
recovery.
Both Ford and Rover are being forced to cut output on several of their UK
assembly lines because of weaker-than-expected demand in the UK and in
export markets.
New commercial vehicle registrations in August rose by 9.5 per cent to
31,704. The increase was, however, 'from a disastrous base', Sir Hal said.
In the first eight months of the year new commercial vehicle sales at
142,098 were 6 per cent lower than a year before. Sales have fallen by 46.5
per cent in the last three years.
Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, lost further ground in August with
a 10.2 per cent fall in sales volume and was ousted from third place by the
Peugeot group, which includes Citroen.
Rover's market share last month declined to only 11.1 per cent from 12.6 per
cent a year before, while the Peugeot group boosted its share to 12.9 per
cent from 11.7 per cent.
Rover still remains narrowly ahead of the Peugeot group for the first eight
months, however, with a share of 12.3 per cent - down from 14.4 per cent a
year ago - compared with the 12.1 per cent captured by the French carmaker.
Citroen made the biggest gains last month among the volume carmakers with a
25.7 per cent jump in sales compared with the 1.7 per cent rise in the
overall market.
Both the Peugeot group and Renault have made significant gains this year
with Renault's sales volume rising by 18.9 per cent in the first 8 months.
Ford, the UK market leader, halted the erosion of its market share in August
with a 9.9 per cent jump in sales volume.
Volkswagen, which was involved in heavy price-cutting a year ago, was
another casualty last month. It suffered a 28 per cent drop in sales, which
it blamed on a shortage of supplies from Germany of the new version of the
Golf, its best-selling car.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Shelley at intervals - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELLEY'S bicentenary fell last month, and Radio 3 marked it in Promenade
interval talks. The first, Shelley and Love, on Monday, was presented by
Claire Tomalin. Shelley's idea of love was illuminated in the first
selection, 'Epipsychidion', his blast against marriage. Women were his
muses, none the less, married or not, and we heard great verses afterwards,
addressed to Mary, Claire, and Jane Williams, only one of whom married him.
Jonathan Hyde read beautifully.
On Tuesday, we had The Mask of Anarchy, introduced by Paul Foot, an expert
on Shelley as radical. Nicholas le Prevost read the splendid rap verses that
were spurred by the Peterloo 'massacre'. One line remains as vivid as in
1820, 'Ye are many, they are few.' On Wednesday, Professor Kelvin Everest
introduced Ode to the West Wind (which Paul Foot reckons another radical
poem) and To a Skylark, surely non-political; but alas, I did not hear them.
Maurice Baring visualised a mature Shelley as the Conservative MP for
Horsham, and just as restrained a view must have been taken by Parry,
Delius, Quilter and the rest in the two programmes, Shelley's Soft Voices,
of musical settings of his poems.
Besides the two hours (including repeat) of the Classic Serial, currently
the humorously romantic Miss Marjoribanks by Margaret Oliphant, Radio 4
devotes three half-hours a week to serial plays. Some of these are fine,
some less good; one cannot easily organise listening to pursue a story all
through. Tuesday gives us a welcome repeat of Christopher Lee's six-part The
House, with its background in the Commons, ably directed by Neil Cargill.
On Wednesday, there is the glutinously sentimental In Search of Mihailo by
Dolores Pala, that I shall not follow further. Thursday evenings offer a
great six-part thriller by Nigel Baldwin, Cordoba, that I have praised here.
On the whole, we should be grateful.
John Reith would not have allowed the Radio 4 Monday series Beyond Belief.
Ludovic Kennedy, an avowed atheist, challenges the established religions for
accepting what seem impossibilities. He began last week with Lord William
Rees-Mogg, a devoted Roman Catholic, but they discussed only the normal
beliefs of Christianity - the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, miracles and
so on. Such beliefs being the latchkey into the church, no valid argument
was likely.
This week, Kennedy examined Kalim Siddiqui, of the Moslem parliament, on the
Moslem faith, and I thought Siddiqui did well. Why did Allah, the merciful,
ordain that adultresses should be stoned, that thieves should have their
hands cut off? Simple: to stop them doing it again. Moslems believe in the
Virgin Birth as Catholics do; they accept the Christian prophets as genuine.
Mohamad was not divine; he was a messenger from Allah. Kennedy has little
chance against the intrinsic believers.
The Bible is now finished on Radio 4. Last week, we had Revelations,
superbly read by Sir John Gielgud. Now we have a dramatised Pilgrim's
Progress, with Mick Ford as Christian. Worth following.
Raving (Radio 4, Sunday) was a not-very-deep enquiry into MDMA, the lab name
for the drug Ecstasy. 'We're not doing anything,' said sample ravers, 'we're
just dancing.' But doctors said there was danger of psychosis, a possible
suicidal tendency, danger from heat-stroke or blood-clots. The law said it
was a Class A drug. There was a follow-up on Radio 1 on Tuesday, with a
helpline.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Merry Maggie May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLITZ] in 1990, and now Maggie May; the National Youth Theatre is making hay
with Lionel Bart. Can Oliver] be far behind? Since 1986, when Michael Croft,
the NYT's founder, died, this is the second year in which their repertory
has included no Shakespeare. They might ponder upon Kenneth Tynan's ironic
proposals for new Bartifications of Dickens: Bleak] - or, perhaps, Great]
Up to a point, Maggie May suits the company very well, and in fact the show
is enjoyable beyond expectation. Alun Owen's script is about the eponymous
whore, sure enough, but more about Liverpool dockers. Its heart is in the
right place, that is Left, which means that the goodies are ur-Militants of
30 years ago. The large, eager NYT cast brandish their Liverpudlian accents
with a will, and David Toguri has drilled them in energetic Sixties dancing
 -more than knees-up, if not all that much more - to infectious purpose.
Youthful high spirits carry the day.
The plot is amiably simple and unconvincing. In a 1946 prologue, we find
little Maggie already attached to young Pat Casey, and figuring in a
Christmas pageant which is interrupted by the death of Pat's father, a union
hero, amid an angry strike. The 'real' story begins 18 years later; when Pat
returns from a sourly enlightening stint in the Navy and Maggie is already a
professional on the game.
Her problem is self-explanatory; and Casey's is partly hers. Their liaison
shocks his decent workmates, and in particular his union chum Judder (Peter
Collins) is seized by a jealous homoerotic fury - which Owen leaves
rigorously unexplored, though it is the ground for the fatal denouement.
Before that, Pat has been trying to organise a high-minded walkout over a
gun-shipment to South Africa, while fighting shy of election to his father's
old role (song: 'I'm Me]'). There are confused signals here, but the message
seems to be that eventually, congenital Left virtues will out.
Maggie May is chock-a-block with musical numbers - folksong or nursery-rhyme
style (with sentimental waltzes, barely disguised), which may probably
explain why Owen's text seems so thin and schematic. It needs serious help
from the actors, in the form of a battered world-weariness which neither of
the principals here is yet of an age to convey. Likewise Simon Bowen's
smooth, unprincipled union heavy: nice character-details, too little
gravitas.
Nonetheless, Liz King's Maggie is inventive, volatile and brassy, James
Barriscale's Pat clean-cut and honest (if slightly unmanned by uncertain
pitch). Their heartfelt ballads grow strident, with a lot of amplification
and no mollifying strings. Otherwise Timothy Higgs draws lively playing from
his small band and enthusiastic singing from everybody.
Royalty Theatre, off Kingsway, London WC2, until September 19. Sponsored by
National Power.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Sculpted, silent and spectacular - Robin Lane Fox
praises the scope of a Viennese exhibition that lays bare the glories of
Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILENCE WAS the key quality in old Egypt of the Pharaohs, according to the
late Professor A. Momigliano, the most learned man in Europe. If so, both he
and I would have hated it. Silence certainly prevails in the remarkable show
of nearly 4,000 years of Egyptian sculpture, which is running in Vienna
until October 4. Its setting is the elegant Kunstlerhaus. Against a
background of cool dark blue, silent heads and sculpted figures take us
through an unprecedented time-span of Egyptian modelling, from c. 3,500 BC
to c. 100 BC, from the first kings to the time of Cleopatra's grand-parents.
Many of the great names are here from gods such as Osiris to kings as old as
Chephren. High officials and scribes keep them company, although I failed to
find any trace of the FT's particular Egyptian favourite, Batson D. Sealing
and his mischievous scribal pen.
Vienna is an apt site for an Egyptian spectacular, although the background
to the show has had its share of controversy. During the 19th century,
Austria acquired a remarkable range of Egyptian sculpture, mummies and
papyrus: at the time, Egypt was not so much the victim of rape as the
willing server of her favours. Like biographies, art exhibitions
inter-connect if you sample enough of them: an important figure in Austria's
Egyptian collections is the same Maximilian whom visitors to our own
National Gallery can see before the death-squad, as painted by Manet.
Maximilian had been exported from Europe by the French as potential ruler
over Mexico. To celebrate, he planned to load a large ship with antiquities
bestowed by Egypt and sail them across to the New World for display in a
grand museum in his new Mexican domain. The Mexican firing-squad was too
quick for him, and his boat-load of treasures was diverted to Trieste and
thence to Vienna, where it became one backbone of the great Egyptian
displays.
God, Man and Pharoah is the first big Egyptian show in Vienna for 30 years.
Its moving spirit was Wilfried Seipel, the newish director of the
Kunsthistorisches museum, whose appointment caused dark mutterings in
certain corners of the Egyptological diaspora. There were unfounded
allegations that he, too, might have done a Maximilian, and that the great
success of his earlier career, an Egyptian show at Linz, was not the
advertisement which his many strong supporters assumed. Certainly, it proved
the strong Austrian taste for ancient Egypt: 260,000 visitors saw the show
in Linz.
God, Man and Pharoah is his sequel and in every sense his blockbuster. Its
range is strictly limited to sculptures, hewn from hard stone, occasionally
worked in wood and very rarely cast in bronze. Egyptian diplomats have
contributed an appreciative foreword to the important catalogue which he has
supervised and partly written, but the fact remains that not one object has
been lent from Egypt itself. It must seem a missed opportunity, as the
Vienna show is proving such a success and has merely reinforced its
director's international standing. There is now the promise of a sequel in
1993, showing Egyptian objects from Egypt to make up for the gap.
Rameses and his fellow-rulers are all very fine, but the beginning and end
of this exhibition are its sensations. As usual, Egypt mesmerises us by its
age. Around 3,000 BC a craftsman in Egypt could carve the bulging figures of
a mother holding her baby to her chest. The pose became standardised later
for the goddess Isis suckling her infant and then, by direct imitation, was
adopted for Mary in Egypt, suckling Jesus. Around 2,500 BC, craftsmen were
well able to work the lips, eyes and noses of human faces from a block of
stone and leave it looking like an idealised model. It makes we visitors
feel very small: these sculptures belong at least 1,500 years before
anything which is known to be historical in the Bible. Whether these early
sculptors attempted 'portraits' is far more controversial: like the
catalogue, I felt that there was a hint of individuality in a fine head of
the Pharaoh Mycerinus, lent from Brussels.
From c. 650 BC onwards, the exhibition raises fascinating questions for
anyone who puts the classical Greek tradition at the origin of European
sculpture. This period saw a truly formative impact of English art on Greek
architecture and sculptors: Greeks visited Egypt and learned there, a
contact which is as historically secure as all those in Martin Bernal's
fashionable book, Black Athena, are fanciful and misplaced. Bernal argued
for a profound Egyptian legacy to Greek civilisation more than a thousand
years earlier: the most important impact comes in this later period - not so
much a matter of Black Athena as of Nut Brown Ionians up the Nile.
As a loyal classicist, I have always been happy to believe that Greek
artists first unfroze, humanised and animated the poses of the stiff,
'hieratic' sculptures which had become an ossified tradition in Egypt. If
you look closely at the later exhibits in this show, the gap between Greek
and Egyptian achievement seems to narrow. It might seem even narrower if
more of the later works in metal and especially wood had managed to survive.
Characteristically, scholars used to attribute a sculpture as fine as the
rare royal head, cast in copper and lent here from Hildesheim, to the
distant period of the Middle Kingdom. After its recent restoration, its
dating has had to be drastically lowered. Here, the piece is classed under
the period of the early Ptolemies, a down-dating of a thousand years. Among
Egyptian sculptors, Greeks did not encounter a dead and lifeless tradition.
Blockbusting shows have been criticised for uprooting treasures from museums
and putting them at risk to travel in order to satisfy sponsors or
nationalism. In Vienna, the movement of objects has had a happier result. It
reminds you how great a range of Egyptian antiquities became dispersed over
Europe during the years of 'collecting' up the 19th century Delta: this show
draws only on US and European resources.
It has also reassembled pieces which once belonged together. For the first
time since excavation, a statue in Vienna dated around 1700 BC has been
reunited with its base and legs, which had wandered meanwhile to Dublin.
Across Europe, the sculptured pair of a husband and wife have also been
brought back into partnership, lost since the moment of their excavation.
Those who complain about blockbusters should remember that they can
reassemble as well as put art at risk.
Like its subject, this exhibition is austere and makes demands on the
viewer. It is not scheduled to travel, but it is seriously important, like
the catalogue accompanying it. By isolating sculpture from the other objects
of 'daily life,' it forces us to look very closely at the range and
endurance of Egypt's artistic achievement.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Venice opens its doors to change - A new-look film
festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE chosen to run the Venice Film Festival change almost as often as
the people chosen to run Italy. The guest director of this year's Mostra Del
Cinema is film-maker Gillo Pontecorvo, who made that masterpiece of
docudrama generalship The Battle For Algiers. Running a film festival is
harder, as we know, than organising a military campaign. Number one: you
cannot win. Number two: whatever you do, your enemies will increase rather
than decrease. Even Pontecorvo's popular precursor Guglielmo Biraghi ended
up with more knives in his back than medals on his chest.
But first signs this year are good. Fresh gales are being allowed to waft
into the cultural corridors. Special events include a 'Vetrina sulla cinema
Italiana' and a 'Finestra sulle imagini': one window on the imagination, one
shop window for native film. In addition a skylight has been opened for
American cinema, with Brian De Palma's brilliant new thriller airdropping
into Venice alongside Alexandre Rockwell's breezy film about film-making In
The Soup (top prize winner at the recent Sundance Film Festival). And a
small bathroom window has even been eased open for Britain, welcoming new
films by Neil Jordan, Peter Greenaway and others.
Jordan being on jury duty at Venice, his The Crying Game showed out of
competition - perhaps as well for this strange, vulnerable bloom. Half
political thriller, half love mystery, it follows guilt-haunted terrorist
Stephen Rea from a tragic kidnapping in Ireland to a tryst-of-honour with a
dead soldier's beloved in London.
Planted with riddles and ambiguities - chiefly, when is a girlfriend not a
girlfriend? - the story is a fable about the minefield of misperceptions we
walk through in both love and war. Before the close, however, the film's
mood of mazy convolution becomes more sedative than hypnotic. A key
character is too opaquely played to involve us, and the odd-couple 'romance'
at the film's centre conjures fatally invidious memories of Jordan's better
Mona Lisa.
Brian De Palma's Raising Cain, by contrast, could be re-titled Raising
Lazarus. Some thought Mr De P had been buried for ever by the debacle of The
Bonfire Of The Vanities. Now he leaps forth with all limbs jangling. This
deliciously crazed thriller about a child psychologist with a multiple
personality (John Lithgow) is in the best tradition of Carrie, Obsession and
Dressed To Kill.
De Palma is often pilloried for imitating Hitchcock, but at his best he
improves on the master. The visual booby traps and ambushes here are quite
inspired - from a ubiquitous black wig to a not-quite-drowned woman to a
last-scene showdown between a madman, a bag of oranges and a sun-dial - and
so is the film's parodic eclecticism. Bits of Psycho, Vertigo and Peeping
Tom flutter about the imagistic aviary, but we are never in doubt who is the
true birdmaster. Comic and kinetic, witty and weightless, and dazzlingly
fluid in its movements between dream and waking, this is as close to 'pure
cinema' as the form can come.
After De Palma how impatient we become with films that slap their
message-heavy stories up on screen, uninflected by wit, ambiguity or
provocational trompe l'oeil. Golden Yawn contenders thus far at Venice
include Claude Sautet's atrophic romance Un Coeur En Hiver (beautiful
violinist Emmanuelle Beart tries to inspire some vibrato in repressed
violin-maker Daniel Auteuil), Ousmane Sembene's Guelwaar, a stiffly directed
satire on colonialised culture, and Maurizio Zaccaro's The Valley Of Stone.
This last is a Euro-pudding in the grand modern tradition. It tempts one's
spoon into the rich mix of cultural flavours, then breaks one tooth on the
unyielding polyglot awkwardness. England's Charles Dance plays a German land
surveyor in an Italian-speaking tale about greed and humility. Preachy,
pedestrian and post-synched, the film's only interest is that it was
double-billed with a rare screening of Steven Spielberg's 1969 Amblin', the
calling-card short that brought this prodigy into show business. Time has
not been too kind to the Coca-Cola sunsets and feelgood hippyisms of this
tale of two hitch-hikers meeting cute in the American West. But at least,
unlike Zaccaro's film, it is loud, cheerful and alive.
So is Alexandre Rockwell's In The Soup. This is a comedy about an aspiring
film-maker (Steve Buscemi) who cannot even get to make his calling-card
film; unless the eccentric Mafioso he meets (Seymour Cassel) will finance
the project after our hero has reluctantly co-operated in a series of
robberies. Minor in ambition, major in off-the-wall comic appeal.
None of these films, I predict, will win the Golden Lion. That animal
traditionally favours esteemed and non-controversial veterans. At this stage
he is probably mulling the merits of Pupi Avati's Brothers And Sisters and
Bertrand Tavernier's L 267.
The French film is a disappointment from the maker of Sunday In The Country
and Life And Nothing But: a ponderous docudrama about anti-drugs cops in
Paris, unvitalised by its non-professional cast and rushing Steadicam style.
But Avati's film is a small-scale delight. Evading the curse of the
co-production, its tale of Italian-American family life in St Louis,
Missouri, is funny, subtle, astringent and elliptical: a soap opera which
stings the mind and senses. More if it wins, much more if and when it comes
to Britain.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Relative heroes - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN as a child I first heard the expression 'anti-hero', I thought the
speaker was referring to a female relative. There must be an Auntie Hero in
the family, possibly married to an Uncle Villain. I have since learnt the
error of my ears. But I still think of the anti-hero as some kind of
delinquent older androgyne: a person transcending both the sexual divide
between heroes and heroines and the moral divide between heroes and
villains.
September's video anti-heroes - the month is thick with them - illustrate my
point. Warren Beatty as Bugsy (Columbia/TriStar), John Turturro as Barton
Fink (Columbia/TriStar), Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix as two gay hustlers
living on the law's edge in My Own Private Idaho (Fox); even disillusioned,
downbeat Humphrey Bogart in the anniversary-reissued Casablanca (Warners).
Someone once defined an anti-hero as a hero looking into a cracked shaving
mirror. There may still be good looks, integrity, virility: but they have
all become a little scrambled. The subtlest anti-hero of the month is Beatty
as Bugsy Siegel in Barry Levinson's gloriously sweet-and-sour gangster
history about the man who made Las Vegas. It is not just that Beatty for the
first time manages moments of ugliness: receding hair and swelling jowls
giving the one-time pin-up a Nixon look. It is that his surviving charm and
dynamism seem just as winning in a wicked context as they did in the Boy's
Own heroics of The Parallax View or the Comrade's Own heroics of Reds.
Bugsy's ambivalence shocked American filmgoers into shunning the movie. Nor
did they flock to My Own Private Idaho, where writer-director Gus Van Sant
suspends his rent-boy 'heroes' in a tender, dreamy limbo between good and
evil, past and present, reality and fantasy. The film's beautiful threnody
on themes of loss and search - a road movie through American childhoods -
underscores its sometimes deliberately discordant morality.
Movie audiences are disconcerted by central characters who do not display
exemplary moral attributes. Anti-heroes have always been conscripted from
the fringes of the character department. Just as Idaho dares to put a pair
of hustlers-for-hire into the central spotlight, so the Coen brothers'
Barton Fink foregrounds an outright weirdo (John Turturro) who would
normally have been wheeled in and out for a quick madness cameo.
Turturro's struggling writer in Hollywood, circa 1940, is wild of hair,
bespectacled of eye and twittery of manner. He is an anti-hero for the
literary movie tradition: a cracked-mirror answer to all those Glamorous
Authors the cinema has supplied from Gregory Peck as Scott Fitzgerald to
James Mason as Flaubert.
Unsurprisingly, moviegoers stayed away from Barton Fink too. But anti-heroes
are not always box-office poison. The greatest was Bogart. His forlorn and
furrowed mug would crack any mirror at ten paces, and his moral ambivalence
was staunchly cultivated through 50 films. Yet his romantic appeal was
incalculable. In Casablanca he is a piece of human driftwood with hunched
shoulders and a voice like a saw. But he realises - the film realises - that
given the right existential context a man practising Do Your Own Thing
ethics (Bogart) is more charismatic than a man practising duty-bound
derring-do (Paul Henreid).
Finally, let us not forget the anti-heroine. Thelma And Louise (MGM/UA) is
the story of two plainspun women who hop into a car for a freedom-tasting
weekend and discover that the road to good intentions is paved with
hailstones from Hell. With its main characters turning more macho by the
minute, no film could better show the anti-hero(ine)'s tendency towards
gender mutation. And no modern action thriller has given crime and mayhem a
greater pop-tragic stature as the wages of an unjust or unstable society.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Names look to reports for help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES who have suffered multi-million pound losses from catastrophe
reinsurance believe evidence from a Lloyd's investigation will help them win
compensation, Richard Lapper writes.
The interim report into the losses of Devonshire syndicates 216 and 833/834,
prepared by a a committee headed by Mr Anthony Blake of accountancy firm
Neville Russell, is one of several being prepared by Lloyd's to examine the
losses of syndicates which participated in spiral reinsurance, in which
syndicates and companies reinsured each other's catastrophe losses.
Names, the individuals whose capital supports the Lloyd's insurance market,
have suffered heavy losses from spiral reinsurance business.
Lloyd's expects to disclose details of three other reports - into the
Feltrim, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young syndicates over the next four
months.
The Devonshire report alleges underwriters bought inadequate reinsurance and
that the former board of the Devonshire agency failed 'to properly discharge
its responsibilities'.
Mr Christopher Stockwell, a Devonshire Name and leader of the Lloyd's Names
Association Working Party, which links Names' action groups of lossmaking
Names, described it as 'utterly damning'.
During 1989 and 1990 losses by Devonshire syndicate 216 amounted to Pounds
338m compared with a stamp capacity (or capital base) of Pounds 43.4m, while
the losses of syndicate 833/834 amount to Pounds 151m, compared with a stamp
of Pounds 43m.
The report says both syndicates have had difficulty in making recoveries
from reinsurers.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Rules on bankruptcy are the great leveller: The increase
this year in personal insolvencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RICH may have farther to fall, but once they become bankrupt those
concerned - from Thursday including Mr Kevin Maxwell - are subject to the
same rules as everyone else.
Mr Maxwell and Mr Asil Nadir, founder of Polly Peck International, are two
of the most recent high-profile individuals to become bankrupt.
Earlier this week, Lord Beaverbrook, the former Conservative party
treasurer, staved off bankruptcy with the court extending him protection
from his creditors who are owed nearly Pounds 1m.
But behind the financial difficulties of these businessmen lie problems
facing many thousands of ordinary people who have become bankrupt this year
alone.
Mr Nigel Halls, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says bankruptcy can be the fate of an individual who
either has liabilities which exceed assets, or who does not have the cash to
service debts in the short term.
Statistics released last month by the Department of Trade and Industry for
the first half of this year show 18,389 people were declared bankrupt in
England and Wales, and 5,578 in Scotland. That represented a jump of 60 per
cent and 52 per cent respectively on the same period last year.
Separate figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department show that individual
bankruptcy petitions in the courts in England and Wales - which register
more quickly than the DTI figures and do not always result in bankruptcy -
increased by 43 per cent to 23,032.
The future looks no less gloomy. Cork Gully estimates that there will be
50,000 individual bankruptcies for the whole of this year. Many thousands
more are still bankrupt from previous years.
The recession has obviously caused an increase in bankruptcies as people
have lost their jobs, found mortgage payments beyond their means and
suffered rising interest rate charges on credit-card loans and other forms
of debt.
However, Mr Halls says: 'Bankruptcy is no longer the stigma it used to be.'
People have shaken off the image of the debtors' prison and increasingly see
the procedure as a realistic way to cope with mounting debt.
At the same time, many practitioners point a finger at the government's
insolvency service. Underfunding, combined with the increased volume of work
in the past few years, has lead to less scrutiny of a bankrupt's affairs
than used to occur.
Bankruptcy under English law can result from two sources: debtors'
petitions, which are brought by the individual and comprise nearly two
thirds of the total this year, and creditors' petitions, which are brought
by others owed money by the individual.
A petition is lodged with a county court or the High Court and if it is not
challenged, a bankruptcy order is issued by the judge.
If there are assets which can be recovered, a trustee in bankruptcy will be
appointed. Otherwise, an official receiver from the government's insolvency
service is appointed.
The trustee sets about investigating and realising the bankrupt's assets,
and has the right to question others with knowledge of the assets.
Any assets against which there are charges - such as mortgages - go to the
'secured' creditors. Preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue
and the trustee himself, must then be paid in full. Any remaining money is
distributed between the other creditors.
Bankrupts can keep a normal working salary or state benefits on which to
live after the order is in place, but any windfall gains can be realised
only by the trustee with the approval of the court. Bankrupts cannot be a
director or manage the affairs of a company, stand for public office, or
incur credit above Pounds 250 without declaring their status.
Those with debts below Pounds 20,000 are normally discharged from bankruptcy
after two years. Those with debts above this level are typically discharged
after three years. Once discharged, creditors have no right to make claims
on any money the bankrupt makes.
However, if the official receiver objects to the discharge - which may be
because the bankrupt refuses to co-operate, does not comply with the
procedures or is found to have committed fraud - the period can be extended
indefinitely.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Trustee to interview Kevin Maxwell next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS will be able to put together a more comprehensive picture of
movements of money from the empire of the late Robert Maxwell as a result of
the bankruptcy order against Mr Kevin Maxwell, his son, it emerged
yesterday.
Mr Peter DuBoisson, a partner with accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn who was
appointed trustee in bankruptcy to Mr Maxwell on Thursday, said he intended
to question 'as many people as required' to help identify the assets.
He said he would be interviewing Mr Maxwell early next week.
He also expected to hold a meeting with creditors later this month to select
a committee and to appoint Mr Phillip Sykes, a colleague, as joint trustee.
Under his powers as trustee, Mr DuBoisson can interview anyone who might
have information on the assets which Mr Maxwell may own.
The process might involve, for example, Mr Maxwell's wife, his brother Mr
Ian Maxwell, and his mother Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, as well as advisers to
the companies of which Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director.
Mr DuBoisson's role is to identify and realise for creditors existing assets
and any which have been disposed of by Mr Maxwell in the past five years.
He said he did not expect money owed to other creditors to take the claims
against Mr Maxwell above Pounds 500m and stressed that he would be working
with existing accountants to minimise the costs of his appointment.
Mr Neil Cooper, head of insolvency at Robson Rhodes said he was pleased the
bankruptcy petition had succeeded. As liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment
Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, he is tracing
funds taken from Maxwell pensioners. He said: 'We know what assets there
were about two years ago, but it is important that we can reconcile where
they have gone. We must be satisfied that all the puddles of wealth have
been accounted for.'
The High Court has yet to rule on a claim brought by Mr Cooper against Mr
Ian Maxwell for Pounds 400m which could bankrupt him if his defence is
rejected.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Warburg sets alarm bells ringing: The marketmaking problems
of smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER, TIM BURT and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by SG Warburg to cease making a market in 362 stocks has
created alarm among the 90 companies whose stocks risk being switched from
the main market to the Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board, which provides
information to help match buyers and sellers of the shares of illiquid
smaller companies.
Those facing relegation to the Bulletin Board will be left with only one
marketmaker as a result of Warburg's withdrawal, and they have two weeks to
find a replacement.
Mr Paul King, chairman and managing director of Property Partnerships of
Norwich - one of the 90 - was shocked by the Warburg decision. 'We are a
highly respectable and highly solvent company,' he said. 'We have been
quoted since 1962. It's come as a complete surprise. Operating on the
Bulletin Board is easier said than done. We don't have the resources to buy
the company to go private. I don't know what to do.'
His concern was echoed by Mr David Frame, chief executive of Usborne,
manufacturer of animal feed, who said: 'Warburgs haven't been the least bit
of good for us.
'The market they've made has been so small it hasn't been worth it. Their
failure really shows that the Stock Exchange is failing to deal with
illiquidity of company stocks.'
Mr Frame said that when Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister, joined
the board, he had to wait two months before he could buy shares, eventually
buying through another broker. 'Warburgs were unable and unwilling to make a
market,' Mr Frame added.
Mr Harry Lambert, chief executive of Adscene, a printing and publishing
company, said: 'We have not been told about it by Warburg and I think that
is rather discourteous of them.'
He was hopeful that a replacement would be found. If the hunt proved
unsuccessful, 'it may defeat the object of being a listed company'.
He accepted that there was not much liquidity in the shares - he owns 51 per
cent and other directors a further 20 per cent. 'But we became a listed
company so that we could be more liquid.'
The timing of Warburg's announcement could not have been worse for Adscene,
he added. 'We announce our final results on Tuesday and normally trade
livens up after that. It will be annoying if there is less activity in our
shares next week.' Mr Brian Winterflood, managing director of Winterflood
Securities, which specialises in making markets for smaller companies'
shares, said many of the 90 companies would feel they had been 'virtually
delisted and they could not raise money (equity finance) with that sort of
status.
'These companies paid a great deal of money to get a quote and now they are
being driven back into the clutches of the banks.'
He favoured modifications to the system to help the market-maker in smaller
companies, and so stimulate liquidity.
The Stock Exchange stressed that companies were not being delisted. They
still had access to the full range of capital-raising methods.
Mr Andrew Beeson, at stockbrokers Beeson Gregory, which has four clients
left with only one marketmaker, said the Warburg move was part of a trend
towards an order-driven, as opposed to quote-driven, market in less liquid
securities.
'The vast majority of trade in smaller companies is not through market
makers, but through people like ourselves who talk to investors about buying
and selling and then work at matching the business.'
He did not think that a company's ability to raise money by issuing shares
would be affected.
The Stock Exchange said that it could not make companies liquid or interfere
with the commercial decisions of its members. 'We can only provide an
alternative mechanism where marketmakers feel they cannot commit the
necessary capital.'
But it replied to companies reluctant to move to the Bulletin Board by
saying that it offered several advantages. Orders were displayed that might
enable an immediate trade, it said. An order could be posted to attract
takers and prices were indicated. The broker was named and was well placed
to know who was interested in doing business.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Oftel probes BT telex charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFTEL, the telecommuni-cations regulator, is investigating whether large
increases in British Telecommunications' telex charges are justified.
The move follows complaints from users about a 20.7 per cent increase in
telex line charges which is to start next month.
Mrs Vivienne Peters, executive director of the Telecommunications Users'
Association, a leading user group, said yesterday that the rise in charges
was 'totally unacceptable'.
BT defended the increase in its basic telex line charge from Pounds 352 to
Pounds 425 a year on the grounds that it needed to bring charges into line
with costs. It added that there had been no rise since 1984.
Telex is a declining service because many users find it more convenient to
use faxes for messages. BT said that, as usage has declined, unit costs had
risen. But it refused to say whether telex was profitable.
Oftel said it had asked BT for information about the cost of providing the
telex service. The regulatory body's preliminary view is that the rise is
justified. Oftel has no direct control over BT's telex charges as the
service is not included in a basket of the company's main services covered
by a price formula. But the regulator is entitled to object to rises.
Telex is still used extensively, particularly in the export-import business
since many developing countries are not fully converted to fax. Moreover,
telex messages, unlike fax ones, are legally binding.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Timeshare group cuts jobs: Controversial holiday company
halts high-pressure sales promotions and closes main office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLIDAY Ownership Exchange, a UK-based timeshare holiday operator is
shedding 150 jobs and has closed its main office in London because of the
impact of the recession on sales.
The office has been operating since 1985, and the hard-sell tactics of its
staff have helped make the company one of Europe's most successful timeshare
operators. The lease on the large Leicester Square premises was due to
expire at the end of this month.
The operation has had a chequered history following complaints from
customers about hard-sell tactics, but the reasons for the closure were
economic according to Mr Ray Rantell, managing director. He said: 'It is a
matter of mortgages and jobs. People are just not willing to make a
financial commitment.'
People had still come forward for the presentations at Leicester Square, but
had been unwilling to sign up. 'The high cost of running such a big
operation in the West End is no longer economic. That era, sadly, has come
to an end.'
The company will continue to run its 600-apartment Clube Praia da Oura
holiday complex near Albufeira on Portugal's Algarve coast, which has 14,000
timeshare members, and timeshare holidays will still be marketed on the
Continent and through alternative outlets in Britain.
The loss of about 150 full-time jobs include 140 staff at the company's
marketing office at Ilford, Essex and 12 sales administration staff at
Leicester Square. In addition, a further 70 self-employed sales consultants
will lose their posts.
Other staff from Leicester Square who handled member support services are
being moved to Ilford.
Mr Rantell's regret at the closure may not be shared by many of his
customers who faced a two-hour sales pitch at the Leicester Square office.
Hundreds of complaints were made by people who had received unsolicited
mailshots saying they had won valuable prizes provided they attended the
presentation. They were then subjected to a high-pressure sales promotion
before discovering that their 'prize' was not always what they had been led
to believe.
The Office of Fair Trading issued a statement in 1990 threatening to take
legal action against the company because of misleading advertisements, and
the organisation agreed to change its marketing practices.
More recently, the company has been the subject of investigation concerning
a 'win-a-car' promotion at London mainline rail stations which required
detailed personal information.
Mr John Lamidey, assistant data protection registrar, said he had launched
an investigation into the campaign following complaints from the public.
He added: 'When data to be stored on a computer is gathered, the subject has
to be made aware exactly who is gathering the data, for what purpose it is
to be used and whether it will be disclosed to a third person. On the face
of it this promotion meets none of those criteria.'
Complaints were also received by the Advertising Standards Authority.
Mr Rantell said the promotion had been stopped, together with all other
promotion campaigns in Britain. However, Holiday Ownership Exchange would
continue its travel club, newsletter and exchange scheme.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Tour operator ceases trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUR operator DHG (UK), which specialised in package holidays to Turkey, has
ceased trading, the Civil Aviation Authority said yesterday.
There are an estimated 3,000 people now abroad with the company and they
will be able to complete their holidays before being flown back to Britain.
The CAA said that people due to travel up to midnight tonight should report
at the airport as arranged. Other customers with advance bookings would get
a full refund.
The company, based in Twickenham, London, traded as Flights Delight, South
African Delight Holidays and Turkish Delight Holidays, and arranged
seat-only flights to Mediterranean countries in addition to its Turkey
operation, the CAA said.
The authority has called in the Pounds 1.3m bond which was required for the
company's air-travel organiser's licence authorising up to 56,516
passengers. The money will be used to fund the flights and refunds.
The CAA advised customers to keep in touch with their travel agents. People
who booked direct with the company can contact the CAA this morning on
071-832 5620. This afternoon and tomorrow they should ring 081-759 2195, and
from Monday, 071-832 5620.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Milk board reform attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO turn the 60-year-old Milk Marketing Board into a single voluntary
co-operative were strongly attacked yesterday by the Dairy Trade Federation,
which represents creameries and dairies.
Mr Brian Smith, federation president, said he could not understand how a
government that believed in a free market could be in favour of the
co-operative proposal.
The federation's reaction is the latest setback in the long process of
reforming the board, which represents nearly 30,000 dairy farmers in England
and Wales. Less than two weeks ago the federation and board failed to agree
on plans to reform the pricing system for milk used in manufacturing.
Mr Smith said the federation approved of the board's proposal to float Dairy
Crest, its wholly owned subsidiary which has a 25 per cent share of the
British market for manufactured dairy products. But it disagreed with the
board keeping its assets, which would be 'disguised incentives' to attract
farmers to the co-op.
The government is expected to publish a bill soon to reform the board.

BEER production for June was 3.4m barrels, up 15.7 per cent on June last
year. Adjusted production (production plus imports and minus exports) was
3.63m barrels, up 16.7 per cent.
The Brewers' Society said the rise 'must be seen in the context of two
additional brewing days this year, and the comparison with a particularly
bad June last year'.
Adjusted production for the year to June was 37.16m barrels, down 1.5 per
cent on the 12 months to June last year. The society said this figure 'more
accurately reflects the state of retail sales, which are still depressed'.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Berkertex group calls in receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKERTEX, one of Britain's largest bridalwear manufacturers and retailers,
went into receivership yesterday after a long period of falling sales, Tim
Burt writes.
The group, which includes Genesis clothing and Fifth Avenue retailers in
central London, employs 1,200 people and has 250 retail outlets. It also has
42 overseas outlets, including 26 in Spain.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, has been appointed receiver for the
group.
Mr Christopher Morris Touche Ross said: 'We have started to seek buyers for
the Berkertex businesses as going concerns. Trading is continuing while we
assess the position.'
The fortunes of the group, formed in 1986 through a Pounds 21.6m management
buy-out from the Raybeck retail group, have failed to match the profits of
the late 1980s when the company bid Pounds 41m for Ellis &amp; Goldstein, the
women's clothing group. Its expansion plans were obstructed, however, when
Ellis &amp; Goldstein opted instead for a counter-offer from Alexon, another
clothing company.
In the 1990s the combination of high interest rates and falling consumer
spending has hit the company, which last year had a turnover of Pounds 40m.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Farmers to invest in urban invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FARMERS from the Shropshire village of Wem have decided they might make a
better living by coming out of their rural hideaways and staging an urban
invasion.
Led by Mr David Hurren, secretary of the local branch of the National
Farmers' Union, 12 of them are contemplating an investment of Pounds 5m to
take the business of the land to the doorstep of townsfolk in the west
Midlands or the north-west of England.
They plan to buy a farm of up to 250 acres on the edge of one of the
conurbations, work it as a model rural enterprise, set up craft units and a
teaching centre and then a shopping complex to sell its products and those
of other farms.
Such shops would not be like normal farm shops - 'not cobbled together with
string and tacks' - Mr Hurren hastened to assure. But they would cock a
snook at the power of the supermarket chains.
'You can't beat them at their own game,' Mr Hurren explained. 'You can't
join them at it. But there may be a way to slip in between them.'
The plan gives a new slant to rural diversification: the scramble for
farmers to find means of compensating for diminishing subsidy income from
the European Community. 'The difficulty we have found is that farmers want
to do things in their own backyard,' Mr Hurren said. 'But you've got to go
to where the market is.'
Preliminary research for a feasibility study by Venture Business Consultants
of Shrewsbury indicates that the idea has proved successful on a smaller
scale. 'We'll need some venture capital,' Mr Hurren said, but at this stage
he does not know how much.

<TEXT>
I POPPED round to Downing Street for a word with the prime minister last
night, to urge him to poke his head just a millifraction above the parapet
and to tell us what is happening to this weary, wracked planet. Like you, I
am stunned by the swirl of events that are buffeting and harassing us.
His manners never change. He is the courtliest soul imaginable. We entered
his private sitting room. I sat on a floral sofa.
'Care for some food?' said the prime minister. 'One of the nicest things
about this place is that they are happy to serve you anything, whatsoever
the time of day.'
'Wonderful,' I said. 'I'd like eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms
and fried bread, thankyou very much.'
As we ate, I broached the subject of my visit.
'It seems to me, prime minister, that the time is fast approaching when you
must do or say something - possibly something small: no one is counting on
miracles - to relieve the confusion and dread that are stalking the land.
'Everywhere people look they see schism and breakdown. Paralysis of the
world economy. Markets shaking and heaving. Europe on the brink. Poor old
George Bush. Maastricht and Mitterrand. Wars flaring daily. Saddam still
out-tricking us. Turmoil at the BBC. The House of Windsor quaking. The
return of Lord Owen. Children rioting and swearing. Lord Beaverbrook
insolvent. Some exceptionally dodgy weather. A great pall of horridness.
'If you ask me, prime minister, it is all getting a bit too pre-millennial
for my taste: eerie and frightening, the sky a hideous purple, oceans
glinting afire, earthquakes and tempests, paganism and metempirics.
'Yet no one is speaking up. You yourself, prime minister, remind me of an
incident Paul Theroux writes about in his new travel book, The Happy Isles
of Oceania. I happen to have a review copy, courtesy of the Books editor.
'Theroux is in Western Australia, plugging his latest novel. He visits a
Perth newspaper. He is escorted to a cubicle where an 18-year-old boy is
sitting at a tidy desk. 'Well,' says the boy, 'where shall we begin?' He has
read none of Theroux's books. The interview goes nowhere.
'Finally, at the door, the boy asks his only literary question. 'How do you
get your characters?' he asks. 'You just think them up?'
''Sometimes I think them up,' replies Theroux. 'And sometimes they appear
before my eyes.'
'The trouble is, prime minister, that people are no longer sure whether you
are a character they invented, or whether you just appeared. They find it a
mystery.'
'It's remarkable you should say that,' said the prime minister, 'because the
truth is that we - the world's leaders - are grappling with a genuine
mystery at present.
'We seem to have encountered gridlock. Everything has stalled. We think it
is pre-millennial. And it seems to involve pi. As you are aware, pi - a
circle's circumference divided by its diameter - is a transcendental number.
It starts off as 3.14159265 but its decimal places continue for ever - an
infinity of decimal places. Or so it was supposed.
'Some scientists, however, have been using extremely powerful computers to
see whether pi would eventually yield a pattern of numbers that contained
some sort of code, a message from the Creator. All was going swimmingly
until six weeks ago when the computers started to produce an endless
sequence of noughts. Whereas we used to receive a never-slackening stream of
unrelated digits stretching to infinity, all we are getting is zeros.
'Nor is that the end of it. All the Earth's strategic computer programs have
thrown in the towel. We ask them the big questions, and out come noughts. I
have talked to George about it, to Francois, Helmut, Boris. Everything is
gridlocked, everything closing down. There seems to be no way forward. We
are sure it is pre-millennial.'
'Are you worried?'
'What's the point of worrying? We are going with the flow, waiting to see
what happens.'
'You don't have a plan?'
Just then, all the red telephones on the desk started ringing. The prime
minister answered one of them and listened very hard. The colour fled from
his face.
'I am afraid you will have to excuse me,' he said, dashing for the door. 'If
I am not back in 30 minutes, order a pot of tea.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / Time to inspire a palace revolution: Malcolm Rutherford
thinks Britain should show its leadership qualities by creating an art park
in central London based around Kensington Palace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IDEAS ARE in the wind for the creation of a new modern art gallery
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
more ambitious than has gone before - to greet the approach of the second
millennium. Here is a modest proposal which might go even further and create
a market for art as well. There should be an art park, a mixture of public
and private interests, stretching across a large part of some already
established international art capital. The aim would be to bring artists,
collectors, sellers and buyers more closely together. The idea is developed
later in the article, but first some background.
The underlying thesis - impossible to prove conclusively, but even harder to
refute - is that demand for art will always exceed supply. You can see that
in many ways. At the top end of the market Christie's can still sell a
Titian for nearly Pounds 7.5m in spite of the recession. New galleries
continue to open in different areas as recession hits the more traditional
establishments. The paintings and drawings strung along the railings of
London's Hyde Park on Sundays are a sign that interest is always there.
Demand for viewing art, rather than buying it, also goes on rising. Official
figures are not up-to-date, but show that the number of visitors to the main
national museums and galleries in London went up from 10.3m in 1979 to 12.1m
a decade later. Figures from the Policy Studies Institute suggest much
higher increases in some of the regions. Anecdotal evidence would include
the high attendance at the small, selective Manet Exhibition 'The Execution
of Maximilian' at the National Gallery and the Magritte Exhibition at the
Hayward. Others can supply their own evidence from Paris or New York, and
note that where admission is free, not everyone is counted.
Almost anything to do with art has a tendency to arouse public passions. The
long-running dispute over the rights and wrongs of museum charges is one
example. Another is the perennial argument over whether privately-owned
paintings which come up for sale should be 'saved for the nation', and how.
A new dispute has broken out over proposals by Nicholas Serota, gallery
director, to split the Tate collection into foreign and British works.
At first sight, this outline of rising public interest fits ill with the
reports of falling profits and turnover at the main auction houses of
Sotheby's and Christie's and the closure or financial difficulties of a
growing number of private galleries in London's West End. There is clearly a
price adjustment under way, but I suggest a deeper explanation: the demand
is there, but the supply side isn't working.
In broad terms, art holdings fall into the following categories:
museums or other official institutions, such as churches and palaces;
private galleries, which exhibit, buy and sell;
corporate collections held, for example, by Pearson, Reuter and Robert
Fleming;
private collections, some of which are on show or on loan to exhibitions;
random private holdings, mainly inherited, but sometimes bought ad hoc and
occasionally a gift from the artist or a friendly gesture of encouragement
by purchase.
Leaving aside the right of an individual to collect and hold whatever piece
of art he or she chooses, provided it is legally acquired, all those
categories have their deficiencies.
The problem of museums is well-documented. Essentially they hold more than
they can show. Recall the story of the Corots in the Louvre - kept in an
upstairs gallery and only brought to wider attention when exhibited
elsewhere in Paris. The same could be said about Britain's Turners. The Tate
can only show about one quarter of its collection at any time.
The problem of private galleries, certainly in central London, is not
dissimilar from that of other businesses in a recession. They may carry
excessive overheads, be in the wrong place, open at the wrong times and be
inaccessible to a new public. There is no reason why new galleries should
not open elsewhere in line with the earlier revolution in the retail trade.
Some have already done so.
Corporate collections are a much under-studied and under-catalogued subject.
Suffice it to say that some companies have made a point of collecting art
and do not know what to with it.
Private holdings are, of course, a private matter. Yet, it is striking in
major shows that so many of the exhibits come from private collections or
simply private owners. In the big Magritte exhibition at the Hayward, more
than half the works fell into that category. Of the 108 paintings in the
Allan Ramsay exhibition at this year's Edinburgh Festival, more than 30 were
from private owners. There were 76 exhibits in the same festival's 'Dutch
Art and Scotland'; 34 were privately held. Sometimes the owners are willing
to be identified; sometimes, not. In the two Edinburgh cases cited, a
majority withheld their names. The Queen lent to both.
It is also clear from social observation that a sizeable number of people
have works of art which, although they may not amount to a collection, are
interesting or possibly valuable in their own right. Often the potential
value was not and could not have been known when the piece was acquired.
More of these private owners might like to have their paintings shown; some
might like to consider selling.
In theory, the auction firms exist as a clearing house when art changes
hands. Yet one doubts how far they are an adequate means of developing a
wider and more active market. Witness, by contrast, the success of The
Guardian's 'Art for Sale' which puts artists in touch with potential buyers.
The newspaper has found that it can hardly cope with demand: sellers and
buyers rate it highly.
It is the peculiar mix of public and private ownership that makes art
different from other commodities. If there is to be a greater movement in
the market - more on show, more to sell and more to buy - there will have to
be some rearrangement of public and private interests. This is germane to
the question of a new modern art gallery and underlines the need to be
ambitious. Where should it be and how should it be run?
The location will make sense only if it is close to, and can evolve from, an
existing international art centre where museums, galleries, auction houses,
a viewing and a buying public are already part of the tradition. It will
also require space - masses of it. As it happens, there is an obvious
candidate: London.
By the standards of Paris, Rome or even parts of New York, London is not the
most beautiful metropolis in the world, but it does have one superb, large
and conveniently empty site. It stretches, with only a few obstacles, from
St James's Park, Green Park, through Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens and,
pushing it only a bit, on to Holland Park. It is already ringed with
galleries, small and large, public, private and royal. The Queen's
paintings, now partly open to the public, are nearby. The Royal Academy
almost faces Green Park. There are some splendid galleries in the Mall, and
the Royal College of Art looks on to Kensington Gardens. On Sundays the
surroundings are full of artists peddling their wares.
The great bulk of the parkland is untouched but not immune. There is the odd
Henry Moore, the greatly under-used and under-ambitious Serpentine Gallery
in the middle, and a few tiny galleries in and around Holland Park at the
western end. In between there is the supreme prize of Kensington Palace
which, with official permission, could be turned into a major gallery in its
own right - almost the hub of the concept.
Someone would have to co-ordinate the project, so let me define it more
closely. A new gallery of modern art is too small a definition. A more
accurate term would be a modern gallery of art, containing old as well, and
not just one gallery but a string of them, indoors as well as out (for
sculptures and itinerant artists). It would combine exhibiting and selling.
That is why, however infelicitous, I have chosen the term art park.
The co-ordinator would be appointed by the government. He or she would
require wide powers - a bit like those for the opening up of Docklands.
There would have to be co-operation with all sorts of bodies: the Queen (if
Kensington Palace is to be secured), the local authorities, the trustees of
existing museums who like to keep art rather than trade it. Some, although
not many, new buildings will be needed. There might be a gallery to show
corporate collections, and perhaps a place for private owners to exhibit
their holdings. Smaller galleries could proliferate - as to some extent they
have - in the areas round about.
To help the co-ordinator, there must be a company in this country capable of
running a theme park, and leasing galleries as franchises.
There may also have to be changes in the law: some are on the way. Just
before the last general election, Tim Renton, then arts minister, put
through Parliament the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 which empowers the
Tate to sell paintings and sculptures from its existing collection. Renton
would have liked the Act to have gone further and extended to the National
Gallery, but it is at least a start.
The power to dispose does not, of course, rule out the power to acquire. On
the contrary, the change in the law helps to create a market and provides
greater freedom for gallery directors.
I have deliberately said nothing in this article about the aesthetics of
art: that is a matter of taste and fashion. Nor have I mentioned public
funding: there is no reason to suppose that what I suggest would cost much
additional money. It is more a question of better co-ordination and a change
in attitudes. The opening up of a market would help artists and purchasers
alike.
The timing is ripe: not only the approach of the millennium, but the
creation of the ministry of national heritage, which has been given an
empire but not yet found a role. Should the area around the Serpentine prove
too small, there are others available. Why not put paintings and sculptures
in Regent's Park as the animals depart from the zoo? There could be no
clearer acknowledgement of changing tastes. Renton has thoughts about
Butler's Wharf, in London, where there is space aplenty, then on into
Docklands.
One final thought: if London does not take up the idea, somewhere someone
else will. The outstanding candidate is Berlin, which has lots of money,
lots of space, lots of art, and masses of ambition. Must the Germans lead?

FT  05 SEP 92 / Private view: The fine art of stealing the world's finest
art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT TIME you are in an art gallery in Europe or America, look out for a
pretty young woman with a cap pulled down over her face. She will not be
trudging along the walls but rooted in front of one painting, holding a
sheaf of colour reproductions in one hand and making notes with the other.
You are watching Susie Ray about to steal another masterpiece.
Of course, she is not going to wrench the picture from the wall. She is
merely going to lift the image, take it away and reproduce it in oils for
some rich, probably anonymous, client.
'You can usually get something on camera before the wardens start shouting
at you,' she explained gaily. 'But I'm getting a bit too well-known, so I
sometimes use an assistant.'
What Susie Ray does is perfectly legal, provided her deception is done
without intent to deceive and provided the work she mimics is out of
copyright (which in Britain means the artist must have been dead 50 years).
It is legal, but odd. Jonathan Swift would have relished a topsy-turvy world
in which a piece of painted canvas, originally purchased for a modest price,
becomes so valuable and such a liability that its owner is forced to hide it
or sell it, and feels obliged to pay again for someone else to paint another
piece of canvas in exactly the same way.
Temporarily housed in a corner of a big studio in a not-so-fashionable
district of south London where her husband John Stewart designs and sells
kites, Susie Ray told me why the copyist's art is once more in again.
Some of her clients are sentimental, she said, like the Texan couple who
before selling their little Sisley landscape to a Japanese wanted a copy of
it to put back above the mantelpiece, or like the security guard at
Rockefeller's private mansion who wanted a souvenir of one of his master's
paintings for his retirement.
Others, like the Arab with the huge collection of early Impressionists
stored in a bank vault in Geneva, are billionaire investors who will not pay
the insurance premium.
Or they are collectors who are going bankrupt, or who are afraid the art
market is collapsing, have stopped buying at auction and need new
acquisitions to give their friends the impression they are still active.
Some are doing up country houses, like the couple who commissioned Monet's
Santa Maria della Salute for their Venetian decor; like the English
industrialist Sir Anthony Bamford who needed Reynolds' portraits for his
Warren Hastings room.
Or they just want a van Gogh they've seen on holiday, such as the couple for
whom she copied Starry Night, or they want Modigliani, like the old man who
has commissioned four, or they want Stubbs, or Gauguin, Cezanne or
Caravaggio - even, in one case, Duccio. Occasionally, she has had brushes
with the underworld: 'I have had funny phone calls.'
Susie Ray is one of the first modern copyists in Britain to go publicly into
business. In Paris there is Daniel Delamare, who commissions other artists
to work for him and in Barcelona there is Miguel Canals who heads a large
studio whose output has been put up at auction.
Ray charges up to Pounds 4,000 for an Impressionist or post-Impressionist,
including the frame. For Old Masters she charges more. She does only one
copy of each masterpiece, calls them Susie Ray Originals (a cheeky use of
the word but one with precedents in fashion and music), then stamps the back
of the canvas with a certificate of non-authenticity.
When I asked her why only one, she replied: 'Because it takes a lot of time.
If you do it again you can't do it as well. You lose interest in it. You
can't concentrate. I just couldn't do it, even if the painting was
destroyed.' She did not add that the uniqueness of her copies might persuade
customers they were acquiring an asset.
Do you have an artist's eye? I asked her. Do you think of your clients as
philistines?
'It varies with the clients. But I don't see myself as a fine artist. I
wasn't trained as one. Had I been, I would have developed a style, a
technique, and that would have shown in my paintings. But because of my
training I am able to produce accurately. I call myself a technician.'
Her painstaking skill is the product of natural talent, a year's foundation
course at Chelsea Art College, four years studying scientific illustration
at Middlesex Polytechnic and two years working as a botanical artist at Kew
Gardens.
Are there any painters you can't do?
'I've turned down two Canalettos, not because I can't do them, but because
it would take for ever.' What about technically?
No, I haven't come across one yet. I think contemporary painters would be
hard, with drips down a canvas. Anyway, they're not out of copyright.
'Old Masters take longer but technically they're easier. With Impressionists
have to get the brush strokes looking spontaneous, especially when they
painted so fast.'
But, I said, if you can knock up a pretty decent Monet aren't you tempted to
go out and find a subject for yourself?
'No, because I can't do that. I've tried. It would end up looking like a
photograph. This is the extraordinary thing.'
What are you lacking that you can't do it?
'I'm lacking the fine artist's way of painting.'
But it's a matter of looking, isn't it?
'Yes, but probably I just don't want to do it because Monet does it so much
better. If I tried it it would just be so bad.'
You don't have to paint like Monet.
'No, but I look at everything with an illustrator's eye.'
From prints or slides of her paintings it is impossible to tell they are
copies. Seeing them in the flesh it is still difficult (though isn't the
expression of that Modigliani nude a touch too saucy?) and even beside the
originals they might confuse.
So I applied the Turing Test for robots: let's say you can make a copy to
fool virtually everyone. What then is the difference between your copy and
the original?
'Visually, I hope, there shouldn't be - though I would be completely aware
of it. There's a big difference in the value, of course.'
So why is there such a difference in value?
'Why should a Stubbs be worth Pounds 60,000 and an Impressionist Pounds 6m?
Why should a de Kooning go for Pounds 2m? It's the art world. I don't
understand it.'
I pointed to the nude again. How would you describe the difference between
your Modigliani and his, apart from the fact that he had the idea and you
didn't?
'Because it was done by the original artist. It's as lame as that. There is
something there. If the two were side by side I think the original would
still have an aura.'
Would I get the same buzz from a copy as from the original?
'I would hope you'd get the same buzz.'
People say there's some quality inherent in an original work of art. Do you
think that's true?
'All I can say is that when I've done a copy of a painting that's hanging in
a gallery and I go back and see the original it's just very exciting. I
think 'Gosh, I've done it]'
'It's something that I feel I can achieve, and I have never seen anybody
else quite get it. And I'm going to get better. But it will never be the
same. Which is why I don't charge the same.'
Do paintings have souls? I left Susie Ray's studio with the aesthetic
conundrum unresolved. Perhaps she cannot answer the question for the same
reason that, brilliant as she is, she cannot paint her own pictures.
So if you discover Susie Ray stealing a picture from your gallery, don't
worry. She will probably leave a bit of it behind.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Edinburgh Festival: Good, bad, but mostly the same /
Assessing the 'too similar' work of C P Taylor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C P TAYLOR wrote more than 70 plays; this Edinburgh Festival has presented
seven of them. On this evidence seven is more than enough. Taylor is not a
playwright whose work benefits from being gathered together. Though each
play has its own distinct character, there are too many similar dramatic
devices and too many larger ideas in common. How many times have we heard
two characters not conversing but carrying on an alternation of monologues?
How many farcical situations have there been in which a central character is
caught between the various aspects of his life?
Taylor's chief subject, it appears, was conflict of interest. He homed in on
the areas where public and private lives clash; he made black comedy from
situations where disinterested good intentions (especially within the same
person) are defeated by selfish interests. He particularly enjoyed making
his protagonist an artist (see Good, Schippel, The Black and White
Minstrels, Walter) and showing how a passion for music is yet another of a
man's private lives (see also Operation Elvis and And a Nightingale Sang).
It is often said that his best play is Good, and certainly it has been the
best of this festival's seven. But - so suggests this festival - it is
simply the ultimate version of the play he had written often before in
different guises: the most deft treatment of the themes that run through his
other work. There is no blacker subject for comedy than complicity in Nazi
politics; and Good charts with some brilliance the absurd whirlpool of
private interest that sucks John Halder, an initially amiable and
well-meaning intellectual (forever haunted by music), into becoming the
first Kommandant at Auschwitz.
Taylor wrote this for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1981, the last year
of his life.
It seems probable that RSC conditions stimulated him to the top of his form.
He was, by all accounts, a playwright who incorporated and utilised his
cast's abilities; and, though I never saw the RSC production, I believe even
now you can hear Alan Howard's delivery (he was the original Halder) in the
lines themselves.
Not that the new production, by Glasgow's Tron Theatre, feels like a
pastiche. Some of the actors employ Scots accents; the designer, Michael
Boyd, has provided a semi-circular no-place-in-particular set, out of whose
five doors characters keep popping. Conrad Squith's muted slightly dead
about the eyes performance conveys much of Halder's fazed passivity.
Glasgow was Taylor's birthplace and the setting of several of his plays;
Northumberland became his later home, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne the home of
many of his premieres. One of these, the memory play And a Nightingale Sang
(1977) is also set in Newcastle. As presented by the Northern Stage Company
in a new staging by Alan Lyddiard, this turns out to be an adept kind of
wartime soap-opera, half way between Dad's Army and When the Boat Comes In.
What with 'Me Mam' (obsessively Catholic), 'Da's' or 'Our George' (forever
playing the piano) and the gloom-mongering grandpa, it is not far from
Bread.
Set against these relentlessly stock types - and endless refrains of 'Ee,
sit down, yer daft ol' bugger' and 'Joyce, man, I'm that glad to see yer' -
are some more three-dimensional views of the younger generation. Joyce is
pretty but scared of marriage and, subsequently, of sex; later, however, she
is not sure which 'feller' has caused her wartime pregnancy. Her sister
Helen, one leg shorter than the other, is the narrator, plain,
self-conscious and sensible. She welcomes love when it happens to her. Even
when her lover turns out to be married with a child, she is stoically
grateful for what love left her: new confidence.
What is most Taylorish about all this is the way these girls live their own
lives against the insistent background of the war. It is one of his most
deeply sentimental plays: a fact which Helen's apparent hard-headedness and
the stereotyping of the older folk only help to underline. I too am a sucker
for this kind of thing, but it is so close to umpteen television treatments
of growing up in the war that I do not need to go to the theatre to see it.
When Taylor was at his best, he interlaced politics and personal lives far
more tightly; he showed his characters' reluctant complicity, duplicity,
guilt. In short, he made Good.
The Tron production of Good at St Bride's Centre and Northern Stage's And a
Nightingale Sang, at the Church Hill Theatre, both end their Edinburgh
performances today.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: A farewell to Soderstrom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY on the day did the news emerge that Elisabeth Soderstrom's late-night
cabaret performance, at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, would also be her
farewell. She entered dramatically. A wall rose to reveal her; she at once
launched into the opening phrases of 'Dich, teure Halle' from Tannhauser.
Then she cut to the aria's closing phrases and - just as she was due to hit
a high note now surely beyond her - she cut into 'Hello, Dolly', here
reworded as 'Hello, darlings'. The medley continued with 'Tea For Two' ('tea
for you and cakes for me') and 'Black eyes' (in Russian).
To love Soderstrom has been to love life itself, for her range was so wide.
The evening stirred memories of all the ways she has enchanted us over the
years - in opera, in recital, on record, in the printed page, on TV, in
chat-shows, talking on the radio; in numerous languages; in music by umpteen
composers.
She loves apparent self-contradiction: as in an interview in Opera when,
having just said 'I hate modern opera,' she then said her favourite role was
the Governess in The Turn of the Screw. She has been the most spontaneous of
singers, the most hilarious and endearing, and she has been among the most
musical and moving.
She gave, in The Makropoulos Case, the greatest physical performance in
opera I have seen - conveying sensuousness, coldness, wit, urgency and all
the weight of a 300-year life in her stance and her every step. Perhaps my
favourite memory is of her third encore at a Covent Garden recital, when,
just as she was singing the echo in a Scandinavian echo song, a police siren
outside the opera house sounded so like yet another echo that she began
laughing and refused to sing another note.
She is 65, and sang her last opera - Poulenc's La Voix humaine - early last
week. So, on this occasion, dressed in black tights and loose shirt a la
Judy Garland, she sang 'Nobody loves a fairy when she's forty', pointing the
lines 'They want a bit of magic from a younger bit of stuff,' and 'I'd
rather be a has-been than a never-was' without malice, and earning her
biggest laugh with 'You stand there crying 'What-ho]' - but they all pass by
your grotto.' She also sang 'Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs
Worthington' memorably.
Amazing to find that she could give new meaning to something as familiar as
Cole Porter's 'Night and day' or as thin as Sondheim's 'Send in the clowns'.
The fact that the evening also included the Swedish folk song that Ambroise
Thomas incorporated into the mad scene in Hamlet, a Piaf song, and Clara
Schumann's setting of a Heine poem about love is typical of her
extraordinary diversity.
To talk of her art in the past tense is hard. True, her prime passed more
than 10 years ago. True, her voice has become increasingly threadbare. It is
also true that she has always continued to enrich our lives, because she
remained so musical. Her encore, by the way, was 'Bed? Bed? I couldn't go to
bed. . . I could have danced all night.' As so often, we believed her.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Edinburgh Festival: A calm debut - reviews the off-stage
action / Off The Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIAN McMASTER is that rare bird in the roll call of directors of the
Edinburgh Festival - quiet and self-effacing. His calmness was invaluable in
putting together this, his first Festival, with only six months' planning;
it has probably helped to ensure that the festival, which closes today, has
gone so peacefully. It should even reach its box-office revenue target.
The critics have already delivered their verdict on McMaster's four-prong
programme. The Tchaikovsky glut of 30 pieces is reckoned a success, with
some wonderful solo recitals; the crash course in Scottish music is regarded
as a necessary sop to the locals; and, of the two playwrights put under the
microscope, Harley Granville Barker was deemed interesting and worthy of
more revivals, while CP Taylor will never enjoy such coverage again. The
dance programme was good.
The rain hit the box-office, but about 65 per cent of tickets were sold and
theatre takings are up on last year - satisfaction for McMaster, a music
man, over his predecessor, Frank Dunlop, a theatre man. Unfortunately, the
Festival has invested in a national tour of Barker's 'The Voysey
Inheritance,' which has failed to excite the citizens of Woking. Losses here
could destroy McMaster's hope of reducing his inherited deficit of Pounds
179,000 in his first Festival.
McMaster is entering what should be an encouraging future for the Edinburgh
Festival. The new Royal Lyceum Theatre was open this year and proved a
splendid asset; in 1994 Edinburgh at last gets its opera house, with the old
Empire becoming the new Festival Theatre. Sponsors, and local authorities,
and the Scottish Arts Council seem happy to contribute over 50 per cent of
the Pounds 4.5m revenue needed to hold the Festival.
There have been disappointments. Cristina Hoyos was not very popular, and
the Taylor plays suffered from opening cold. Next year should be better,
with opera making a come-back, probably Janacek and Verdi involving Scottish
Opera. Other lessons digested include organising more events on the busy
Bank Holiday Sunday; greater efforts to attract overseas visitors above the
current 15 per cent of customers; and another go at an all-embracing
marketing umbrella involving the Fringe, the film and the TV festivals. It
remains a reproach that about a third of the seats were not filled. The 1992
Edinburgh Festival will not live forever in the memory, but it was enjoyable
enough at any level, and a great achievement, given the recession.
* * * Among the sights of Edinburgh this week was David Mellor, the Heritage
Minister, coming out of summer hibernation to score easy boundaries off an
audience of arts worthies assembled at the city's new pride and joy, the
hi-tec Traverse Theatre.
Mellor can say 'no' - he has decided against saving intact the 15th-century
timber-framed house, Pitchford Hall in Shropshire and its contents, because
he recalls the disaster of government ownership of Hevingham Hall - but he
said 'yes' or 'maybe' to most of the demands of the lobbyists.
Slowly his policies are taking shape. There are surprises. The Lotteries
Bill will be presented to parliament this year and Mellor will fight any
debilitating changes. By 1994 he expects lottery money to be boosting the
arts. It seems that the existing institutions - the Arts Council, the Sports
Council, the Museum and Galleries Commission - will allocate the funds
rather than some new Lotteries organisation. And Lottery money will go
towards revenue funding of the arts as well as big capital projects such as
the proposed dance theatre for London.
After two years of subsidy increases way ahead of inflation the arts must
expect a more modest improvement in grant from this year's battle with the
Treasury. But Mellor should gain more than the proposed 3 per cent. The
government still believes in the arts, and, compared with the other
candidates for cash, a few extra millions here makes a big splash.
As for Covent Garden: in spite of press reports of icy glances Mellor and
Jeremy Isaacs, the Royal Opera House's director, enjoyed dinner together at
last month's Bayreuth Festival. Mellor, with memories of enduring a poor
performance by Domingo in a Pounds 180 seat, still wants Covent Garden to
become more accessible, but he is prepared to tackle the issue rather than
pursue a personal vendetta against Isaacs.
* * * The best farce at Edinburgh this year has been over the various
awards, which now come fast and furious. Such gongs are useful in helping
visitors choose between well over 1,000 shows on offer, but a comprehensive
rationalisation is needed.
A Japanese entrepreneur, a Mr Hamada, has attempted to buy himself artistic
fame, both by presenting his own plays at Edinburgh and by throwing money at
the Festival. As well as donations to both Festival and Fringe, this year he
is offering two prizes, each of Pounds 25,000, for what are judged the best
drama and musical events. This pitches companies such as the National
Theatre against the Mark Morris Dance Group, for the drama award, and
Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron against the solo recital by the Russian mezzo,
Olga Borodina. All the big splashy events have received nominations - but
representation by the Fringe is limited. Those that have might get much
more; those that need seem frozen out.
The most celebrated Fringe award, the Perrier, also needs overhauling. The
money, Pounds 2,000, is too little, although the fame greatly increases the
earning power of the winner - this year comedians Steve Coogan, working with
John Thomson. The Perrier has dug itself into a hole by concentrating on
cabaret and revue; its nominations are weighted towards the almost-famous,
playing the big Fringe venues. It should try and hunt out rawer talent, or
be all-embracing and give the money to the best act on the Fringe - even if
it does not need a career boost.
Cellnet's attempt to make prizes more democratic by sponsoring an award
based on the phoned-in votes of the public proved brave but doomed. It fell
victim to lobbying, and in the end the judges overruled the people and chose
the Cauld Blast Orchestra as the winner.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Fishermen all at sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE 'amphibians' of Billy Roche's new play for the RSC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
at The Pit in London's Barbican - are the fishermen of Wexford, or more
exactly the about-to-be ex-fisherfolk. One had always suspected that Wexford
might be a bit dull outside Festival-time, and so it seems here to be.
Roche's three previous Wexford plays have been widely admired; perhaps the
onus of an RSC commission was the wrong kind of challenge for him.
Of his 11 characters ten are of fisherfolk-stock, and the eleventh is the
plump young inheritor (educated upper-middle) of the town factory, which
employs the people who can no longer live by fishing. He is called Brian
Taylor; the others are called names like Humpy and Broaders and Dribbler (a
devoted fan of the novelist Louis l'Amour). Wexford's rivers and coast, we
are told, are steadily more polluted, and poor Eagle - still an independent
soul - cannot catch enough to support his wife and his young son Isaac.
The two days of the action are the last before he too signs on at the
factory. Meanwhile he escorts Isaac to his 'traditional', manhood-proving
night alone on Useless Island (I think I heard that right), erotic tensions
and envy - notably between Eagle's sister Sonia, her rejected swain Zak and
her new beau Mr Taylor - simmer away, and all the actors take decent
advantage of their individual turns. There is a lot of Irish chitchat, no
doubt quite realistic, some routine invective and folk-singing, and several
quaintly spun yarns.
We realise early on that something nasty must happen on Useless Island to
bring matters to a head. At long last, it does - but any of several
alternative scenarios might have done as well. Dramatic inevitability is not
on offer, nor any delving into character. Perhaps Roche has been too
generous to his extended cast, with the result that the most prominent roles
seem under-written and under-explored: Eagle and his worried wife, and
especially lovelorn Zak, who surely deserves more attention. Young Isaac,
who might have supplied a poignant focus, is played modestly and seriously
by 13-year-old Kevin Burke, but with a piping voice (we missed a lot of his
words) and a bland face which deny us entry to his thoughts.
Though the distant lights of Wexford look pretty from the island, as
imagined by Michael Taylor and Geraint Pughe, the mainland sets are
cluttered and clumsy. As Zak, Eagle and his upwardly-mobile sister, Barry
Lynch, Ian McElhinney and Lesley McGuire make us wish we could know them
better.
I admired the other women, Hilary Cromie and Jane Gurnett, no less than
Albie Woodington's lusty pub-turn as Dribbler and Sean Murray's Broaders,
whose bumptious cynicism insinuates something over the top long before the
gory climax. Everybody else plays up with spirit, though we have seen clones
of Lalor Roddy's dim, convulsive Humpy too often before. Michael
Attenborough directs.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Edinburgh Festival: Shared aims and age-old traditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S oldest music festival, the Three Choirs, outstrips Edinburgh by two
centuries, its antecedents reaching back to the Restoration. The annual
programme strives to maintain a balance between tradition and innovation,
with large choral works its forte - a staggering number are mounted within
the space of a week, with the conducting shared between the three cathedral
organists of Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester.
This year's director, John Sanders, produced perhaps the week's outstanding
performance, a Bach B minor Mass, in which all aspects gelled: precise
chorus intonation, distinctive soloists led by Emma Kirkby,
period-instrument clarity from the Brandenburg Consort.
The premieres were mixed. Alongside a slightly dull brass piece from Hugh
Wood and an unexpectedly-imaginative anthem from John Rutter came Philip
Cannon's A Ralegh Triptych, settings of three poems penned in anticipation
of execution. The angularity of Cannon's spare A Cappella writing poses a
challenge. That it came across well was due to the boys' alertness in tuning
and attentive direction by Donald Hunt. Cannon merits unearthing: his
Ligeti-inspired Quartet, Chansons for soprano and harp or the Oraison
Funebre de l'Ame Humaine for strings, all manifestly called for revival.
Despite a valiant effort by the tenor, Maldwyn Davies, a tiring Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra just took the edge off Finzi's sumptuous Wordsworth
setting, Ode to Immortality, whose word-painting is as delicate as
Britten's. A different problem is set in Janacek's inspirational Glagolitic
Mass. For all the flair in big climaxes, flat choral enunciation merge with
a lethargic orchestral reading. The work has much in common with Janacek's
pliant operatic writing, yet only John Mitchinson, the veteran tenor, found
the required energy for its impassioned Gloria and Credo. The show was saved
by Mark Lee, the young organ soloist, whose playing proved one of the
distinctions of the week. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rose to
the Processional finale like an idle schoolboy runner who surges
ostentatiously to the finishing line.
Of the visitors, Richard Hickox followed a scintillating Elgar Alassio with
a Mahler Fourth Symphony of breath-taking indifference. But Michael
Berkeley's ritualised, Messiaenic organ concerto (its inflections suggest a
debt to Jehan Alain) easily proved its repertoire worth, with Thomas Trotter
an articulate soloist. More striking was Meredith Davies conducting EJ
Moeran's cello concerto, eloquently played by Raphael Wallfisch, who has
also recorded the work for Chandos. Davies's direction proved something of a
revelation: he has been too long exiled from the podium.
Chief pleasure of a buoyant Fringe was Nicola-Jane Kemp's song recital,
setting Schubert and Wolf alongside a new cycle by Gloucester composer,
Christopher Boodle. There were two literary tributes. A new biography of
Hubert Parry, harbinger of the English revival, was prefaced by an
enthusiastic talk from its author, Jeremy Dibble, at Parry's own Highnam
Church, Paul Spicer's lecture celebrating the centenary of Herbert Howells
set the tone for the week. Musical examples, especially those from an
earlier period, left one in no doubt that Howells' importance in the British
canon calls for reassessment.
This summer also brought a new history of the Three Choirs by Anthony Boden,
a canny sifter of anecdote, as his books on the Gloucester poets, Ivor
Gurney and FW Harvey, have already shown. A sense of fun pervades Three
Choirs (Alan Sutton, Pounds 20), whose meticulous research starts with the
Civil War period and Restoration and supplants dry annals by a colourful,
though never trite, account of the festival.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Swan wins order for Tyne ferry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced yesterday that it had won
an order worth almost Pounds 1.4m for a new cross-Tyne ferry.
The 200-tonne vessel's size is very modest by warship builders' standards,
but Swan's success in clinching the contract signals the company's entry
into the small ships market, where it hopes to win further work.
Swan Hunter Engineering, part of the Wallsend-based group, overcame stiff
competition from six UK yards and one in Germany. It will be the smallest
vessel to be built by the company since privatisation it was privatised in
1986.
The new Tyne ferry will be among the first to incorporate new safety
measures developed by the Department of Transport following the sinking of
the Marchioness on the River Thames in London in 1989, in which 51 people
died.
The contract, placed by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive,
will provide work for 40 men for eight months. Work starts next month. It
will not stave off job losses at Swan Hunter.

FT  05 SEP 92 / National Power in deal to sell gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the privatised electricity generator, said yesterday it had
signed a deal with Bord Gais Eireann, the Irish Gas Board, to supply it with
natural gas in the event of unexpected shortfalls.
The generator is ready to supply BGE with up to 1.2m therms of gas a day at
short notice in times of high demand. The five-year agreement - the first of
its kind - begins in autumn next year.
Gas will be supplied from National Power's portfolio of supplies using
British Gas's transmission network to Moffatt, in Scotland, from where it
will be delivered through the interconnector pipeline being constructed
beneath the Irish Sea.
Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said: 'This agreement is an
example of the value of international co-operation in relation to energy
supplies, which we believe could be enhanced by increasing liberalisation of
energy markets.'
The deal is further evidence of increasing crossover between the electricity
and gas sectors since the government's energy privatisation programme. Rival
generator PowerGen already has an interest in gas marketing through
Kinetica, a joint venture with oil company Conoco.
Several regional electricity companies have also formed joint ventures with
gas producers. Enron, one of the largest gas companies in the US, which is
part of a consortium building a gas-fired power station at ICI's Wilton site
in Teesside, signalled its intention last month to become an important gas
marketer by buying up gas interests in the North Sea.
National Power said yesterday it was 'looking at all opportunities' for
marketing more of its gas.
'We have a programme of building gas-fired power stations, and have built up
a strong portfolio of gas supplies, so the marketing opportunities are
there.'
National Power acquired a small quantity of gas in June through British
Gas's release programme - in which BG is selling off some of its contracted
gas to competitors to reduce its share of the industrial market. The
generator said it would use this to gain marketing experience.
Meanwhile, the gap between UK gas prices and those in Europe continues to
widen, according to the quarterly survey of prices carried out by
consultants Energy Advice and British Gas.
The UK's 18m household gas customers pay 8 per cent less than those in
Netherlands, 27 per cent less than in the former West Germany, and almost 50
per cent less than those in Italy.
The figures are based on prices at the beginning of July this year, and do
not take account of the further 2 per cent cut in prices that will come into
effect on October 1.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gill hits back over Pounds 50,000 payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN GILL, who retired last week as general secretary of MSF, the general
technical union, yesterday hit back at critics who accused him of hypocrisy
by accepting a lump-sum leaving payment of more than Pounds 50,000 on top of
his pension of two thirds of his final salary of Pounds 55,000.
Several other union leaders have recently received even more generous
pay-offs, sometimes related to leaving early, and usually as a result of
generous clauses for officials in union merger agree-ments.
Mr Gill, who was also a past chairman of the TUC's equal rights committee,
said that the payment to him was based on a formula of 1.5 per cent of
salary for every year's service which applied 'to all staff and officials of
MSF'.
When the union was formed out of the merger of ASTMS, the white-collar union
and Tass the technical union, in 1988, all Tass staff - plus Mr Gill the
general secretary - received the superior benefits enjoyed by ASTMS,
includ-ing the leaving payment formula.
Mr Gill is also keeping his Ford Scorpio car but says that he chose a
second-hand one, saving the union Pounds 12,000.
He believes that the news of his retirement terms have been leaked by his
political enemies in the union which has now been taken over by Mr Roger
Lyons, widely regarded as more of a pragmatist.
Mr Gill said that if he had left a year or two early he could have picked up
a payment much higher even than the Pounds 220,000 received by Mr Clive
Jenkins, former leader of ASTMS, who left before official retirement.
Other high payments in recent months include the Pounds 148,000 paid to Ms
Brenda Dean, 49, who left the print union GPMU under a special agreement
arising from the merger which produced GPMU from the two main print unions.
Mr Roy Evans, leader of the ISTC steel union, also received a leaving
payment of about Pounds 100,000.
Although the health of trade union finances has recently improved slightly
following a severe deterioration in the late 1980s, most unions have been
forced to make painful cuts and increase member's subscriptions sharply.
Six of the 10 biggest unions, including the MSF, performed better in 1991
than 1990 and all six produced a surplus.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Man in the News: Smooth scourge of low standards - John
Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few things more calculated to touch a raw nerve with parents than
the suggestion that the standard of their children's school examinations has
fallen.
So when Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week demanded an
urgent inquiry into the reliability of GCSE results, he provoked a
predictable furore.
Educational traditionalists who fought the replacement in 1988 of the
two-tier system of O-levels and CSEs with a single test for all 15- and
16-year-olds were delighted. They believe that egalitarianism has eroded
standards, particularly for bright children.
What Mr Patten would call the educational establishment was furious.
Teachers' unions accused him of undermining real improvements in GCSE
performance. Political opponents seized on his record as an unabashed
self-publicist to accuse him of seeking cheap headlines before next month's
Tory party conference.
At the heart of the controversy was Mr Patten's strong reaction to a report
by Her Majesty's Inspectorate into the record level of passes in this year's
GCSEs.
The report said that there was evidence pointing to a gradual erosion in
standards since 1988. It suggested that the quality of testing by the
independent boards which set and mark the examinations was uneven. HMI's
inspectors were concerned that it was too easy for children to achieve the
top grades and insufficient attention was paid to punctuation and spelling.
Alongside these criticisms was the more measured comment that many of the
shortcomings were neither new nor easy to solve.
Even opponents of the GCSE acknowledge that standards among the examining
boards which set O-levels often varied widely. Mr Patten does not recall it,
but the Jesuit-run grammar school he attended in south London frequently
directed pupils to different O and A-level boards to maximise pass rates.
The full report was published only yesterday. But the education secretary
seized the initiative by releasing the most damning extracts at the start of
the week and demanding a response from the boards by the end of this month.
The handling of the announcement could have been subtler. Parents and
children who a week earlier had been celebrating examination passes found
the achievements devalued.
Mr Patten is unrepentant: 'What the report tells us is that there are
serious question marks over the way the examining process has been
conducted.'
It was vital to seek an urgent response, he said, because whatever remedial
action was necessary would have to be taken before next summer's
examinations. 'At this stage every single week counts if it is to be got
right.'
But Mr Patten - who stressed that one of his principal objectives was to
achieve a period of 'peace and quiet in the classrooms' - is adamant that he
had not sought to provoke new controversy.
He had not known of the existance of the HMI study until the results landed
on his desk 10 days ago. He had intended to spend this month working on the
school restructuring outlined in his July white paper: 'I would have much
preferred not to have this report on my desk.'
Nor, he insisted, should his reaction be taken as an attack on the nation's
classrooms: 'The criticisms are aimed not at pupils, not at teachers, not at
teachers' training colleges. They are aimed fairly and squarely at the
examining boards.'
His response to the ensuing row is likely to disappoint both the
traditionalists and those conjuring up fears of a new Tory plot to engineer
the return of the O-level.
Mr Patten is a politician shrewd enough not to slam the door entirely on the
traditionalists but, asked whether his starting point was to improve the
GCSE rather than scrap it, he replied simply: 'Sure.' An 'awful lot', he
added, could be put right within the present framework: 'I certainly hope
that we can make a single examination work.'
The furore provides an intriguing insight into the way Mr Patten intends to
run the schools system over the next few years.
On one level, his appointment after the April general election marked a
break with the past. The 47-year-old former university lecturer is as
self-consciously smooth as his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, is
instinctively abrasive.
He is the product of the state system and sends his six-year-old daughter to
a central London primary. He has long had a professional interest in
education. His overall approach is infused with the moralism that comes with
devout Catholicism.
His appointment sent a signal to the teachers that, after the upheavals of
the past few years, the government was anxious to rebuild classroom morale.
The white paper carried the same message. The radical thrust of the shift to
grant-maintained status would continue but there would be no 'big bang'. The
process instead would be 'evolutionary'. Local education authorities will
wither rather than face outright abolition.
Peace in the classroom, however, is not to be bought at any price. Mr Patten
is determined, for example, to grasp a political nettle long avoided by
education secretaries and reduce the 1.5m surplus places in the nation's
schools.
More importantly, this week's row signals that he has no intention of
retreating from the Conservative assault on the 'progressive' teaching of
the 1960s and 1970s.
The education secretary is an ambitious politician. Until his appointment in
April he had been stranded on the fringe of the cabinet for five years. He
is acutely aware that there is no political future for a Tory education
secretary who is perceived to be soft on the educational establishment.
So making friends with the teachers does not mean making up with their
unions or with the progressive educational theorists said by the government
to dominate the local education authorities and teacher training colleges.
Nor does it mean accepting an erosion of what the average Tory voter might
define as standards. Peace and quiet, in other words, is to be relative.

FT  05 SEP 92 / High marks for Mitterrand show: France's TV debate on
Maastricht has helped to calm the electorate's worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is touch and go, but it looks as if France's baffled European Community
partners can start to breathe a bit more easily.
The signs are that French President Francois Mitterrand's magisterial
television appearance before an audience of 8.3m viewers on Thursday evening
has helped to calm his disillusioned electorate's fears of the consequences
of accepting the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
It is, however, too early to predict whether his three-hour performance,
backed by an appearance from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, will turn the
fine balance between the Yes and No vote into a firm majority when France
votes on the treaty on September 20. A poll by the CSA institute last night
showed a swing to a 55 per cent majority in favour of the treaty, but this
is still a long way short of the majority of nearly 70 per cent in favour in
early June, when Mr Mitterrand announced a referendum.
The debate was clouded by the peculiarities of French politics. Yet it also
underscored certain general weaknesses in the Maastricht treaty, which are
there to be exploited by its opponents in other EC countries.
Mr Mitterrand achieved two important objectives under questioning from a
panel of 14 supposedly representative citizens, three journalists and a
surprisingly emollient Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist former government
minister who leads the anti-Maastricht campaign.
First, he cooled the temperature of what has been until now an emotional and
ill-informed public wrangle. He avoided the temptation to predict Armageddon
in the event of a No, saying instead that Europe would lose several years in
its development - a moderate argument that is bound to increase his
credibility, battered by rising unemployment, perceived remoteness from the
electorate and party political scandals.
At the same time, Mr Mitterrand sought to calm fears of loss of sovereignty
by reminding viewers that the treaty was designed to 'protect France and
Europe from the free-for-all that would have followed the simple application
of the Single European Act', the 1985 treaty which paved the way for the
abolition of trade barriers between member states.
Second, he resisted pressure from both pro- and anti-Maastricht campaigners
to consider resignation, at least for the time being, in the process helping
to take France's tangled domestic politics out of the debate.
All this should encourage the electorate to lay aside their own feelings
about the increasingly unpopular president and focus on the real issues in
the treaty when they vote. Yet even if the French do manage to boil down the
debate to the nuts and bolts of the treaty - economic and monetary union,
plus security and foreign policy co-ordination - the balance between the Yes
and No camps is painfully fine.
The show uncovered a gamut of gripes about the European Community as it is
now and as it would be were Maastricht to be ratified by the 12 EC member
states. They ranged from loss of economic sovereignty, to fears of German
domination, an autocratic Brussels bureaucracy and the shackling of French
diplomacy to its EC partners.
The gripes also centre on issues that have nothing to do with the treaty,
such as immigration, which might seem ironic from one of the few countries
to have ratifed the Schengen free travel accord, which sets a common visa
policy for its eight signatories. Working hours, the threat from Japanese
industrial competition and the future of farming were other strictly
non-Maastricht issues - all the daily bread of French politics - thrown into
the debate by the citizens' panel.
It could be that the French public has woken late to the general obligations
of existing EC membership and that Maastricht has snapped the country out of
its Euro-doze with a nasty start.
This might seem surprising to other Europeans who think of France as a
self-confident wielder of power in an EC it has largely designed. But it is
understandable given that the current campaign is, as Mr Mitterrand sadly
admits, France's first proper debate on Europe for 40 years.
Mr Mitterrand took a risk by agreeing to appear at all, just as he did in
deciding on June 3 to call a referendum, when the treaty could have been
ratified by parliamentary procedure. Many pro-treaty campaigners feared he
might do more harm than good by appearing on television this week, by
linking people's feelings about Maastricht with the Socialist government's
image.
Perhaps, argued some commentators, the Yes cause would have been better
served by an opposition party leader favourable to Maastricht. Candidates
include former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the
centre-right UDF, or Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR. A majority
of their supporters are against Maastricht, so unlike Mr Mitterrand they
would not just be preaching to the converted among their party rank and
file. And they pull more votes than the Socialists, who won a mere 18.3 per
cent of the vote in March's regional elections.
In the event, Mr Mitterrand performed with cool audacity, betraying not a
hint of worry over his unpopularity. 'How can I be Mr Seguin's opponent?' he
joked. 'I am president of all the French, including Mr Seguin.'
Few leaders can speak unscripted for so long without making a blunder, let
alone sweltering under spotlights in an echoing hall of the Sorbonne. Mr
Mitterrand seemed positively to flourish under pressure, smiling with
satisfaction as he thought up answers to aggressive questions. The wily old
fox may be temporarily cornered, but he is not finished by a long chalk.
As usual, when pushed on his own future, he was enigmatic. Some, including
his own supporters, have urged Mr Mitterrand to resign to guarantee a Yes,
while the opposition is obviously urging him to stand down in the event of a
No. 'I will take the responsibilities that fall to me' a day or so after the
result is known, said Mr Mitterrand.
'If it is true that I do that much harm to the treaty of Maastricht, then I
must take the greatest possible account of the advice of my adversaries and
others - but do you think that it has got to that point?' he added.
If the Mitterrand show might help to soothe French agonising over
Maastricht, it is less certain that it succeeded in laying to rest all the
popular fears of the consequences of European union as underlined by Mr
Seguin. He did not draw as much blood as he could have done, perhaps
conscious that he might again become a minister if the right wins next
March's parliamentary elections, as seems likely.
However, he drove hard at a theme that strikes a chord in many member
states, by complaining of the weight of 'technocratic' rule from Brussels.
This has become a sensitive point on all political sides in France over the
past year, with several Commission rulings against French industrial
interests.
Mr Seguin pushed Mr Mitterrand on to weak ground by referring to the prime
role which the Maastricht treaty gives to the European central bank in
running the eventual single currency. Economics have never been Mr
Mitterrand's strongest suit.
The president agreed that technocrats could be 'cold monsters', but stressed
that it would be 'politicians, elected by universal suffrage, and not the
technocrats' who would decide overall economic policy. The criteria by which
economies must bring their inflation levels, budget deficits and interest
rates to converge would be applied with the utmost sensitivity, he said.
Political control over the central bank was France's negotiating aim in the
long wrangling over Maastricht. But it is not at all clear in the Maastricht
text whether France really achieved its aim of keeping the 'economic
government' of Europe out of the hands of unelected central bankers. It was
of course Germany's minimum demand over Maastricht that the central bank be
properly insulated from political pressure.
Mr Seguin must have made a telling point to many French viewers - victims of
some of the highest real interest rates in Europe - when he argued that
'anyone who has mastery of monetary policy has the main hand in setting and
carrying out economic policy'. In other words, how would the French like to
see their government's spending policy steered by European banking
officials?
Most of the talking on another French public worry, German domination, was
left to Mr Kohl, addressing the debate from his office in Bonn. Here, he
might have steered too close to the truth for the liking of touchy French
opinion in saying that France need not have an inferiority complex. He went
on, however, to sound more comforting, by pledging that a post-Maastricht
Europe would not be German, but belong to all member states. 'There is no
German demon,' he said. Take the 'advice of a friend', said the chancellor -
suddenly looking avuncular  - and vote Yes.
Another difficulty in selling Maastricht, as Mr Mitterrand found out on
Thursday night, is the special treatment it gives one country, Britain, on
monetary union and social policy.
As Mr Seguin noted, once France ratifies the treaty, it would have no chance
to opt out of a single currency as the UK will. Mr Mitterrand finessed the
issue of Britain's opt-out on social policy, saying one needed 'patience, as
in all families', for everyone to agree. But it became clear on Thursday
that for proponents of EC labour regulation, Britain's opt-out on social
policy is a serious flaw, while for opponents of such regulation it is an
unfair privilege.
It is doubly odd for Mr Seguin, and other No compaigners, to rail gainst
Maastricht for shutting eastern Europe out, when fears of people and food
flooding into France from the east are precisely those that rally people to
their cause.
But the fear of loss of national identity is what lies behind the anxieties
raised by Mr Seguin and others. Nevertheless, the sovereignty card is a hard
one for a Gaullist to play against Mr Mitterrand, who has all the
haughtiness of De Gaulle.
'You cannot give the impression,' he told Mr Seguin, 'that France is
suddenly losing its sovereignty, and submitting itself to foreign
domination. Do you think I could accept that any more than you?'
At the very least, Mr Mitterrand's rare television debate has regained some
of the ground lost by the Yes campaign. Those among his supporters who
thought that calling the September 20 referendum was a crazy risk must now
be breathing a sigh of relief. Yet he is not home and dry.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Putting a floor under markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE whose first experience of markets was gained under the Bretton
Woods fixed exchange rate system, the events of the past week on the
European exchanges will have looked thoroughly familiar. In the argot of
central bankers, fixed rate systems make the financial system crunchy; and
the best insurance that governments can take out against a financial crunch
is policy credibility. Within the European exchange rate mechanism Britain,
with its well-judged Pounds 7.3bn foreign currency borrowing package on
Thursday, had just enough of that commodity left to put off an unwelcome
interest rate rise. Italy, in contrast, was unable yesterday to defer the
crunch. It raised short-term interest rates by a swingeing 1 3/4 points to
15 per cent and the markets are still far from convinced that the lira has
been stabilised.
That does not mean that Britain is out of the woods, for want of a better
phrase. By borrowing in D-Marks it raised the cost of any future
devaluation, which is the kind of gamble that foreign exchange markets find
reassuring. But while the British are playing by the rules of a fixed
exchange rate system in which the D-Mark provides the main anchor, the
Americans are playing a game of their own in which the rules are purely
domestic. After yesterday's dismal US employment data there appeared to be
no alternative to further cuts in short-term dollar rates. Sterling could
thus wilt again, since it tends to feel the backwash when capital deserts
the dollar for the D-Mark.
The larger question, as European finance ministers meet in Bath this
weekend, is how much more of this hard pounding the currencies of the ERM
can take. Under the old Bretton Woods system, realignments were permitted
when a currency was in fundamental disequilibrium and exchange rates could
only be shored up at the cost of undesirable distortions in domestic
economic policy. The system broke down when disagreements between the US and
Europe over underlying policy became irreconcilable, after the Americans
refused to confront the crunch to which their fiscal policy was leading
during the Vietnam war.
Exporting deflation
This time the US-European differences are being managed through the
mechanism of floating exchange rates. The more painful policy conflict is
within Europe, where the combination of loose fiscal policy and tight money
in Germany has had the effect of exporting deflation to the rest of Europe
via the fixed exchange rates of the ERM. Given that the French electorate's
misgivings about Maastricht partly reflect this depressing German influence
on French unemployment, it was ironic that President Mitterrand should have
called on Chancellor Kohl for support in his broadcast on Thursday night.
While the Bundesbank has taken most of the flak, Mr Kohl, whose
determination to avoid hard fiscal choices has been one of the more striking
features of the German unification process, offers a more deserving target.
The French referendum on September 20 is widely regarded as a test that
could lead to a resolution of this economic conflict one way or another. Yet
that seems implausible. Despite the apocalyptic rhetoric that permeates the
debate, the ERM will survive, whatever happens to European Monetary Union.
France, for one, will not lightly abandon the franc fort. The real question
is who will stay within the hard core of the system.
Vicious circle
The European finance ministers will no doubt do their best to shore up
confidence this weekend. But Italy is an enduring problem. A crisis in which
real interest rates are approaching 12 per cent will usefully strengthen the
Italian government's hand in pushing through unpalatable budgetary medicine.
Yet with the lira trading below its D-Mark floor yesterday afternoon, the
markets are still not convinced that the medicine is tough enough. Italy is
caught in a vicious circle whereby an increase in interest rates further
undermines credibility because of the impact on an already excessive budget
deficit.
Britain in many ways poses a more interesting conundrum. An interest rate
rise may have been avoided before the politically sensitive party conference
season. But the combination of a stagnant economy, an overhang of private
sector debt and sharply deteriorating public finances is not designed to
buttress credibility over a longer period. Nor does a robust economic
recovery seem compatible with any realistic assessment of German monetary
policy for the foreseeable future.
In the short run real interest rates continue to rise as inflation comes
down. House prices, according to the Halifax Building Society, are still
falling. Corporate profits, witness the interim figures now emerging, are
squeezed. In the absence of a deus ex machina Mr Major's government may yet
be forced to choose between maintaining a fixed exchange rate and dealing
with what appears to be an increasingly serious financial crisis.
Credibility, on unchanged policy, is a wasting asset.

<TEXT>
MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, yesterday purged a third
of her cabinet in a move designed to emphasise unemployment as the
government's priority, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo.
Most significant is the appointment of Mr Gunnar Berge as local government
minister in charge of labour issues, which was formerly the responsibility
of the ministry of labour and administration.
Mr Berge is Mrs Brundtland's closest party political ally and has also
strongly backed her strategy to lead Norway into the European Community.
Norway's unemployment, at 7.6 per cent including those on government
training schemes, is at a post-war high and has been the single biggest
issue undermining Labour support. A general election is due next year.

THE US Defence Department yesterday awarded a Dollars 689m (Pounds 346m)
contract to a team of aerospace companies, headed by Lockheed Corporation,
to develop an anti-missile system to replace the Patriot, Reuter reports
from Washington.
The rockets in the new system - Theatre High-Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) -
would be smaller and faster than those of the Patriot and are intended to
counter ballistic missiles with ranges from about 50 to 1,800 miles.
During the Gulf war, the Patriot felled Iraqi Scud missiles in Saudia Arabia
and Israel, but it was noted that the Scuds were relatively unsophisticated
and one of them evaded the Patriot, killing 28 US personnel in a barracks in
Saudi Arabia.
The THAAD would be a component of the Strategic Defence Initiative against
ballistic missiles that the US still wants to develop.
The 48-month contract will fund design, fabrication and tests of a
demonstration weapon system, 20 missiles for tests and components of a
prototype system including command and control units and mobile
missile-launchers.
Other companies to work on the contract include divisions of Honeywell,
Rockwell International, Westinghouse Electric, and United Technologies.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Italian action fails to boost lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY forced up interest rates yesterday by 1.75 percentage points, the
biggest increase in 11 years, and drew on international central bank credits
in a fresh attempt to protect the lira.
The rise in the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 15 per cent, the highest
since 1985, was accompanied by further heavy intervention but gave no
significant boost to the lira.
The Italian currency finished a nervous European trading day close to its
floor in the European Monetary System against the D-Mark.
The international efforts to bolster the lira, backed by the German and
Belgian central banks, represented one of the largest EMS support operations
since the last full-scale realignment nearly six years ago.
In spite of the action, the lira closed in Milan at its EMS floor of 765.40
against the D-Mark. In London it closed just off its floor at 765.0.
Italian commercial banks said they would match the discount rate increase
with a matching rise in their interest rates charged to customers.
The discount rate move was accompanied by increases in short-term money
market rates, which yesterday were about 18 per cent. Mr Giovanni Agnelli,
chairman of the Fiat group, was quoted as saying: 'We are very concerned.
Interest rates have reached unbearable levels for industry.'
The Bank of Italy said the lira had become vulnerable after the UK's move on
Thursday to borrow Ecu10bn of foreign currencies to prop up sterling. This
shifted international selling pressure from the pound to the lira.
In intervening to support the lira, the Bundesbank and Belgian central bank
were acting under EMS rules requiring automatic action to prop up weak
currencies once they touch their floor.
Although the Italian authorities insisted the country was not running short
of foreign exchange reserves, the Bank of Italy's convertible currency
holdings have fallen sharply during the lira's weakness of the past two
months.
The last published figures for Italy's foreign currency reserves at the end
of July showed a total of L27,808bn against L38,583bn the previous month and
L66,513bn in July 1991.
Partly in response to this drain on reserves, the Bank of Italy announced
yesterday it was making use of EMS credit facilities enabling it to borrow
unlimited amounts of strong currencies for up to 2 1/2 months to defend the
lira's parity.
Using foreign currency drawn from the other EMS central banks, the Bank of
Italy intervened early in the day selling DM890m and BFr800m to protect the
lira. The Bundesbank, according to market dealers, bought L13bn at
yesterday's midday currency fixing.
By drawing on EMS credit facilities, the Bank of Italy appears anxious to
remind the Bundesbank in particular that the weakness of the lira does not
have repercussions only for Italy.
The Bundesbank's purchases of lira, as well as its loans of D-Marks to the
Italian central bank, can indirectly lead to an expansion of German banking
liquidity, counteracting the Bundesbank's efforts to hold down rapidly
rising monetary growth.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Insider dealing in UK gilts alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACEY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England has received reports of alleged insider dealing in the
gilts market before Thursday's announcement of the Treasury's Pounds 7.27bn
foreign currency funding.
The allegations of trading based on advanced knowledge of the announcement
centre on one of the four UK clearing banks and two foreign banks.
Gilt prices rose more than two points on Thursday after the announcement.
The currency programme could make up as much as 25 per cent of this year's
public sector borrowing requirement, reducing supply in the gilts market.
The banks involved in the initial part of the programme, a DM10bn syndicated
facility, had been in talks with the Bank for a week ahead of the
announcement. However, any insider knowledge may be hard to prove unless
purchases of gilts before the announcement were unusually large.
'If a formal complaint is made to the Bank of England we will, of course,
investigate it very thoroughly,' a Bank official said last night.

FT  05 SEP 92 / On the world's coldest mountain: Rebecca Stephens endured
sleepless nights and numbing storms trapped in a snowhole 14,000 ft up in
Alaska
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOUNT McKinley, Alaska: at 20,320 ft, the highest mountain in the North
American continent, and cold. By all accounts it is the coldest mountain of
any range. And one of the most crowded.
Big mountains - the biggest - attract climbers in their hordes, and on
McKinley in May there were scores, hundreds, who had flown in from gateways
across the world. Of these, a good half would fly home having stood on the
top. Or so said the book. 'Don't be fooled, though,' said a friend.
'McKinley isn't a mountain to be underestimated.'
These cautionary words from a veteran mountaineer rang in my ears, in a
snowhole. We were stuck - unable to climb higher, unwilling to climb down -
at some 14,000ft, forced by high winds to abandon our tents and burrow deep,
like high-altitude moles, underground. Four days, maybe five we'd been there
 -I forget.
One nameless, numberless day merged into another in an unstructured sort of
timelessness, in this northern land where darkness fell only a couple of
hours in 24. But we were comfortable, if a little cramped, three of us lying
prostrate one side of a snowy shelf on which we cooked, two on the other.
The ceiling by now had sagged under its own weight and that of the falling
snow so that sitting upright was made impossible. But we were warm,
relatively so: the temperature hovered around - 10'C. We ate and chatted,
brewed drinks and read and slept.
Only sleeping was a worry. At night, snow drifted, blocking the cave
entrance. No matter what we did, it drifted. We dug, built protective walls,
troughs and tunnels. Come morning, the entrance was always blocked. We had a
chimney, but this snowed over too, in spite of a protruding ski pole. What
happens if one runs short of air? Does one wake? Or fall peacefully into a
coma? I wanted to know.
Occasionally, we had to venture outside, for sanity's sake, or to use the
communal, extremely exposed, loo dug in the middle of this wilderness by
conscientious rangers in an attempt, successfully in the main, to keep the
mountain clean. We were not alone at 14,000ft. There were 60 or so, in a
large, snowy basin - Americans, Koreans, French, German, Swiss - all dug in,
waiting.
That morning of the fourth - or was it the fifth day? - I woke early, my
bladder wanting out. The boys were asleep. I pulled on windproofs over
layers of fleece, not shed since I had set foot on the mountain. Boots,
over-gaiters, gloves, hat, goggles, face-mask; I never left the cave with
less. And a shovel.
Gathering my strength, I dived into the entrance hall, which by now had been
excavated into an impressive 20ft long narrow, tunnel. I was forced to lie
on my belly, digging somewhere above my head and having no choice but to
shovel the snow back around my body so that I was cocooned, barely able to
move.
Three times I retreated, and three times forced myself back, until, at last,
I broke a window to the outside. But that is where I stopped. A storm blew
fiercely. Spindrift swirled round me, masking my goggles and freezing my
hands, and nothing in me could force my body through the tiny escape hole. I
retreated, close to tears; I was angry and frightened, defeated.
It got worse, that day; or sadder. A fortnight ago there had been 12 in our
party, enthusiastic on the lower, sunny slopes, and optimistic for the
summit. Four had forked off as planned to climb the arduous Cassin Ridge,
leaving eight of us on the less challenging, and more popular West Buttress;
the 'dog run', it's called. We could not fail.
It was three of our friends in the group of eight - Peter and Mike and Brian
 -who dug us out that morning. They occupied a neighbouring snowhole and we
had hardly seen them in days.
They had bad news. The temperature outside, they said, was - 38'C and the
wind speed at least 80mph. least. It was the worst weather on the mountain
in 30 years - my lifetime, damn it. And there were no signs of improvement.
They, and Sandy, our doctor, too, had pressing engagements at home, and
could not wait.
It was a sad decision, and a sad moment seeing them go. John Barry, the most
experienced mountaineer among us, and our leader, roped them up and sent
them on their way: 'Just stood there watching,' he said, 'till they
disappeared out of sight.' We could only imagine them retracing our steps
through the various camps to the landing strip at 7,200ft. By morning they'd
be on an aircraft to Talkeetna , then Anchorage and home.
Just the four of us now - John, myself, Dave Halton and a young lad of 22,
Paul Deegan; and that afternoon, of course, the sun shone.
'Should have persuaded them to stay,' muttered John. Maybe. Maybe they would
have done.
It felt so good to be out of the cave, stretching our legs and squinting all
the while into the sun. So beautiful in the sunshine: white and clean, and
warm. Sixty people enjoyed the same pleasures that afternoon, mingling and
chatting away, as if in a park on a Sunday.
But it was only a temporary reprieve. The following morning, Bob, a
down-suited American, fought his way through a storm and squeezed into our
cave. 'Heard the news? A Swiss guy, a guide, died in camp last night.
Cerebral oedema.' He went on: 'And that's not all. Two bodies have been
found on the Cassin, and three Koreans fell just here, on the Orient
Express. All dead.'
Six people. 'Do you know what that makes me think?' said John. I didn't
answer. 'This whole bloody game's a waste of time.'
But my mind was on the Cassin. Were they our guys, dead? 'It's not Bill and
Harry, or Smiler, or Brian. They're just too experienced.' John's words.
This unquestioning faith was all we had to hold on to.
For the first time I had serious doubts whether we would make it to the
summit. Spirits were low. This mountain was a killer, and the winds
continued to blow. We spent two, or three more days in that cave . . . and
then the weather changed, for a day.
Just the motion of moving, upwards, pumped energy back into our bones. We
travelled light now - just rucksacks, no sleds - up a steep 2,000ft climb on
to the buttress; and for an hour or so the sun shone so fiercely that it
seemed impossible that a storm could ever blow again, but no: the mountain
threw us its worst once more, thwarting our chance of climbing the length of
a ridge to an inviting plateau at 17,200ft.
We pitched our tents instead, short of the ridge on an exiguous, shark-fin
crest. We had no choice, other than going down. The temperature was
worryingly low; the wind, in gusts, knocked us to our knees, and when
finally we succeeded in pitching our tent, the poles buckled and the canvas
tore. We didn't sleep that night, uncomfortable in the knowledge that a
tent, plus occupants, had been blown off this very spot.
And it continued, a second night and a third. We were tiring, and time was
running short. Already we had missed our flight to London, and if I held on
one more day I'd lose my job. Others had worries too.
What to do? That last possible day for an ascent and the winds dropped a
little. The weather wasn't good, but it was fair.
We went for it.
Four thousand feet - from 16,000ft to more than 20,000ft - is a lot to climb
in a day, when the air's so thin. The oxygen was half that at sea level, and
we felt it. We moved slowly, painfully so.
'What do you think?' asked Dave. There was still a good way to go and it was
late, and cold. Gloves weren't removed for fear of frostbite.
'I'm not turning back now,' said John.
'Nor I'
We stood on the summit ridge of McKinley at about 9pm. It was perfectly
clear. The Alaska Range stretched before us, with light cloud filling the
valleys thousands of feet below. All was tinged pink and we were alone. And
there wasn't a whisper of wind.
Footnote: Our friends were not killed on Cassin Ridge, we learnt at base
camp. They started the climb, but retreated early in worsening weather. So
John was right.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Collecting: Bargain times in antique country - Antony
Thorncroft visits the Cotswolds where dealers are waiting out the recession
with quiet resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be stretching credulity to pretend that all is well with the
dealers in the Cotswolds in south central England, the second greatest
concentration of traders in important antiques outside London. The recession
has hit them hard for two years. Turnover has slumped - and there are few
signs of any immediate improvement.
But unlike London, few Cotswolds dealers have closed their shops. Most own
their premises and their running costs are much lower than in London. They
can survive on less custom and they have adapted to reduced circumstances.
Many are working more aggressively to attract business. The factors which
persuaded them to open in the Cotswolds - the relaxed pace of life, the
beauty of the countryside, the proximity of fellow dealers and connoisseur
customers - are helping them get through the quiet times with good-natured
resignation.
Their main complaint is that fewer buyers are making the pleasant, speedy
run up the M40 from London to the Cotswolds. In particular trade purchases
have virtually disappeared. In the past the Cotswolds were a clearing house
of quality antiques. Runners (who sniff out bargains from auctions and
traders all over the UK) brought goods to the Cotswold dealers, most of whom
are conveniently clustered in such centres as Stow-in-the-Wold, Burford and
Broadway. These were then sold on to the London trade.
But now dealers, often under orders from their banks to cut back on their
overdrafts, and with fewer customers to sell to anyway, have reduced their
stock greatly. This is specially true of the interior decorators, who found
many choice items of early pottery and furniture in the Cotswolds.
The Americans, the other traditional source of custom, have also become rare
birds of passage. They have been falling away for some time. In the recent
past the American desertion was made good by continentals but although there
are still Italians and Germans passing through their numbers are down too.
The Cotswolds have also been hit by the troubles of Lloyd's, the London
insurance market, and the collapse of the housing market. Many of the
richest Lloyd's 'Names' live in the area and in happier times spent their
wealth on antiques; many more used the Cotswolds to furnish their second,
country, home. They have stopped buying; indeed some are forced to dispose
of antiques, causing problems for those dealers that guarantee to take back
the goods they sell.
However, it is the dearth of new home purchases that has been most keenly
felt, plus the problems of the luxury country hotels which were also
voracious buyers of antiques. Many Cotswold dealers specialise in antiques
that are ideal for furnishing country mansions: a revival in the property
market would stimulate business.
Most dealers have come to terms with the recession. It helps that they tend
to be general traders, concentrating on furniture, the sector of the
antiques market which has held up best. The main casualties in London have
been the picture dealers, especially those selling contemporary art. Most
people do not need another painting, but they do need something to sit on or
eat off. The Cotswolds have few dealers specialising in pictures and even
fewer who stock the avant-garde.
John Noott of Broadway probably has the largest stock of pictures in the
region, ranging from the 17th century to the present day. 'Now I only buy
pictures I think I can sell; I cannot afford to buy for stock. Most of my
business is with old customers. New clients who buy on impulse are very
rare.' Sales are perhaps half the level of two years ago and 'I can't see
many rays of hope. We need a return of the 'feel good' factor. Still, if you
are cash rich and take a long view this is now a good time to buy'.
Noott is thinking of closing his second gallery which concentrates on
contemporary works, but will continue to sell contemporary paintings: 'They
are cheaper'. Among the artists Noott will show at the 20th Century Art Fair
at the Royal College of Art in London this month is his son.
By a nice coincidence the Swan Gallery in Burford, run by Dominic Pratt, is
decorated with works by his father, Jeffery. Obviously keeping things in the
family is cost effective. Pratt is one of the few Cotswold dealers who seems
busy and buoyant. He concentrates on country furniture from 1680 to 1730. He
pursues a policy of buying furniture of good colour at the right price and
selling it quickly. His margins are lower but he stays busy.
Pratt points to a Queen Anne chest of drawers of 1710. 'It is priced at
Pounds 2,200. It would have been Pounds 4,000 two years ago. I will probably
take Pounds 1,800 for it. That Charles II corner chair would have been
Pounds 750 two years ago. It is marked at Pounds 475, and I might let it go
for Pounds 400.'
Undoubtedly prices are lower, mainly because dealers are acquiring stock
more cheaply, partly because they have reduced their margins, often from,
say, 40 per cent to nearer 20 per cent. This should bring in buyers. After
all, you can buy genuine 18th century items of furniture at prices lower
than it would cost to make a reproduction.
It is impossible to tour the Cotswolds antique dealers without being struck
by the bargains on offer - Victorian desks for Pounds 800; Georgian clocks
for Pounds 1,200; a pair of Chippendale chairs for Pounds 6,500 (at David
Pickup in Burford, who also has a three piece William Morris suite for
Pounds 5,500).
There is also the knowledge that dealers will trim prices, or deliver for
nothing, or take payment over a few months. This is especially true at
warehouses such as Gateway Antiques in Burford, where the young owners buy
the best pieces from the local auction houses, add on a small margin and
expect to turn over stock quickly - three times a year.
Gateway sells at the lower and medium price range - up to Pounds 15,000.
Duncan Baggott, who has a vast stock scattered through a clutch of sites in
Stow-on-the-Wold, has antiques from Pounds 16.50 to Pounds 50,000. He is
perhaps the bell-wether Cotswolds dealer, long established and a beneficiary
of the 1980s boom. Three years ago most of his business was through his
trade warehouse; now it is through his two shops. Then he might have turned
his stock round five times a year; now he turns it over once. But it is more
expensive stock: he has seen income rise and profit fall.
He also has to sell that much harder. When I met him he had just sent two
items to London on approval: if they fitted well into the prospective
buyer's home they would stay. Selling things on spec' is one way of helping
to clinch a sale. Another is to take antiques in part exchange. Free
delivery is also on offer. All the goods in Baggott's shops carry typed
labels with their price and history: anything to keep the discounts down.
In a buyer's market, says Baggott, 'somebody will offer Pounds 6,000 for an
item priced at Pounds 12,000. I might settle for Pounds 10,500'. Dealers
margins are already squeezed by such expenses as higher bank charges and
business rates and they cannot give too much away.
Stow, Broadway and Burford attract thousands of visitors a day in the summer
 -but they rarely buy antiques. The dealers tend to have a few jokey items
that might catch their fancy. Baggott was offering 19th century Lancashire
clogs at Pounds 65 a pair. He also had golf clubs for Pounds 50 or so, but
anyone seriously interested in golf clubs and sporting memorabilia would
know about Manfred Schotten's shop in Burford, which has one of the largest
collections in the UK.
He has recently purchased one of the late 19th century bright red jackets
worn by members of the Leicester Golf Club to show their presence on the
course. He can offer golf clubs of the 1860s for Pounds 4,500; garlanded
Eton rowing boaters for Pounds 200; and a rare and prized item, an 18th
century real tennis racket for around Pounds 3,500. Business in this
specialist sector has slowed. Schotten usually buys only with a collector in
mind and sends out many more mailing shots to likely purchasers. You must
hunt for business these days.
For Huntington Antiques of Stow this means buying in the US. Michael Golding
finds that the weak dollar enables him to re-patriate some of the English
furniture that went across the Atlantic in the 1930s. Ironically his best
customer is an American collector who is furnishing his Missouri home with
Pounds 250,000 worth of early English furniture, the Huntington speciality.
Many dealers can hardly be bothered talking about the recession and the
lower level of demand. Of more concern are two other restraints - the
attitude of the banks, and robberies. The local banks, under pressure from
their head offices, are making things more difficult by increasing charges
or reducing overdraft levels. Robberies are the unwanted hassle. Some
dealers have been 'ram raided', their shop fronts smashed in by cars. Some
have been burgled many times and rarely are the antiques recovered.
But the dealers keep their spirits up. The Cotswolds Antique Dealers
Association helps with promotion and encourages a feeling of co-operation.
English furniture is now cheap compared with French and American antique
furniture and the bargains on offer must be appreciated soon.
Anyone who lost interest in antiques when their prices rocketed in the late
1980s should take another look. Not only are prices considerably lower but
dealers are willing to bargain: bank managers want sales as a sign of
activity. Anyone feeling like a country break could do much worse than motor
down to this bucolic region and window shop. I would be very surprised if
they did not come back with at least one purchase.

THE ECONOMIC climate might be deplorable, the art market stagnant, and
French buyers prone to referendum jitters. But the Paris Biennale antiques
fair, the most ostentatious in the world (and, many say, the best) is going
ahead from September 18 to October 4 in the Grand Palais.
This year's show, the 16th, will house 120 exhibitors - including 17 from
elsewhere in Europe but only two from the US - showing works which are
vetted rigorously by experts.
Stands will be decked out with an unprecedented and unabashed theatricality
in a set concocted by Italian stage designer, Pier Luigi Pizzi. The decor
comprises a main circular space called an 'agora' and radiating streets.
Opinions about the result, let alone the expense - said to be in the region
of FFr5m (Pounds 520,000) - are divided. Some dealers - such as Paris Art
Deco specialist Galerie Vallois, which is turning its stand into a
mid-1920s' room with specially recreated silk wall hangings - have adapted
happily. Others, such as tapestry specialists, are anxious that visitors
will have no room to stand back and get a good look at their exhibits.
The list of exhibitors is impressive. There is a jewellery section and four
leading French dealers in antique books. The Antiquaires a Paris group of
dealers, which specialises in mainly-18th century furniture and art objects,
is back in the fair for the first time since 1986.
Several other Paris specialists can be counted on to provide outstanding
18th century art; one, Jean Lupu, has designed a stand which looks like the
inside of an Egyptian pyramid. Newcomer Carlton Hobbs, is the only British
furniture dealer making the trip. He has planned a lavishly-curtained stand
containing, among other things, a large Aubusson tapestry, late 18th century
Russian furniture and several items of top English furniture of the same
period.
Belgian dealer Axel Vervoordt, will have one of the largest stands divided
into four rooms. Exhibits will include paintings by Klein, Fontana and
Tapies; ancient Egyptian and Chinese art and a lot of antique silverware -
'nothing flashy or show-off but things with soul,' Vervoordt says.
Twenty-five stands will be devoted to drawings and paintings. Hopkins-Thomas
of Paris, a specialist in mid-19th to early-20th century art is showing an
unusual Fauve painting by Louis Valtat, circa 1905; an unpublished oil by
Sisley of 1884-85; and three works by Impressionist artist Berthe Morisot,
favourite model and sister-in-law of Manet.
Paris-based Old Master dealer Bob Haboldt includes an oak panel portrait of
Edward VI by Stretes, and a rare still life by the 18th century French
artist, Louis-Leopold Boelly.

NEVER AGAIN: BRITAIN 1945-51 by Peter Hennessy Jonathan Cape Pounds 20, 544
pages
SERGEANT Ernie Teal, of the Coldstream Guards, recalled 1944-45 in a
conversation with Peter Hennessy in 1989: 'When we got to Holland, we went
to some of those houses in Nijmegen - flush toilets, nice gardens, they were
just ordinary people but so much better off than we were. I was
flabbergasted. And when we got to Germany, I thought: 'These people have
been living well under Adolf. We owned two-thirds of the world and we lived
worse off than them'.'
Teal had got to the heart of the problem facing the post-war Attlee
government, a problem summed up more analytically by former cabinet minister
Roy Jenkins (also quoted by Hennessy): 'The inheritance was bleak. Our
nominal membership of the triumvirate of world power was guaranteed by our
recent record. But it was as unsustainable as it was temporarily
incontestable.'
With the help of hundreds of quotations such as these, Hennessy has produced
a vivid and readable account of Britain between 1945 and 1951. It is a
period with a unique flavour; one that looked backwards and was dominated by
its own recent past. In retrospect, much of what was attempted and done was
directed more to tackling inherited problems than to building for the
future.
Because of this, Hennessy spends more than a quarter of his book on what was
happening in Britain during the second world war and in the 1930s. This is
done well and means that the young or ignorant reader can plunge straight in
and come away from the book with a fair and balanced assessment of the
period.
Hennessy aims to get everything in - the economic crises, the creation of
Nato and the National Health Service and the withdrawal from India, of
course; but also cricket and football, the radio programmes of the day, the
New Look. This sometimes makes for an embarrassing superficiality, as in his
treatment of the literature or philosophy of the period. On the big issues,
though, generally he exhibits an excellent grasp of the material, both
published and unpublished, presenting it in such a way as to show the
dilemmas and difficulties as they appeared to people at the time.
He has had, for example, the good idea of publishing the agendas for cabinet
business in the first fortnight of the dreadful year 1947. Keeping in mind
the enormous range and intractability of the issues ministers were trying to
handle induces a proper degree of tolerance towards their failures and
shortcomings.
What emerges? On the debit side, most notably, the continual
under-estimation by ministers of the UK's external balance-sheet problem
(despite many incisive analyses by senior officials) and the consequent
absence of any strategic approach to solving it. But there is much on the
credit side: for example, the heroism and imagination of Ernest Bevin,
almost single- handedly shaping the Marshall plan and creating Nato.
The first acts of the long tragedy of the UK's unwillingness to get involved
with continental Europe until too late are well set out: the irrational (but
ultimately well-founded) rhetoric of Monnet contrasted with the rational
(but ultimately ill-founded) scepticism of British officials. Given the
context, Hennessy is (surely rightly) tolerant of British behaviour at this
point. But he warns that he will be (again, surely rightly) much less
tolerant in his next volume.
Hennessy also plays fair in his account of the agonising decision to re-arm
on the outbreak of the Korean war. He lets the officials most concerned
explain eloquently why it was done and how, in the light of Britain's
relationship with the US, it appeared unavoidable. But clearly he believes
(again, I think rightly) that the result, at a time when continental and
Japanese industry was just getting under way, was a terrible blow to the
UK's export drive from which, in one sense, the nation never recovered.
This is a good book but it could have been an even better one. In the
promised succeeding volumes, could we have fewer cliches, fewer reflections
on the author's feelings and personal life, and fewer footnotes (there are
2,100 here, including references to Hennessy's own unpublished diaries)? On
the other hand, could we please have a critically-annotated bibliography?
The absence of any bibliography at all in a book of this sort is amazing.

JANICE Elliott's City of Gates (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 14.99) operates
on the simple but often neglected principle that fiction is stranger than
truth. The story of Daisy Herbert's adventures in Jerusalem appears at first
to be an English-gentlewoman-abroad novel descended from Henry James and EM
Forster, all high sensibility and comic asides. Then we meet Eugenia Muna,
who keeps the guest-house by the Jaffa Gate and is reputed to have been
there 'forever.' This is no simple over-statement, although it takes some
time to realise what a strange turn things are taking.
Elliott freely mixes comic realism and something which I hesitate to call
fantasy because its effect is so convincing, and lacking so completely in
feyness. When first we are told that 'Eugenia only had to squint a little
and she could see David, weeping, barefoot, in flight from Jerusalem,' we
assume that this is poetic licence. But, as the momentum builds, we realise
that something altogether other is happening, an intertwining of the
marvellous and the everyday in which anything is possible.
Elliott gives several clues to the level on which she is working, stating
clearly at the end of the first chapter that ' . . .in Jerusalem, it is
forever one time and all times: past, present and to come.' Muna knows that
'history is not a train, but water in a bucket. Slosh it around and anything
might slop over.' She also knows that the Gnostics hold intuition to be
higher than reason; and it is in this sense that City of Gates is a Gnostic
novel, neither mystic nor fantastic but obeying its own rules.
The result is an unusual combination of the universal and the intimate,
conveyed through a succession of scenes which are almost as funny as they
are touching. This is a most unusual and deeply-felt novel but it is never
daunting, thanks to the lightness of its humour.
Another superb but very different achievement is that of Eugene McCabe in
Death and Nightingales (Secker &amp; Warburg. Pounds 13.99). This is an
archetypal tale of love and betrayal and the brute latent in us all, set in
rural Ireland in 1883. Beth Winters, the Catholic step-daughter of
Protestant landowner Billy, is pregnant by one of his Catholic tenants, Liam
Ward, and plans to steal Billy's gold and run away with her man. Her mother,
who died in a farmyard accident, was already pregnant (although she never
said by whom) when she married Billy - hence Beth's ambiguous position in
his household.
He exploits her both as free labour and as an object for his drunken lust;
yet, there is still some remnant of affection between them. Beth suspects
that Ward is only interested in her for the gold, but even the reader is
shocked when his real plans are revealed.
McCabe is also well-known as a dramatist, and one of the many remarkable
things about this novel is the way that everything, from the cattle of the
misty Fermanagh landscape to the birds that sing or keep silent, contributes
to the drama. As Beth notes at her lowest point: 'How extraordinarily
beautiful the world could be and all the creatures in it, excepting
mankind.' Anyone looking for an explanation of the roots of sectarian hatred
will find it here. Death and Nightingales is the best Irish novel to appear
for a long time.
Remembering Light and Stone, the second novel by a younger Irish writer,
Deirdre Madden (Faber, Pounds 14.99), is also full of good things but has a
narrower focus. 'I hate convenient, empty words,' Aisling, the narrator,
tells us right at the beginning; and, as we get to know her, we find that
she is not the sort of person to accept any kind of cliche, whether it be
about emigration, exile, national identity, youth, art, politics, nostalgia
or love.
To say that the novel is about a young Irishwoman living and working in a
small Italian hill village while trying to sort herself out gives no
indication of the originality and vigour of Madden's approach to this
commonplace theme, nor of her unusual sensitivity. I read it on a long train
journey and felt as if I had made a new friend, passing the the time
listening to an intelligent, honest and original contemporary. While I might
not always agree with her opinions, she has a wonderful way of expressing
them and has produced that most rare of artifices: a novel which is at once
highly literary and, yet, immensely readable.
The latter is a quality associated closely with Maeve Binchy, along with a
warm heart. She is on grand form in The Copper Beech (Orion Pounds 14.99),
an expansive village saga which follows the lives of a primary school class
in the small town of Shancarrig from 1950 to the present day. She has a
fondness for tear-jerking sudden deaths but, that apart, she is a far
sharper and funnier observer of changing times and morals than the
saccharine TV adaptations of her works would suggest.

REASON AND CULTURE by Ernest Gellner Blackwell Pounds 10.95, 193 pages
AMONG the conflicts which scar the world's human face, those that involve
people bombing each other, and the struggle to survive nature's onslaughts,
rightly absorb our immediate attention. Behind these, though - and detached
from them, because it is a struggle with the proportions of history itself -
is another struggle, profound and consequential because it shapes the
long-term destinies of whole nations: even of the world. This is the
struggle of ideas, expressing itself in terms of ideologies, politics, and
the conceptual frameworks which determine beliefs and moralities.
Our understanding of the human condition, and the choices we make in
managing the unruly and difficult complexities of social existence, are
founded on ideas systematised into theories. Ultimately, it is ideas which
drive people to peace or war, which shape the systems under which they live,
and which determine how the world's scarce resources are shared among them.
Ideas matter: and so, therefore, does the question of reason, by which ideas
live or die.
In this elegant and perceptive book, Reason and Culture, Ernest Gellner
addresses the enormously important issue of reason's role. On one view,
reason is the armament of ideas; it is the weapon employed in the conflict
between viewpoints. This suggests that, in some sense, reason is an absolute
which, used rightly, can settle disputes and guide us to truth. But reason
so understood has always had enemies. One is religion, which claims that
revelation from outside the world conveys truths undiscoverable by human
inquiry within it. Another is relativism, the view that different truths,
different views, different ways of thinking, are all equally valid and that
there is no authoritative standpoint from which they can be adjudicated. In
recent debates between science and religion, we see an expression of this
underlying conflict between competing conceptions of the nature of reason.
Gellner is on the side of the argument which says that reason, despite its
imperfections and fallibilities, provides a standard to which competing
standpoints must submit themselves. Accordingly, he is is hostile to the
fashionable 'post-modernist' views which say there are authorities more
powerful than reason such as race, tradition, nature, or supernatural
entities.
To mark the boundaries of this fundamental dispute, Gellner takes us through
the history of views about reason, from Descartes to the present. The result
is a clear, sharply-delineated history of thought. It lays bare the essence
of rationalist optimism in early modern philosophy and proceeds to a robust
anatomisation of anti-rationalisms, not least those versions which have come
to hold increasing sway in the contemporary world.
Gellner's diagnosis of contemporary anti-rationalism is stimulating. Human
traits and values once were thought to be constants, he argues, but social
and other forms of engineering have turned them into manipulable variables,
with the result that we have lost premises from which to reason about aims
and means.
He is tough on anti-rationalists. Their oracles 'speak in nebulous and murky
language and their pronouncements are allergic to clarity.' He attacks 20th
century 'depth psychology' as one form of anti-rationalism, describing its
doctrines as 'nebulous, flabby and evasive' and its therapeutic claims as
'baseless.' His defence of reason is not unqualified, though. Human identity
is more ironic and conditional than it once was, and less entitled to
confidence. But still, reason remains our best help in seeking knowledge and
it 'enjoins us to treat each other equitably' so, despite its failings and
limitations, we must cling to it.
More than 30 years ago, Gellner, now professor of social anthropology at
Cambridge, offended academic philosopers in Britain mightily with his book
Words and Things, an attack on then-fashionable 'ordinary language
philosophy.' Ever since, British philosophy has been ungenerous to him,
failing to acknowledge his qualities as a frank, robust thinker
distinguished by an unswerving belief in the importance of philosophical
debate.
It is true that, in the long-ago offending book, some of Gellner's arguments
were unfairly polemical. But, on the evidence of this valuable and
provocative defence of reason, it is clear that this quarrel within the
tents of the Greeks must end; in the context of the wider battle in defence
of reason, it has no further place.

POOR THINGS by Alasdair Gray Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 317 pages
ALASDAIR Gray's fourth novel is constructed so cunningly that it contains
excerpts from mock reviews on the dust jacket, one of them favourable, the
other dismissive. The former praises it as an amusing piece of 'light
fiction,' the latter slams it for belonging to the overworked genre of
Victorian pastiche. The reader (and, alas, reviewer) are thereby forewarned
 -this is not a work that will yield itself easily to a final analysis.
Poor Things pretends to be two recently-discovered historical documents
which Gray has 'edited' by providing an introduction, illustrations and
copious notes. The main body of the book comprises the memoirs of Archibald
McCandless, 'the bastard bairn of a poor peasant,' who goes to Glasgow to
study medicine in the 1880s. He befriends Godwin Baxter, the eccentric and
grotesque son of a famous surgeon.
McCandless soon learns that Baxter has inherited from his father the skill
to re-animate dead creatures, a skill which he has used upon the corpse of a
beautiful, pregnant suicide. In order to mask her identity, Baxter has
implanted her own foetus's brain into her skull, thus rendering her as
innocent and malleable as a newborn. He calls his creature Bella.
McCandless falls in love immediately with this innocent but is deprived of
her company by the jealous Baxter, who sets about educating her in the best
traditions of the liberal arts and sciences. McCandless is further
frustrated when the passionate Bella decides to elope with a callow seducer
named Wedderburn, whose finances and sexual energy she proceeds to bankrupt
with alarming insouciance. On their voyage, Bella is baptised in the cruel
ways of the world, bitter lessons brought home in an Alexandrian slum and a
Parisian whorehouse.
She returns to Glasgow to marry McCandless and dedicate herself to the poor,
only to be confronted by the man to whom she had been married before killing
herself, an heroic empire-builder named General Blessington. After avoiding
narrowly his attempts to get her back, she embarks upon a life that sees her
becoming a noted physician and socialist.
Readers who may have found all this a bit tough to stomach are immediately
handed an antacid by Gray, who appends a letter written 30 years after these
events by Bella (now referred to as Dr Victoria McCandless). She refutes her
husband's story as a 'morbid Victorian fantasy' penned by a frustrated
sentimentalist who seemingly could not bear his wife's passions and
achievements. This document is followed by a long series of annotations
provided by Gray which lend equal credence to both stories.
Poor Things is a lively and witty read, erudite without ever being onerous.
Fans of the pastiche genre will find much in which to delight, with echoes
of Mary Shelley and Shaw scattered throughout as well as telling satire of
both Victorian imperialism and early socialism. Bella herself is a fine
creation, a prototypical feminist whose 'menstrual cycle was in full flood
from the day she opened her eyes, so she has never been taught to feel her
body to be disgusting or to dread what she desires.'
In the end, however, it is hard to know what to make of the whole
enterprise. One waits in vain to find out who is telling the 'truth' and
what this 'truth' could mean. McCandless might be a slightly deranged bore
but he is no less credible than the Fabian crank, Victoria.
Although Gray claims in his introduction to believe Archie's account, he
refuses either there, or in his copious notes, to provide the decisive clue.
One is left to guess the point of it all.
Is it that men cannot think of a liberated woman without seeing her as being
some sort of monster? Or is it rather that truly socialist ideals are
destined, like the older Bella, to deny their origins, to degenerate into
crankery and insignificance?
Pastiche lovers and literary maze-walkers will enjoy puzzling over the
answer. The rest will find Poor Things to be like McCandless's mysterious
bride: something put together very well but kept alive by artificial means.

TIME AND TIDE by Edna O'Brien Viking Pounds 14.99, 326 pages
SIN by Josephine Hart Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 11.99, 164 pages
Time and Tide is a tale of mother love, that fierce passion. Like so many of
Edna O'Brien's heroines, Nell escapes from a narrow, suffocating existence -
a bullying family in a rural Irish village - into the arms of an older,
sophisticated man, a Rochester to her Jane Eyre. But he does not mellow with
age. Years later Nell flees again, this time from her husband's tyrannical
rule, and she fights successfully to gain custody of their children.
Her sons become an anchor in a precarious life: lovers take advantage of her
generosity; her spendthrift ways leave her homeless and her honest notes to
authors nearly cost her her job in a publishing house. But Nell's real
struggle comes when her sons begin to free themselves of her love. One turns
to drugs and a girlfriend hostile to Nell, while the other travels to
Turkey. Nell fears she has lost them both but discovers, through her
memories of her own loving but censorious mother, the binding power of
mother love.
This is Nell's story entirely; her husband, sons and lovers seem to exist
only in her vivid imagination. Yet, it is difficult to imagine her; we are
imprisoned in her fantasies: her guilt over her mother's death, her fears
that she is, as her husband says, a bad mother. Rarely does she step back
from herself, rarely does she peek in the mirror.
This is an impassioned narrative, claustrophobic for the reader. It isn't
until we reach the tragedy in her life that we begin to empathise with Nell,
for she has been too close to us, too insistent, her life story too
impossible to believe.
We grow impatient with her; she seems never to follow her instincts and is
unbearably impractical, romantic when she should be hard-headed, cruel when
she should be indulgent. Yet, by the end of the book O'Brien has won us
over, for her writing is fluent with a beauty which is never self-conscious,
a passion which never engulfs its wisdom.
The heroine of Josephine Hart's Sin has let one dark passion dominate her
life: 'Goodness is no longer a respectable aim in life. The hound of hell,
envy, has driven it from the House.' Ruth has always felt that her cousin,
Elizabeth, usurped her place in the family. Orphaned as a baby and adopted
by her aunt and uncle, Elizabeth became the first child, the golden-haired
girl whose goodness could never be challenged.
Ruth, 'who came wrapped in a caul of darkness and anger into Elizabeth's
kingdom,' is the one with nightmares and vengeful thoughts about her
surrogate elder sister. She wanted not to destroy her but to take her over.
As a child, Ruth steals her dolls; later on, she takes bits of her clothing,
seduces her lovers, steals her husband and son and, in desperation and mad
ness, wears a blond wig. But her hatred and her self-loathing - for those
who envy others can think little of themselves - seem to bring a heavenly
punishment down on both Ruth and Elizabeth when their sons drown in a lake
on the family estate.
In this coldly-written Cain and Abel tale, Hart allows Ruth only two moments
of passion - two outbursts, after which she is beaten down for, despite her
dark machinations, she becomes the victim of her own obsession. But we
cannot feel for Ruth or Elizabeth; the former is too cruel, the latter too
dull, and the writing is so restrained and so elliptical that we are held at
arm's length from the story.
In this short, bare novel, bereft of humour or irony, Hart's characters
languish and her ideas fail to germinate. The most interesting question the
book asks - does goodness spawn evil? - is hardly explored. Sin is caught
between parable and novel, having neither the piquant wisdom of the one nor
the humanity, the rich ambivalence, of the other.

ODYSSEY: THE AUTHORISED BIOGRAPHY OF ARTHUR C. CLARKE by Neil McAleer
Gollancz Pounds 16.99, 430 pages
HE is perhaps the only man in the world who can be designated unambiguously
by a four-digit number. He drives a solar-powered Sinclair C5 scooter and he
recruited George Bernard Shaw to the ranks of the British Interplanetary
Society. He is Arthur C. Clarke, the author of 2001 and the colossus of
science fiction, who strides through the pages of Neil McAleer's Odyssey
with an oddly comical gait.
To McAleer's credit, he makes clear in his preface that this book is only a
spectre of the one which might be written about his subject one day.
Clarke's intimate personal journals, presently sealed in an iron box, may
provide a biographer in a distant future with material to flesh out and
bring his subject to life.
In the meantime, despite the 'nine feet of print resources and dozens of
taped interviews' which declaredly went into the preparation of this volume,
Clarke as a character in these pages remains as remote and as lifeless as an
asteroid.
Stanley Kubrick, we are informed ominously in the same preface, is on record
as pronouncing that 'Arthur is not an anecdotable character.' So, the tone
is set for this altogether too-timid portrait of a man who, among other
claims to fame, foresaw the rise of modern global telecommunications in his
anticipation of geo-stationary satellites.
McAleer seems so unremittingly in awe of his subject that the effect is to
dull a topic which might have been fascinating. The text veers between
Pravda-like pronouncements of Arthur's greatness and Boswellian dinner party
snippets.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gardening: Plant of the Week - Fuchsia Lady Thumb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upright yet dwarf hardy fuchsia which is specially suitable for window
boxes and containers because of its compact growth. The neatly-formed
flowers have carmine sepals and a white corolla, a very keen and distinctive
contrast. This variety could be paired with Tom Thumb which is similar in
height and habit and has scarlet and mauve flowers. All hardy fuchsias can
be planted outdoors and if covered with two inches of soil for protection
are unlikely to be killed by frost. In many winters stems may be killed to
ground level but should be removed in spring when new growths will appear
rapidly from the roots.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gardening: I'm dreaming of a white autumn - How he plans to
keep the white flag flowering until the first frosts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETCHED on every ambitious gardener's mind is the image of white flowers, set
against dark green hedges and shown off in the cool of a summer evening. No
doubt it has been deeply etched on those of you trapped in a freak European
summer, where the swimming-pools turned green, the children nearly
suffocated, and the railway lines melted in the extreme Italian heat. Back
in England, the railway lines have other problems; swimming-pools will be
swimming-pools, but the gales and sudden coldness have not wiped out the
image of pale flowers as the garden turns peacefully towards autumn. White
gardens now stretch far beyond their famous model at Sissinghurst Castle. It
takes skill to keep the white flag flying in September and, personally, I
relish the challenge.
By early autumn, white flowers are widely believed to have gone into
retreat. White corners are a tangle of old campanulas; white roses are out
of season; and the white flowers on the giant crambe have vanished, leaving
a mass of leaves like yellow cabbage. The best white flowers are not a soft
colour which needs to be segregated. They can easily compete with yellows,
deep blues, and especially strong reds. I would rather use them at intervals
round a small garden, especially in the darker setting of a back garden in
the city: they are more impressive if they are not isolated.
This year, any expatriate would pine for some of our Japanese anemones,
which are flowering madly after a summer with so much late rain. They ought
to be a town gardener's first choice for a welcome home after the summer
holiday. They will put up with dry shade and life in a narrow bed below a
London wall. They need a few years to give of their best and should never be
judged by their first two seasons' performance. I have compared the
varieties carefully and I am convinced that it is worth paying more for the
white form with the biggest single flowers. Geante des Blanches is its true
name, although this lady giant sometimes turns up as White Queen. I see no
particular merit in the double forms. The single whites are a godsend and,
after a few years without disturbance, they spread prettily.
Below them, at a lower height, I recommend the Gaura lindheimeri, which I
have grown to maturity in its second year from a seed packet. Probably, it
ought to be tied to a stake, but I have let my young plants fall with their
white flowers sideways, like a graceful form of willow herb. Anemones hold
themselves upright, but Gauras throw themselves around very prettily. One
danger is that a hard winter will kill them off.
At intervals beyond these two fine plants, you need spires and spikes of
white. The spires are best found on the tall veronica virginica, which has
been hidden from most of us under the new name of Veronicastrum. The spikes
are best on the Cimicifugas, whose flowers are like white bottle-brushes and
whose stems develop best in a semi-shaded bed which is not too dry. These
plants have the great advantage of being tall, up to five feet in good
conditions: neither of them is gleaming white, but they have a style which
is still under-exploited.
Beyond these leafy border plants, you need white shrubs with density and a
higher volume of flower. The robust white tree mallow, Lavatera Barnsley, is
an obvious choice nowadays wherever the garden can run slightly out of
control. Hardy white fuchsias are another possibility, often forgotten for
their ability to put up with shade. White hydrangeas are more obvious and
particularly handsome in this wet year: the best of the hardy forms is still
Mme E. Mouilliere, although the more subtle style of the Lacecap varieties
is superior.
This year, I have a new favourite, always listed but seldom seen in
thoughtful plantings, perhaps because it seems too obvious. The
white-flowered Obedient Plant is five times as good as its purple-pink
sister: its dark green leaves set off obedient stems of white flowers to a
height of about two feet. Its worst enemy is its name, Pysostegia Summer
Snow, but I like to alternate groups of it with the white Penstemon
Snowstorm, which took such a beating from its namesake last winter. At a
greater height behind them, you cannot beat the best of the phloxes, the
robust White Admiral, which flowers from July until late September, if you
remember to dead-head it. There is something special in this variety's pale
green leaf and breeding which gives it the vigour lacked by other phloxes in
the pale-colour range. Breeders ought to investigate it.
White flowers without scent would be a poor half-measure. Many people
complain that scent is almost unavailable later in the season, but they
forget their tobacco plants and are among the hundreds of gardeners who
overlook the easiest of white lilies, Lilium formosanum. If you sow seed of
this variety in January, it really will flower in the first year of its
life. It is extremely easy and is best managed if you pot it on by stages
into six or seven inch pots. In late June, they can be let into gaps left by
early varieties. Next week, they will join the last of the white tobacco
plants and will spread a strong scent through the chill of early autumn
evenings. Many town gardeners cram the lovely regale lily into pots for
July, but forget to do anything about this lovely sequel, a lily which is
happy on any good garden soil.
Lastly, I would play around with autumn crocuses. The blue varieties are
well-known, but I have a weakness for the white-flowered Crocus speciosus
albus, which soon makes a good clump in any light soil. The flowers will be
showing in mid-September, but the leaves have to wait until next spring.
Like all strong whites, they make a big impression in small, dense groups.
The battle for colour is far from over, and it merely needs a touch of
cunning to keep the flags of white still flying until frost finally forces
us all to submit.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gardening: Japanese style in an English setting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the British involvement with Japanese gardens is very old, English
gardeners have never tried to follow in any great detail the philosophical
ideas which inspire much garden-making in Japan. Instead, Britons have
either use garden artefacts from Japan or made imitations of them.
Quite often, these have been associated Japanese plants, but in styles of
planting and design that are wholly British. The story often has been told
of the Japanese dignitary who was taken to see a 'Japanese' garden in
England and made the wry comment: 'We have nothing like it in Japan.'
The latest example of a Japanese garden in Britain was opened this spring at
Capel Manor Horticultural and Environmental Centre, Bullsmoor Lane, Enfield,
Middlesex. It sets out to represent what Japanese gardening is all about.
But, in visual terms, it falls short by attempting too much in too small a
space, so confusing one type of Japanese gardening with another. It also
uses reproductions rather than genuine Japanese ornaments and buildings.
The 12-page folder prepared to explain and illustrate the garden is,
however, excellent and contains a foreword by Dr David Hessayon which gives
an excellent idea of the various styles of Japanese garden-making. He says
the basic principles can be set out in 50 words. The Japanese garden, he
says, is a place where the designer, with a selection of stones, sand,
water, rocks, bamboos and/or plants, seeks to achieve a harmony between the
in (low, dark, delicate, feminine, damp) and the yo (high, bright, strong,
masculine, hard). Everywhere, the in must be balanced by the yo.
He explains all this in detail, and much of the rest of the folder is taken
up by illustrations of individual details. The purpose of this garden
largely is educational, and visitors seeking to learn from it evidently are
intended to pick and choose what is relative to their particular needs and
ideas and not to try to copy the whole.
I have no quarrel with this, but I think that most British gardeners would
be well advised to do just as they have been for at least 100 years when
employing the Japanese tradition - that is, to use it in whatever British
surroundings seem to be pleasing. For me, there is nothing incongruous about
the lovely, and genuine, Japanese rest house in the Batsford Park arboretum
in Gloucestershire, nor in the life-sized bronze animals there which Lord
Redesdale brought back from Japan to place at strategic points in the wide
grass rides through the trees.
There are many fine Japanese tea-houses in British gardens, none more
beautiful nor placed more pleasingly than that at Heale House, Middle
Woodford, near Salisbury. This was built by Louis Greville early this
century and erected by four Japanese workmen brought over for the project.
It stands over two streams which cross each another at right angles, one
passing under the other in a short conduit. There is also a red Nikko-style
bridge and all around are lanterns and other Japanese ornaments. The whole
is screened by trees and there are plenty of lush waterside plants, but
there is no attempt to follow any Japanese philosophical idea. Nevertheless,
it is beautiful and represents a style of garden- making which is very
British.
The most extraordinary Japanese garden I know is in Ireland - at Tully
House, Kildare. This was made by a Japanese specialist, Tassa Eida, between
1906 and 1910, and represents life from birth to death, a progression
through tunnels, up hills, beside streams and across water. There is a
tea-house in which the traveller rests before dying. It is beautiful and it
seems to me to be westernised almost completely.
The most remarkable situation I know for a Japanese garden in Britain is
outside the formal garden at Torosay Castle on the Isle of Mull, on the west
coast of Scotland. It is exposed completely to the rough waters of Loch
Linnhe and, on a clear day, you can see Ben Nevis. Here, you might regard
the garden itself as all in and the landscape in which it is placed as all
yo, but I do not suppose that whoever made it had that in mind.

FT  05 SEP 92 / The dark knight returns, his strange genius undimmed: Bobby
Fischer is back, still bad and still brilliant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER 20 years' hibernation Robert James Fischer has proved that, whatever
powers he has lost, he has not lost the power to cause offence. His remarks
at the press conference at the outset of his return chess match with Boris
Spassky were vintage Bobby.
As The Times reported: 'Time has not mellowed his eccentricity. Judaism,
Israel and the United Nations all came in for fusillades. Fischer did,
however, attempt to clarify the widespread assumption that he is, despite
having a Jewish mother, a convinced anti-Semite. Not at all, said Fischer,
with his usual loopy logic: 'Anti-Semitism is a nonsense term because my
understanding is that the Arabs are also Semites, not only the Jews. And I'm
definitely not anti-Arab.'
Fischer is still, though, a rabid Russophobe, calling all the top former
Soviet players 'criminals . . . the lowest dogs around.' As for the American
government, Fischer found that words failed him: he simply spat on a letter
from the US State department requesting him not to play the match which,
being held in Serbia-Montenegro, infringed the United Nations embargo
against that country.
All in all, the ravings of a charmless and unpleasant person. And yet the
next day Fischer, in his first chess game for 20 years, produced what I can
only describe as a perfect work of art. He destroyed Spassky's ultra-solid
position by a series of elegant manoeuvres all strung together by infinitely
subtle mental pirouettes.
To the chess addict, and I confess I am one, it was an almost heavenly
experience to witness the creation, move by move, of a 20th century
masterpiece, which, if it had been a painting, only the Getty museum could
afford. Above all there was the stark contradiction between Fischer's crude
and unpleasant political posturings, and the flawless beauty and integrity
of his inner thoughts, made visible on the chess board in Sveti Stefan.
For some reason we do find it very difficult to accept that the genius can
also be a clown, or worse. Perhaps it arises from the popular view that true
genius is a rare gift from God, and that someone touched by Divinity can not
also be touched by the Devil. Peter Shaffer made this the theme of his play
Amadeus. The main character, Salieri, an ambitious and devout hack court
composer, could not accept that the sublime music of Mozart emanated from a
man whose character in all other respects was crude and jejune. So Salieri
lost his faith in God and murdered Mozart.
Strangely, literature has also touched on this theme in the context of
chess. Stefan Zweig's story The Chess Player is in part an account of the
supremacy in chess of a crude peasant, Cvetkovic, a man totally devoid of
any culture. For Zweig, a fleeing Jew writing at the outset of the Second
World War, Cvetkovic was a symbol of the dull and philistine power
destroying everything he cherished. Zweig committed suicide before The Chess
Player was published. I wonder what Fischer would make of it all, if he ever
bothered to read The Chess Player.
It is of course, naive to think that what we call genius is simply a gift,
whether God-given or simply genetically inspired. Fischer's creations are
the result of a fantastically single-minded study of chess from a very early
age.
Consider such other sporting 'geniuses', as Nigel Mansell and Nick Faldo.
Like Bobby Fischer, they are completely driven men. And while Mansell and
Faldo, unlike Fischer, have managed to marry and start families, it is still
clear that they are difficult men, frequently self-centred and charmless.
For some reason sports addicts find this very difficult to accept. Racing
fans want to believe that Nigel Mansell is a 'great guy', and golf fans want
to believe the same of the prickly and (sometimes) offensive Faldo.
George Orwell touched on this strange human weakness in a brilliant 1944
review of Salvador Dali's autobiography, The Secret Life of Salvador Dali.
At that time the book was considered far too obscene to be published in
Britain, and indeed Orwell's review of the American edition was also banned
in this country.
Orwell himself was disgusted by Dali's necrophilia and other warped sexual
obsessions, but at the same time insisted that Dali 'has 50 times more
talent than the people who would denounce his morals and jeer at his
paintings.'
Yet Orwell noted that those who admired Dali's work could not accept that
the man was depraved, and those who thought the man depraved could not
accept the brilliance of his draughtsmanship. Such people, Orwell said, are
'unable to admit that what is morally degraded can be aesthetically right.'
That telling phrase encapsulates the paradox of Bobby Fischer.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Property: Lloyd's losses squeeze owners hit by recession -
No crisis yet but crunch could be coming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUGE losses incurred by Names (the members) at Lloyd's, the London
insurance market, have not had a major effect on the property market. Not
yet.
A few well-publicised cases - such as Pitchford Hall in Shropshire, which
the National Trust could take over if the National Heritage Memorial Fund
finds the money - have led people to think the crisis has arrived. But
estate agents agree that this is not so although Justin Marking, in the
country house department at agent Savills, believes the cracks are starting
to appear.
The Lloyd's losses are only part of how the recession has hit the landed and
nearly-landed classes, forcing them to put their houses on the market.
Failed businesses are a more frequent reason, usually when owners have
pledged the houses as collateral for bank loans or bought them in the
company's name, trusting that expanding profits would take care of any
over-investment.
Soaring maintenance costs (and no VAT relief on regular repairs) are another
factor. But the worst is that agricultural income is only a dribble nowadays
 -if not an outflow - and has taken the price of farm land down with it.
Norman Hudson, consultant to the Historic Houses Association, says the
effects of Lloyd's will not affect the large country houses that have been
in the same family for generations as they are usually in entail and the
'owner' is only a life tenant. Likewise, it is on receivers' instructions
that Marking is selling two large estates: Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex
(Pounds 5m) and Heveningham Hall in Suffolk (Pounds 4.5m). Again, there is
no link with Lloyd's.
Free from serious trouble are the lucky (astute?) Names who were not in the
disastrous LMX syndicates but aimed for lower returns from boring business
like aviation and motor insurance. Some will have low losses this year - but
many actually will have received a cheque.
There are about 22,500 Names in Lloyd's, the same as in 1983-85. Membership
peaked in 1988 at more than 32,000, dropping slightly in 1989.
The Names who have borne vast losses for those years, and who still do not
know what their eventual liability will be, are about 25 per cent of the
membership. In the unlikely event that all had to sell their houses, prices
would fall from their present low levels, but it would not be a market
melt-down.
If there is an autumn rush to sell, the houses at risk are the old rectories
and manor houses, and houses and flats in London, belonging to Names who
entered Lloyd's during the 1980s when the threshold became more affordable,
and enticing talk of 'making your assets work for you' flowed through the
shires.
Newcomers used their houses as collateral, not to Lloyd's itself (which
would not accept a main residence as evidence of wealth) but to the bank
which guaranteed their wealth (for an annual fee of Pounds 1,000) to
Lloyd's. A high valuation of the property let the Name subscribe to a larger
line of underwriting.
This system infuriates such suffering Names as Harriet Crawley, who asks why
Lloyd's did not then inquire what the guarantee was based on. 'If they are
serious about getting people with greater means, you should not be able to
put up a flat in lieu of money,' she says. 'The real question is: Have you
got any money?'
The guarantees could pose a tricky dilemma for the banks. If Lloyd's draws
down on these, do the banks pull the plug on the Names and sell their
houses? Or do they encourage them to trade through now that Lloyd's is
becoming a leaner, healthier organisation asking higher premiums and with
tighter policy wordings on asbestosis and pollution?
While the banks ponder, they have begun quizzing Names more closely about
the value of their property and chattels - even how much a wife's jewellery
is worth.
Wiser (or luckier) Names who have been in Lloyd's a long time are
philosophical. They can afford to be as, over the long run, they are still
on top. And, rather than being guaranteed by a bank, their deposits will be
in securities which are easy to sell (unless they decide to take a picture
off the wall, or sell a cottage or some fields).
Such Names can argue that the property market fall was coming, anyway, and
had nothing to do with Lloyd's. Values in 1988/89 were too high in real
terms - and markets do correct themselves eventually.
Yet, while Lloyd's has had little effect so far on the British property
market, it still could. No one wants to be forced to dispose of his house.
But if trouble is on the horizon, it might be better to act now, even though
the post-election price euphoria has vanished. Do not hold off for a better
price, as it might not be there when the time comes.
A Name in Northamptonshire bit the bullet last year. Faced with selling his
house or his farm, he got rid of the house in which he had grown up and
squeezed into the ex-farm manager's house. He will farm when he retires from
the City and, with Lloyd's bills still continuing, is glad now of the extra
cash from selling early.
The estate agents insist that good properties will sell, even now, so long
as the guide price is reasonable. But they are still harried by
over-optimistic vendors who have not got over the 1988 valuations.
For most people, the effect is negligible. If you get less for the house you
sell, you will pay less for the one you buy. The only loser is the Treasury,
since inheritance tax valuations also have tumbled. But for the
understandably angry Names who are stumping up to pay other Names for the
LMX losses (as well as sharing in a massive transfer of wealth from the UK
shires to the Middle West of the United States in the asbestosis and
pollution claims), this is Cold Comfort Farm.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Property: Beauty of the real Majorca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FAITH GLASGOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAJORCA'S image has much to live down in Britain. The Mediterranean island
remains linked inextricably with 'fly and fry' package holidays and
excessive lager consumption; the idea of actually buying a holiday or
retirement home there brings visions of beach-side boxes or apartment blocks
surrounded by discos.
It is true that these are rather too plentiful, especially along the south
coast around Palma. But Majorca remains a beautiful island and the
government is making determined, if belated, efforts to up-grade existing
resorts (notably, the notorious Magaluf). Also, it has introduced
environmental laws to control further developments.
What, then, are the choices for potential buyers in the 'other' Majorca? You
could always try such trouble-free, sophisticated and exclusive developments
as the golfing complex of Las Abubillas near Puerto Andraitx, or the
Anchorage Club 8km west of Palma (with prices from Pounds 120,000 for a
one-bed flat to Pounds 400,000 for three beds). But for a retreat from the
mainstream tourist beat, turn your back on Palma.
The north-western mountains shelter picturesque spots such as Soller, Deia
and Valledemossa; it is not surprising the area has attracted artists and
celebrities from Chopin, George Sand and Robert Graves to Richard Branson
and Michael Douglas. But forget any dreams of an unconverted barn for Pounds
15,000. While old farmhouses (fincas) and villas can be had, they are not
cheap any more; indeed, fincas are now very fashionable.
'People love to say they have one and they're getting smaller every day,'
says Heather Langford of the Palma-based Agencia Hoz. For a restored
property and some land, you are likely to pay at least Pounds 200,000.
Simple stone cottages and 'town houses' can, however, be found for less. A
few miles inland from Puerto Sollxer, the honeyed-stone farming village of
Fornalutx perches among its olive groves in a verdant, terraced valley. A
renovated stone house there, dating to 1700 and complete with orange grove,
olive oil store and a ruined outhouse that could be converted, costs around
Pounds 100,000.
In the same village, a typical Majorcan town house - tall, thin and roomy
but needing an estimated Pounds 25,000-plus to restore - is available at
around Pounds 60,000. But the charms of Fornalutx are gaining recognition;
according to one local estimate, 30 per cent of the houses already are
holiday homes or permanent residences for expatriates, mainly Swedish and
English.
Thus, while there are interesting choices to be made, do not expect a
cut-price bonanza for up-market property despite the market being depressed.
While English trade (traditionally the backbone of second-home business on
the island) has dried up in the past two years, house price levels have been
maintained by rich Majorcans, well-off Spaniards from Madrid and Barcelona,
and Germans and Swiss who still can afford a good thing when they see it.
There are bargains to be had, of course, but these are mainly in villa and
apartment re-sales rather than new developments or old properties. Indeed,
Mintegui, a Majorcan estate agency which acts for Humberts, the UK agent,
reports: 'Speculators are coming in, mainly from the UK, and making very low
offers. And some owners do have to take them up.'
Langford cites the Pounds 40,000-100,000 flat bracket as the hardest hit.
Overall, though, she says: 'We thought the economic crisis in England would
have had a bigger impact but prices aren't dropping, except in odd cases.'
Many sellers, she adds, are prepared to sit back and ride the recession
until demand picks up. UK contacts: Humberts, 25 Grosvenor Street, London
WlX 9FE; Mackenzie Wemyss, Stable Grange, Cliftons Lane, Reigate, Surrey RH2
9RA.

THE MV Napoleon is a river cruiser that generally plies its trade on the
River Rhone, in France, between Lyon and Arles, or vice versa. It is 129ft
long and 16 1/2 ft wide, and was converted from the hull of a
freight-carrying barge built in Belgium in 1963.
Sounds like a plodder? Not at all, for the purchase and transformation of
the Napoleon from barge to luxury passenger vessel cost Dollars 1.5m. As a
result, its owners are confident that it is the most comfortable small river
cruiser operating in Europe.
Which means that it isn't cheap. In the current high season (until
mid-October), eight days and seven nights on the Napoleon cost Pounds 2,566
per person, with an extra charge for single passengers of Pounds 1,183
(total: Pounds 3,749). Even at low-season rates (October 21-November 11),
eight days and seven nights on the Napoleon are priced at Pounds 2,196 per
person (single supplement: Pounds 1,011).
I was aboard the Napoleon recently, not as a fare-paying passenger, I
needlessly add, but as a non-paying guest accompanied by Miss Lee, my
assistant. The only other passengers were a travel writer from The Daily
Telegraph and her assistant.
None of us was paying. It was all buckshee. Which made me wonder, as we
gaily cruised along, whether a venture like the Napoleon - a maximum of 12
passengers in six luxurious double cabins, en suite marble bathrooms, TV and
video, air-conditioning, a palatial main-deck lounge, an 800 sq ft sun-deck
with a six-person Jacuzzi, perfectly decent food, flexible itinerary and a
seven-strong crew of impeccable disposition - was inspired or foolhardy.
Inspired, I greatly hope, for cruising on the Napoleon must be one of the
most engaging and relaxing ways of seeing France yet devised. The vessel
mainly cruises on the Rhone, though my trip was on the Saone, a gentle Rhone
tributary, pottering from Vienne to Seurre, near Dijon, a distance of 280km,
via Lyon, Trevoux, Macon, Tournus and Chalon-sur-Saone.
Nothing could have been more soothing. The Saone cruise is particularly
aimed at those interested in Burgundy's wine, architecture and pre-history.
At Pounds 367 per night, the cruise is restorative and healing, with plenty
of side-excursions.
The Napoleon's first season was last year, when business was sabotaged by
war and recession. This year, Charterbarge, the company that owns it, is
hoping for an occupancy rate of 70 per cent, of whom many will be Americans.
The president of Charterbarge is an Englishman, Gerard Morgan-Grenville, who
lives in Normandy. Morgan-Grenville says that one of his life-long hobbies
has been landscape painting. He bought a barge, the Virginia Anne, as a
floating studio, and it was this that turned him into a waterway freak with
an interest in the liquid history of Europe's rivers and canals.
The Virginia Anne, newly refitted, now takes private parties of four or less
on the Nivernais canal in Burgundy. The complete voyage, usually nine
nights, runs from Auxerre to Chitry-les-Mines. A third vessel, the Fleur de
Lys, is described by Charterbarge as a 'large, floating Champs Elysees
apartment accommodating up to seven guests in unmeasured comfort.'
The Fleur de Lys was launched in 1986, has three staterooms, carries a
maximum of seven guests, has a small heated swimming pool on her foredeck
and dreams along the Marne-to-Saone canal, also in Burgundy, through
countryside virtually unchanged since the canal was built in 1863. A party
of six chartering it for six nights in high season would pay Pounds 3,000
each; 13 nights: Pounds 5,334 each. If there were only two of you, the
charge would be Pounds 9,000 for six nights, Pounds 16,000 for 13.
Most canal and river passenger boats in France are British-crewed and -run.
The Napoleon is lucky in its crew, six of whom are British, led by skipper
Mike Gardner-Roberts, 34, whose wife Lesley also works on board. The only
Frenchman is pilot Thierry Martin, 27, son of a long line of bargees, who
has worked on the Rhone for 13 years.
It must be pleasant to cruise the Rhone, which is France's fastest, most
powerful river, second only to the Loire in length. In olden days,
flat-bottomed wooden barges, often lashed together eight at a time, were
pulled up-river by teams of 80-100 horses. By 1829, the journey down-stream,
Lyon to Arles, could be done in 14 hours - much quicker than today, because
of the monster locks with which the modern-day Rhone has been tamed, and
slower current. The return journey took 88 hours.
On the Napoleon, meals are informal, dress casual. You can always discuss
menus with the cook. A visit to a Michelin three-star restaurant for lunch
or dinner is included in the itinerary. The tour prices quoted here include
airfares from London, all meals, drinks and excursions.
The company states: 'Our staff do not expect gratuities as a matter of
course. However, if you consider that you have been well looked after and
would appreciate a guideline on tipping, we would suggest approximately 5
per cent of the ticket price as a suitable gesture.' I consulted long and
hard with the Telegraph - 5 per cent of two ticket prices indicated a
recommended gratuity of Pounds 256.60 per couple. 'We're not rich,' I told
the Telegraph. 'Even the tip would cripple us.' In the end, we left Pounds
50 per couple.
The Napoleon, Fleur de Lys and Virginia Anne feature in a brochure, Europe
Waterways, from Abercrombie &amp; Kent Travel at Sloane Square House, Holbein
Place, London SW1W 8NS, reservations: 071-730-9600, fax: 071-730-9376. The
brochure also features the Vertrouen (Caledonian canal and Loch Ness); the
Actief (River Thames); L'Abercrombie (river-plus-canal, Burgundy); the
Lafayette (upper Loire and Briare); La Litote (Burgundy canal); the Mark
Twain (Bordeaux or Midi); the Rembrandt (Holland and Belgium); the
Anacoluthe (Seine and Yonne, between Paris and Burgundy); the Normandie
(Seine, from Honfleur to Paris); the Victoria Cruziana (Rhine); the Danube
Princess (yes, the Danube), and the Hebridean Princess (coastal cruising off
western Scotland).

FT  05 SEP 92 / Motoring: A Mercedes to remember - Stuart Marshall laments
the loss of his 190D 2.5 - a car of top quality built for adult motorists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING owned and driven cars for more years than I care to remember, I
reckoned I could look at any of them dispassionately. They are, when all is
said and done, steel boxes on wheels.
But parting with the Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5, almost exactly 12,000 miles
(19,320 kms) and one year after driving it brand-new to Frankfurt for the
motor show last September, has been a wrench. I shall miss the three-pointed
star at the end of the bonnet, more than I had thought possible.
The 190D 2.5 that has served me faultlessly is that rare bird, an automatic
diesel. Engine and transmission are matched beautifully. Driven with a light
foot, it changes up silkily at under 2,000 rpm.
The 190D 2.5 is not particularly high-geared; 81 mph (130 kmh) on an
autoroute represents 3,500 rpm. But the 2.5-litre, five-cylinder engine is
so quiet that passengers often have needed convincing it is a diesel.
Between 70 mph (113 kmh) and 100 mph (161 kmh), the noise level hardly
changes. More than once, when enjoying music on a motorway, I have been
surprised to find the speedometer needle has edged into the naughty 90s.
Automatic transmission is near-essential for the business motorist and
air-conditioning - a boon during the sticky summer - a most desirable extra.
But both absorb some power and do nothing for fuel economy. So, I rate the
35.94 mpg (7.86 l/100km) I have averaged over the year most satisfactory.
During that time, the Mercedes has had plenty of very short trips and cold
starts as well as long motorway hauls.
The engine is naturally-aspirated. (While there are turbo-charged Mercedes
diesels, you cannot buy them in Britain because a right-hand steering column
would get in the way of the plumbing). Its 94-horsepower output is modest
for 2.5 litres - it is only marginally more than that of the 1.9-litre
turbo-diesel in the Citroen ZX, and its torque (pulling power) is
substantially less.
A two-pedal 190D 2.5 would not appeal to an impatient, forceful driver. In a
traffic lights grand prix, it is no match for a company rep in a Cavalier L.
Does this matter? Not to me. I learned long ago that dashing from one
hold-up to another is always pointless, sometimes counter-productive.
The extra weight of the five-cylinder diesel compared with a standard 190's
four-cylinder petrol engine does nothing for its agility on a winding road.
But the up-side is that the car runs straight on a blustery motorway,
brushes rough roads aside and, even by Mercedes standards, feels unusually
solid and enduring.
A 190D 2.5 is for adult motorists - for people who admire top build quality,
want doors to close with a soft thud, and expect a car to drive like new
when it has at least 100,000 miles on the clock.
Mercedes virtues are more easily perceived than described. It is a bit like
trying to put into words the difference between cast-iron and plastic baths;
leather riding boots and the cleverest moulded ones; wood-grained laminate
and oak panelling.
The real thing simply feels, looks and works better and grows old more
gracefully - and none more so than the 500SE bought new by a Cambridgeshire
company director, Michael Davidson, in 1984. This week, it is heading for
320,000 miles (515,000 kms) and is still running well. Apart from two new
front springs, a fuel pump, water pump, battery and new sets of tyres every
35,000 miles (56,000 kms), all it has cost to run is petrol (20 mpg/14.1
l/100 km) and regular servicing.
He says it has become the family pet. I know how he feels. Many times in the
past year, I have stepped out of some snappy, trendy test car and found that
settling on the 190D 2.5's firm seat behind its big steering wheel was like
being reunited with an old friend.
Of course, it is not a perfect car, just a very good one. Even with the
driving seat set as low as possible, the non-adjustable steering wheel's rim
partly obscures my view of some instruments. A convex off-side door mirror
(like the nearside one) would reduce a blind spot that can be awkward when
joining a motorway.
Rear seat leg-room is adequate rather than generous although the boot is
enormous - it easily takes two golf bags in their trolleys and a weekend's
luggage. And the car's nose-heaviness makes the front tyres work hard when
cornering. Their outer shoulders are beginning to show enough wear to make
tyre rotation worthwhile at the 12,000 miles service now due.
Apart from that - and a boot lid scraped slightly by someone's luggage
trolley in the Gatwick airport short-term car park - the Mercedes looks and
feels as if it had just left the showroom.
First cost of a 190D 2.5 is high. It is listed at Pounds 20,346, which
includes power steering, electric windows and central locking. But its
key-in-hand price with automatic transmission, air-conditioning, power
sun-roof, stereo radio/tape, alloy wheels and exterior thermometer is closer
to Pounds 27,000.
That is not the whole story, though. Few used cars are more sought-after or
command better prices than a Mercedes. Given proper servicing it will last
longer, depreciate more slowly and provide better long-term value (as well
as better motoring) than almost any other car.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Travel: Slave to wind and wave - Andrew Anderson braves the
elements in Shetland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no escaping the wind in the Shetland Islands. It swings across the
chill North Sea like an invisible fist, whipping spume from the waves,
stopping walkers in their tracks and carrying off untethered objects:
dustbins, picnic rugs, sheep, unwary tourists . . .
The locals seem to consider Force 7 on the Beaufort scale a mild breeze,
although Force 10 is enough to make them mutter: 'Aye, the wind's picking up
a morsel.' The Arctic terns, knife-sharp, gorgeously streamlined, ride the
air currents like Top Guns. Puffins - dressed to kill in multi-coloured
beaks, dinner-jacket bodies and stubby orange feet - blunder about like
colour-blind gigolos. Only the Shetland ponies seem unmoved, grazing
pot-bellied and content in rough pastures.
It is the remoteness of the Shetland Islands, far off the north-east of
Scotland, that gives them their wild climate. They are slaves to wind, wave
and weather, volcanic outcrops cast adrift in a great expanse of water. The
convoluted coastline means that no point of the main island is more than
three miles from the sea.
They are not as flat as their diminutive size might suggest, rising from the
sea in craggy leaps to create a jagged cliffscape. The interior is rippled
with hills, soft green in the South Mainland hardening to near-Arctic tundra
in the north. The islands have no trees apart from a tiny, stunted copse
that has become a tourist landmark: people drive up, leap out, point at a
tree, have their pictures taken and drive off again, much to the locals'
amusement.
The islanders - some 28,000 - regard themselves as Shetlanders first,
British next and Scots some way behind that. They enjoy waving cheerily at
cars, or passing the time of day. Shared interests, once unearthed, lead
complete strangers to rummage in fishing bags to find you a top secret trout
fly.
At the Sumburgh Hotel, standing solidly by the airstrip on the tip of South
Mainland, everyone seems to know each other, and the 'offcomer' oil rig
workers, regularly grounded by fog at sea, stand out in the crowd. Jarlshof,
the unearthed Viking settlement, is a few yards away and well worth a
scramble among the stone houses and beautifully constructed underground
chambers. Sumburgh Head is good for puffin-spotting.
Lerwick, the Toytown capital, can be covered in a couple of hours, but after
the deserted countryside can seem like a metropolis. Lerwick is best known
as home to the Up-Helly-A festival, a New Year shindig of Viking costumes,
flaming torches, epic tale-telling, epic drinking and the ceremonial
torching of a replica longboat in the harbour.
Tourism in the 17 inhabited islands is geared to the outdoors. Bird watchers
will have a field day: besides terns and puffins there are gulls and
guillemots, cormorants and oystercatchers and the thuggish great skua, or
'bonxie', which dive-bombs any twitcher who strays too near its nest.
Anglers can cast a fly in a different trout loch every day for a year -
although the wind may cast it back at them - or try salt-water sea-trout
fishing in the 'voes', where a loch meets the sea. There is sea fishing,
riding, sailing (for the brave: the sea is glacial) and wind-surfing (for
Spartans).
All land is common so this is a walker's paradise, especially on the springy
turf of the cliffs from which one can watch seals sporting in the surf like
aquatic labradors. The air seems scrubbed clean. A couple of hours strolling
in a 'mild breeze' is enough to wind-blast one to tingling exhaustion. St
Ninian's isle is particularly recommended for walking, being joined to the
South Mainland by a 'tom bola', a shimmering spit of white sand.
Being so far north, the summer months boast near all-round daylight, a time
known romantically as the Summer Dim. Conversely, winter is as black as
black, although the Shetland tourist board has baulked at calling it the
Winter Dull. The benign Gulf Stream means that the islands are rarely very
cold - but then they are never very warm, either.
Accommodation is plentiful, cheap and largely concentrated in bed &amp;
breakfast or self-catering cottages. Many of the island's purpose-built
hotels are architectural horrors, but isolated Busta House - a former
laird's home in North Mainland that claims to be Britain's most northerly
luxury hotel - is well worth a trip. Its bar is warming, its walls feet
thick and the library comfortable.
Busta's resident ghost - a woman wronged in love in the 17th century - was
to be heard moaning in the corridors. Or perhaps it was the wind.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Their world is an oyster - The French
brotherhoods devoted to eating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who missed a trip to France this summer, panicked perhaps by blocked
autoroutes or drained finances, could experience much of the essential
Frenchness of France for Pounds 35. This is the price of Les Grandes
Confreries de France,* a new, privately-published guide to one of the
country's identifying institutions.
These confreries are true brotherhoods, built not on personal commercial
advancement but on greed of a purer sort. Although ritual is crucial to the
150-odd brotherhoods detailed in the book, their unifying theme is not
masonic but, perhaps not surprisingly, gastronomic.
No wine is too obscure, no victual too mundane, no sweetmeat too slight to
have an entire constitution, chapter of officers and roster of ceremonies
centred on it. Here are confreries dedicated to a particular sort of
macaroon, quince jam, choucroute, Cavaillon melon, pheasant terrine and
tripes a la mode fertoise.
The confrerie exists to promulgate by gathering, and the typical gathering
is a long ceremony during which new members are given an honorary rank and
required formally to eat, drink, identify, or swear eternal allegiance to
the comestible in question - followed by an even longer, and much more
convivial, feast.
In a small village outside Albi, for instance, is the Order of the Stuffed
Chicken, male members of which attain the rank of Coq et Chevalier and
females that of Coquette Dame. The mirabelle plum of Lorraine has been
defended by its own 'consultat' since 1974 but the pumpkin pate of Millancay
only since 1980, while the sausage of Muscadet was left to fend for itself
until May 1990.
Most seafoods seem to have inspired their own brotherhood of enthusiasts, a
high proportion of the confreries being centred on a particular oyster or
scallop and one on the squid of tiny Bidart near Biarritz (ranks: Chevalier
and Grand Pecheur) Even the art of slashing the top off a champagne bottle
with a sabre has its very own Confrerie du Sabre d'Or.
The author and publisher of this heroic and revealing work is Bernard
Tardif, president and grandmaster of the Confrerie Gastronomique de la
Marmite d'Or (golden stewpot), a sort of National Trust of the French table
which resurrected an ancient royal company of provisioners nearly two
centuries after Robespierre sentenced it to an extended siesta.
His book is not cheap and one ponders at first the luxury of printing at
least one full-colour photograph on most of its 250 pages. But this is to
overlook another vital aspect of life as a confrere: the clothes.
The French, more than anyone, believe the maxim that you haven't done it if
you haven't dressed for it and this book provides glorious, nay sumptuous,
proof of the French robe-maker's ingenuity. Each order has not only its own
ranks, certificates and traditions but its own uniform, designed to add pomp
to what might otherwise, just possibly, look a little silly.
Ideally, the robe should be floor-length, generous in cut (especially round
the girth), vaguely evoke medieval heraldry (and, if possible, the product
in question), incorporate a sash and/or clanking insignia and, of course, a
hat.
Typical, and very smart, is the uniform of the Chevaliers de l'Olivier,
based at Nyons in the southern Rhone.
Their velvet cloaks with matching olive-sprigged trilbys are, of course, in
olive green (the regulation red bow tie surely not representing a pimento
stuffing?), but the rig-out must be jolly hot at their regular meeting on
the first Sunday of July.
One of the most fetching costumes is the emerald and shocking-pink satin
smock and baker's bonnet worn by the Confrerie of the Saulxures Raspberry,
founded in 1972. On the other hand, the brilliant orange robes and green
striped headgear designed to celebrate the Cormery macaroon look as though
they had just been unpacked for the photographer - but then, this confrerie
was founded only in 1990.
It is not at all like the seriously charitable, and seminal, Jurade de
St-Emilion to which I have the honour of belonging (as Dame) along with the
claret Commanderie du Bontemps du Medoc et Graves, and the grand order of
the burgundian snail (which, worryingly, does not feature in this book; but
then, I was told when I joined back in 1977 that France already imported
most of its snails from Taiwan) and the noble order of the trou normand (or
mid-meal shot of calvados).
The oldest of France's confreries, the Jurade, can trace its roots back to
1199 and is based, like all of confreriedom, on a charter governing the
administration of a part of France then under the English crown. So, it is
possible that, without Albion, French life (and presumably Monsieur Tardif)
would be considerably the poorer.
Les Grandes Confreries de France is available only by mail from Bernard
Tardif, 5 Allee de Ia Chevaleries, 37170 Chambray-les-Tours, France. FFr315
inc. postage.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Going to work on a wok - Nicholas Lander turns
up the heat in a Chinese kitchen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACROSS the divide which separated 250 noisy diners from hard-pressed kitchen
staff came two unusual sounds.
The first was the giggling from 10 young girls who stood by the kitchen door
receiving food from the chefs, assembling it on trays and thrusting it to
clamouring waiters.
The second noise came from half a dozen washers-up, mainly women in
wellingtons and rubber gloves, working as fast as they could. Rents are now
so high in Hong Kong and the volume of dirty plates so much greater in
Chinese restaurants (they can have eight sets of crockery in circulation
compared to three in a western restaurant) that electric dishwashers cannot
be justified.
There are enormous differences in how western and Chinese professional
kitchens operate. In the west we prize the individual while in China the
will of the individual is restrained for the benefit of the community.
Hence, in the west, the tradition of great individual chefs from Taillevent
onwards. Chinese cooking, in spite of its many changes, boasts no individual
chefs of national fame.
Kitchens in the west are organised hierarchically and in a way that allows
strong individuals to exert their authority. As a written order comes in, it
goes to the head chef who shouts the details (known as the pass). On hearing
the two phrases 'Ca marche' and 'Envoyez' the brigade goes in to action.
Sous chefs set to, calling instructions to lesser mortals such as the chefs
de partie while the lowest of the low, commis chefs, hover on edge. The
kitchen's other prima donna, the pastry chef, listens for the first dessert
order.
The Chinese kitchen is bereft of such hierarchy. The person in charge at the
Victoria City Seafood Restaurant in Hong Kong (tel: 827-9938), was the man
cooking at the Number One Wok. About 5ft 8in tall, thin, wiry and with very
powerful arms, he did nothing other than cook. He worked in front of six
woks, powered by propane, controlling the temperature with his kneecaps and
a lever under the range. This way of controlling the heat meant that all the
chefs' hands were free to cook.
The chef's cooking utensils were simple. A large, extremely hot wok,
groundnut oil and a large flat sieve with which he drained off all excess
oil. He used large amounts of water, recycling it, to cool the range and a
cooking technique that would terrify any amateur. Once the wok was hot and
thinly coated in oil, he threw in the ingredients and then took the wok off
the heat, tossing the contents as they cooked.
He could cook in this way during the one-hour lunch service (it lasts no
longer to allow the diners to return to the stock market) because he never
moved. When an order comes into a Chinese restaurant the No 1 Wok is the
last person in the kitchen to see it.
The order is taken in the same way, in triplicate, with one copy to the
cashier, one for the waiting staff and the last for the kitchen. In a
Cantonese kitchen serving dim sum at lunchtime (and in Hong Kong 1m sit down
to such a lunch every day) the order goes first to the back of the kitchen
where the raw ingredients for each order are prepared.
Instructions for the steamed dishes - shrimp or beef dumplings, char sui
buns, the delicious glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaves - then go to a
side of the kitchen which houses a row of steamers. These, at full tilt,
resemble a scene from Dante's Inferno as the cooks appear and disappear
behind thick clouds of steam.
All the ingredients for the dishes to be cooked in the wok make their way
from the preparation area to the back of the cooks via a chain of
expeditors. They pass the finely chopped ingredients in sequence virtually
into the hands of the cooks and then whip the plates away as soon as they
are ready. Lids on, they are passed to the gaggle of giggling girls who
assemble the orders from both sides of the kitchen and make sure they are
never without clothes pegs.
Economics are forcing certain changes. Soaring rents (new restaurants rarely
open on a ground floor but invariably in a cheaper basement or upper floor)
have led to the disappearance of the traditional dim sum trolleys. And, with
1997 so close, restaurants must repay their investors quickly.
Other outstanding Hong Kong restaurants: Yung Kee, 32-40 Wellington Street,
Central, (522-1624), for their roast goose; Rainbow Room, Lee Gardens,
Causeway Bay, (895-3311) for the best Peking Duck; Sun Tung Lok, Tsim Sha
Tsui, Kowloon, (730-0288) for sharks fin exotica; Zen, Pacific Place,
(845-4555) for modern design and cooking, Hunan Garden, Exchange Square,
(868-2880), for hot spicy Hunan food, and The Happy Seafood Restaurant, Yuen
Long, New Territories (472- 3450) for the very freshest seafood and, on a
clear day, a view of China.

FT  05 SEP 92 / As They Say In Europe: Sophisticated louts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WELL, IF you look carefully at what I said at the time, it was a fairly
sophisticated way of trying to increase the pressure, in a variety of
different ways . . .' Thus Lord Owen explained to a news conference in
London how his earlier demand that Serbia be bombed could be reconciled with
his new post as a neutral chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference.
We have clearly seen events in eastern Germany in a false light - as a story
of unpleasant louts setting fire to refugee hostels when it was really a
tale of sophisticated attempts to put pressure on foreigners.
Fortunately the paper of the old Solidarity trade union in Warsaw, Gazeta
Wyborcza, got near the truth. Its correspondent, Andrzej Kaniewski, wrote,
'The skill which the neo-Nazi mobs showed during the week in carrying out
their actions and their apparent readiness to take further action against
asylum-seekers, prove that they are anything but a band of street
adventurers. In actual fact they are well-prepared and trained for
street-fighting.'
Kaniewski concluded that the reasons for the pogrom were not economic, but
natural taste for dictatorship among the citizens of the former GDR, so long
as 'order' was kept.
The Poles have a special distaste for the citizens of the former German
Democratic Republic after 40 odd years of 'fraternal socialist friendship.'
Now the Austrians are supposed to exhibit Germanic xenophobia only more so,
so the Vienna press has done all it can do distance itself from German
events and avoid being tarred by the Rostock brush.
Kurier wrote, 'The mob rages on the street. The state finances are
threatened, business is worried. Nazi thugs receive bourgeois applause. The
news from Germany. It recalls bad times. And arouses the fear that such
times might return.' But Kurier concluded that democracy in Germany was
strong, 'but more in the west than the east.'
For the French the events in Germany have become merely an adjunct to the
Maastricht argument. Nobody in the 'Yes' camp pretends that the proposed
treaty on economic and monetary union is a good thing; argument consists of
listing the dire consequences of voting 'No'.
Liberation thinks both sides are playing the same game: 'For one group, the
proposed European Union consecrates German domination, for the other, it is
exactly the opposite: a 'No' would provoke a fatal divorce between France
and Germany putting the latter in the dominant position on the European
continent.'
But the paper came down on the 'Yes' side, 'because a 'No' victory would
would end up by convincing Germany that the French have an opportunistic,
egoistic conception of Europe, that Germany must sacrifice itself still more
so that France can maintain the vain illusion that it governs the world.'
There are few papers that espouse the opposite cause. Those that do
originate from an odd or unsavoury point in the French political spectrum.
Thus the communist Humanite accuses the 'Yes' camp of outdoing itself in its
'chaos blackmail.' But it turns one of the arguments of its opponents on its
head - 'The idea that Europe cannot be made without France . . .
UNIMAGINABLE] they shout in unison. And that is right.' In other words there
will be no 'Europe' without France so vote 'No' because otherwise there will
be a 'Europe of the great money powers dominated by Germany.' The French
will vote no, perhaps, because it is their last chance to play a decisive
role in Europe.
It was all summed up in a glorious welter of metaphors in Die Welt: 'In the
struggle for the Maastricht vote, the house is set ablaze to grill a
schnitzel. Both sides say they see demons at work in Germany; one group
would tie it down, the others say one should not get under its claws. The
political class is divided but a 'No' would be its Waterloo . . .'

FT  05 SEP 92 / Cookery: Teaching men to fend for themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE WE got married, my husband used to woo me occasionally with his
cooking. He was a dab hand at such menus as asparagus hollandaise, baked sea
trout with cucumber and new potatoes, and a salad of peaches in orange and
lemon juice.
Blinded by love, I failed to notice what he has pointed out since - his
repertoire ran to three or four menus only. This is as much as a chap needs
to sail through social life, of course.
But if the aim is to gain enough knowledge and confidence to create
variations on culinary themes, and thus become a fully-fledged cook, then a
proper understanding of ingredients and cooking methods (rather than the
mere learning of recipes by rote) is necessary.
The belief that every man should be able to fend for himself in the kitchen
 -and fend occasionally for others, too - explains why colleagues Lyn Hall,
Lorna Wing and Roz Denny have decided to rescue non-cooking males in
distress.
Next month, they will launch Bachelor Cooks, a course to be held in Fulham,
west London, on six consecutive Monday evenings. (How sensible for them to
choose such a time - Mondays are always low tide on the social calendar).
Classes will be limited to 12 and each lesson will take the form of a menu.
First, it will be discussed and demonstrated by the three colleagues, then
cooked by the bachelors working in pairs.
By 9pm, everyone should be sitting down to eat the fruits and meats of their
labours. At this point, the party will be joined by a guest expert who will
talk about, say, buying cheese or wine.
Sample menus will include Provencal filo fingers, honey-glazed roast
chicken, basmati pilaf with green herbs, and brochettes of exotic fruits
with crushed kiwifruit and gin sauce; and char-grilled vegetables with olive
oil bruschetta, steak with red wine sauce and mustard butter, green salad
with hazelnut dressing, and whisky syllabub with red fruits.
Each menu is, I gather, designed for two people. I imagine there will be
instructions on multiplying them for a dinner party as, seductive
tete-a-tetes apart, they are not normally the the sort of meals I would
consider cooking for two (rather unsuitable, I would have thought, if a
friend rather than a lover were coming to supper or for a single parent with
a hulking teenager to feed).
The trio promise a very practical approach. Plenty of attention will be paid
to shopping such as where to buy, how to recognise quality, and how to use
bought-in foods in spectacular ways without feeling guilty. Some short-cuts
will be encouraged, but only those that do not compromise fine results.
There will be help with those most vexed problems for the novice cook:
unravelling the finer points of what can and cannot be prepared ahead
without deterioration, and learning to organise timetables so that the
various components of a meal come together precisely when you want them.
Each of the trio specialises in different fields. Hall is an ace tutor of
classic French cuisine, on her own account and for Michel Roux at the
Waterside Inn. Wing is a queen bee in catering circles, creator of
deliciously witty and imaginative party pieces. Denny is a writer and
television cook with a solid reputation for good, plain dishes expounded in
a modern and cosmopolitan way.
TOAST-RACK TOMATOES (serves 2)
For those who have not yet learned to boil the proverbial egg, here is a
pretty and fairly substantial appetiser that involves no cooking at all.
For each person, you will need one largish (5-6 oz) tomato with good
flavour. This is a tall order, I agree, but I hope Bachelor Cooks will tell
you where good tomatoes can be bought. There is a good Pick-Your-Own market
garden called The Green Landscape, in Hurst Lane, Egham, Surrey.
Remove the stalks and sit the tomatoes, calyx end down, on plates. Slice
each tomato almost, but not quite, through to the base, rather as though
preparing a stick of French bread in readiness to receive garlic butter.
Fan open gently and sprinkle sea salt, black pepper and torn basil leaves
between the slices.
Take about 7 oz of mozzarella di bufala cheese. Cut slices to size and
insert them into the tomatoes, like white pieces of 'toast' standing in
scarlet racks. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil between the slices as you
insert them.
Spoon a little more oil over the top and scatter with more basil before
serving. Lightly-toasted ciabatta bread from Marks &amp; Spencer will do well
for mopping up the delicious juices.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: How to gain real US expertise -
Robert Powell considers American mutual funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD world has long regarded the US as a land of opportunity and riches.
The US certainly has the most sophisticated financial markets in the world.
But how does a non-American gain access to the expertise of US fund
managers?
The American equivalent of the unit trust industry is the mutual fund
sector, which has been phenomenally successful in attracting US private
investors. One in every four American households owns shares of a mutual
fund, and during the past decade, the number of funds has grown from 665 to
3,570.
However, for the overseas investor, buying into a mutual fund is neither an
easy nor a tax-less task.
The non-US investor must first open - if they can - a deposit account in the
US or locate a European or an offshore financial services company which will
establish an account in the US for them.
After going through all that, they will learn that Uncle Sam will treat them
worse - at least if they invest in a money market or bond fund, than if they
had invested their funds in a unit trust domiciled outside the US, but which
also invested in US securities.
That is because under current US securities law, mutual funds are required
to distribute interest income and realised capital gains each year. Under
the same law, mutual funds must convert the interest, income and capital
gains realised and distributed into 'dividends'.
The non-US investor's 'dividend' is then subject to a US withholding tax
that ranges from 15 per cent to 30 per cent depending on whether a treaty
exists with the US. (In some countries, Germany for instance, the non-US
investor can recover that withholding tax by declaring it on their home
country tax form.)
Catherine Heron, of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group in
Washington DC, says lawmakers in Congress may pass a bill that has
bipartisan support this year that will remove the hurdles that now make it
difficult for non-US investors to buy US mutual fund shares.
The law would enable US firms to distribute interest and income and
short-term capital gains to non-US investors free from withholding tax. It
would also enable US companies to create special mutual funds for non-US
investors that would not be required to distribute income or gains annually.
In the meantime, non-US investors may be better placed investing in a fund
that is domiciled in an 'offshore' centre such as Luxembourg, Ireland or the
Bahamas. That way they can benefit from the expertise of a big US fund
manager such as Fidelity or Putnam, without incurring a tax penalty.
Robert Pozen, general counsel for Fidelity Investments in Boston, says
offshore funds are not very different from those that an investor might buy
directly in the US. And in fact there may be certain advantages.
For starters, those funds usually invest in the very same securities that
managers of US funds do. And as a result, the performance of those funds
will be similar.
For instance, Bill McBride of Lipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund
research firm in New York, said the average offshore fund that invested in
US securities rose 39.04 per cent over the five years ended June 1992. By
contrast, the average US equity fund rose in US dollars terms 47.74 per
cent. (The non-US investor would have faced a withholding tax on part of
that gain).
The top-performing offshore funds over that 5 year period were Global Asset
Management Selection Inc, up 133.85 per cent, Fidelity's Sterling American
Fund, up 127.87 per cent, and Putnam's Emerging Health Sciences Trust SA, up
105.12 per cent.
Meanwhile, the average offshore fund that invested in US equities rose 11.34
per cent over the year ended June, while the average US equity fund rose
13.01 per cent. (The top performing offshore funds over the past year were
Thornton American Opportunities Trust Income, up 19.85 per cent and Ermitage
Selz Fund Ltd, up 18.52 per cent).
McBride attributed the better performance of US-based over offshore funds to
the former's concentration in small stocks and not to superior investment
talent.
However, offshore funds are not without drawbacks, according to McBride. For
a start, the private investor does not have as many choices as in the US
domestic market. True, the number of funds that invest in US equities has
grown from 60 five years ago to 124 today, of which around 32 are managed by
US fund managers. But that still pales in comparison to the number of US
funds and firms.
According to McBride, there is some Dollars 4.2bn invested in the 124
offshore funds that invest in US equities. But there is an estimated Dollars
500 billion invested in the more than 1,200 US based equity funds. In
addition the non-US investor may not be able to put his money in a fund
managed by a superstar as Americans were able to do with Peter Lynch, the
now retired manager of Fidelity.
In addition, offshore funds are more costly to operate than US-based funds,
and as a result, investors may face higher charges. On average, the investor
in the US-domiciled equity fund will usually pay the manager 1.4 per cent of
assets under management for expenses. By contrast, McBride and others
estimated that an investor in a non-US based funds can expect to pay an
additional 0.5 of a percentage point or more in expenses each year - and
thus, all things being equal, could expect to see a lower rate of return.
Non-US investors will also have to pay a initial charge of about 5 to 6 per
cent to buy an offshore fund that invests in US securities. Such a charge
can significantly reduce the investor's return.
By contrast, many US domiciled funds have no initial charge. These so-called
'no-load' funds are sold directly to the public without the intervention of
a stockbroker, banker, insurance salesman, or financial planner.
There is a further option for non-US investors - 'cross border' funds. For
example, the Boston-based Pioneer fund, which was founded in the late 1920s,
was registered for sale in Germany in the late 1960s. German shareholders of
that fund, which is exactly the same as the fund offered for sale in the US,
are treated in the same way as if they had invested in a German-domiciled
fund.
But while experts say Pioneer has succeed in gaining market share in
Germany, they note that other US firms - because of cultural and
distribution differences - have had limited success registering US-domiciled
funds overseas.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: A friend in distress
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A friend in his early 40s has been in the popular music business for many
years. He is married with a large family and supplements his musician's
income through casual construction-related work.
Some years ago a terrible tragedy struck my friend when his toddler was
permanently handicapped after being knocked down on the road. Legal
proceedings regarding the accident are ongoing and I gather that the
youngster is likely to benefit from a compensation award at some point.
From remarks that my friend has made I suspect that he is concerned about
the prospect of his financial circumstances coming under scrutiny as part
of, or subsequent to, the legal aftermath of his child's accident.
This is because my friend has not made any returns to the Inland Revenue for
some years, and I suspect he may never have declared any of his music
business income over his whole career. My friend seems keen to legitimise
his position but does not know the best way to proceed.
The best solution is probably for your friend to explain the position to the
solicitor who is acting for his child. If the solicitor cannot assist him,
he or she will at least be able to put him in touch with a local accountant
who is experienced in that type of negotiation. It is best to have
professional representation when admitting past omissions to the Inland
Revenue - not least because some tax inspectors may adopt a slightly
bullying attitude towards unaided taxpayers.

answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: My hobby and self-employment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have followed your correspondence relating to tax liability arising from a
hobby and, as a result, have declared sales from my hobby to the Inland
Revenue. They have agreed that costs far outweigh any profit and no tax
liability arises.
The Department of Social Security is now requiring me to register as
self-employed and I am resisting this on the grounds that this is a
non-commercial venture and without the necessary intent to make a profit
there can be no question of employment.
Can you tell me if I am justified in my refusal to register as
self-employed? What, if any, appeal lies from the local Department of Social
Security and what sanctions are they able to apply?
I have sufficient contributions to draw a full retirement pension when I
reach 65. I am a higher rate tax-payer but do not seek to offset the loss on
my hobby against my tax bill.
The first thing is to get yourself exempted from class 2 contributions for
the future (and the past few weeks) on the grounds of small earnings -
without conceding that you are in fact liable to pay class 2 contributions
at all. Ask the DSS for the free leaflet NI27A, and complete the exemption
claim form which it contains. Strictly, a certificate of exception can only
be backdated by up to 13 weeks, but in the circumstances the DSS should feel
able to grant retrospective exemption for a far longer period.
You could also ask for leaflet N139 on self-employment generally. The basic
question is whether you are gainfully employed in selling the products of
your hobby. The statutory term 'gainfully employed' means that your hobby
must be pursued with the motive of gain - but not necessarily for profit
(which it clearly is not). The fact that you seek to offset some of the
costs of your hobby by making sales may well be sufficient to constitute a
motive of gain.
The appeal procedure is complicated and time consuming, so it is best to try
to reach a compromise solution with the local DSS office by correspondence,
and face-to-face discussion.
To indicate your determination to fight, however, you could ask them for an
appeal form CF90. It may be helpful if you write to your MP with a brief
outline of the situation, (and mention to the DSS that you have done so).
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED uncertainty over France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty has
kept the UK market nervous. With sterling only inches from its floor level
in the ERM, share prices are likely to remain volatile over the next few
weeks. But even these anxieties have failed to deter the more resolute
directors from buying.
Throughout 1991, insurance broking was sold heavily by many directors at a
time when it was showing relative strength against other market sectors. The
wisdom of those sales is only now becoming apparent as brokers donwgrade
forecasts after some very disappointing results, notably the Sedgwick Group.
Against this background Lord Pearson, chairman of PWS Holdings, picked up
277,500 shares at 32p. He also made a non-beneficial purchase of a further
75,000. Pearson remains by far the largest shareholder on the board, with
just over 1.7m. PWS is due to report final results in January.
When Charles Hambro, chairman of Guardian Royal Exchange, bought 50,000
shares at 128p in March this year, they rose promptly to 160p. Since then,
however, they have fallen back again.
Now, Sir Anthony Tennant, a non-executive director, has bought 25,000 at
131p. They were acquired on the same day as interim results were revealed
showing losses before tax reduced to Pounds 39m from Pounds 88m the previous
year. The improving trend owes much to GRE's strategy of raising premiums at
the cost of volume.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The market researcher who found
the answer - A woman who rediscovered her sense of excitement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO ALEX Walley, who runs Directions Research and Marketing, the thought of
setting up her own business was far more frightening than the reality.
'In practice the hardest bit was getting British Telecom to fit the phone
lines,' she says.
Directions offers strategic market research, to help companies market new or
existing brand products and services. The idea is to offer a highly
professional service to clients based on detailed interviews with carefully
chosen groups. You will not find Alex standing on a street corner asking
people what kind of washing powder they use.
Alex, who has a degree in maths and psychology, spent 18 months on leaving
university with the accountants Thomson McClintock but left to become a
market researcher with a medium sized firm. In 1987, she and two colleagues,
Liz Cox and Sally Nicholson, were approached by a large advertising agency
and asked to set up an in-house research company.
'They were offering us a profit share, fast cars on the company scheme and
lovely offices,' she recalls, but she was tired of working long hours for
someone else and decided to set up on her own with her two former
colleagues.
It took a month to set up the business and rent an office in Fulham. This
was straightforward in comparison with the efforts to raise a Pounds 10,000
loan from National Westminster and Lloyds Bank to pay for a top of the range
desk top printing system.
'Lloyds offered us a high interest personal investors'
account,' recalls Alex, 'but no business services. NatWest hummed and
hah-hed and said they only looked at serious business people. They didn't
say no but they all but did.'
The experience deterred her from approaching the other clearing banks;
luckily, a loan was arranged through banking contacts with CL Bank
Nederland. In contrast, a recent trip to the local NatWest branch to open a
petty cash account generated a totally different reaction: 'they were
falling over themselves to help us'.
In the early days, the main problem was persuading people to take them
seriously as a new business. Alex believes this was hard because all the
three partners were women. But several clients from their old company
commissioned work and since then, the client list has expanded comfortably.
It includes TSB Bank and Insurance, the Leeds Permanent Building Society and
Courtaulds Textiles.
For each project, Alex and her colleagues talk to respondants individually
or in group discussions which may last from one and a half to four hours. In
the more creative sessions, respondants act out roles. They might pretend,
for instance, to be shop assistants treating customers as they would like to
be treated themselves. A network of recruiters around the country organise
the discussion sessions and find respondants.
Alex has taken a very cautious approach. For the first three years, she
turned away work rather than risking over-expansion. She did the books
herself, once a month on a Sunday afternoon.
The number of employees has been kept low - the total now is eight - but
Alex has not been forced to make redundancies as a result of the recession
in the market research industry.
Turnover has stayed at around Pounds 750,000 a year.
'In the first year we practically killed ourselves because we were so
convinced we would go bust,' she remembers.
They all worked at least 12 hours a day and for most of the weekends. Since
then, she says, each has realised that other aspects of their lives - in
Alex's case, her two young children - are as important.
One thing she has learnt by bitter experience is the importance of a good
accountant. Directions' first firm of accountants were a 'small two man band
who were very nice and gave us lots of help with book-keeping but blew out
when it came to dividends and wouldn't admit they were out of their depth.
We lost a lot of money due to incorrect tax advice.'
'The second accountant was a complete disaster, from one of the top 20
firms. We had a partner who couldn't have been more condescending. He didn't
get our accounts out on time; one of my partners was actually fined for not
returning her tax return on time despite having told her that hehad.'
The current accountant is from a medium sized firm and does an excellent
job.
And, invariably, it's 'the little niggly things which turn into massive
problems,' as Alex says. She has just spent several days sorting out the
confusion caused by an official from the Inland Revenue who gave the wrong
advice about the payment of VAT for hotel rooms used for interviewing
respondants.
After four years, Alex regards the main problem as balancing home and work.
She wants to spend more time with her family, but doesn't want a part-time
job. She is also keen to keep the company relatively small so that people
work together well.
But she is in no doubt that working for herself has been a change for the
better.
'As soon as I started, all the excitement came back. I'm in control, I like
my clients and I enjoy the work.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: 'Ugly' job figures spread gloom all over - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST WHEN they thought it could not get any worse, it did. Yesterday's
employment report for August stunned everyone.
Those affected included President Bush, for whom the figures were very bad
news indeed; the Federal Reserve, which had hoped it could get through the
year without another interest rate cut; and Wall Street, which had been
anticipating some rare good tidings on jobs all week.
The August employment numbers were described by one analyst as 'ugly.'
Non-farm payrolls, which had been expected to rise by between 150,000 and
200,000, actually fell 83,000.
Even that decline did not tell the whole story. The figures would have been
worse had it not been for a federally-funded summer jobs programme which
boosted payrolls temporarily by 100,000.
A closer look provided even more gloom.
Employment in manufacturing industry fell by 97,000 and the number of jobs
in the goods-producing sector by 108,000, an indication that industrial
production went into sharp decline in August.
There was no comfort to be gained from the modest fall in the civilian
unemployment rate, which dipped from 7.7 per cent to 7.6 per cent last
month.
Analysts said the decline was due to more people being discouraged about
their employment chances and, therefore, not looking actively for work.
Anyone who stops looking for work comes off the unemployment register
immediately.
So, how did the markets react? The bad news delighted fixed-income
investors, as it always does.
The benchmark 30-year government bond jumped more than a point yesterday
morning, pushing the yield down to 7.26 per cent. There was an equally sharp
fall in short-term yields.
Shares showed little initial reaction, due partly to many stock market
traders having taken the day off to extend the long Labor Day weekend. In
the event, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded only a few points lower
during the morning session, a muted response which probably disguised a
tug-of-war between two opposing forces: renewed pessimism about the outlook
for the economy, but fresh optimism about the the chances for another cut in
interest rates.
Any optimism about interest rate cuts was tempered, however, by the reaction
of the foreign exchange markets. The dollar dropped more than two pfennigs
to below DM1.40 as currency dealers anticipated that the Fed would respond
to the jobs situation by easing policy, widening further the already large
gap between US and German interest rates.
But Wall Street was not convinced entirely that interest rates would fall.
After the jobs data was released at 8.30am, many analysts predicted the Fed
would ease - by lowering the discount rate and the federal funds rate (what
banks charge each other for overnight loans) - by a full 50 basis points
before the stock market began trading at 9.30.
When that deadline passed without action, speculation intensified that the
monetary authorities were holding their fire for fear of sending the dollar
into free-fall. The consensus on Wall Street, however, remained that the Fed
would cut rates again, despite the vulnerable dollar, because of political
pressures.
Almost as soon as the jobs data had been released, the Bush administration
stressed yet again that the economy, not the dollar, should be the primary
focus of monetary policy.
The White House position is that a weak dollar is not necessarily a bad
thing because it boosts export sales by lowering the cost of US goods to
overseas buyers.
In the end, the Fed did ease policy late yesterday morning by adding
reserves to the banking system to lower the federal funds rate from its
present target of 3 1/4 per cent to 3 per cent. Lowering the funds rate by a
quarter of a point was regarded as the least the Fed could do without
triggering a collapse in the dollar.
Although the Fed's actions helped to stem the dollar's slide, they failed to
lift stock market sentiment, which had been looking for a fully-fledged
discount rate cut of at least 50 basis points.
If the Fed continues to resist a more substantial policy ease, equity
investors face a potentially difficult autumn.
Sustained improvements in corporate profitability should provide some
momentum for stock prices, but a continued lack of economic growth and a
likely increase in political uncertainty as election day nears could make it
an uncomfortable ride.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: Stiff upper lip from Italy, not Britain - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY and Britain, both in currency trouble, reacted quite differently this
week. One government went for the flashy, but perhaps ultimately empty,
gesture. The other gritted its teeth, showed what it was made of, bit the
bullet, and all those other public-school cliches.
The country whose actions this week displayed operatic flourishes, is, of
course, Britain; the one that displayed a dogged determination traditionally
associated with John Bull is Italy.
In the short term, there was no doubt which gesture impressed the markets
more. Britain's decision to raise Ecu 10bn in loans to defend the pound
pushed share prices up and market interest rates down. Italy's decision to
defend the lira in a different, more painful way - by raising official
interest rates for the third time this summer - led to hectic selling in the
Italian market in after-hours share trading, with the market as a whole down
2 1/2 per cent.
The announcement of the British borrowing came at 3pm on Thursday. That
morning, the stock market had been moving upwards, anyway, as traders who
had left themselves short of stock scrambled to cover themselves against a
small burst of optimism about the British government's chances of avoiding
an interest-rate rise. Then came the treasury statement. The pound jumped
sharply, showing daylight above the ERM floor for the first time in weeks.
Shares rose, too, with the FT-SE 100 index ending Thursday at 2381.9, up 38
points in 90 minutes.
The speed of the markets' reaction owed a lot to the way the treasury and
the Bank of England caught them by surprise. In their dog-eared files on
defending the pound, civil servants will have come across a pile of
memoranda dating back to Stafford Cripps which emphasise the first rule of
currency defence: kick speculators where it hurts, in their wallets.
That means catching them off-balance and driving sterling up sharply - a big
enough move, carried out quickly enough to inflict real pain on anyone whose
positions reflected an expectation of a weaker pound.
In that, the authorities were eminently successful. They have probably
re-established themselves as a credible threat - and that alone is
sufficient to give sterling an element of protection in the two weeks before
the French referendum.
Italy faced a more difficult challenge. As one European observer of the
currency markets put it: 'The polls show that there is a 50 per cent
probability of a No vote in the French referendum. Since Italy will
certainly have to devalue if the French vote No, that means there is a 50
per cent probability of a lira devaluation in three weeks' time.
'If you calculate the interest rates required to compensate for that risk,
the numbers get pretty hairy. There has never, that I can remember, been
such a high probability of a devaluation at a defined date.'
Italy's difficulties, reflected in Friday's interest-rate rise, hang over
the London markets, too. Higher Italian interest rates were one of the
factors that led to a partial reversal of Thursday's rise in Friday's share
trading. Unexpectedly awful US employment figures, raising the strong
possibility of a further easing of US interest rates, also helped to weaken
the pound and the stock market. Sterling closed the day unchanged at DM
2.80, down two pfennigs from its high and the same distance from the ERM
floor. The FT-SE index closed at 2362.2, down 19.7 on the day and up 49.6 on
the week.
Lower US interest rates will increase the temptation to move out of dollars
and into D-Marks, pushing up the German currency within the ERM and making
life still more difficult for the currencies at the bottom of the system.
By Friday, the immediate fears of a rise in UK interest rates had eased  -
three-month money, at 10 5/16 , is only a quarter-point or so higher than
base rates - but the treasury's Thursday coup had left at least some
observers unimpressed.
If sterling again were to come under ERM pressure, say the economists at SG
Warburg, with most of the plausible shots in the Bank of England's armoury
now fired, it would be 'increasingly difficult to see any alternative but
higher UK rates.'
A similar pessimism can be detected in a striking volte-face at Goldman
Sachs: at the beginning of August, its European strategists put the UK top
of their list of equity markets to buy in Europe; by September, with share
prices 4 per cent cheaper, the UK had dropped to seventh place in a list of
nine.
Meanwhile, back in the real world, a flood of companies have been reporting
their interim results. Overall, the numbers reflect a further worsening from
an already depressed period of earnings last year. But manufacturing
companies - doing better than their depressed cousins in the service and
financial sectors - are starting to show an improvement in profits, and
dividends are also holding up. This week, for example, Reckitt &amp; Colman
announced a 5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Similarly, Burmah
Castrol's profits gained 17 per cent, Cookson 100 per cent, T&amp;N 71 per cent,
Bowater 19 per cent and Laird 43 per cent.
One trend in the results has been the impact of the weak dollar on companies
with big US operations or competition from companies in dollar-linked
economies, such those in the Far East. However, companies which have been
dollar borrowers are chalking up double gains: not only are US interest
rates now at bargain-basement levels, but every dollar of debt service now
costs a fifth less in sterling terms than it did in the summer of 1991.
Hanson and Bowater - companies famous for their knack of borrowing in
dollars and depositing cash in sterling - must be watching the currency
markets' antics with an indulgent smile.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: Old dog with a zest for life - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROLL CALL of Reckitt &amp; Colman's brands sounds like a recitation of the
shopping lists of consumers all around the world. Many of the names would
have been on the lists of housewives in former generations - Woolite
detergent, Robin starch, Colman's mustard, Robinson's barley water. Others -
like Down to Earth in the UK, Maison Verte in France and Casa Verde in Spain
 -are newcomers to the supermarket shelves.
None of the group's leading brands costs more than a few pounds and all are,
more or less, daily necessities. As such, Reckitt's looks a safe bet in a
recession. And, on Thursday, the company proved its merits with half-year
profits ahead, if not by much, and trading margins higher yet again. Pre-tax
profits were Pounds 134.2m (Pounds 127.6m) and trading margins 16.2 per cent
(14.8 per cent).
Few companies supplying the volume-driven supermarkets have been able to
increase their own margins in the present hostile trading climate. And even
selling into 120 different countries around the world, most of Reckitt's
important markets are in recession.
So, the margin improvement is creditable, although much of it came from the
disposal of lower-margin businesses such as its US spice and seasoning
subsidiary and its South African food activities.
Underneath the bushel of what look fairly unexciting figures, however,
Reckitt is hiding a light. The group has pursued productivity and efficiency
gains ruthlessly, more than offsetting a rise in marketing costs. These
costs have been increasing as a proportion of sales for some years now and
Vernon Sankey, the chief executive, says the group aims to continue heavy
investment in its brands to keep up their profiles and push their market
shares forward.
But he reckons this heavy investment can be financed from ever greater
efficiencies, The secret to making those, says finance director Iain Dobbie,
is never to think you have finished.
The group has, for example, been re-organising its European manufacturing
activities. Rather than make the range of products in factories throughout
the Continent, the aim has been to focus production of one group of products
in one place. This has already produced savings and more are expected.
The strategy of investing in existing brands, adding new ones in the same
categories, or extending ranges (such as adding Dettox disinfectant cleaner
to the Dettol antiseptic range) or launching established brands in new
countries (like the launch of Lemsip, the cold treatment, in Australia) is a
change from the one the company pursued in the 1980s.
Sankey explains that, in the past decade, the group's plan was to make
acquisitions which gave it critical mass in its chosen product and
geographical areas. These deals included the Pounds 165m purchase of
Airwick, the air fresheners' business, in 1984; the acquisition of Durkee
Famous Foods for Pounds 80m in 1986; and, most importantly, the Dollars
1.25bn purchase of Boyle-Midway of the US in 1990.
A number of disposals have been made recently, bringing in more than Pounds
150m in cash; and at the time of the Boyle-Midway deal, the group raised
Pounds 200m through an issue of convertible capital bonds (which are
regarded as equity since there is no facility for redemption in cash only
through conversion to shares).
Even so, the level of debt - which was Pounds 338m net at the end of 1991;
47 per cent of shareholders' funds - is still high. Gearing would look much
worse but for the inclusion on the balance sheet of Pounds 587m worth of
acquired brands.
But if the big acquisitions are a thing of the past, the group may now be
able to cut borrowings through good cash generation. The high marketing
costs are not capitalised, and the group does not revalue the brands in its
balance sheet upwards.
Reckitt is unfortunate in being placed in the health and household sector,
where most of the companies are big drug groups such as Glaxo and Wellcome.
Were it included in the food manufacturing sector - like them, it sells most
of its products to the food retailers - its performance would look better.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Building materials gloom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not difficult to see why the Building Materials sector has had a tough
year. With the property market in its current straitened circumstances,
analysts and marketmakers have been very nervous about investing. There are
also concerns about over-capacity and falling prices, although analysts
believe that volumes have held up surprisingly well. Over the year to
Thursday of this week, the FT-Actuaries Building Materials Index had fallen
by 23.26 per cent; the Property sector by comparison, had dropped by 36.64
per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices fell again in August according to the Nationwide and Halifax
price indices this week. Nationwide recorded a 0.2 per cent fall in prices
compared to the previous month, while Halifax found a 0.7 per cent fall. UK
house prices have fallen by over 5 per cent over the 12 months to August,
according to both indices.
Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said concern about the
economy was continuing to depress the market. The reintroduction last month
of stamp duty would 'act as a further brake on the market in the short
term,' he said. Halifax also had a gloomy prognosis, foreseeing no upturn in
the market this year and only muted recovery next, unless the economy
recovers.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Markets: Banks put their faith in apathy - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCENE: a bank manager's office. A customer enters and sits opposite the
manager and his assistant, who is taking notes. The customer begins to
speak.
'I'd like a new type of account, please.'
'Certainly, sir. What would you like?'
'An account where I give you lots of money and you hit me with a charge
every time I try to claim my money back. In return, I want you to pay me a
minimal rate of interest.'
'Minimal?' the assistant asks, incredulously.
'Yes' says the customer, with a superior smile. 'You spell that with two
Ms.'
'How much interest?' asks the manager.
'Oh, only 1 per cent.'
'Right away, sir.'
Surreptitiously, men in white coats have crept into the office and start to
carry the customer away.
'And I want to pay 30 per cent interest if I go into overdraft,' he shouts,
'You can't turn me down. I'm the Emperor Napoleon . . .'
                     *      *      *
That scene will doubtless be repeated in thousands of banks up and down the
country as customers embrace the prospect of paying charges on their
accounts - even when in credit.
Of course, it might not happen. The banks may have been indulging in the
time-honoured political tradition of kite-flying. If a minister plans a
potentially controversial change in policy, the tactic is to leak to a
newspaper that such a move is being 'considered.' If the story passes
without comment, it is safe to go ahead. But if armed gangs march on
Whitehall, the minister can drop the change with only a minimal loss of
face.
Plenty of angry words have been directed at the banks over the past few
days. Whether any of it will translate into action is another matter.
Britons are notoriously lethargic about changing their bank accounts -
something which the banks know only too well.
Indeed, you could argue that most customers are mad not to have moved their
accounts away from the Big Four already. The rates of interest available on
current accounts have dwindled to paltry levels and can be beaten easily
elsewhere (as David Barchard shows on the opposite page).
The problem is that changing accounts involves a lot of hassle. Every
standing order and every direct debit must be altered. Your employer must be
told to pay your salary into the new account. And if the whole process does
not go smoothly you can get into a dreadful mess, with angry unpaid
creditors, or an overdraft, or both.
But if you really want to avoid paying charges, and you do not want to
change your account, you might be able to avoid all the aggravation by
sending just one letter. Write to your local branch manager and tell him
that you will move your account if the bank imposes charges when you are in
credit.
Despite all the sound and fury of the past few days, this is not a moral
issue - just a financial one. Banks are there to make a profit; and if they
cannot earn money from business lending (because of bad debts), share
trading (because of low volumes) or mortgage lending (because of the state
of the housing market), it is only natural that they will seek to take their
profits from their account-holders.
That is the nature of capitalism. It is a strange nation that keeps
re-electing Conservative governments time after time, yet fails to
understand the profit principle.
So, the customer merely has to work the levers of the capitalist system. If
enough people threaten to withdraw their accounts, the banks will not risk
making the change - for the good reason that it will not be profitable.
Some would argue that the moral case against the banks is that they are
planning to introduce charges as a group. It is always possible to see plots
everywhere, but one suspects that the most important factor in this instance
is the fear of being first. As soon as one moves, the others will feel it is
safe to follow (just as others were quick to copy the first bank which paid
interest on current accounts). Is this a cartel or a form of what economists
call a 'perfectly competitive' market?
Take credit cards. Lloyds was the first to levy an annual charge;
eventually, the other Big Four clearers followed its example. But it is
still possible to own a card that does not charge a fee - most consumers are
too apathetic to make the effort of getting one, perhaps because most fees
are relatively small.
Indeed, the card issue is an appropriate precedent for the account-charging
issue. Initially, most people were slow in paying off their balances and,
thus, ended up paying the (fairly hefty) interest rates to the issuers.
Eventually, however, smart consumers realised they could get free credit by
paying off their balances in full every month.
As a result, the banks' profits fell and they started to argue that the
indebted customers were subsidising the early payers. Hence, the
introduction of the annual fee.
A cynic might see this as merely the Darwinian system of the capitalist
jungle in action - a never-ending battle between the predators (the
industry) and the prey (the customer), with each evolving strategies that
frustrate the other. Sadly, lethargy is no longer an option; the price of
free banking is eternal vigilance.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles at Pounds 18m and flotation plans
reaffirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the leveraged buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food retail
business, yesterday reaffirmed its plans for a flotation in 1995 when
announcing results for the year to April 25.
The group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18m (Pounds 3.6m) but there was an
attributable loss of Pounds 146.2m (Pounds 21.2m) after a Pounds 161m
write-down of the value of businesses and assets the group is hoping to sell
for Pounds 57.7m.
This largely refers to the Herman's Sporting Goods chain in the US, the
value of which was reduced by Pounds 144.8m.
Isosceles published its annual report, which was given an unqualified
auditors report. The previous two years' accounts had been qualified.
The accounts showed that Pounds 1.9m was paid to former directors in
compensation. Mr David Smith, who led the buy-out in 1989, and Ms Liz
Hignell, who was finance director, left during the year.
The group also wrote to shareholders detailing the refinancing agreement it
signed with its bankers this week. Shareholders are to vote on the deal at a
special meeting on October 8, but already holders of over 90 per cent of the
shares have said they will support the resolution.
Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman, said he expected to sell Wellworth, the Northern
Irish food retail subsidiary, by the end of 1992 rather than floating it as
it said it would in the spring. He said the group was also in talks with
possible buyers for the Herman's chain, and this might be sold by the end of
the current financial year.
The group's results showed a fall in sales from Pounds 3.1bn to Pounds 3bn,
but the fall was almost all due to the sale of some stores to Kwik Save.
Operating profits also appeared to fall, from Pounds 189.3m to Pounds
187.4m.
A drop in interest charges from Pounds 185.7m to Pounds 159.7m was largely
due to the refinancing completed at Christmas 1990, when Pounds 222m of
equity was added, Mr Bob Nellist, finance director, said.
He said there was a negative swing on profits of about Pounds 30m. The sale
of the stores to Kwik Save had taken out profits of Pounds 5.5m in the
previous year and there were exceptional costs of Pounds 9.7m relating
mainly to property write-downs and redundancies. The previous year had
included Pounds 7m of foreign exchange gains which were not repeated and the
group capitalised Pounds 7.4m less interest in the latest year.
Mr Bob Willett, chief executive of the Gateway chain, said the group was
progressing with the plan to reposition the business. 'We have the
solutions, we just need some time.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon requests share suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Harland Simon, the control systems group, were suspended yesterday
at its request after the company apparently ran into serious financial
difficulties.
The reason given for the share suspension was the need for clarification of
Harland's financial position, a phrase often used when negotiations between
companies and their bankers have broken down.
Harland, which makes control and automation systems, said it hoped to make a
further statement next week.
It is understoood that Barclays, Harland's bankers, had called in some of
its overdraft facility, leading to a working capital crisis.
Harland's overdraft, which is repayable upon demand, stood at about Pounds
14m at the end of July, but has since been reduced by Pounds 6.9m with the
proceeds of the sale of Vickereys, a specialist blade and equipment maker.
Harland had hoped to use the proceeds of the Vickereys sale to repay
borrowings, and then draw down fresh facilities for general working capital
needs. However, Barclays has kept the money and is refusing to extend new
facilities.
Harland has been in trouble since a profits warning in February, prompted in
part by exposure to companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Since then the shares have tumbled from 653p and a capitalisation of Pounds
115m, to 20p at suspension, worth only Pounds 3.5m.
Mr Roy Ashman, the former chairman, has been replaced and the company has
since been dogged by reports of collapsing morale and dwindling orders. The
accounts for last year were qualified after its auditors were unable to
trace the ownership of a stake in a loss-making information system, PIL. The
auditors could not conclude whether PIL was an associate.
Borrowings of about Pounds 5.4m represent more than 40 per cent of
shareholders funds, which fell sharply last year following losses and
provisions. Further disposals were planned to reduce borrowings.
A large institutional shareholder said yesterday's announcement was 'totally
out of the blue'. He said shareholders were expecting news of further sales,
and had believed Harland's banking relationship to be sound.

DIRECTORS of Andrews Sykes, the industrial services and environmental
products group which changed its name from Braithwaite last year, face a
battle for control of the company with a dissident shareholder.
Sykes said yesterday that Mr Jacques Murray, who holds a 26.63 per cent
stake in the group, had called for an extraordinary general meeting. Mr
Murray is also chairman of Nu-Swift, and majority shareholder in the office
cleaning and fire protection group.
The meeting, which will probably be held in late October, will be asked to
consider resolutions for the removal of Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and Mr
David Crowe, a non-executive director, from the 5-man board and replacing
them with Mr Murray and three of his associates.
Mr Hubbard said yesterday that he would resist moves by 'a minority
shareholder to grab control of the company' without making a full bid.
The directors said they would be recommending shareholders to vote against
the resolutions. In their opinion and that of the company's advisers the
mover 'would be neither desirable for the company nor in the best interests
of other shareholders.'
The company's shares closed up 5p at 130p yesterday.
For the year to March 1992 Sykes returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m
from a turnover of Pounds 56.8m.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pearson ahead of City hopes with Pounds 35m

<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, suffered a 14 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34.8m for the half year ended June 30
 -a better result than the City had expected.
Newspapers, books and entertainment all improved their profits despite the
effects of recession.
'With the major world economies still in or near recession we have seen no
let up in the harsh trading conditions which characterised 1991, and to
which the additional burden of a weaker US dollar has recently been added,'
said Lord Blakenham, the chairman. He believed the recession in the UK could
continue for another two years and that the company was treating the current
situation as normal.
'We believe we are in a strong position to live with this recession for some
time to come,' Lord Blakenham said.
Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director, added that cost-cutting would
continue. 'I don't think there is ever an end to cost-cutting,' he said.
Group sales for the first half totalled Pounds 694.8m (Pounds 700.4m).
Earnings declined to 4.4p (5.1p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at
5.375p.
Mr Eric de Bellaigue, publishing analyst at stockbrokers Panmure Gordon,
said the results were a little better than expected but he was not changing
his full-year forecast of pre-tax profits of Pounds 160m.
The share price closed 2p higher at 314p.
Trading profits of the newspaper division increased from Pounds 13.8m to
Pounds 15.1m, an improvement of 9 per cent. The contribution to the division
from the Financial Times Group, including the newspaper, business
information services and Les Echos, the French business paper, rose by 22
per cent, from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 13.2m.
Books swung from losses of Pounds 13.4m to profits of Pounds 2.4m. Most of
the improvement came from Penguin, particularly in the US where the
publisher currently has seven titles in the New York Times top 50 best
seller list.
Trading profits from entertainment increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
1.6m but oil services suffered a 55 per cent drop from Pounds 16.6m to
Pounds 7.4m as major US oil companies ran down exploration and development.
A sharp decline in investment banking to Pounds 7m (Pounds 12.9m) reflected
the reduction in merger and acquisition activity, particularly in the UK.
Fine china trading profits fell by 59 per cent to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 5.4m),
mainly because margins had suffered in difficult market conditions.
'Firm cost control by all our businesses has continued to improve our
overall cash performance and reinforce a very strong balance sheet,' Lord
Blakenham said.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ewart board changes blocked by institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Ewart, the Belfast-based property company, at
an extraordinary meeting yesterday defeated a move led by a dissident
shareholder, Mr Philip Monahan, to gain control of the company.
Ewart said institutional shareholders, which own 52.8 per cent of its
shares, unanimously opposed proposals to replace four of its directors with
nominees of the dissident shareholder group. The dissidents include Mr
Monahan, chairman of Republic of Ireland-based Monarch Properties, which
holds a 29.2 per cent stake in Ewart. He has been a non-executive director
of Ewart since 1990 and is backed by several Ireland-based businessmen who
have business interests with him.
However, Mr Monahan yesterday signalled his intention to carry on his effort
for control of the company. In a prepared statement, he said he had no
intention of selling his stake and that his group would press for additional
representation on the board.
Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of Ewart, said that 96 per cent of
shareholders voted, an unusually high turn-out for such a meeting, and that
his board had the unanimous support of institutions. He called on Mr Monahan
to either support the current board or make an offer to buy the stakes of
all shareholders. If neither of those was acceptable, he should resign.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dividend cuts already built into the share
price - Andrew Taylor previews the construction sector's interim results due
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDLY A day seems to have gone by this summer by without some stockbroker
reducing a profit forecast for a construction or building materials company.
The stockbrokers' views will be put to the test next week when some of the
biggest companies in the sector are to due to publish results for the first
half of this year.
Fears that the figures may be accompanied by dividend cuts have already
caused shares to fall.
Since the beginning of June the FT-Actuaries Construction Index has
under-performed the FT-A All Share Index by about 40 per cent. The building
materials index has underperformed by a quarter.
The ability of companies to maintain payments to shareholders by raiding
reserves has been exhausted, says Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst
for Warburg Securities.
'There is a growing realisation that housing and commercial property
profits, bolstered by high inflation, will not be repeated even when these
markets recover. Companies in the 1990s will not be able to afford dividend
payments made in the 1980s.'
Reduced dividends are expected from several companies. Others are likely to
issue warnings that year-end payments may be reduced unless trading
conditions improve - which nobody expects to happen.
At best, dividends will stand still in cash terms representing a fall in
real terms, says Warburg.
Deepening the gloom is the fact that there is still no sign of a recovery
beginning in the UK housing market, which has been in recession for almost
four years.
Margins have slumped as house prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent in
some parts of the country. Builders meanwhile have been working through
expensively priced land bought in the late 1980s, when house prices peaked.
There is concern that some contractors may have to increase provisions
against their housing and commercial property operations. This has made it
more difficult than usual to forecast results.
Building materials companies have suffered as sales and prices of building
products have fallen as demand for construction has reduced. There is large
over-capacity and further plant closures and redundancies are inevitable.
Dominating next week's results will be first half figures, due on Tuesday,
from Wimpey, Britain's second biggest housebuilder.
Wimpey's share price fell by almost a fifth, from 97p to 79p, during four
trading days days this week on fears that the company may reduce its interim
dividend from 4p paid last year.
Forecasts of first half losses at Wimpey range from Pounds 2m to Pounds 7m.
In the first half last year the group made a Pounds 5m pre-tax loss.
Taylor Woodrow, the construction and property development company which has
seen its share price halved from 119p to 52p since the beginning of June, is
also expected to cut its interim dividend.
The company which publishes its results on Wednesday is thought likely to
announce pre-tax losses of about Pounds 5m. In the first six months of last
year the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25.3m and paid an interim
dividend of 1.86p.
Amec, which so far has ridden out the recession better than most
contractors, is due to report on Thursday. It is expected to maintain its
interim dividend at 4p despite forecasts that interim profits will fall from
Pounds 21.9m to about Pounds 14m.
Other companies reporting on 'construction Thursday' include John Laing, the
contractor, where profits are expected to be only slightly down on last
year's Pounds 6.3m and Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer
where profits are forecast to fall from Pounds 57.5m to a little more than
Pounds 40m.
Laing last year cut its final dividend from 10p to 6p but may decide to
spread the cut more evenly by trimming its interim from 3p last year. Blue
Circle is expected to maintain its interim of 3.75p.
Rugby, Britain's third largest cement manufacturer, is likely to be one of
the few building related companies, to announce an increase in interim
profits which are forecast to rise from Pounds 27.4m to about Pounds 30m. It
has been helped by improvements in Australia and the US, where a fragile
recovery in construction output appears to have begun.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Laird bucks sector trend with 43% rise to
Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAIRD GROUP, the car components and industrial products company, has defied
the trends of a globally depressed automotive market to report a 43 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 20.5m.
Sales for the half year ended June 30 rose a more modest 15 per cent to
Pounds 295m.
The results came in slightly better than analysts had been expecting, and
the shares rose 9p to close at 266p.
Laird, which has spent three years investing heavily in plant and expansion,
benefited from the introduction of the new Volkswagen Golf and Vauxhall
Astra models last year. The group helped to develop and now supplies the
systems for sealing windows and doors on these models.
Operating profits in the sealing systems division, which supplies car
manufacturers mainly in Germany and France, more than doubled from last
year's depressed levels to Pounds 13.7m.
The return was buoyed by the absence of last year's Pounds 2m first half
start-up costs relating to the new model systems, and a return to the double
digit margins achieved in 1989. Last year margins had fallen to about 7 per
cent.
Mr Charles Barton, finance director, said that although car sales in Germany
were declining from the high levels of 1991, production at this stage
appeared to be holding firm. Laird continued to invest in new models,
although the finance director said the group's current projects did not
include vehicles with the high volumes of the Astra or Golf.
Laird's plastics distribution and packaging business, which operates mainly
in the US, proved a disappointment with profits tumbling 34 per cent to
Pounds 3.5m. Mr Barton said there was no sign of an easing in the difficult
economic conditions in the US.
However, the small Scottish company which provides products and services to
the UK computer industry achieved higher profits in the first half.
The industrial products operation, which supplies plastic and rubber vehicle
components, increased operating profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 7.1m.
The interim dividend is being increased to 4.2p (4p). Earnings per share,
after adjusting for the bonus element of the Pounds 41m 1-for-5 rights issue
last April, rose from 8.3p to 11.7p.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Further moves in train to oust Simpsons'
board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly hostile battle for control of Simpsons of Cornhill, owner
of two of the City's most famous restaurants, took a new turn yesterday when
dissident shareholders announced moves to oust the board.
Rebel shareholders led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select
Appointments, have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting amid claims that
the board has abandoned plans to develop a themed-restaurant chain along the
lines of Simpsons, the 17th century chop house.
The board, which refused to allow voting on a rebel resolution to elect two
new directors at an EGM last month, has rejected the allegations.
Mr Paul Reece, managing director of Simpsons, said resolutions seeking the
removal of the board and disclosure of executive salaries would be
vigorously opposed.
He also dismissed claims that the rebel group had the support of 40 per cent
of the shareholders.
Mr Klapp, meanwhile, yesterday outlined his long-term strategy for the
company which was floated last August, raising Pounds 2m for the acquisition
of Simpsons and the nearby Jamaica Inn.
'We could build up a group of traditional chop houses nationally with
restaurants in towns such as Bristol and Oxford,' he said.
The rebels - who already have the support of Mr Alan Crompton-Batt, an
existing Simpsons' director - also revealed that investors in the Far East
were behind a 10 per cent stake in the company recently purchased by
Mountjoy, registered in the Turk and Caicos Islands.
Overseas investors are thought to be interested in opening a Simpsons-style
restaurant in Hong Kong.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ensor Holdings, which is engaged in the building and motor vehicle
industries, ran up a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.38m in the year ended March 31
1992 against a profit of Pounds 327,000.
Also there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.65m for writing down
assets and other losses consequent on the closure of the aggregate
manufacturing business.
Turnover fell from Pounds 52.7m to Pounds 46.6m. Losses per share were 9.14p
(earnings 2.3p).
Profits in vehicle dealership were Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 925,000), in
distribution Pounds 2,000 (Pounds 218,000) and in metal products manufacture
Pounds 154,000 (Pounds 229,000). The blocks and bricks side incurred a loss
of Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 107,000).

<TEXT>
An attack on costs enabled Gibbs &amp; Dandy, the builders' merchant, to cut its
pre-tax loss from Pounds 405,000 to Pounds 92,000 in the opening half of
1992.
Turnover fell 2.5 per cent to Pounds 11.3m because of the recession in the
construction industry, with the consequent reduction in volume sales.
However, operating profit moved ahead from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 121,000
as staff levels were cut by a further 5 per cent, bad debts were reduced
through stricter control, and operating costs were tightened.
On top of that, interest charges were reduced by Pounds 85,000 to Pounds
213,000.
Losses per share worked through at 1.2p (5.1p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Progress has been made towards resolving many of Sale Tilney's problems
according to Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive. However trading in the six
months to May 27 had been disappointing with net liabilities increasing to
Pounds 11.6m.
The company, with food, industrial, insurance and financial services
interests, cut its pre-tax loss to Pounds 2.53m (Pounds 3.68m) on turnover
of Pounds 44.2m (Pounds 69.3m) of which Pounds 11.2m (28m) related to
discontinued businesses.
Debt was cut from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 20.7m over the six months. The net
interest charge was lower at Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.31m).
The outcome for the year was dependent on the progress of certain contracts
in the industrial division.
After a Pounds 1.12m extraordinary surplus, attributable losses came out at
Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 4.57m). Losses per share were 9.1p (13.6p). Again there
is no dividend.

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff beats low US oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the recession and depressed oil and gas prices in the US,
Pittencrieff increased its pre-tax profit by 42 per cent in the first half
of 1992.
The group, also engaged in the communications business, saw turnover jump
from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 7.09m. The profit was up from Pounds 1.55m to
Pounds 2.21m, and included Pounds 401,000 exceptional net gain on the sale
of the shareholding in AmBrit International.
Gross profit rose almost 50 per cent to Pounds 2.7m despite margins being
reduced from 42.4 to 37.5 per cent as a result of curtailed oil and gas
volumes and low product prices, and the temporary impact of high operating
costs inherited from recent communications acquisitions.
In communications, turnover more than doubled to Dollars 9m (Pounds 4.5m)
while gross profit doubled to Dollars 2.9m.
Earnings were 9.4p (7.19p) and the interim dividend is 3p on increased
capital (2.5p).

FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Taylor Nelson turns in Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Nelson AGB has issued its first set of results since becoming the
largest market research group within the UK.
That followed the merger this year of Taylor Nelson with AGB, RSGB, ASL and
IMR.
In the six months ended June 30 1992, the expanded group produced turnover
of Pounds 20.5m and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.61m, and has declared an
interim dividend of 0.1p. Earnings came to 0.63p (0.05p).
Taylor Nelson's turnover rose from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 10.4m while the AGB
businesses generated Pounds 10.1m since acquisition. Last year's profit was
Pounds 40,000.
Extraordinary charges of Pounds 625,000 included settlement of the Autocar
litigation of Pounds 175,000, and provisions of Pounds 450,000 for rent
arrears under original tenant liabilities resulting from the insolvency of
tenants in leased properties which were sold by Addison Consultancy some
years ago.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of three start-up operations had an adverse affect on Perry Group,
the motor dealer, and its pre-tax profit was halved to Pounds 553,000 in the
opening six months of 1992.
Profits generated from existing businesses almost matched the previous year,
said Mr Richard Allan, chairman and chief executive.
New vehicle profits improved on unchanged volumes, but used car volumes and
margins were down, and servicing and body repairing also fell. The parts
operation 'did well' to match last year, he said.
The half year profit was made on turnover of almost Pounds 151m, and
compared with Pounds 1.11m generated from Pounds 154.1m. Earnings per share
were halved to 2p but the interim dividend is again 2.75p.
Mr Allan said August sales were similar in size to last year, but the
dealerships were reporting improved results.

cent of the fully diluted share capital.
Trimoco has recommended that shareholders accept Hart-well's increased and
final offers which value the company at Pounds 29.6m.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Italy's action fails to protect lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY forced up interest rates yesterday by 1.75 percentage points, the
biggest increase in 11 years, and drew on international central bank credits
in a fresh attempt to protect the lira.
The rise in the Bank of Italy's discount rate to 15 per cent, the highest
since 1985, was accompanied by further heavy intervention but gave no
significant boost to the lira.
The Italian currency finished a nervous European trading day close to its
floor in the European Monetary System against the D-Mark.
The international efforts to bolster the lira, backed by the German and
Belgian central banks, represented one of the largest EMS support operations
since the last full-scale realignment nearly six years ago.
In spite of the action, the lira closed in Milan at its EMS floor of 765.40
against the D-Mark. In London it closed just off its floor at 765.0.
Italian commercial banks said they would match the discount rate increase
with a rise in interest rates charged to customers.
The discount rate move was accompanied by increases in short-term money
market rates, which yesterday were about 18 per cent. Mr Giovanni Agnelli,
chairman of the Fiat group, said: 'We are very concerned. Interest rates
have reached unbearable levels for industry.'
The Bank of Italy said the lira had become vulnerable after the UK's move on
Thursday to borrow Ecu10bn of foreign currencies to prop up sterling. This
shifted international selling pressure from the pound to the lira.
In intervening to support the lira, the Bundesbank and Belgian central bank
were acting under EMS rules requiring automatic action to prop up weak
currencies once they touch their floor.
Although the Italian authorities insisted the country was not running short
of foreign exchange reserves, the Bank of Italy's convertible currency
holdings have fallen sharply during the lira's weakness of the past two
months.
Figures for Italy's foreign currency reserves at the end of July showed a
total of L27,808bn against L38,583bn the previous month and L66,513bn in
July 1991.
Partly in response to this drain on reserves, the Bank of Italy announced
yesterday it was making use of EMS credit facilities to borrow unlimited
amounts of strong currencies for up to 2 1/2 months to defend the lira's
parity.
Using foreign currency drawn from the other EMS central banks, the Bank of
Italy intervened early in the day, selling DM890m and BFr800m to protect the
lira. The Bundesbank, according to market dealers, bought L13bn at
yesterday's midday currency fixing.
By drawing on EMS credit facilities, the Bank of Italy appears anxious to
remind the Bundesbank in particular that the weakness of the lira does not
have repercussions only for Italy.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Patten rules out return of O-level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that the government might reintroduce the O-level examination
following the GCSE standards controversy has been dispelled by Mr John
Patten, the education secretary.
Mr Patten said his aim was to improve the present system rather than abolish
it. His remarks follow the furore surrounding a report by Her Majesty's
Inspectorate which suggested that standards may have been slipping since the
GCSE replaced O-levels and CSEs in 1988.
The report prompted Mr Patten to demand an investigation by the independent
examination boards and raised the hopes of educational traditionalists and
rightwing Tories that the single examination might be scrapped.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Patten rejected criticism from
the Labour party and teachers' unions that he had used the report to
undermine confidence in the GCSE.
He expected the boards, which will be holding a joint meeting later this
month, to respond swiftly to the 'serious criticisms' of the inspectors. But
he added that he had been surprised by the report and had no intention of
using it as a cover to promote a further shake-up.
Mr Patten emphasised that the criticisms had not been directed at pupils or
teachers but at the boards responsible for setting and marking the
examinations.
He said the aim was to improve the present all-ability test rather than seek
a return to O-levels and added: 'I certainly hope that we can make a single
examination work.' It is understood this view is shared by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, a keen supporter of an examination for 15 and
16-year-olds which recognises achievement at all levels.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Dollar and sterling hit by poor US jobs data: Fed funds rate
cut - Economy weaker than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR and sterling came under renewed selling pressure yesterday after
worse-than-expected US employment figures indicated that the economy was far
weaker than thought.
After the news that US non-farm payrolls had plunged by 83,000 in August,
the Federal Reserve further relaxed monetary policy by signalling a cut of
1/4 point to 3 per cent in the Fed funds rate, at which US banks lend to
each other.
The jobs data reversed the revival of the dollar and sterling which had
followed the UK government's decision on Thursday to borrow Ecu10bn (Pounds
7.27bn) of foreign currencies in the coming months and sell them for pounds.
The dollar yesterday fell by nearly 4 pfennigs in the space of an hour,
hitting DM1.3940 at one point before recovering to close at DM1.4030 in
London, nearly a pfennig down on the day. In New York, it closed at
DM1.4017.
Sterling lost most of the gains it had made in the previous 24 hours to
close unchanged in London at DM2.80, a level it maintained in New York.
The payroll report showed that the US economy is in a worse state than had
been expected and was seen last night as an embarrassment to President
George Bush's administration.
Analysts had been expecting employment in the US to rise by about 150,000
last month. The news was particularly gloomy because it incorporated the
benefits of the US government's summer jobs programme, without which
employment would have fallen by 183,000.
'The report is an across-the-board disaster', said Mr Norman Robertson,
chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 'It raises the possibility
that the economy may be slipping into another decline.'
The cut in the Fed funds rate was the first reduction in US interest rates
since July, when the US central bank cut both the discount rate and the Fed
funds rate by  1/2 point. The Fed funds rate sets the level of short-term
interest rates throughout the country but is less influential than the
discount rate.
The UK government's large foreign currency borrowing plan was intended to
protect sterling against a cut in US interest rates as well as against
uncertainty within the European exchange rate mechanism in the run-up to the
September 20 French referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The Fed has lowered short-term interest rates by more than 5 percentage
points since the recession began in the summer of 1990. Although these rate
cuts have had little impact on the economy, they have helped to depress the
dollar.
With official short-term interest rates in Germany at 9.75 per cent,
yesterday's move seems set to increase the incentive for investors to move
funds into D-Marks from the dollar.
The US employment figures also checked the sharp rise in equities that
followed the announcement of the British foreign borrowing plans. After
rising by 68.9 on Thursday, the FT-SE 100 index closed down 19.7 at 2,362.2.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 10.27 to 3,281.93.
The Bush administration drew some comfort from a slight decline in the
unemployment rate, to 7.6 per cent compared with 7.7 per cent in July, even
though this reflected the impact of the summer jobs programme on teenage
unemployment.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY HOPES were dismissed by motor industry leaders yesterday after UK
new car registrations in August, the most important sales month of the year,
rose only slightly by 1.7 per cent compared with last year.
Rover, which has introduced a three-day week on Metro and Mini assembly at
Longbridge, Birmingham, last night announced further reductions in output of
its Rover 200/400 series.
Overall new car registrations last month rose to 373,804 from last year's
depressed level of 367,646, but demand remained well below industry
forecasts for sales of around 400,000.
Sales have failed to rally in spite of heavy marketing by car makers
including widespread dealer discounting, manufacturer cash rebates and
offers such as free insurance, free road fund licence and low-cost finance.

FT  05 SEP 92 / National Savings goes to the Far Side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL SAVINGS has unveiled the latest weapon in its battle for the
nation's wallets - Gary Larson. The Far Side cartoonist's work will head a
campaign aimed at persuading private investors to help fund the UK's growing
budget deficit.
Larson's work will appear in animated version for the first time in a series
of UK television adverts starting on Wednesday. British animators have
adapted the US artist's cartoons, which mainly involve animals and are noted
for their off-beat humour, with the creator's approval. Newspaper
advertisements will also carry Larson's car-toons.
National Savings says the campaign is aimed at attracting many investors,
often in the 30 to 50-year-old range, who regard the government department's
products as down-market and dull. The cartoons are designed to give the
investment schemes a more up-to-date image. The campaign will be cheaper
than the department's previous efforts which have involved actors and
location filming.
The National Savings department's success in attracting savers has been
complained about recently by the building societies. Rates on National
Savings products have been cut twice in an attempt to head off criticism.

FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Isosceles, life does not get any easier. In the company's own words,
trading conditions are tough - a view confirmed by other food retailers -
and at the moment there seems little prospect of an improvement. Judging by
the company's delayed annual report, that leaves the proud owner of the
Gateway name with a problem. Even accepting the company's own valuations of
its sites - it is not clear what they would be worth to a non-food retailer
 -Isosceles has around Pounds 1.2bn of net debt and negative net worth of
Pounds 320m. Hardly the ideal foundations for returning to the stock market
in 1995.
It is difficult to see that goal being achieved. With Pounds 100m a year
being spent on converting stores to new formats, the company is not
generating any free cash flow to reduce borrowings. Even if the Northern
Ireland retailer Wellworth and the American Herman's chain can be sold, they
are unlikely to fetch much more than book value. At the very minimum that
implies that existing shareholders will be diluted out of existence on
flotation. The banks seem to have decided that as the problem is not
actually getting any worse, they will put off difficult decisions in the
hope that something turns up.
Refashioning Isosceles into several formats ironically apes the intentions
of the financial wizards who hoped to break up the disparate group and sell
it to other supermarket chains eager for space. That never happened, but the
accounts show a payment for loss of office of Pounds 1.9m as a monument to
the late 1980s buy-out.

FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Laird
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following better than expected results from the likes of GKN and T&amp;N, the
market was half expecting a strong showing from Laird. Even so, a 43 per
cent rise in interim pre-tax profits was clearly ahead of expectations. A 3
per cent rise in the shares against the background of a falling market
underlines the point. With new plant still running below capacity, sales and
margins should show further improvement in the second half. Capital
expenditure is still running at around 1.5 times depreciation, maintaining a
record of investment in recession which underpins yesterday's figures.
The nagging concern is that success on the automotive side, which accounted
for most of a Pounds 40m increase in turnover in the first half, leaves
Laird looking unbalanced. Other interests, such as US plastics and
packaging, are suffering. The rate of progress in future hinges on the
outlook for the European car market. As a supplier to some of the newer
high-volume models on the market, such as the redesigned Volkswagen Golf,
Laird should be protected from the worst of any downturn. Yet new car sales
in the important west German market are expected to fall this year and Laird
will have to work hard to maintain momentum.
A multiple of around 12 times this year's forecast earnings is hardly
demanding, though, when viewed against prospective multiples of 17 or more
elsewhere in the sector.

FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt the commercial logic for SG Warburg of withdrawing as market-maker
in more than 350 UK stocks is overwhelming. Trading small company shares can
be highly profitable in the good times, but in bearish markets the
combination of dealing losses and the opportunity cost of dead capital can
become a significant burden.
Other houses, though they deny it fiercely, have also been striking
companies off their lists. But the scale of yesterday's announcement is
alarming for companies and investors alike, and ought to be of fundamental
concern to the Stock Exchange. Admittedly smaller businesses are often happy
to see their shares tightly held and thinly traded; there are reasons other
than buying liquidity for paying the listing fee. Nor can the Exchange force
marketmakers to engage in unprofitable business. That said, the order-driven
Bulletin Board which already enables trades in about 120 companies to be
matched - and to which another 90 may now be added - will be no substitute
for many participants for the quote-driven SEAQ system. Investors arguably
are already handicapped by wide spreads - but they can only feel more
shackled now.
It is always possible that Warburg's move is calculated to boost its client
list (given that it will surely go on marketmaking for companies where it is
corporate broker). But the securities house can hardly be encouraged by the
immediate outlook for small companies. As measured by the Hoare Govett
smaller companies index, these are now facing their fourth consecutive
calender year of underperformance against the market, an unprecedentedly
poor record in view of their generally sparkling outperformance over the
last four decades. Perhaps it is just another sign that the 1990s in
financial markets are going to be very different.

FT  05 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Hostage to the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The agenda for this weekend's meeting of European finance ministers will
doubtless include tactics for the run-up to the French referendum on
Maastricht. On yesterday's evidence, a clear strategy for supporting the
dollar should be high on the list of priorities. A 4 pfennig plunge in the
dollar following the release of dreadful US employment data undid most of
the good work done by European governments earlier this week. If it was not
already glaringly obvious, the episode illustrates the clear linkage between
the weak dollar and strains within the ERM.
The UK government may feel cheated: sterling closed at DM2.80, more
comfortable than before its scheme for foreign currency funding was
announced on Thursday, but 2 pfennigs below a high point reached earlier in
the day. The mood in Italy will be worse. The lira remains pinned to its
floor within the ERM despite a 1 3/4 per cent rise in the discount rate.
A deeper message from the sharp fall in US employment is that the dollar
will get scant support from an early domestic economic recovery. A further
widening of the differential between US and German interest rates yesterday
hardly points to quick relief. If that were not enough to keep the pressure
on, another set of German money supply data and another Bundesbank council
meeting must be negotiated before France goes to the polls.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Warburg ends trade in stocks of 362 companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG Securities, a leading UK stockbroker, is to stop making a market
in the shares of 362 companies, claiming it no longer makes commercial sense
to trade such illiquid stocks.
Yesterday's decision may result in about 90 small companies being put on the
Stock Exchange's Bulletin Board, which matches buy and sell orders for
illiquid shares in small companies.
Warburg's decision to stop making markets in so many shares is a blow to
small companies, already hit by the recession.
Although some securities houses have stopped marketmaking in illiquid
smaller companies' shares 'in dribs and drabs' over recent months, according
to the Stock Exchange, none has withdrawn on the same scale as Warburg.
The 362 shares being dropped include Alexandra Workwear, a market leader in
company uniforms and overalls, Amber Day, which owns the What Everyone Wants
discount clothes chain, and Bridon, the wire rope maker.
Of the total, 277 have a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m; the
list includes 47 companies on the second-tier Unlisted Securities Market.
Some of the stocks are not ordinary shares, but such instruments as warrants
and non-voting shares.
Warburg will continue to make markets in about 1,400 stocks, including
warrants and convertibles. The group said it had reviewed its past five
years' operations and identified the shares it was losing money on.
'We couldn't justify making markets in these stocks to our shareholders
because we were losing money on them,' Warburg said. Overall, it said, the
group's UK equity business was profitable in 1991 and so far in 1992.
Stock Exchange rules say a company must have at least two marketmakers.
Warburg's withdrawal will leave about 90 companies with only one. The
exchange said it would try over the next two weeks to find these companies a
second marketmaker.
If it fails, the companies will be put on the Bulletin Board, available on
Topic the electronic information system. It gives details of each company
and the date and price for the last 12 trades in its shares.
'Being on the Bulletin Board is not as advantageous for the company because
it is not so visible there,' said one smaller companies analyst.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Banks warn Eurotunnel to settle cost dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL has been told by its bankers that it must settle its long-running
dispute over the cost of building the Channel tunnel by Monday night.
The bankers have warned that without an agreement with Transmanche Link, the
Anglo- French consortium of contractors working on the tunnel, Eurotunnel
may not be allowed to draw down funds from its bank facilities.
If that happened, the company would face grave financial difficulties. It
needs to draw around Pounds 100m from these bank funds in early October.
A banker involved in negotiations with Eurotunnel said: 'It is possible
agreement will be reached over the weekend.' However, he was braced for a
crisis early next week.
A Eurotunnel employee said: 'We have made our final offer . . . But the
contractors have yet to be persuaded that midnight has arrived.'
TML's members consist of five UK contractors and five French ones.
Opposition to the deal is coming from the French companies. TML has been
demanding that Eurotunnel pay for the huge over-runs in the costs of fitting
out the rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at Folke-stone, Kent,
and Sangatte, northern France.
However, Eurotunnel has been adamant that part of the responsibility for the
increases over the original budget was TML's and therefore TML should bear
some of the costs.
In the event, Eurotunnel is offering the most it can without making a
serious breach of its banking covenants, or the terms of bank facilities.
Its offer consists of a cash payment to TML of around Pounds 1bn, calculated
in historic as opposed to today's prices. It is also offering Pounds 200m in
some form of equity, likely to be a convertible debenture.
Eurotunnel has 206 banks which have provided a Pounds 6.8bn banking
facility, of which more than Pounds 4bn has been drawn. They are led by four
agent banks, National Westminster and Midland of the UK and Banque Nationale
de Paris and Credit Lyonnais of France, which are planning to meet on
Monday.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Poll shows French swing back to European union
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government's campaign for a vote in favour of the Maastricht
Treaty regained ground yesterday with an opinion poll showing a significant
swing in favour of European union.
The poll, conducted by the CSA institute, showed a 55 per cent majority
would vote for the treaty in the referendum on September 20, the biggest
margin for several weeks. This followed a marathon television appearance by
President Francois Mitterrand on Thursday during which he faced questions
from a panel of French citizens, journalists and Mr Philippe Seguin, the
Gaullist former government minister who has led the No campaign.
Mr Mitterrand's performance was praised by his socialist supporters but also
criticised as uninspiring by some pro-Maastricht campaigners in the
opposition right wing.
Mr Henri Emmanuelli, president of the National Assembly, said: 'The Yes won
some points yesterday evening. I am quite confident that the French will
vote yes. There will be a big percentage for the No vote but . . . all the
big historic decisions for our country have always been taken by a small
majority.'
Among the political opposition, Mr Nicholas Sarkozy, deputy secretary of the
Gaullist RPR, and a campaigner for European union, said Mr Mitterrand came
over as 'sympathetic' but 'lacked inspiration'.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who has threatened
to resign in the event of a French No, praised Mr Mitterrand's performance.
He said he was confident the treaty would be approved and that Mr Mitterrand
had been in 'top form' during the debate with Mr Seguin.
Mr Delors said he would be satisfied with a narrow victory in the
referendum. Dismissing fears that a close result in traditionally
pro-European France would leave a question mark over the treaty, Mr Delors
told French radio: 'Fifty-two per cent is OK.'
In his television appearance, Mr Mitterrand sought to persuade an estimated
8.3m viewers that French sovereignty would remain intact if the treaty were
ratified and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be under firmer control of
member states' elected representatives. He stood up competently to
questioning.
The surprise emergence of a majority against the treaty in polls in the
second half of August had already started to move back to a narrow majority
in favour in more recent surveys, before last night's poll.
Yesterday's swing leaves the pro-Maastricht majority a long way short of the
nearly 70 per cent that prevailed when the referendum was called in early
June. Twelve polls are due to be published next week, before polling is
forbidden in the final week of campaigning.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Economics
confuses metal markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE absence of significant fundamental supply/demand developments
international economic factors continued to dominate the base metals markets
this week. But such were the complications surrounding their interpretation
that traders were unable to draw either bullish or bearish conclusions with
any confidence.
Metals are generally traded internationally in US dollar terms, so the
extreme weakness of that currency for most of the week had the effect of
making prices cheaper in terms of other currencies. What encouragement that
gave to buyers was countered, however, by their understandable reluctance to
commit funds to the market at a time of turmoil on the foreign exchanges. In
addition the weakness of the dollar made yet more remote the prospect of a
reduction in the high level of interest rates that has been acting as such a
strong disincentive to the holding of physical metal.
Neither did the traumatic condition of the dollar bode well for the world
economy in general, or for a recovery in metal demand. 'People are now
becoming very wary of the economic outlook,' Mr Angus MacMillan of Billiton
Enthoven Metals told the Reuter news agency yesterday.
Metals traders are particularly concerned about the slackness of demand for
cars, a key sector for base metals consumption. This week saw the
publication of statistics indicating that German car sales would fall by 11
per cent this year, and yesterday Britain's Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders cut its 1992 sales forecast from 1.74m to 1.55m following a
disappointing 1.67 per cent rise in August, which normally accounts for
about 20 per cent of annual sales as buyers are attracted by the advent of
the new registration prefix letter.
For the London Metal Exchange copper market the net result of these
considerations was a Pounds 5.50 fall in the cash price to Pounds 1,251.50 a
tonne. But that worked out at a Dollars 5 rise in terms of the US currency.
The copper market's underlying weakness was cushioned early in the week by
bargain-hunting encouraged by the dollar's fall, traders said. But that
dried up as the dollar rallied on Thursday and was not resumed when it
turned downwards again yesterday.
Other LME metals were generally lower, the biggest movement being cash
nickel's Dollars 155 fall to Dollars 7,080 a tonne.
The exception was the zinc market, which continued to react to the
development of another options-related technical squeeze. Traders believe
this is the work of a small group of producers and one trader who have
control of 1m tonnes of annual zinc output, equivalent to between 15 and 20
per cent of the western world total.
Concern about the situation - which the LME said it was 'closely monitoring'
and the Economist Intelligence unit warned was 'damaging for the credibility
of the LME as a representative reference price for the metal' - was
reflected in the widening of the cash premium over zinc for delivery in
three months from Dollars 38 at the end of last week to Dollars 44.25 at
yesterday's close.
Other factors boosting zinc prices included labour contract negotiations in
North America this month and next; the fact that zinc consumption had
outpaced production in the first six months of this year; a potential strike
at Centromin in Peru; and, although LME zinc stocks were at record levels, a
10 per cent fall in producer stocks since the end of January, said Mr Nick
Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group.
LME cash zinc, which reached a 23-month high on Thursday, closed yesterday
at Dollars 1,436.75 tonne, up Dollars 21.75 on the week, while the three
months position was up Dollars 16 at Dollars 1,392.50 a tonne.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) the coffee market continued
the uptrend of the previous two weeks, helped by technically-driven
investment fund and commission house buying in New York, where December
arabica futures broke through a key resistance point at 55.70 cents an
ounce. The London market remained cautious, however, and as the November
position on the Fox, which trades the coarser robusta coffee variety,
climbed to Dollars 795 a tonne, up Dollars 35 on the week, at Thursday's
close analysts were warning that the overall downtrend was still intact. The
November price edged up to Dollars 798 a tonne yesterday morning, but having
stopped short of the psychologically significant Dollars 800 level, it eased
to close Dollars 6 down on the day and Dollars 29 up on the week at Dollars
789 a tonne.

FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Package trading ceases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXPIRY of trading in the Electricity Package, the grouping of shares in
the electricity distribution companies which were floated on the market in
1990, was accompanied by a substantial bear squeeze in all the constituent
stocks. Institutions which had not sold their packages by the close
yesterday, will receive the constituent shares on September 28.
The run-up to the cessation of trading in the package has seen share prices
in the smaller, more illiquid electricity distribution companies, come under
substantial pressure as dealers anticipate that big institutions will sell
their unravelled holdings in the smaller groups.
The final quotation for the package was Pounds 3,228, a rise of 120 on the
day; the opening price for the package on December 11, 1990, in its
partly-paid form, was Pounds 1,575.
Specialists said that the 'recs' had been sold short ahead of the final 70p
call on the shares, due on September 15, but the prospect of much higher
dividend growth in the recs compared with the water sector was said to have
helped the recs rise sharply yesterday. The best individual performances
came from the smaller stocks, notably South Wales, which jumped 19 to 372p,
Seeboard, the same amount up at 321p, and Northern, 18 higher at 333p. Water
stocks hit by the switching operations included Severn Trent, 6 lower at
409p and Southern, 7 down at 391p.
Mirror deal
Shares in Mirror Group (MGN) were very heavily traded as a block of 6.5m was
bought at 62 and sold at 62.5 in a cash deal. The stake represented almost
1.5 per cent of the company's shares.
Dealers speculated that the Irish food and media tycoon Mr Tony O'Reilly,
who has built up a significant stake in MGN through his media group
Independent Newspapers, might have in creased his holding. Last month, Mr
O'Reilly, raised his stake in MGN to 2 per cent from 1.3 per cent and was
reported to be holding talks with bankers who bought shares in MGN in the
wake of the collapse of Mr Robert Maxwell's media empire after his death at
sea. Yesterday, MGN eased 2 to 61p with recorded turnover of 14m shares.
Carlton active
Television production and services group Carlton Communications surged after
consideration of a weighty and enthusiastic piece of research and in
response to the early recovery of the dollar. The shares jumped 22 in early
trading and closed 9 up on the day at 589p on heavier than average turnover
of 3.4m.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd published a 36-page booklet on the group earlier in
the week but said the effect was just beginning to be felt. BZW argues that
Carlton's 'growth prospects are above average, its management and balance
sheet strong. The shares' premium rating is fully justified and prospects
for 1993/94 mean that we continue to recommend purchase.'
However, another securities house pointed out that with 44.5 per cent of
profits generated from the US yesterday morning's recovery in the dollar was
bound to impact on Carlton shares.
Abbey National shares, boosted in midweek by hopes that a possible end to
free banking would produce a big influx of new customers to Abbey, turned
down sharply to close 10 off at 267p.
Legal &amp; General, where worries about the safety of the dividend abated after
the much better than expected figures released by Sun Alliance, jumped a
further 9 to 315p, leaving the shares 25 higher over the week.
Thorn EMI, responding to a buy note issued by Kleinwort Benson, jumped 8 to
687p on heavy turnover of 1.7m shares. Mr Tim Hirst at Kleinwort said recent
selling of Thorn, prompted by downgrades and worries about an OFT
investigation into compact disc prices, had been overdone; 'on a p/e of 12.5
and cash flow multiple of 4.5 the shares represent good value.
BP dipped 5 to 196p with the market unimpressed with suggestions that it is
discussing a possible sale of its minority stake in the Olympic Dam mine in
South Australia. 'BP has been trying to sell the stake since 1988,' said one
analystwho said the asset would realise some Pounds 200m 'at best'.
The weakness in Enterprise Oil, triggered by the sale of a 2.1 per cent
stake continued yesterday with the shares down to 310p, a fall of 10; over
the week Enterprise shares have retreated 38.
Dealers said the sale of the near 10m-share stake, could be the catalyst for
further institutional sales. Norwich Union is among the biggest holders of
oil shares of the UK institutions, but has not been seen as a seller of
Enterprise in which it holds. Lasmo suffered along with Enterprise, sliding
3 to 125p.
Tightly-traded Rothmans 'B' jumped 15 to 532 with two buyers trying to pick
up stock and vague old bid rumours circulating.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo remained firm throughout the day after
announcing that its Zofran anti-nausea drug was recommended for
post-operative nausea and vomiting by a US Food and Drug Administration
advisory committee on Thursday. However the recommendation had been expected
and the shares gained only 3 at 749p.
Reckitt &amp; Colman recovered 2 to 535p following its post results weakness on
Thursday. Nomura Research was buying the stock after issuing a
recommendation which argues that the shares are near their all time
price/earnings relative low against the market.
Northern Foods bounced 10 to 227p, after Smith New Court reiterated its buy
recommendation. The broker said recent falls had been overdone.
Rank Organisation was once again a nervous market with the appearance of a
small line of stock sending the price falling 10 to 483p.
Good two-way business continued in Ladbroke. Turnover reached 5.6m as the
shares shed a penny to 150p.
Laird Group bucked the market trend jumping 9 to 266p as the market
appreciated a 43 per cent improvement in interim figures. British Aerospace
fell 12 to 213p as turnover reached 1.1m on fears of a reduction in orders
for the Airbus aircraft for which BAe builds the wings.
Aero engine and turbines group Rolls-Royce remained in the doldrums after
Thursday's poor results, the shares giving another 5 to 123p, in trade of
3.5m shares.
Turnover in motor dealer Trimoco rose to 25m with its predator Hartwell, the
Saudi Arabia - controlled motor group believed to have been the day's main
purchaser. Trimoco closed slightly easier unchanged at 20p.
Conglomerate Trafalgar House yesterday achieved the dubious honour of being
the biggest faller in the market in percentage terms when the shares shed 4
1/2 to 43p as financial worries surrounding the company continued to take
their toll. Williams Holdings, weakened by profit downgradings. gave up 10
to 237p with 1.8m traded.
Publishing to oil services conglomerate Pearson jumped sharply at the market
opening after the group announced encouraging half-year results but closed
only 2 better at 314p.

FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES market experienced a volatile but busy end of the account
session as early strength gave way to profit-taking and a retreat caused by
poor economic data from the US, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, September opened strongly at 2,420 but after a brief move up
when it touched 2,423 and pulled the underlying cash market higher,
profit-taking set in leading it to gently drift lower.
The release of disappointing employment figures from the US after 1.30pm
caused a sharp retreat in the contract and a poor opening on Wall Street,
following the figures caused further weakness. Interest from Goldman Sachs,
which was a buyer of September and a seller of the December contracts helped
produce a rally just before the close.
September closed at 2,377, down 34 on its previous close and around 9 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was high
at 14,348 contracts.
Traded options were also busy, with turnover reaching 33,357 lots. The FT-SE
100 option traded 18,066 lots, while Hanson was the busiest stock option
with 1,752 lots.

FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices fall in turbulent
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS at a more considered reaction in UK equities to the British
government's Pounds 3.75bn plan for sterling support were overwhelmed
yesterday by new developments on the global currency stage. Share prices
ended the trading account sharply lower after an extremely erratic session.
The lead came from currency and futures markets, as they grappled with an
increase in Italian discount rates and alarming unemployment figures from
the US which sent the dollar sharply downwards.
The sterling support plan announced on Thursday was seen as, at best, buying
time until the Maastricht referendum in France on September 20. But a No
vote in France would still imply pressure on the pound and revive fears that
rates will be forced higher if intervention cannot sustain the currency.
Equities opened higher yesterday as sterling topped the important DM2.80
level but peaked early at FT-SE 2,396.4. By then, the generally cautious
response to the funding plan was taking effect and sentiment was further
discouraged by the 1.75-point rise in the discount rate in Italy.
However, the hardest blow came at mid-session with the disclosure that jobs
in the US had fallen by 83,000 in August; 'a disaster,' said US watchers.
Sterling wilted on the cross rates as the dollar fell away and the Footsie
soon showed a loss of nearly 30 points.
Later, when Wall Street opened relatively calmly, London rallied to give a
final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,362.2, a loss of 19.7. Volatility in
share prices reflected similar trends in stock index futures and in the
short sterling contract. Dealers said that the institutions had again stayed
on the sidelines, and that trading had been very difficult, with
marketmakers struggling to avoid taking stock on their books. However, gilts
opened slowly turning higher later as the market took a favourable view of
the near term outlook. At the close, long gilts were around up.
Seaq turnover of 546.7m shares compared with 551.3m on Thursday when retail
business was worth Pounds 978.5m. Market sentiment was jolted yesterday when
SG Warburg withdrew from dealing in 362 smaller company shares.
At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett cut UK growth and earnings forecasts and
commented that the outlook must now depend heavily on a Yes vote in France
and no change in UK interest rates.
Retail business has remained exceedingly volatile as currency uncertainty
has kept the institutions on the sidelines.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Credit where credit is due: The UK's foreign loan deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's plan to borrow some Pounds 7.27bn worth of foreign currency to
support the pound was completed, where it began, in the Bank of England last
night.
The agreements for the UK to borrow Ecu 10bn worth of foreign currencies
over the next seven months were signed in the Bank at 5 o'clock yesterday.
For once, the choice of venue turned out to be a case of giving credit where
credit was due. For the first proposals for the large-scale currency
borrowing that was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, on
Thursday, were crafted by officials of the Bank's markets division less than
three weeks before.
The markets division is the pride and joy of Mr Eddie George, the Bank's
deputy governor, who represented the Bank at yesterday's ceremony. Sir Terry
Burns, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, deputised for the
chancellor. Also in attendance were the chief executives of the banks that
have agreed to provide the funds.
Although some of the euphoria that greeted the plan in financial markets on
Thursday subsided following the announcement of yesterday's extremely poor
US employment figures, it still proved its worth. Sterling, which only a few
days before had been heading towards its DM2.7780 floor in the European
exchange rate mechanism, closed in London last night at DM2.80, unchanged
from Thursday evening's level.
Officials involved in crafting the plan said it would be wrong to see the
borrowing as a crisis response to the extreme weakness of sterling in the
ERM in the week beginning August 24. The Bank first put forward the idea of
a large-scale borrowing in Deutschmarks and other currencies that would be
converted into sterling during the previous week with medium-term problems
in mind. It wanted to build in a cushion of support for the pound ahead of
the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20 and to
protect it from further weakness of the dollar - a contingency that arose
again yesterday.
The idea was taken up in the Treasury by Mr Paul Gray, undersecretary in
change of the monetary policy group. Mr Lamont took up the proposal
immediately on his return from holiday on August 24. It was around this time
that the Bundesbank was advised of the UK's wish to borrow D-marks.
But by this time sterling was spiralling downwards. The monetary authorities
responded by intervening in its support but this proved ineffective, as did
the chancellor's attempt to 'talk up' the pound on the Treasury steps on
August 27.
'The plan was not born out of a feeling that we were looking over an abyss,'
recalled one of the officials closely involved in the borrowing. 'In fact
that week of fire-fighting was a bit of a distraction.'
At the Bank, Mr Ian Plenderleith, an associate director responsible for
managing the UK's foreign currency reserves, was the prime mover behind the
scheme, although the Bank was reluctant yesterday to discuss details of its
involvement. Executives of the four clearing banks, Barclays, National
Westminster, Lloyds and Midland, were called in to see Mr Plenderleith on
Wednesday August 26.
Though the governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, was not present at the
meeting, he was kept closely informed during his summer holiday of
developments on Friday. The telephone wires to his country estate, Torry
Hill, were 'humming', in the words of a Bank of England official.
The clearing bankers present at the initial meeting were Mr Peter Wood of
Barclays, Mr John Davies of Lloyds, Mr Roger Byatt of NatWest and Mr Keith
Whitson of Midland. They were told that the government wished to borrow Ecu
5bn and that the proceeds would be drawn in D-Marks.
'There was no hesitation on our part about whether the money should be made
available,' said a clearing banker involved in the talks. However, three
days of negotiations were required to establish the terms of the deal. These
negotiations were quite complicated because there were no precedent for a
Ecu bank loan to a government on this scale.
'We all felt that the key consideration was the the deal should receive a
favourable reception in the market,' said another banker. 'On the other
hand, we were not going to roll over and do the deal at the price chosen by
the government.'
Another banker said: 'There was a free and frank exchange of views.'
Detailed negotiations began the following day and were not completed until
Friday last week. Banks argued they needed a wider margin over the benchmark
London rate, Libor, than that paid on a recent European Community loan,
because many banks had refused to participate in that EC loan. In the event
they got a more generous interest rate of  3/32 of a point over the Libor -
the London Interbank Offered Rate. Although satisfactory to the government,
bankers were concerned that it might face accusations that the money was too
dear.
Having reached agreement, the Bank of England then had to get the Treasury's
agreement to the deal, which it received over the weekend. With the
Treasury's assent, the four clearing banks then sought out other banks to
join the deal.
In the event, the four clearers provided Ecu 850m each. Another eight banks
 -J P Morgan of the US, Union Bank of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of
France, Bank of Tokyo, and four German banks, Deutsche, Dresdner,
Commerzbank and Westdeutsche Landesbank - each provided Ecu 150m.
A final group of six UK banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland,
Clydesdale, TSB, Abbey National and Standard Chartered - each provided Ecu
50m.
The deal was completed by Wednesday evening. 'I have no idea why the
Treasury waited till Thursday afternoon before announcing it,' said a
banker.
In fact, the Treasury wanted to announce the deal when the markets were
relatively calm. It also wished to keep its impact separate from Wednesday's
disclosure of a Dollars 1.3bn drop in UK gold and foreign currency reserves
in August. This was to stress that the latest borrowing was qualitatively
different from previous foreign borrowings, made to boost the reserves.
Thursday's enthusiastic reception for the plan on the markets showed that it
had achieved this objective. Yesterday's new tribulations surrounding the
dollar showed that the Treasury was right to move when it had the chance.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Auntie's familiar face: The BBC's brave new world may look
old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC's ratings for the latest week set out the pattern of current British
viewing tastes: the undisputed king of its programmes is the popular drama
EastEnders with a total audience of 16.64m, just marginally behind
Coronation Street on ITV.
The top programmes also include old comedies such as Dad's Army and
Porridge, new comedies such as Birds of a Feather, and Paul Daniels' quiz
Every Second Counts.
But by far the most remarkable show in the ratings is the cheap Australian
import Neighbours.
It occupies slots three to seven in BBC 1's Top 30, with audiences ranging
from 15.23m to 13.74m. Apart from being much-loved by teenagers it is one of
the most cost-effective shows on British television.
This week, Sir Michael Checkland, director-general of the corporation,
suggested that important changes were on the way for viewers as the BBC
strives to redefine its role as a public service broadcaster in an age of
growing competition from multi-channel television.
'There are some things we simply don't have to get involved with in future,'
he said. 'I don't think we have to have, for example, so many quizzes,
money-based quizzes or entertainment quizzes on BBC Television. We don't
necessarily need to have some of the lower-cost purchased programmes that we
have sometimes put into our schedules.'
Neither the director-general nor the BBC will give any example of a
programme that is likely to be removed from the schedules as a result of the
new BBC emphasis on programmes that are 'distinctive', and the planned move
towards 'the high ground' of British broadcasting. But certainly Neighbours,
originally bought to pad out day-time schedules for a few thousand pounds an
hour, is a quintessential example of 'lower-cost purchased programmes'.
The fate of soap operas such as Neighbours goes to the heart of the dilemma
now facing the BBC. The dilemma is implicit in a confidential BBC document
leaked this week to Broadcast magazine. The intention was to publish it
after a green paper on the future of the corporation, expected early next
month. The document amounts to a mission statement for the future of the
corporation as it renegotiates the Royal Charter which runs out in 1996.
Derivative formula comedy or simple and unchallenging game shows are out.
There is no room for entertainment programmes which belittle or humiliate
members of the public.
'The BBC will need to withdraw from areas in which it is no longer able or
needed to make an original contribution,' the document says.
Instead there will be more live performances on both radio and television.
The aim will be to restore the BBC's place as the primary focus of broadcast
drama - 'the National Theatre of the airwaves'.
Under the blueprint, viewers would receive a steady stream of classic plays
from the great dramatists of British culture - from Shakespeare to Jonson,
Shaw to Osborne. There would be a similar diet of literary adaptions in
serial form.
The document does not view such taking of the 'high ground' as a retreat
into a cultural ghetto, however. All genres of programmes would be made, but
quiz programmes 'would test the audience's imagination and creativity'.
In addition, the BBC would continue to schedule mainstream current affairs
and religious programmes in prime time even though ITV is steadily moving
towards concentrating on popular entertainment which can be virtually
guaranteed to deliver high ratings during the main evening viewing hours.
In its own words the corporation has set itself four important areas on
which to concentrate:
News and information across what it refers to as a 'range of outlets' to
support fair and informed national debate;
Development and expression of British culture and entertainment;
Programming and services creating opportunities for education;
Communication and interchange of cultures and ideas between Britain and
abroad.
At a cursory glance it seems difficult to take exception to such a mission
for the future which is about as controversial as apple pie and motherhood.
And surely it is wise for the BBC to march gradually uphill, away from what
is likely to become an increasingly bitter ratings battle between ITV and
the satellite television companies?
But there are problems inherent in the approach. The first is economic. Most
of the programmes under threat tend to be cheap, while most of the
replacements are expensive. Costume drama, for example, can cost up to
Pounds 1m an hour.
The second problem is how to define and choose 'distinctive' programmes. If
the new policy is going to have any meaning, programmes designated
'undistinctive' will presumably have to be weeded out from the schedules,
even though they are the most popular with audiences, and cost-effective.
The BBC's new approach to programming implies a more restrictive attitude to
programme commissioning than in the past. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive
of Channel 4, might nevertheless have been overstating things in his
Edinburgh Television Festival attack last month on the corporation's
'pseudo-Leninist style of management'.
It is a rare organisation that deliberately sets out to make its product
range less popular in the marketplace, but that is the danger the BBC now
appears to be running.
If, even for the most intellectually coherent and respectable strategic
reasons, the BBC were to lose a significant slice of its audience to rival
terrestrial and satellite channels, there could come a point when the
universal BBC licence fee would no longer be sustainable.
In the week ending August 23 - after the Olympics and before the new autumn
schedules began - the total BBC share of the audience was 42.6 per cent. Any
drift towards the 30 per cent mark would surely cause problems. It would be
difficult for the organisation to convince the government that it deserves
to retain its licence-fee status.
Despite the disclosures of the document, it is entirely possible that little
will change other than a slight adjustment to the tone and character of some
programmes. This would mean that the product of a year's soul-searching by
numerous committees would be little more than a public display designed to
reinforce the BBC's case for its own survival.
Public service broadcasters all over Europe will be watching to see how the
corporation resolves its conflicts in what is becoming one of the most
competitive broadcasting markets.
Keep watching for Neighbours in the BBC schedules. As long as it is still
there, viewers can be sure that old-fashioned British compromise and
accommodation to what the public actually watches continue to triumph over
pseudo-Leninism.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Debt would constrain graduates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT SCHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'College for All' (September 1), raises the spectre of UK
students in higher education paying for both tuition and keep.
I have always felt that one advantage enjoyed by UK graduates as compared
with their US counterparts is that, as a general rule, UK graduates do not
enter the job market with substantial debt obligations. This, in my opinion,
allows them greater flexibility in the selection of their career as, in
seeking employment, attaining a salary sufficient to service their debt
obligation is not a factor. This has been one of the reasons why quality
graduates have, to date, felt able to pursue socially important careers
albeit they are poorly remunerated.
I am also concerned that a move such as you suggest will have undesirable
inflationary consequences and could lead to a structural change in entities
such as the National Health Service where the government would need to
increase salaries or waive debt to attract a qualified workforce.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Adverse impact of lottery promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'A national lottery for good causes is entertainment, not gambling',
says Richard Ogier of the Lottery Promotion Company (Letters, August 26).
Yet buying a lottery ticket means chancing money on an unknown outcome, as
good a definition of gambling as any unless our dictionaries are to be
re-written. If donating some element of the lottery's turnover to good
causes means it is not part of the gambling industry, then the football
pools, which give more than Pounds 100m a year to sport and the arts, must
similarly benefit from this new interpretation]
The Lottery Promotion Company is clearly rattled by arguments that a lottery
could have harmful social effects; it therefore attempts to re-write normal
definitions of gambling and ignores overseas evidence.
Marketing is the key issue. For a British lottery to generate substantial
new money for good causes, not to mention an adequate return for its
operator, unrestricted advertising and promotion on broadcast media and the
widest possible availability of tickets will be necessary. Mr Ogier is right
to argue that experienced gamblers will not play the lottery but in so doing
he declares his target to be those who currently gamble small amounts weekly
or who do not gamble at all.
If the government permits the national lottery to be promoted on a scale not
presently allowed to any other form of gambling, we will witness the
damaging social consequences that are evident overseas, with the Irish
Republic as a good, nearby example. Mr Ogier can redefine the lottery as
entertainment if he wishes, but it will not alter the adverse impacts
deriving from unrestricted promotion.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Consultant not high quality cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Charles Batchelor's article, 'Badge of quality'
(September 1) and the views expressed by Mr Bernard Juby on BS 5750 and the
role of a consultant in the process.
In Mr Juby's opinion a consultant is someone who 'charges an arm and a leg'.
The cost of 15 days' consultancy under the Department of Trade and Industry
scheme should be a maximum of Pounds 3,000 with another Pounds 3,000
approximately for management time. Certification should be achieved, on
average, within nine months. In the case of Mr Smith, who achieved
certification without using a consultant, he spent one day a week over two
years (half a man year) which would cost an average company approximately
Pounds 20,000. Based on these figures, it can be seen that the consultancy
route can save a company both time and money.
Additional benefits can be achieved from using consultants, such as
obtaining an objective/independent view on the company's existing activities
and 'tapping' on the consultant's broad range of acquired industrial
experience.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Devaluation of D-mark would alleviate strains on
weaker European currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAG LINDSKOG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The huge differential between the high German and low American interest
rates gives a dramatic decline of the dollar rate and puts strong pressures
on the weaker European currencies. In order to alleviate the strains and,
possibly, even give way to interest rate reductions in the recession-mired
European economies, there is an increasing number of economists who advocate
a revaluation of the D-Mark.
But is this policy advice really correct? Is not the opposite policy step
more likely to give the desired result? There are at least two reasons why a
devaluation of the D-Mark is the better policy option. The first reason is
that the present uncertainty in the financial markets up till at least the
French referendum is driven by psychological factors and the policy makers'
credibility.
A revaluation of the D-Mark would prove that all the speculators are right
and that there is a difference between the D-Mark and the rest. It would
also show that little has changed in terms of European integration and that
the old credibility ranking is still relevant. Hence, a D-Mark revaluation
is likely to postpone indefinitely prospects of reducing the interest rate
spreads between Germany and the rest.
A devaluation of the D-Mark would totally change the rules of the game. The
speculators would be on the wrong side. Such an outcome has lasting effects
on the general comprehension of the European currencies. It would show that
much has happened in Europe over the last decade. A devaluation of the
D-Mark might well reduce the interest rate spreads with Germany and could
possibly totally wipe them out for some countries.
The second reason is based on economic fundamentals. Take France. Any
comparison between the present economic situation in France and Germany
shows that France is in a far better position.
One way to look at Germany after reunification is to acknowledge that the
west German capital stock must now serve another 16m people from the east.
Old East German capital stock is obsolete. Hence, capital is scarcer and
labour more abundant. Thus, a new equilibrium requires that capital returns
must increase and labour cost decline.
So far, the opposite has happened. A revaluation of the D-Mark would prolong
the movement in the wrong direction. German labour costs would increase on
an international comparison, but the large German traded goods sector would
have to reduce its prices. A revaluation of the D-Mark would give a profit
squeeze. A devaluation would take the economy closer to a new equilibrium.
German labour costs would decline on an international comparison. Prices
might, and profits certainly would, increase. In summary, there are two
important reasons why the D-Mark should not be revalued, but devalued. To
convince the Bundesbank is another story. Dag Lindskog,

FT  05 SEP 92 / Letter: Strains in financial system felt by small companies,
not banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTONY P HUMMEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Quentin Davis demonstrates ('Worthy sacrifice', August 28) that he is
completely out of touch with what is happening to small and medium sized
businesses (SMEs in Euro jargon) in the current situation. He states that
default and bankruptcy creates strains in the financial system reducing the
capital of banks and their ability to lend.
That is true, but it hits the SMEs much harder than it hits the banks and
SMEs do not even get a mention from Quentin Davis. As the owner of a small
business, I get a letter nearly every week from newly appointed receivers to
another of my customers instead of a cheque. It is invariably the banks
which have called in the receiver. The banks also have security and in my
experience in nine out of 10 cases the banks get 100 per cent or close to
100 per cent paid back. It is the unsecured creditors like myself who go
empty handed in nearly every case.
So the banks may be losing some of their capital, but I can assure Quentin
Davis that unsecured creditors (ie, suppliers) like myself lose at least 10
times as much. The fact that this large percentage is lost by a large number
of SMEs is not newsworthy because of their small individual size, and so
apparently escapes the notice of our political masters.
My heart bleeds for the banks, for their monopoly practices, for their high
fees - the latter deducted at source without even having to issue an
invoice, let alone monthly statements and numerous phone calls before
getting paid.
The banks should be split up into SMEs so that they also escape being
newsworthy. We would then have a level playing field and a lot more
competition. Is that not what the Single European Market is meant to be
about?

FT  05 SEP 92 / Ecuador announces 20 privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of President Sixto Duran Ballen of Ecuador announced late on
Thursday its long-awaited economic reform measures, which include the
privatisation of numerous state-owned enterprises, a cut in public spending,
a devaluation of the currency, as well as drastic price increases for petrol
and electricity.
In a nationally televised speech, the president, who took office less than a
month ago, said the measures were aimed at combating persistent inflation, a
burgeoning budget deficit and a bloated public sector.
'I am not only applying stabilisation measures, but am also attacking the
basic causes of the crisis,' Mr Duran said.
Ecuador's annual inflation rate has been hovering near 50 per cent for the
past three years. The budget deficit stands at the equivalent of Dollars
800m - 7 per cent of gross domestic product.
A key element of the economic reform package is the privatisation of 20
state-owned enterprises, including Ecuadorean Airlines.
'Other state enterprises will be subject to further analysis,' stated Mr
Mario Rivadeneira, finance minister.
'If they do not prove to be operating profitably and efficiently, they will
be privatised or put into competition with the private sector,' he added.
The government also plans to reduce public spending by 4 per cent across the
board. The military announced its support of Mr Duran's reform package and
agreed to cost-cutting of its own.
The president emphasised his government's intention to propose a balanced
budget for 1993 and to halt deficit spending.
Other measures adopted by the government to halt inflation are the
devaluation of the currency (the sucre) by 20 per cent.
The US dollar is now worth 2,000 sucres.
According to Mr Andre Barreira, energy and mining minister, petrol prices
will increase by as much as 300 per cent while electricity rates will go up
by as much as 90 per cent, depending on the varying rates of consumption.
Following street demonstrations in recent days against austerity measures,
Mr Barreira maintained, however, that the heavily used public transport
would not become more costly.
In an attempt to avoid further popular unrest, the government has announced
an increase of 10,000 sucres in the monthly cost-of-living adjustment for
employees. Also, Mr Rivadeneira announced an extra bonus equivalent to a
month's salary, starting next year.

<TEXT>
MR Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said the latest round of Middle
East peace talks in Washington yielded 'the best 10 days ever' in
Israeli-Syrian relations, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, US acting secretary of state, was similarly
optimistic yesterday, saying there had been important movement in the
US-brokered talks between Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the
Palestinians, which adjourned on Thursday.
Mr Peres told Israeli television: 'In the 44 years since the founding of
Israel, there have never been 10 days like these in Syrian-Israeli relations
. . . From the peace standpoint, these have been the best 10 days ever.'
Israel has long seen Syria as its most implacable enemy. It has formally
been at war with Israel since the Jewish state was established in 1948.
However, some Arab delegates expressed disappointment that Israel had not
shown more flexibility. 'We have seen improvement in atmosphere, in tone, in
style, but we haven't seen yet that promise in change concerning substantive
matters,' Mr Mouwafaq al-Allaf, chief Syrian delegate, told reporters.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said yesterday both Israel and
Syria had yet to set out their full negotiating positions. 'I don't think
the Syrians have yet shown all their cards, just as we haven't shown all our
cards. We have not revealed what price we are prepared to pay in exchange
for full peace,' he told Israeli television.
The talks had been scheduled to run for a month, but the Israelis have asked
for a 10-day recess for consultations.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Dutch sign open skies deal with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the Netherlands signed a liberal 'open skies' accord in
Washington yesterday.
This gives KLM Royal Dutch Airlines essentially unrestricted access to the
aviation market in the US.
The bilateral agreement is the first under Washington's 11-point 'open
skies' initiative, which seeks to exchange freer access to the American
market for similar rights for US carriers abroad.
It comes only months before Europe's January initiation of a single air
transport market, coincides with a fierce transatlantic fare war and is
aimed at pressuring other EC governments to sign similar accords.
Recently, countries such as France and Germany have been seeking to restrict
US carriers' access to their markets, saying they enjoy an unfair advantage.
The deal also coincides with British Airways' controversial attempt to
expand its US market presence through a major equity partnership with the
USAir group.
Calling the deal 'a very significant event in international aviation', US
transportation secretary, Mr Andrew Card, said it represented a model for
market-oriented aviation agreements with other countries.
The pact gives KLM and other Dutch carriers open entry and unrestricted
capacity rights on flights through US international gateways and on to other
US and third-country destinations, widens flexibility in fare-setting and
sets liberal charter and cargo arrangements.
The airlines are allowed to enter freely into open code-sharing arrangements
with other carriers (ticketing connecting flights with partner-airlines
using the flight number or sharing aircraft).
It also includes a pledge for non-discriminatory operation of and access to
computer reservation systems.
Governments are allowed to interfere in fare-setting only in the case of
excessively high or low fares.
Under the deal, US carriers will further widen the already liberal rights
they have enjoyed in Holland for several years.
KLM, 38 per cent owned by the Dutch state, said it was 'extremely pleased'
with the accord, which it expects to boost the importance of Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport as an international air transport hub.
The accord will also allow it to take fuller advantage of its co-operation
with Northwest Airlines, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake.
The Dutch transport minister, Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, called it a 'dream
treaty'.
She said: 'We expect it will bring money to our airlines and believe it will
provide an impetus for the further liberalisation of European air
transport.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / World slow reacting to Somali crisis, says Hurd

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, yesterday said the world had
been slow reacting to the crisis in Somalia, and criticised United Nations
agencies which have not yet established a presence in the country to help
save up to 1.5m starving people.
Mr Hurd, who led an EC troika of ministers on a one-day visit to Somalia,
said the crisis was worsening outside the capital and promised the European
Community would increase humanitarian aid; concentrate on turning relief
into long-term recovery; and help with efforts to re-establish a government
in the war-ravaged country.
Although he refrained from naming the UN agencies, Mr Hurd was thought to be
referring to the World Health Organisation and the Food and Agriculture
Organisation.
Mr Hurd made the comments after four hours in the shell-blasted capital,
Mogadishu. The EC troika experienced the chaos and danger of Somalia at
first-hand as gunmen in 'Mad Max' customised vehicles zoomed past their UN
flagged convoy and an occasional shot was fired in the distance.
At a Save the Children Fund feeding centre for severely malnourished
children and nursing mothers, Mr David Shearer, SCF director, told the
ministers that the EC should concentrate on expanding emergency relief in
rural areas and should plan for the long-term, after the 'crisis falls off
the world stage'.
Mr Mohamed Ahmed Noor, the secretary for relief and rehabilitation of the
faction that controls south Mogadishu, told Mr Hurd: 'A political settlement
must go side-by-side with relief. Everybody is fed up and ready to throw
away their guns and what we need is for a country like Britain to call us
together to talk.'
The same point was stressed later after the EC convoy crossed the front line
to enter the north of the city, controlled by clan forces loyal to Mr Ali
Mahdi Mohamed.
Mr Mohamed, who arrived in the looted Range Rover which used to belong to
the former British ambassador, said: 'Britain, as president of the EC,
should help Somalia by giving more aid, by playing a role in peacekeeping
operations and by giving us a hand with political reconciliation.'
Mr Hurd later highlighted the need for a long-term recovery programme by the
urgent provision of seeds and tools. 'The international community should
sustain relief after the television cameras have gone,' he said.
However, Mr Hurd steered clear of making any commitments on a British or EC
role in mediating a political dialogue between the warring factions.
Asked earlier if he was in favour of a UN trusteeship for Somalia, Mr Hurd
said he was in favour of an expanded UN presence and administration of
Somalia, where the government and civil society have disintegrated. But, he
said, trusteeship would not be the right name, since the UN was bound by the
sovereignty of states.
Mr Hurd said the 3,500 UN troops expected in Somalia should be deployed with
careful consultation with the Somali authorities. 'There are risks,' he
said, 'but the troops are needed to make sure the relief effort works.'
Britain would not contribute any soldiers to the UN force, the foreign
secretary said.
Mr Jan Eliasson, UN undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs,
yesterday said he would lead a team of UN officials on a visit to Somalia,
to meet Gen Mohamed Farah Aideed, one of the warlords who has hampered UN
efforts to guard relief supplies.

<TEXT>
HONG Kong would lose Dollars HK35bn (Pounds 2.26bn) in trade if the US
imposes punitive tariffs on China as a result of its Section 301
investigation, according to the Hong Kong government.
A government report, aimed at alerting the US to the heavy price Hong Kong
would have to pay for Washington's trade policy, estimated that 16,600 jobs
would be lost and GDP would fall by 0.7 per cent.
The US 301 investigation focuses on Chinese protectionism. On August 27, the
administration published a list of Dollars 3.9bn-worth of US imports that
would be considered for retaliation. Tariffs on these goods would be
increased to up to 100 per cent.
The debate appears to have heated up following the US decision to allow the
sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan; but Mr Chau Tak-hay, Hong Kong's secretary
for trade and industry, was adamant that this would not sour the
discussions.
'These are purely trade negotiations and I do not believe other issues will
affect the outcome,' he said.
Hong Kong's exports are expected to rise 20 per cent this year from the 1991
level of Dollars 98bn.
By comparison, the impact of the US trade action would be to remove more
than one-fifth of that growth.
The impact would be even greater if China countered the American moves by
restricting US imports.
Mr Chau said the government would present its report to the US
administration and he also urged other local trade groups to lobby the US.
He said the longer-term impact on Hong Kong would be far greater than the
initial drop in trade.
It would result in 'weakening of investment interests by Hong Kong and
foreign companies in China, undermining of Hong Kong's role as a gateway to
China and major entrepot, and reducing Hong Kong's longer-term potential,'
he argued.
The deadline for the bilateral trade negotiations is October 10.

BIASED reporting of township violence in South Africa is hindering both
peace talks and constitutional negotiations, according to the South African
Institute of Race Relations, which has published a report detailing what it
calls an international campaign of 'disinformation' about South African
violence.
Organisations such as Amnesty International, the International Commission of
Jurists and the South African-based Human Rights Commission 'distort the
causes of violence', the Institute says. In its 50-page report, it details
cases in which these three organisations have 'ignored the rules of
evidence', elevated allegation to the level of fact and reported evidence
selectively.
All three organisations accuse the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of
being the main perpetrator of political violence, in collusion with the
South African police. But, the report says, they ignore the ANC's role in
township violence: it argues that the ANC's policy of rendering South Africa
ungovernable in the mid-1980s has left a legacy of violence which is
difficult to overcome, and provides evidence that intimidation and coercion
often accompany the ANC's mass action campaigns, further fuelling violence.
The report notes that the ANC often relies on the reports of these
organisations to substantiate its accusations against Inkatha and the
government.
The institute, for its part, argues that it is very difficult to apportion
blame for incidents of township violence, noting that of 2,030 violent
incidents analysed for 1991, it was impossible to identify the agent of the
attack in 87 per cent of cases without relying on 'untested allegation or
speculation'.
'Reports which are seen to be one-sided can easily fan the flames of
violence', the report concludes.

FT  05 SEP 92 / China's 'tired' finance minister is replaced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WANG Bingqian, China's finance minister, who presided over a widening budget
deficit as Beijing sought to keep sagging state industries afloat, resigned
yesterday after 11 years in office, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The official Xinhua news agency said Mr Wang, 67, would retain his position
as a state councillor, or member of China's cabinet. The standing committee
of China's rubber-stamp parliament approved his resignation, and named
former vice finance minister Liu Zhongli, 57, to replace him.
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 88, has stepped up his calls for China's old
guard to step aside in favour of younger officials since he launched his
latest drive for faster economic reform in January.
Mr Wang was known for frank assessments of China's financial situation. From
the late 1980s he repeatedly warned of the dangers inherent in funnelling
billions of dollars in subsidies into inefficient state industries to
preserve their role as the backbone of China's socialist economy.
In his report to parliament in March, he effectively admitted that efforts
to shake up state enterprises were floundering when he set the 1992 budget
deficit target at Yuan20.78bn (Pounds 1.9bn). In 1991, the deficit hit
Yn20.26bn, overshooting the target by Yn7.92bn.
Mr Wang attributed the 1991 overrun to 'loose management, expenses for
over-staffed departments, sightseeing and banquets with public funds, too
many subsidies and bonuses.' He has said he sees little hope of improvement
this year.
China's budget deficit would be Yn58b (Pounds 5.3bn) higher under standard
international measurements, which count foreign and domestic debt on the
deficit side.
While Wang's analysis of China's financial problems may have won him few
friends in the huge state sector, it is unlikely political problems were
behind his resignation, according to political analysts. Xinhua hinted he
was simply tired of the job.
Little is known of his replacement. Mr Liu served as vice-minister of
finance in the mid-1980s and became deputy secretary-general of the State
Council in 1990.
The committee also removed railways minister Li Senmao, 63, 'for reasons of
ill health', Xinhua said. His reign over the nation's rail transport system
has seen it struggle to keep up with the demands of China's accelerating
economic growth. His replacement, Han Zhubin, 60, is a long-time official in
China's railways administration.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Japan's trade surplus soars as strong yen lifts exports:
Weak consumer demand forecast to hit company profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN's current account surplus soared in July to Dollars 9.641bn (Pounds
4.84bn), 89 per cent higher than a year ago, the Ministry of Finance said
yesterday.
The announcement came as researchers at Nomura Securities forecast a bigger
than expected fall of nearly 18 per cent in company profits this year, in
the wake of static consumer demand.
The rise in the current account surplus marks the 16th consecutive month of
year-on-year increases and will add to the growing discomfort of the
Japanese government, which has faced sharp calls from its trading partners
to bring down the trade surplus.
The current surplus is a record high for the month, with the trade surplus
alone, which excludes invisible items such as tourism and insurance, rising
from Dollars 8,624bn to Dollars 11,647bn. It puts Japan on course for record
current account and trade surpluses this year.
Imports during the month rose by a scant 0.4 per cent, while exports climbed
by 12 per cent. The anaemic state of imports reflects the weak state of
domestic demand in Japan because of the slowdown in the economy.
In spite of government efforts over many years to reduce Japan's dependence
on exports for economic growth, exports are turning out this year to be an
important contribution to GNP growth.
A finance ministry official attributed most of the increase in exports to a
rise in the value of the yen compared to a year ago.
Japan once again became a net importer of long term capital in July,
amounting to Dollars 374m, compared to capital exports of Dollars 7.43bn in
June.
Japanese net purchases of overseas securities declined sharply from Dollars
4.85bn to Dollars 1.18bn, with bond purchases falling from Dollars 5.06bn to
Dollars 2.02bn.
Foreigners were net purchasers of Japanese stocks and shares worth Dollars
591m, compared to Dollars 1.95bn in sales during June.
The forecast of falling company profits by Nomura Research Institute (NRI),
the research arm of Nomura Securities, is a bleak revision of its initial
prediction of 10 per cent pre-tax corporate profits for the year to March
1993.
Japanese companies had expected a rebound in earnings during the second half
of the fiscal year, but are starting to revise down profit forecasts
following the prolonged economic slowdown.
An unexpected slump in consumer demand is hitting profits. Although the
Japanese government expected stable consumer spending to lead the country
out of recession, recent statistics reflect an increasing loss in consumer
confidence.
The government's failure to announce its economic support package earlier
will also delay recovery. The government last week announced its package,
which includes Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) in public works spending. NRI said
the effects of the package are not expected to be felt until next fiscal
year.
Delayed rationalisation of operations and increasing depreciation costs were
also cited as causes for lower than expected profits. Profits at the
electrical machinery and precision instrument sectors are expected to plunge
23 per cent, down from an initial projection of a 7.7 per cent decrease.
The chemical sector is expected to show a 38.6 per cent fall, the financial
industry a 12.1 per cent fall, and consumption related companies a decline
of 8.4 per cent.
However, for the next fiscal year to March 1994, NRI says the effects of the
government's package will be felt, and together with an increase in consumer
demand, will lift corporate profits by 8.5 per cent: the first rise in four
years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's political crisis now seems unlikely to be resolved quickly as
government lawyers believe the intricacies of the impeachment process mean
that President Fernando Collor will not face a congressional vote before the
end of next month.
The delay is expected to result in a big cabinet reshuffle and a possible
change in economic policy towards more growth-oriented strategy in an
attempt to win popularity and political support.
Mr Collor is under mounting pressure from his political advisers to drop
technical ministers or those 'not fully in line with him' in favour of
political nominees who could help win Congressional support for the
impeachment vote.
Mr Odacir Soares, the newly-appointed leader of the government in the
Senate, told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper that he expected new
ministers to be named within the next few days for important posts, though
Mr Ettewaldo Dias, Mr Collor's spokesman, denies that any cabinet changes
are planned.
Those most expected to go are Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the economy
minister, Mr Jorge Bornhausen, the political co-ordinator, and Mr Celio
Borja, the justice minister. Although the entire cabinet signed a 'pact of
governability' pledging to stay on until the end of the crisis, the three
are known to now be discussing resigning, dismayed by the delay in the vote.
The impeachment process could be brought forward however if the
attorney-general recommends a criminal case against the president for which
congressional approval would be necessary. He is studying the results of a
three-month congressional inquiry into government corruption.

PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco group, yesterday unveiled an agreement to
build a factory to produce Marlboro cigarettes in the St Petersburg region
in Russia.
The deal with the regional administration is to set up a factory near the
town of Vyborg, employing at least 600 workers and costing 'several dozen'
million dollars.
It follows a similar agreement reached by RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and
foods group, to produce other well-known western brands in the same part of
Russia.
The Philip Morris target is to produce 10bn cigarettes a year at the
factory, which is expected to be completed towards the end of 1993.
Yesterday's announcement in St Petersburg was preceded by a marketing
campaign in Russia's second city, with kiosks selling Marlboro at less than
the price charged by new private Russian businesses and glossy adverts
appearing in the local subway.
On Tuesday, Philip Morris executives met Russian government officials to
discuss ways in which Russia might repay a debt of Dollars 98.7m worth of
cigarettes delivered in 1991 after Moscow was hit by 'tobacco riots' as a
result of a domestic shortages.
Strapped for hard currency, Russia has offered to repay the debt with a
combination of raw materials, real estate and roubles.
Marlboro is currently manufactured in Samara as part of the Constellation
joint venture between Philip Morris, the Samara Tobacco Factory and the
AvtoVaz Industrial Corp.

TRANS WORLD Airlines, the US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn and operating

the Dollars 43.3m deficit seen in the previous month.
At the after-tax level, however, TWA moved into the black, showing a Dollars
92.7m profit. This was due to proceeds from assets sales, which totalled
Dollars 125.1m in July. In June, the net loss for the carrier was Dollars
50.3m.
July revenues were Dollars 332.9m, against Dollars 304.8m in June.

FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Club Med returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLUB Mediterranee, one of France's largest travel groups, yesterday
announced its return to the black with net profits of FFr20.3m (Dollars
4.24m) in the six months to April 30. This compares with a net loss of
FFr87.5m in the same period of the previous year.
The company, which recently announced plans for a FFr1bn bond issue,
attributed its return to profit to an improvement in demand at its European
and African interests during the winter.
It said demand had since stabilised and it expected its performance in the
second six months of the year to be much the same as that in the latter half
last year. However, it still expects to meet its target of net profits of
FFr240m for the full financial year.
The group, like other holiday companies, suffered severely from the
disruption to international travel caused by the Gulf War during the opening
months of 1991. It benefited from an improvement in demand during the same
period this year, despite the sluggish economic environment.
Turnover rose modestly from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.8bn, but operating profits rose
more sharply, from FFr71.6m to FFr176.2m. The company received an
exceptional profit of FFr36.7m, against an exceptional loss in the previous
year of FFr12.6m.
Club Med is in the throes of an expansion and renovation programme financed
partly by the proceeds of the bond issue. It plans to renovate its villages
and to build new ones, chiefly to bolster its position in the French market.
Euro Disney, the Paris-based leisure group which has been clouded by
controversy over attendance levels at its Euro Disneyland theme park outside
Paris this spring, yesterday announced that 6m visitors had been to the park
since the opening on April 12.
The period since the opening should be the busiest part of Euro Disneyland's
year, suggesting the group is still below its target of 11m visitors in its
first year.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney's newly appointed president, said
attendance to date surpassed admissions during the first five months of
operations at the Disney park in Tokyo by more than 1.5m people.

MOODY'S Investment Service, the US credit rating agency, has placed the
credit ratings of Japan's Big Four brokerage houses - Nomura Securities,
Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - under review
for possible downgrades.
Moody's said it would focus on the long-term earnings outlook and
cost-control measures of the securities houses.
While the recent rise in the Tokyo stock market has encouraged hopes among
investors of an earnings recovery, Japanese brokers still face high
operating costs due to the over-expansion of the 1980s.
The brokers have not been able to produce effective cost cutting measures,
due to the Japanese practice of life-time employment.
Financial deregulation, where the barrier between the securities and banking
industries is expected to be eased next year, will also affect brokers'
profitability.
Nomura currently has a long-term debt rating of Aa2, Daiwa A1, Nikko A2, and
Yamaichi A3.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED steel prices and rising pay costs pushed Krupp Stahl into a DM32m
(Dollars 22.8m) pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year, after a
DM44m profit last time.
There were no significant signs of improvement in leading steel markets, and
the full year's results would depend on further cost reductions and price
developments, the company said yesterday.
Efforts so far to reduce costs, including cutting 1,500 jobs, had no effect.
Total pay costs rose DM40m, pushed up by a 6.4 per cent wage settlement
earlier this year and influenced by acquisitions which brought 1,000 new
workers on to the payroll.
Current indications on the price front are not encouraging. The company said
increases noted at the start of the year had not been maintained. Although
the core steel division's order intake was 14 per cent higher than in the
first half of 1991 in volume terms, the value was unchanged.
A 7.5 per cent order increase in other sectors was due entirely to
acquisitions.
Group sales, affected by falling product prices and reductions in output
caused by plant modernisation, fell DM190m to DM3.76bn.
Krupp, which is integrating the steel operations of the recently acquired
Hoesch group, is counting on economies of scale to improve results in future
years.
For the present, the group is suffering together with the rest of German
industry from the effects of recession abroad and fading demand at home.
Market conditions worsened further last month, according to figures from the
federal statistics office.
August raw steel output in western Germany fell 3.7 per cent compared with
the same month in 1991. In the eight months to the end of August, production
was down 1.3 per cent.

ELSEVIER, the expansive Dutch publisher, reported a strong 19.7 per cent
rise in pre-tax operating profit to Fl 315.6m (Dollars 199.7m) for the six
months ended June, helped by vigorous growth in its scientific, professional
and business information services.
Trading profit, which excludes income derived from non-consolidated
companies and interest earnings, advanced by 30 per cent to Fl 282.3m.
This was largely due to the first-time inclusion of results from Pergamon,
the UK-based scientific publisher acquired for Pounds 440m (Dollars 875.6m)
in mid-May, 1991, from Maxwell Communications Corp.
The after-tax net profit was up 16.9 per cent to Fl 226.4m. This included
extraordinary income of Fl 40m, stemming from Elsevier's sale of its RTL4
television holding to VNU, its fellow Dutch publisher.
Elsevier said its consumer-information business posted lower earnings as a
result of the slump in advertising sales at its Dagbladunie division, and
further costs reductions were planned.
Group turnover rose 13 per cent to Fl 1.22bn.
The war chest of liquid assets swelled from Fl 170m to Fl 515m. The Elsevier
group is known to be seeking a large publisher in the US business,
professional or consumer-information market.
Elsevier reiterated its forecast that full-year net income will climb by 25
per cent from the Fl 384.8m achieved in 1991.

sharp fall in profits

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHEL Bon, a leading figure in French retailing, yesterday resigned as
chairman of the Carrefour hypermarket group following the news of a sharp
fall in net profits.
The group's profits dived to FFr277m (Dollars 57.9m) in the first half of
this year from FFr593m in the same period of 1991.
The fall was due to Carrefour's problems in intergrating the Euromarche
chain of supermarkets acquired in a FFr5.22bn deal last year.
Mr Bon was the architect of the Euromarche deal which triggered a series of
similar takeovers by other companies in France's increasingly concentrated
food retailing sector.
Carrefour was clouded by speculation about its interim result, and by
rumours of Mr Bon's resignation, for most of yesterday. Carrefour's shares
fell sharply during the morning until they were suspended on the Paris stock
market at FFr2,300, down FFr179 on the previous day.
Mr Bon's resignation marks the end of a period in which Carrefour has
emerged as one of the most dynamic forces in French retailing. He will be
replaced in the short term by a supervisory management committee which will
be formed to run Carrefour.
The Euromarche acquisition formed part of the on-going consolidation of the
food sector, in which the larger players have expanded to counter the
maturity of the French market and the growing power of multinational food
manufacturers, such as BSN of France and Nestle of Switzerland.
Earlier this summer Casino, another big player in French food retailing,
followed the precedent set by Carrefour by buying the Rallye chain.
Carrefour has spent the past year merging Euromarche's operations with its
own management and buying systems. The merger has, however, run into
problems although it said yesterday that it was still on course for an
increase in net profits for 1992, probably 10 per cent higher than 1991 when
it made FFr1.21bn on sales of FFr100bn.

<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, Europe's leading brewer, has announced a 17.4 per cent rise in
first-half profit before extraordinary income from Fl 168m to Fl 197.7m
(Dollars 125m).
The group expects a 'markedly higher' 1992 result, compared with the Fl 410m
achieved in 1991, but cautions that its full-year growth rate will 'probably
not' exceed 12 per cent.
Turnover advanced by 9.3 per cent to Fl 4.59bn, due mainly to higher sales
volume, especially of premium and non-alcohol beers, but also better average
selling prices.
Europe was the biggest growth market geographically but beer demand has not
yet regained the high level seen before the Gulf war, and consumer behaviour
remains 'cautious'.
Despite a big rise in marketing outlays, overall cost growth was 9.1 per
cent to Fl 4.25bn.
Heineken's net profit advanced 39 per cent to Fl 235m, helped by Fl 37m in
extraordinary income stemming from the sale of property in Singapore. A
further Fl 25m income is expected in the second half.
There were no one-off gains in the first half last year.
Trading profit, which excludes income from unconsolidated shareholdings and
interest charges, was up 12.2 per cent from Fl 298m to Fl 334m.
The first-half result was flattened by charges in connection with
restructuring the loss-making Spanish operation, El Aguila.
Heineken is to pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 1.50 per share.

deficit for Air France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the French state-owned airline, will show a loss for the first
half of 1992, Mr Bernard Attali, chairman, confirmed yesterday. The airline
will also put forward a new plan to cut costs next month. He did not say how
big Air France's losses would be and gave no details of any cost-cutting
schemes.
In June Mr Attali said it was unlikely Air France would manage to break even
in 1992, but he hoped to achieve this in 1993.
Air France, like other airlines, has suffered from the combined effects of
the recession in many world markets and the hangover from the slump caused
by the Gulf crisis.
In the first half of 1992 Air France and its subsidiary Union des Transports
Aeriens, carried just 0.8 per cent more passengers than in the same period
of 1991. Cargo traffic fell by 6.7 per cent.
It is the world's third biggest airline by sales and has lost a total of
FFr1.4bn (Dollars 292m) during the past two years. It has already put in
place a plan to cut FFr1.5bn costs a year, under which it expects to lose
3,000 jobs.
The European Commission in July approved a FFr1.25bn injection by the
state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris for an 8.8 per cent stake in Air
France.

COOPER Industries, the diversified US electrical products, tools and
hardware, auto products and industrial equipment group, is to pay Dollars
355m in cash to buy Moog, the Agnelli family's US automotive parts business.
The Texas-based Cooper, which has 54,000 employees and had a turnover of
Dollars 6.2bn in 1991, is buying Moog from Ifint, the Luxembourg-based
Agnelli family holding vehicle.
A spokesman for Ifint said the total value of the transaction was Dollars
610m, consisting of the Dollars 355m in cash plus the assumption of Moog's
debts. Cooper said the effect of the deal would be to increase its
outstanding debt by Dollars 580m to Dollars 600m.
The Ifint spokesman said the price being paid was equivalent to 26 per cent
of the book value of the Agnelli family holding company's total assets. He
said Moog last year contributed 10 per cent of Ifint's Dollars 240.5m of
profits.
Ifint gave no specific reason for the sale, other than to say it had owned
Moog for 15 years and realised its value. 'It makes sense to sell,' the
company spokesman said.
Moog Automotive, based in St Louis, Missouri, is a leading manufacturer of
automotive replacement parts for domestic and foreign automobiles and light
trucks.
The company, which has 3,000 employees and 25 plants, manufactures a broad
line of steering, suspension and temperature control products and also
distributes a line of foreign replacement parts.
Moog's revenues in 1991 were Dollars 476m.
Cooper said Moog would become part of its automotive products division,
which will be based in St Louis. This division includes Anco, Belden
Automotive Wire and Cable, Champion Spark Plug and Champion Aviation.
Ifint, which has a range of real estate, agriculture and industrial holdings
in the US, operates from New York, Paris and Zurich.
Cooper's share price fell by  1/2 to Dollars 47 yesterday.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Wall Street welcomes Fed cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve's decision to respond to a dismal employment report,
with a  1/4 -point cut in the federal funds rate to 3 per cent, was welcomed
on Wall Street yesterday as striking a sensible balance between the domestic
and international needs of the economy.
But for the chronic weakness of the dollar and the imminence of the
presidential election in November, the Fed might have been tempted to
announce another cut in the discount rate which, at 3 per cent, now sets a
floor for the federal funds rate.
Nudging down the federal funds rate (the cost of overnight funds in the
interbank market) was a way to appear responsive to domestic economic needs
without further destabilising currency markets.
The plunge in payroll employment last month was sharp enough to raise
worries that the US economy is heading for a triple-dip recession.
Non-farm employment fell by 83,000 to 108.5m, despite the Bush
administration's attempts to massage the figures with a generous federal
summer jobs programme. Excluding the effects of federal intervention,
employment fell by 183,000 - the kind of figure expected at the depths of a
recession.
Wall Street analysts had expected employment to rise by about 150,000.
The weakness was pervasive. Manufacturing and retailing shed 97,000 and
71,000 jobs respectively, showing the softness of both production and
consumer demand.
Overall, private sector employment was not significantly higher last month
than in April last year, the month many economists believe was the trough of
the recession.
Analysts discounted the few positive elements in the figures yesterday. The
unemployment rate (based on household rather than payroll data) fell
slightly - to 7.6 per cent against 7.7 per cent in July. But the decline was
entirely accounted for by lower teenage joblessness via the summer jobs
programme.
Recent indicators have been consistently weaker than expected. Consumer
confidence slipped further in August, having fallen sharply in July. Orders
for durable goods fell in July, as did housing starts and new home sales.
'This is a very dismal report,' said Mr Edward McKelvey, a senior economist
at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. The employment figures pointed to
economic growth of little more than 1 per cent at an annual rate, a dismal
showing by US standards. Alan Friedman reports from New York: General Motors
shut down two more car plants yesterday and laid off 10,500 workers because
of a continuing strike by members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) at an
Ohio metal-stamping plant.
The latest shut-downs, of car assembly plants in Delaware and Michigan,
brought to nearly 43,000 the number of assembly workers affected by the Ohio
strike, where just 2,300 employees have walked out.

<TEXT>
THE Portuguese government is preparing a tough cost-cutting 1993 budget to
reduce its deficit in a further effort to accelerate nominal economic
convergence with Portugal's richer European Community partners.
'It (will be) an investment and restructuring budget,' Mr Jorge Braga de
Macedo, finance minister, said in an interview with the Semanario Economico
newspaper. 'Recurrent expenditure will fall in nominal terms, but investment
and spending on social services will grow 12-14 per cent.'
According to officials, the aim is to reduce the budget deficit to 4 per
cent of gross domestic product, compared with 5.2 per cent forecast for this
year. All ministries, except justice and interior, will be required to cut
their administrative spending by 5 per cent.
The right-of-centre social democratic administration is also seeking public
sector wage rises of up to 4.5 per cent for most employees and of about 5.5
per cent for the lowest-paid. This is likely to be bitterly fought by public
sector unions, which do not believe the minister's forecast of 5-7 per cent
inflation for 1993 - down from 9 per cent expected this year.
Mr Braga de Macedo said he expected the economy to grow by about 3 per cent
in 1993, compared with forecasts of 2-2.5 per cent growth this year.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS morning in America yesterday. But then, a heavy, dark and pendulous
cloud of ominous breadth passed over the national horizon, and remained
suspended over the imaginary city of Metropolis.
There was solemn news, disclosed by the comic book division of Time Warner,
of the imminent demise of Superman, that most winsome and able of
super-heroes, he who once descended from the planet Krypton.
Yes, Superman will die, in issue number 75 of the eponymous comic book, to
be published on November 20, 1992.
The man who was born with a few strokes of a pencil in 1938, and who has
starred in countless books, magazines, movies and television, may be able to
fly faster than a speeding bullet and leap tall buildings in a single bound.
But he has found it impossible to resist the commercial dictates of a mighty
publisher.
In New York last night, Mr Paul Levitz, executive vice-president and
publisher of Time Warner's DC Comics division, finally confirmed the rumours
that had been swirling about the city all day.
Although Superman has generated more than Dollars 1bn of consumer sales over
the past decade, Mr Levitz said the story line would dictate death for the
Man of Steel, come November.
An aide to Mr Levitz explained the scenario: 'There will be a character
called Doomsday, who is like this force of destruction who comes out of the
ground and starts moving in a straight line toward Metropolis. Both Doomsday
and Superman will die after a big battle in front of the headquarters of The
Daily Planet. Clark Kent will also be missing. And Lois Lane, Superman's
fiancee, will be traumatised.'
Superman will die - but will he return? 'I think this is a nice
attention-getting device,' said Mr Levitz. When pressed further, he would
only say: 'Superman, as a multi-media property which is so valuable to Time
Warner, is not going to disappear.'
In Wisconsin, Mr Don Thomas of the Comic Buyers' Guide said he also expected
Superman might well return - somewhere, somehow. 'It's a little difficult to
determine what death means to someone from the planet Krypton,' Mr Thomas
observed.

THE rising value of the D-Mark hit German industry's export order books in
July, the economics ministry said yesterday.
Incoming orders from foreign customers, already depressed by recession, fell
a real 2.5 per cent in July, compared to June.
Combined with a 0.5 per cent rise in domestic demand, this produced an
overall fall of 0.5 per cent in new orders at manufacturing and mining
companies.
A comparison of developments in June and July, measured against the previous
two months and considered more reliable, showed total orders down 2 per
cent.
Compared with the equivalent period last year, the reduction was 4.5 per
cent in volume and 3.5 per cent in value.
Capital goods manufacturers have been especially hard hit by slowing
investment at home and abroad.
Their June/July orders were 7.4 per cent lower in volume and 5.2 per cent
down in value, compared with a year earlier.
Underlining the strains in the industry, MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, a plant and
engineering subsidiary in the MAN group, yesterday announced plans to cut
420 jobs.
Krupp Stahl, one of Germany's leading steel-makers, announced a plunge into
the red in the first half of this year. After profits of DM44m (Pounds
15.7m) in the first six months of 1991, it reported a loss of DM32m.

<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday again defended the
Maastricht Treaty and called for a clear Yes in the French referendum, as
one of his former cabinet colleagues, Mr Kenneth Baker, entered the UK
Conservative party row over Europe with an endorsement of a No vote.
'I think it is in our interest that that answer is Yes. I think it is even
more in our interest if it is a resounding Yes,' Mr Major said during a
political visit to Wales.
'That would be the best outcome of that referendum from the point of view of
Europe as a whole and from the point of view of the United Kingdom,' he told
the Liverpool Daily Post.
Despite his call for the French to approve Maastricht, he admitted that the
treaty had defects. 'Everybody has a belief that it is the right way forward
but not everybody likes every single part of the treaty.'
By contrast, Mr Baker wrote in the Daily Express yesterday: 'The best
message for the voters of France today is: 'Courage, mes braves, votez
Non'.'
He argued that a No vote would not lead to a political or economic crisis,
but would give Europe longer to consider what was in the agreement.
Mr Baker envisaged it would still be possible to implement those parts of
the treaty with which all 12 member states agreed, giving as examples
greater inter-governmental co-operation over international crime and in
foreign policy.
Mr Baker is not the only former senior Conservative minister to express
opposition to the Maastricht agreement, but he is the only one still in the
House of Commons, having left the cabinet only at the general election in
April.
His intervention comes just a day after Lady Thatcher renewed her criticism
of Mr Major's approach to Europe.

THE ITALIAN government yesterday announced the suspension of further
humanitarian flights to Sarajevo as evidence mounted that the aircraft which
crashed killing its four-man crew near the Bosnian capital on Thursday had
been hit by a missile.
Mr Salvo Ando, Italian defence minister, said yesterday, after a cabinet
meeting: 'The most probable thesis is that the aircraft was shot down.' At
the time of the incident, the G-222 military transport, without armed
escort, was easily identifiable at 10,000 feet on a route normally used for
humanitarian flights. It was carrying blankets to some 380,000 people
trapped by a five-month Serb siege of Sarajevo.
Mr Ando said this suggested that, if the aircraft had been the object of an
attack, a missile was the most likely weapon.
Three of the bodies were recovered by UN rescue teams on Thursday evening;
the fourth was recovered yesterday. From Belgrade, there were reports that
two eye-witnesses had said the aeroplane was hit before it crashed into
mountains controlled by Moslem and Croat forces some 20 miles west of
Sarajevo. A local commander of the Croatian Defence Council yesterday
admitted it had shot at US search and rescue helicopters investigating the
wreckage.
Mr Ando said Italian humanitarian flights would not be resumed 'until we
have found out what happened and, above all, who was responsible'.
UN humanitarian flights into Sarajevo have also been suspended until the
cause of the Italian crash is clear.
In Belgrade, Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the internationally
unrecognised Yugoslavia, won a no-confidence motion in the federal
parliament by 66 votes to 33. In the debate, MPs had accused the outspoken
prime minister of having betrayed Serbian interests at the London peace
conference last week.
In his lively defence, Mr Panic told the Socialist-dominated parliament that
the London talks had been a turning-point for the unrecognised Yugoslavia.
The no-confidence motion was proposed by members of the Socialist Party and
the Serbian Radical Party, which is headed by Mr Vojislav Seselj, an
ultra-nationalist. He is also commander of a paramilitary wing and is known
as Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's favourite politician.
However, Mr Milosevic has been increasingly isolated after the failure of an
earlier bid to oust the prime minister.
Meanwhile, in Geneva, the UN launched an urgent appeal for an additional
Dollars 434m (Pounds 218m) 'to avert a looming humanitarian disaster' in the
former Yugoslavia this winter. However, the appeal covers less than half the
Dollars 1bn-plus a UN team of experts has said is needed up to March. UN
officials say that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk from hunger,
cold and disease in the Balkan winter.
More than 600,000 refugees in Croatia have no adequate shelter and more than
2m people in Bosnia are living in war-torn areas, many without water,
heating or even window covers. After the first snows, many mountain roads
will be impassable for relief convoys.
Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, who presented the
appeal in Geneva, said the international community had to act now: 'Time is
short and thousands of lives are at stake.'
The UN call for funds covers 'life-threatening priority needs' for the 2.7m
people directly affected by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Half of
these are children and the rest mostly women, elderly and disabled. Almost
2m have fled their homes and others remain trapped in cities under siege.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Delors attacks US over subsidy on wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday heavily
criticised the US plan to double its subsidised exports of wheat and warned
that this could undermine efforts to reach a trade agreement through the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
He called US President George Bush's plan to use Dollars 1bn to subsidise
the export of 29.1m tonnes of wheat to some 28 countries an 'aggressive
act'.
Abandoning the informal truce between US and EC negotiators on Gatt, the
commission president said the US move had vindicated the Europeans' refusal
to bend to Washington's pressures to reduce its own subsidies.
His remarks came during a French radio broadcast on the Maastricht treaty.
After the broadcast, Mr Delors said the US plan would double the amount of
its subsidised wheat on world markets, directly challenging the EC's markets
in Pakistan, Kenya and Latin America.
'It is a very bad sign,' he said.
Some countries, such as Brazil, have declared they will not buy subsidised
wheat from the US, while US officials said yesterday that the announcement
was partly aimed pressing the EC to reduce its export subsidies in
agriculture.
Mr Delors acknowledged that Mr Bush's announcement was probably meant to win
US farmers' votes in the presidential election in November, but he
complained that the US was aggravating tensions over trans-Atlantic trade
through its policy of benign neglect of the dollar.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S bookshops have experienced a sudden surge of sales lately as people
have flocked to buy books on the whys and wherefores of European union, to
help make up their minds on how to vote in the Maastricht referendum on
September 20.
'We've been amazed,' said Mr Jerome Castelot, manager of the bookshop at the
Virgin Megastore on the Champs Elysees in Paris. 'Some Maastricht books are
selling so quickly that we can't get keep up with demand.'
The best-seller is the treaty itself, Traite de Maastricht, Mode D'Emploi
(How to Use It), a 600-page tome that has already sold more than 55,000
copies. The more accessible Mieux Comprendre le Traite de Maastricht (A
Better Understanding of the Maastricht Treaty), a 39-page pocket guide, is
also going well.
The government has recorded the treaty on cassettes for France's 100,000
blind voters. These carry a notice on European union in Braille and were
made available at the state secretariat for the handicapped, where the
switchboard operator said: 'The phone has not stopped ringing.'
Then there is the plethora of books trying to persuade the French to vote
Yes or No on September 20. Le Nouvel Observateur magazine this week counted
seven tracts from the No camp, four from the Yes, and six were uncommitted.
The titles of the No and Yes tracts are self-explanatory: Notre Europe Sans
Maastricht (Our Europe Without Maastricht) by Mr Philippe de Villiers, the
centre-right UDF party politician who is one of the most active
anti-Maastricht campaigners, paints a rosy picture of Europe in general and
France in particular if the treaty were rejected.
Trans-Europe Express by Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, social affairs minister, also
predicts a rosy scenario, if the treat is ratified.
The aesthetics of the books are predictable too. The No camp favours the
red, white and blue of the French tricolor flag; the Yes faction prefers the
blue of the EC flag.
Mr Henri Emmanuelli, socialist president of the National Assembly, has
sprinkled his book jacket with yellow EC stars and a red Oui (Yes).
Most of the Maastricht publishers have spent as little as possible on
design, having sensibly concluded that any book about the treaty will
probably be unsellable once the polls have closed on September 20.
The big type and generous white space used in some books suggest that they
were written in a hurry.
The most successful of the political tracts is De L'Europe et de la France
(On Europe and France) by Ms Marie-France Garaud, a prominent conservative,
and Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist politician selected to represent the No
camp in the television debate with President Francois Mitterrand on
Thursday. Their publishers claim the book has sold 50,000 copies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN political establishment has followed the Maastricht referendum
debate in neighbouring France with no little surprise and alarm.
But the German citizen in the street, if following the debate at all, seems
to be decidedly unruffled.
'If the French vote No in the referendum, it would devastate the political
leadership, and probably delight most of the German people,' according to
one senior European diplomat. 'It would shake the foundations of the
Franco-German alliance at government level and simultaneously reinforce the
relationship at the grass roots.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to intervene in the marathon French
television debate on Thursday night, and urgently to plead for a Yes vote,
was a clear demonstration of just how important a positive outcome is for
Bonn.
'If Mitterrand wins, then Kohl wins - and the opposite is also true,' said a
senior government official. 'The chancellor has invested a lot of
credibility in Maastricht. We were worried, but now less so. We assume the
outcome will be positive.'
Until the past few days, the German public had paid little attention to the
French debate, preoccupied with its own problems of unification,
immigration, and the bloody battles in former Yugoslavia.
The emergence of Germany itself as an issue in the referendum campaign has
started to change that, along with the growing realisation that a Yes vote
is no longer a foregone conclusion. Yet there appears to be no contingency
planning in Bonn for a French No: 'It is an outcome too ghastly to
contemplate,' said one German official.
The political establishment in Bonn - the leaders of all the main political
parties - is painfully aware that its dedication to European integration is
increasingly out of step with popular opinion. The polls have shown a steady
and relatively rapid switch in sentiment against further integration,
particularly by way of hostility to the exchange of the D-Mark for a single
European currency and doubt about the benefits of a frontier-free European
market.
Dr Dieter Roth of the Mannheim-based Wahlen institute for opinion research
says that, in July, there was still a majority in favour of Maastricht in
Germany, by 50-34 per cent. He expects a new poll in two weeks to show a far
narrower margin.
'We can say very clearly that, since Maastricht, the German enthusiasm for
Europe has declined,' he says. 'In particular, a large majority of the
population does not want the D-Mark to be replaced by the Ecu. In June,
about 70 per cent were opposed to that.'
That is a process independent of the French debate. What has upset the
commentators is the emergence of the 'German bogey' as an argument on both
sides of the French divide. The Yes campaigners say Maastricht is essential
to bind the German giant; the No campaigners say European union will simply
make France a German lapdog.
'We are a bit concerned about some of the arguments being used,' a German
political observer says. 'If they go on talking about German demons, it
could have a negative effect here. But, so far, the damage is limited. We
have always known that this sort of thinking played a role among the French
elite. And they have to convince chauvinist French voters.'
The German government still faces a tough ratification of the EC treaty in
the two houses of parliament. A deal has been agreed to give the Bundesrat,
the upper house, more power to oversee EC legislation and take part in
negotiations. Now the Bundestag, the directly elected lower house, is
looking for similar powers.
Perhaps most problematic of all, both chambers are demanding the right to
hold a 'vote of approval' before the EC can pass from stage two to the final
stage three of economic and monetary union. That is a concession the
government is desperate not to make, for it could call into question the
whole European Monetary Union process.

MR Vitold Fokin, Ukrainian prime minister, yesterday claimed that the
national economy has begun to pull out of its nose-dive, having grown by 0.5
per cent in the year to July. Such a stabilisation could be contrasted with
the large declines in production plaguing other ex-communist countries in
eastern Europe.
Also, Mr Fokin announced Ukraine is seeking a stabilisation fund of between
Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.5bn from the International Monetary Fund, which the
republic formally joined on Thursday. Ukrainian officials had said they
would need Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn from the IMF to cushion Ukraine's
planned currency, the hryvnia.
In Washington, a Ukrainian delegation to the IMF, headed by Mr Hryhori
Piatachenko, finance minister, was reported to have stuck to the lower
figure.
Mr Fokin claimed that, in July, production had increased by 0.5 per cent in
comparison with July 1991.
He added that, in the next day or two, he will unveil a new 'Action Plan for
the Economy'. He said his programme would simultaneously cut taxes and the
budget deficit, but made little mention of privatisation or other structural
reforms.

FOR MANY people, it could be the last straw. Fed up with unexpected charges
on their statements or high overdraft fees, news that the Big Four banks -
Midland, National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays - and the TSB are
thinking of ending most free banking, even for those in credit, could force
depositors to think about an alternative home for their money.
The number of people with bank accounts has increased substantially in the
past decade - 95 per cent of UK adults have a current account compared with
60 per cent 10 years ago. The British Banking Association says there were
53.5m current accounts at the end of December, 31.3m of them
interest-bearing.
This proliferation of accounts coincided with the introduction of free
banking, first by the building societies and then the banks.
This week, Midland chief executive Brian Pearse made clear what the banks
were thinking. Referring to the 3m of the Midland's 4.5m current
account-holders who do not pay charges, he declared: 'Over time, hopefully,
we'll persuade our customers you don't get anything for nothing.'
This was particularly ironic since the Midland was the first of the Big Four
to act in 1984 and abolish charges on customers every time they drew a
cheque or made a cash withdrawal (although the Co-Operative bank had
pioneered that route 10 years earlier).
Because of the recession, banks already have been taking measures to cut
costs, mainly through reducing branches and cutting staff. (The NatWest, for
example, has made nearly 500 employees redundant in London alone over the
past two months).
They have also been quick to reduce the rate of interest paid on current
accounts while increasing some existing charges. Later this month, for
example, the NatWest will increase its quarterly charge on overdrafts from
Pounds 16 to Pounds 19.
As the banks try to improve profitability, the idea of introducing a minimum
balance on current accounts, or charging customers who have small balances
but make heavy use of their accounts, is gaining ground. Many people,
however, will not be convinced by the banks' argument that they cannot
afford to run charge-free accounts any more.
After all, banks can invest their customers' money elsewhere. And they pay
only between 0.75 per cent net (Lloyds) and 1.86 per cent net (Midland) in
interest on a current account.
But they can charge as much as 37.4 per cent a year (Midland) for an
unauthorised overdraft, while NatWest bills customers Pounds 20 for a letter
telling them they have gone into the red. Of the Big Four, only Barclays
does not charge for an overdraft letter.
The banks do incur heavy costs in maintaining their branch networks and in
processing the billions of transactions their customers make each year.
At the moment, they say, the minority of overdrawn customers, or those with
loans, are paying these costs and, effectively, subsidising the majority.
'We are conscious that there is an imbalance between the 80 per cent who pay
no current account charges and those that are overdrawn,' said an official
for Barclays bank, which has 6.5m current account-holders. 'Most current
accounts are run at a great loss.'
Charges for those in credit have begun already - but on savings, not
current, accounts. In February the Halifax, Britain's biggest building
society, introduced charges for those with less than Pounds 50 in their
savings accounts, and for those with less than Pounds 250 who make more than
two cash withdrawals over the counter a month.
The rationale was the same as the banks are employing today. The Halifax
justified the move by saying: 'It is only fair that where additional costs
arise from customers who make high usage of certain services, that these
customers should make a contribution towards those costs rather than
spreading the expenses over all accounts.
'In general, savings accounts with very low balances and, in particular,
those with frequent transactions, run at a loss to the society.'
But these are not the only Halifax charges. For the past two years, its 3.6m
Cardcash account customers have been paying 60p each time they use a cash
machine which does not belong to the society. And, earlier this year, it
began charging some Cardcash customers who keep less than Pounds 250 in
their accounts.
The banks rule out an indiscriminate policy of charges for those in credit.
Customers most at risk are those with a low balance in a very active
account. 'We would take into consideration the way the account was used, the
real costs associated with it, and whether the customer was a heavy or light
user of the account,' said a Barclays' spokesman.
Charges could also be formulated in a way to discourage using cheques, which
cost more to process compared with direct debits or cash machine
withdrawals. 'The physical shifting of paper is expensive,' said a spokesman
for Midland (which, before free banking, used to charge 28p for
non-automated items and 15p for automated ones).
With this in mind, the Co-Op launched a Pathfinder account last year. This
is a card-based account offering standing orders and direct debits  - but no
cheque book.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: So you want to love your money - But
where? David Barchard examines the options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOW THAT the Big Four high street banks have let it be known they are
thinking seriously about ending free current-account banking for those in
credit, what options do aggrieved customers have if they want to move their
business?
When the charges are introduced - something that might well not happen for
months, or even years - migrating to another bank might not be as easy as
you think. When big banks in the US have introduced new charges, they have
usually done so in a way which encourages good customers to stay and bad
ones to move on. Knowing this, other banks have not always welcomed a flood
of applicants,
If you are planning a move, this is probably a good time. But bear in mind
that, as with credit card charges, there is little point in moving between
the Big Four. The choice is between the high street giants and the smaller
players.
The big banks have some undeniable advantages: they are very safe, with lots
of branches and a wide range of services. Yet, a small bank often provides
better service simply because it is smaller and staff know their customers
better.
There could be a down-side, though. You might live a long way from its
nearest branch and have to deal with it by post or telephone. That could be
inconvenient when you want to pay money into your account or use the
inter-bank giro system to make a payment from a branch. These days, the
larger banks normally charge non-customers for using their services.
As far as withdrawing cash goes, size should not matter. If your new bank or
building society has cash machines of its own, it will belong to one of the
main UK cash machine networks such as Link (building societies, Co-op bank
and Girobank) or Mint (Midland, National Westminster and TSB). You will also
be able to withdraw money through almost any cash machine via the Visa
network, although this incurs a 1.5 per cent handling fee).
Beyond that, you need to ask yourself if your banking needs make you a 'fat
cat' or a 'church mouse.'
Do you need to go into overdraft sometimes? If the answer is yes, think very
carefully about where you place your account. Overdraft charges are almost
the only way that banks and building societies make money from most of their
cheque accounts so, effectively, you will be subsidising bank customers who
stay in credit.
You should be especially careful that you do not go into an unauthorised
overdraft, even for a very short time. That means talking to your branch in
advance and (although it is much less easy these days) negotiating a
favourable rate from your manager. You should look for around 18 per cent.
There are considerable differences: the Co-op bank's Ultra account is among
the star performers, with good interest rates for customers who stay in
credit, but its 31 per cent for agreed overdrafts is punitive. It does,
however, have the virtue of allowing you to overdraw by up to Pounds 250 for
three days.
Do you plan to keep some money in your account and earn interest on it? You
are the sort of customer the banks are looking for these days. But you will
find that most interest-bearing cheque accounts do not earn you very much.
Some of the clearers' accounts pay as little as 1.5 per cent gross on low
balances.
Even if you plan to keep Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000 in your account, the
picture is not all that encouraging. Coutts and other up-market private
banks have long expected customers to maintain large deposits. Some of the
banks and building societies are now doing the same.
To open a current account at Abbey National, customers must deposit Pounds
300 unless their salary cheque is being deposited regularly. For Halifax's
Maxim current account, the figure is Pounds 200. Nationwide's terms are even
stiffer: Flexaccount, the UK's first mass-market, interest-bearing current
account now requires an opening balance of Pounds 500 or the same amount to
be paid in each month.
So, migrating from a bank to a building society to avoid charges and earn
interest will not suit everyone. But the Woolwich building society's current
account does look like one of the best buys on the market. No minimum
balance is needed and it pays interest of 3.38 per cent, starting on
balances of Pounds 1. Its overdraft rates also compare fairly well.
For those with much larger amounts of cash, there are higher-interest
accounts available, although many of these limit the number of cheques you
can write. The table on this page shows the rates available on a number of
accounts with Pounds 1,000 or more.
If you are willing to keep Pounds 50,000 in the account, you should be able
to earn between 8.5 and 10 per cent, with the Portman and Chelsea building
societies offering the best rates (although they pay yearly). The Northern
Rock account, which pays monthly at an annual rate of 9.34 per cent on
balances of Pounds 25,000 and more, is one of the best buys in this
category.
Northern Rock, by the way, emerged as the third-strongest society in the UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew annual review of the industry, a point which investors might
want to bear in mind.

GLAXO Holdings, the pharmaceuticals group, is predicted to produce on
Thursday pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 of Pounds 1.4bn-Pounds
1.46bn (Pounds 1.28bn a year earlier) and a dividend of 16p-20p a share
(14p).
Sales of Zantac, the ulcer drug which make up almost half its turnover, have
been eroded by Astra's newly competing Losec and other drugs in continental
Europe. But Zantac sales in the US and UK have held up.
Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company, is expected to
announce on Tuesday interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 35m-Pounds 43m (Pounds
95.2m). Forecasts of the dividend range from a rise to 3.6p to a cut. The
wide range of estimates follow a company warning in June that first-half
profits would be down.
Prudential Corporation, the insurance and financial services group, is
expected to post increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday to Pounds
225m-Pounds 240m (Pounds 170m). Life insurance profits are expected to
increase only marginally. But Prudential's general insurance business should
produce sharply reduced losses.
Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the shipping and property
group, is expected to report on Wednesday interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
90-Pounds 95m, little changed from last time.
BTR, the industrial conglomerate, reporting on Thursday, is forecast to
unveil a slight increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 440m
from Pounds 428m. News of economic recovery or the further rationalisation
of Hawker Siddeley, will be eagerly anticipated.
Cadbury Schweppes is expected to justify on Thursday its premium rating in
the food sector by reporting interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 115m-Pounds
120m (Pounds 111.5m). A modest dividend increase is also expected.
United Biscuits is expected to present a less happy picture when it
announces its interims on Friday. Cost-cutting and improved efficiency have
helped the company limit the impact of the UK recession but fierce
competition continues for Keebler, its US biscuit and snacks subsidiary.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 70m-Pounds 75m (Pounds 86.1m) are forecast.
On Wednesday Hillsdown Holdings is expected to show only a small rise at the
pre-tax level from last year's Pounds 77.6m, but the interim dividend should
be safe. Operating profits will be down but the saving on interest after
last year's rights issue will offset that.
Thursday sees results from Booker, which has changed its reporting period.
On the new basis profits should be up a touch on last time's Pounds 32.9m -
perhaps to Pounds 33.5m. But on the old basis June, profits are expected to
be down a bit.
Shell Transport and Trading is expected on Thursday to announce an increase
in its interim dividend to between 9.1p and 9.4p from 8.9p last year.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Tom Cobleigh and all for BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY sponsors have taken the plunge into the Business Expansion Scheme this
week - indeed the list consists of Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all, writes John
Authers.
Tom Cobleigh Pubs is a BES company sponsored by Wise Speke, which will buy
two pubs, probably in Yorkshire and the North Midlands. They will be managed
by Tom Cobleigh Ltd, which was set up last year and runs ten pubs of its own
in the north and Midlands, and 51 pubs tenanted by national brewers in
Humberside. Tom Cobleigh Ltd intends to make an offer for the BES shares
once the 5-year tax exemption period has expired.
The bibulous BES theme continues with Merlin Associates (Europe) which has
exclusive European rights to distribute Bushman's Australian Vodka, Crown
Reserve Scotch Whisky, Noble Estate Australian Wines and a range of Italian
and Greek liqueurs. The company believes that Bushman's will have unique
selling appeal, as it is a cane spirit vodka from Australia.
Both of these companies should be firmly labelled 'speculative'. However,
other BES companies with covenanted repayment of fixed sums after five years
are also on offer.
Neill Clerk is sponsoring Oxford Isis Residences, which will buy
accommodation for Oxford Polytechnic, recently created a university. For
every Pounds 1 paid now, it will repay Pounds 1.28 on October 31, 1997.
House the Homeless of London (Greenwich) is the latest BES scheme set up by
the Peabody Trust. It is aiming to provide 70 permanent homes for families
in Greenwich. Peabody, which has properties with a vacant possession value
of Pounds 825m, will pay Pounds 1.26 after five years for every Pounds 1
subscribed now.
The most unusual new development for contracted exit schemes comes from
Johnson Fry, which has launched the Mortgage Express Flexible Growth Scheme
in conjunction with TSB's Mortgage Express. The new wrinkle comes from a
loan facility after one year - borrowers can take a loan equivalent to 76
per cent of the gross amount they originally invested. This is repaid
automatically from the proceeds of the BES when TSB takes control of the
property after five years. The loan does not rely on you proving your
income, and it is non-recourse - in other words, according to Johnson Fry,
there is no obligation to repay it from anything other than BES shares.
Johnson Fry is also launching Sovereign Reversions, which will buy
properties from the elderly for a knock-down price in order to provide them
with an income. The company will only take over the properties once the
occupants have died, and then aim to make a profit.
Finally Pathfinder Repossessions II is a more speculative investment. It
will buy repossessed property in London.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Safety is the best policy  / A look
at the solvency of the big insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW SAFE is your insurance policy? A small insurance trade association this
week alleged that a number of insurers were potentially insolvent, fuelling
controversy about the financial strength of the industry and the security of
insurance policies.
The financial strength of UK insurers has certainly been seriously weakened
by two years of record losses, and falls in the value of the properties and
shares in which they invested heavily in the 1980s.
By the end of last year the net assets of the five biggest composite
companies has been cut from Pounds 10.8bn at the end of 1989, to around
around Pounds 6bn, its lowest level since 1984.
Much of the recent concern has centred on the solvency margin - one of the
main tools used by regulators and analysts to measure the financial strength
of the insurance companies.
The margin (or ratio) measures a company's ability to pay claims by
comparing its net assets (its capital and free reserves) with the amount of
premium income received in a given year.
In very simple terms, the stronger a company's capital base the less risk
there is of it being unable to pay insurance claims, the more risks it can
take on to its books and the more policies it can sell.
Companies must maintain a statutory minimum solvency ratio of between 16 and
18 per cent, although brokers, who are effectively professional insurance
buyers, generally insist that the ratio should be no less than 30 per cent,
nearly double the legal minimum.
Solvency ratios have certainly fallen. The UK's biggest company, Sun
Alliance, fell from over 124 per cent in 1989 to 56 per cent at the end of
June this year. The other large composite companies - so-called because they
underwrite a combination of general and life insurance - all have lower
margins, although they remain comfortably above the legal minimum.
However, a low solvency ratio need not necessarily give grounds for concern.
The level and adequacy of claims reserves - which companies are legally
obliged to maintain - is not reflected in the solvency ratio. In the UK, the
DTI has sophisticated systems to monitor the adequacy of these reserves as
well as the riskiness of the assets - investments in shares, gilts or
property - into which these monies are invested. So a good deal of
qualitative as well as quantitative analysis goes on in assessing company
security.
According to Charles Longhurst of the Association of British Insurers 'it is
no secret that the solvency margin has fallen but the companies are still
trading and able to meet claims. They have been living off the fat for the
last couple of years but they haven't reached the bone yet.'
Roy Randall, of Royal Insurance, says 'a battery of factors are involved' in
assessing solvency. 'The solvency margin is not the be all and end all.'
Nor is a high solvency margin necessarily a guide to financial health.
Trinity Insurance, which became insolvent earlier this year, had relatively
high solvency margins, indicating that the ratio does not always help the
watchdogs spot weaknesses.
Even so in today's very difficult economic environment the possibility that
your insurance company will go under cannot be entirely precluded. Even if
it does, however, policyholders enjoy some automatic protection.
The Policyholders Protection Board - funded by the insurance industry as a
whole - would assume most of a company's obligations.
The PPB will pay 100 per cent of claims incurred on insurance policies which
it is compulsory to buy, such as third party motor insurance and 90 per cent
of all other claims.
Jane Vass, of the Consumers' Association, says: 'Nobody wants to go though
the awkwardness of claiming from such a body but it is a safety net.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: A bitter pill for consumers to
swallow - John Authers considers private medical insurance costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNING] Trying to compare private medical insurance policies can be bad for
your health.
Ten years ago, private medical insurance (PMI) was a standardised product.
The market was dominated by BUPA (the British United Provident Association),
the policies of which were copied by others in the industry.
Since then, changes have made health insurance one of the most bewilderingly
fragmented and complex fields. A quickening rate of inflation in health care
costs has a lot to do with this. Bupa estimates annual health care inflation
at around 14 per cent - triple the rate of retail price inflation.
Then came the changed aspirations in Mrs Thatcher's wake. Many more people
now seek private medical insurance, not necessarily for rational reasons,
and most new customers are in a lower income bracket than the industry's
traditional customers.
These factors between them led to the introduction of 'budget' plans, which
offered lower cover, in return for affordable premiums. Companies had
different ways of cutting the amount of cover they had to offer, so the
costs are not usually directly comparable.
New companies entered the field, such as Norwich Union and Allied Dunbar,
most of which had new ways of approaching the problem.
For example, Norwich Union's market research suggested that customers were
more concerned to ensure that any treatment they did need should be paid
for, but were prepared to spend money on initial consultations. If you go to
a consultant and find you are fit, therefore, NU's cheapest policy will not
pay you anything, and you will have to foot the bill.
If the consultant finds something is wrong with you, life will be both more
distressing and more expensive, but NU will foot the bill.
Other innovations include travel insurance as part of the package (from
Allied Dunbar), loyalty bonuses, no-claims bonuses, and the option to take
an excess - insurers will only pay medical bills in excess of a certain
amount.
All this leads to startling variations in premiums, both between and within
companies. As policies will not, quite reasonably, cover you for a condition
which already exists, tailoring a policy to individual needs is very
difficult.
Perhaps it is best, therefore, to examine exactly why you might want to use
medical care from outside the National Health Service.
Some insurers would claim that private care is not a luxury, but a necessary
product to rank alongside life assurance and pensions. But most, including
Bupa, accept that it is primarily an aspiration.
Health fees inflation however, has made this aspiration rather harder to
fund - changing contracts make this difficult to measure, but most in the
industry accept that premiums have risen by around 30 per cent over the last
year.
What, therefore, do you gain by opting out of the NHS? The prime gain, if
this is to be thought of as anything like a necessity, is time, particularly
for those active in business.
A recent Which? survey confirmed that private health care is indeed much
quicker than the NHS. But the margin is narrower than the gulf in cost
between public and private treatment can justify.
As many as 32 per cent of private patients have to wait more than a month
before going into hospital, according to Which?, but only 2 per cent wait
longer than three, and none wait as long as six months.
Most NHS patients (three quarters) reach hospital within three months of
being referred, but one in five wait for three months or longer. This can
then drag into the kind of emotive nightmare which occasionally appears in
the newspapers - 9 per cent wait more than a year, and 3 per cent more than
two. But the chances of getting treatment quickly on the NHS do tend to tip
the balance against taking traditional private insurance for reasons of
time.
This has led to the growth of the 'six-week' plan. Private medicine can more
or less guarantee to treat you within this period, so the policies will pay
out for treatment if you need to wait more than six weeks on the NHS. These
policies are so much cheaper that they demonstrate how good your chances are
of getting quick public treatment.
For example, according to the latest survey by Money Marketing, a quotation
which would cost Pounds 62.85 from Bupa for top-quality wards, or Pounds
30.33 for the lowest band of wards could cost as little as Pounds 11.90 per
month if only six-week waiting lists are covered.
In many ways this is a traditional 'risk' insurance - you pay quite small
amounts of money to protect against the risk of something which is unlikely
but potentially disastrous if it happens.
What of the other benefits of private medicine? Which?'s respondents found
that food and interior decor were better in private hospitals, but a
comfortable majority of NHS patients were satisfied with privacy and
visiting arrangements. Also, Which? found that if you have complications,
you are sometimes better off in the NHS, as private hospitals often do not
have a full range of emergency back-up facilities.
Private insurance might, then, be best regarded not as an aspiration - it is
too expensive for that - but as an insurance against the risk of a very long
NHS waiting list. Unless you have insurance via the company you work for,
that probably means looking at budget and six-week schemes.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Fashion: Just popping over to Paris for a tie . . . / A look
at where the elitists of men's European fashion choose their clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the pleasures for a man travelling to Europe used to be the
opportunity to return with stylish clothing unavailable in the UK.
Gradually, more items have found their way to Britain. But the ultimate
wardrobe is a combination of classics acquired from Britain and the rest of
Europe.
Wider ranges are usually available in a product's country of origin, while
the original, continental flagship stores remain an experience in
themselves. There are some exclusive, classic items, the finest in their
field, which can only be obtained from a particular address.
Shirts, for example. The Englishman is well served by Jermyn Street, London,
where Hilditch &amp; Key, Harvie &amp; Hudson, New &amp; Lingwood and Turnbull &amp; Asser
line up, demonstrating that a crucial component of fine English shirtmaking
is an ampersand.
But the Englishman abroad should still be tempted by a visit to the
Jugendstil building in Vienna which houses the century-old company Knize - a
tailor used by French entertainer Maurice Chevalier - famous for its
hand-sewn shirts.
Battistoni, Italy's most celebrated shirtmaker, has served Gianni Agnelli,
the Fiat chairman, and Gore Vidal, the author and style commentator, with
custom-made shirts from its Persian-carpeted premises on the Via Condotti in
Rome. Charvet, shirtmakers to Windsors, Rothschilds and Rockefellers since
1838, which sells bespoke and ready-made shirts from its premises on the
Place Vendome in Paris, is still perhaps the most sought after. Customers
are personally escorted in a tiny lift to the company's upper floors where
ready-made and made-to-measure shirts are supplied.
Charvet's ground floor houses its fabulous selection of ties, another
European status item. The language of the old school tie may be an English
dialect but the colours of Eton or the Guards go unrecognised on the
continent where the neckwear which whispers wealth and taste is the Hermes
tie.
Its basic design, of tiny interwoven or repeated motifs, often marine or
equine, has been imitated but never bettered. Ferragamo, from Florence, is
the latest fashionable alternative, with colours a bit bolder and motifs a
little more inventive. But the Hermes tie remains the international power
tie. The finest selection, including bow ties, is on offer at the Hermes
store on the rue du Faubourg St Honore in Paris.
That flagship Hermes store also offers one of the most prestigious names in
British footwear, John Lobb. In London, Lobb produces made-to-measure shoes,
which, are among the best in the world. But at Hermes you can buy ready-made
Lobb shoes, a strange twist on bringing home stylish items.
Paris also contains one of Europe's most prestigious ready-made shoe shops,
JM Weston, on the Champs Elysee, where the styles are discreetly classic.
However, in terms of identifiable styling, the Gucci loafer, available from
the original Gucci boutique, on Florence's Via Tornabuoni, reigns supreme.
This kind of light footwear suggests that your feet barely touch the ground
between carpeted office and chauffered limousine.
Italy beats France by a short head when it comes to hats. True, Motsch et
fils, the hatters on the avenue George V, in Paris, does have a fine
selection of traditional styles, and a real understanding of what an
Englishman can wear. But Borsalino, perhaps the most celebrated name in
hats, combines tradition with a unique flair. Its original shop is on the
corner of the Piazza della Scala in Milan, but the best stocked is on Corso
Vittorio Emanuele II, where you can find everything from an Indiana Jones
fedora to something more suited to the urban jungle.
A fine briefcase is clearly important to the Euro executive. It should fall
somewhere between the lightness of an Italian Bottega Veneta, and the
heaviness of an English Swaine, Adeney. Louis Vuitton luggage achieves the
class which its brash monogram designs lack. Frankfurt is the home of
Gold-Pfeil products. Its top quality leather goods, often in intriguing
shades and colours, are rapidly gaining recognition.
If you do want something made in Spain, then one of the traditionally-tooled
leather belts from Loewe, sold in Madrid since 1846, will bring a genuinely
Castilian flavour to your wardrobe.
There is a tendency to inflate the reputation of foreign items which are
hard to find in the UK, so the Laguiole pocket knife, from France, has
gained cult status, simply because the Swiss Army knife is so easy to
obtain.
Equally, there is a tendency to downgrade our homegrown creations. Yet, when
it comes to bespoke tailoring, there really is nowhere to match London's
Savile Row. There is Cifonelli in Paris, famous for its jacket shoulders,
and there is Caraceni in Milan, which dresses Euro cognoscenti like Baron
Heinrich von Thyssen and Karl Lagerfeld. But there is something about the
sharper cut favoured on the continent which is off-putting to the
well-suited Englishman.
For off-the-peg, however, you do have to go Italian. Immediately, everyone
thinks of Armani, but his couture-level designs are now veering into an
extremely relaxed style, inappropriate for many executives. Ermenegildo
Zegna is much more discreet in its styling. Its comfortable,
crease-resistant fabrics, and subtly patterned, and impeccably tailored
suits, are ideal for international businessmen. At its store on the Via
Pietro Verri in Milan, it offers some of the most sophisticated off-the-peg
suits in Europe.
The green Loden overcoat has become a badge of the European intellectual. It
is the only item of traditional Austrian apparel which has broken the
Lederhosen image barrier, and the reason why it is worth visiting Lanz, in
Salzburg, which makes the best in the world. Of course, inclement weather
brings out the best of British with the Burberry raincoat, or the Brigg
umbrella. Ironically, of course, half of Europe is trying to look like the
English, from Italians in brogues and Prince of Wales check suits, to
Frenchmen fixated on le style Anglais. Or, as Tom Wolfe observed: 'At a
certain level in the class struggle, once you pass a certain point, everyone
dresses English.'

FT  05 SEP 92 / How To Spend It: It's fast, it's furious - it's New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE lived in New York for nearly two years, a blink of the eye in the big
scheme of things; but in a city that moves as fast as this one, a lot can be
learned in a short space of time.
The only important thing to know about visiting New York is, whatever you
do, do not pause too long for breath; otherwise, you will miss feasting on
the city's extraordinary energy. Tackle everything - shopping, eating,
drinking or sightseeing - at speed. You can rest when you get home.
SHOPPING
The best thing about shopping for clothes in New York is that if you want to
spend a bundle on designer labels, you can. But if you want to spend less,
and still look good, there is affordable quality in abundance. Classic
American clothes are especially good value - Levi 501s, for example, cost
just Dollars 36 at any branch of Wings around the city.
For men, Banana Republic also offers the classic American look but with an
outdoor, preppy twist. Handsome black leather jackets, designed with a
minimum of fuss but a maximum of comfort, can be had for only Dollars 325
and dark green suede jackets, which would look wonderful with either a white
T-shirt or a smart Brooks Brothers' button-down, are available for Dollars
345.
There are several Banana Republics around the city, including one at
Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.
There is no shortage of choice at the top end of the market. If you like
everything in one place, the men's department at Bergdorf Goodman, on Fifth
Avenue at 58th Street, is worth a trip - ignore the tweedy, English
gentleman's club interior and enjoy the wide range of top American and
European designers - as is Barneys on Seventh Avenue in Chelsea, which has
the best tie collection and the wackiest window displays in the western
hemisphere.
If you want the designer labels at permanent sale prices, go downtown to
Century 21, a vast, ugly department store opposite the World Trade Centre.
Do not be put off by the tacky setting because you can find some tremendous
fashion bargains on the ground floor. It is especially good for men's
Italian suits and jackets. For those with more particular tastes, try
Matsuda on lower Fifth Avenue which sells pricy, but comfortable and chic,
Japanese clothes.
For women, a wide range of options is available. Obvious recommendations
include Bergdorf Goodman, Henri Bendel and Charivari, all situated
conveniently within a few blocks of each other around Fifth Avenue and 57th
Street; but, among the individual designers, try Betsey Johnson for bright
colours in sexy shapes and Morgane Le Fay, where the present autumn fashions
are ethereally elegant in warm wine reds, navy blues, off-whites and greys.
Both are in SoHo, and all of the above are expensive.
There are too many good shoe shops to mention, but Tootsi Plohound at Prince
Street in SoHo and Martinez Valero on Third Avenue at 61st Street come
recommended for quality women's shoes at good prices.
Anyone looking for home furnishing should head straight for Portico, on the
corner of Wooster and Spring streets. It has a lovely selection of antique
brass beds, plenty of fine linens, towels, and various bathroom fittings and
fixtures. Like many of New York's best shops, Portico is worth visiting just
to enjoy the space it occupies - a high-ceilinged converted warehouse with
polished wooden floors and tall, wide windows.
If your tastes are more cosmopolitan, go to Hecho-A-Mano on West Broadway, a
fabulous shop that sells hand-made Mexican furniture, crockery and
glassware, and Zona (also in SoHo, on Greene Street) which sells an enormous
variety of gifts for young and old, including some delightful wooden
American folk circus toys.
Shopping builds the appetite, so follow the example of many New Yorkers at
lunchtime and get something from the many sandwich bars which offer huge,
exotic combinations for under Dollars 10. If you want something a cut above
the rest, go to Mangia at 54 West 56th Street. Pick up one of its healthy
sandwiches, soups or salads and have a picnic in Central Park.
Sheep Meadow, a few minutes' walk from the park's southern entrance, is
perfect - it is a special quiet zone and has splendid views of the mid-town
skyline above the treetops.
If you fancy a sit-down meal, but want to keep it informal, go to the Oyster
Bar underneath Grand Central Station - a cavernous seafood restaurant packed
with local office workers. The food is simple but very good, and the setting
magnificent.
If you want to come home from New York with a really special buy, head down
to the Lower East Side. Orchard Street is famed for its new and second-hand
leather jackets (a visiting friend recently bought a superb original 1950s'
police leather coat for Dollars 350), while Second Avenue or the eastern end
of Houston Street are equally good for vintage American clothes.
The multi-coloured 'varsity' jackets worn by high school and college
students are particularly fashionable at the moment and cost a fraction of
the price they would command overseas.
Whatever you do, do not leave until you have visited one of the markets
which sell the produce from farms in upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and
other outlying areas. The best, at Union Square, is held on Wednesdays,
Fridays and Saturdays.
The produce, most of it grown organically grown, is wonderful - especially
the sourdough breads, locally-caught seafood, fresh herbs and mouth-watering
sweetcorn.
The smells and sounds of the market create a glorious atmosphere; on a sunny
Saturday morning, there is no better place to be in New York.
EATING OUT
Shopping in New York is enjoyable, but your best time in the city probably
will be spent in restaurants and bars. One of my favourite bars is the Paris
Cafe, on South Street right at the bottom of Manhattan. It is a welcoming,
comfortable old place, best visited at weekends (when it is not so busy with
Wall Street lunchers) and in the early-morning hours, when the traders and
fishmongers from the Fulton Street market next door pop in for a drink after
work.
If you want to mingle with the young and the beautiful, make for the Coffee
Shop on Union Square where you will find more models than on a Paris
catwalk. But if you want the truly unusual, step down to the tiny Samurai
Bar on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village, probably the world's only
Japanese reggae bar. Drink sake or Sapporo beer, enjoy the music, chat to
the friendly Haitian owners - and understand what people mean about the city
being a melting pot.
Of all the many restaurants in New York, my favourite for atmosphere and
impromptu late-night dinners is Raoul's, at 180 Prince Street. Drink with
the locals at the crowded bar, or enjoy the simple but well-prepared French
food.
If you want a more formal night out, with some truly innovative cuisine, go
to the Quilted Giraffe, at 550 Madison Avenue, where the heavily
Japanese-influenced creations are gorgeous to look at and eat. Go for the
'Beggar's Purse' appetiser - caviar rolled in gold leaf presented on a mini
pedestal.
Owner and chef Barry Wine will insist you eat it with your hands behind your
back and, while you struggle inelegantly, he will snap a picture to add to a
collection that includes Warren Beatty, Madonna, William Hurt, and other
luminaries. One important note, though: if the New York Giants football team
are having a bad season, be extra nice to Frank, the maitre d'.
Finally, if you want to be ultra-hip, head down to SoHo. Start off with a
late dinner at Boom, on Spring Street. You've heard of 'world music' - well,
this is 'world food': Moroccan charmoula-marinated seafood over cinammon
couscous, or risotto with white truffle oil and white mushrooms. It tastes
as good as it sounds and sometimes there is live jazz to enjoy.
After Boom, stroll south to where West Broadway meets Grand Street and
fritter the night away at the coolest crossroads in all of New York: the
Felix Bar, upstairs at Jour et Nuit, the West Broadway Restaurant, La
Jumelle and Lucky Strike are all crammed into one small block. By four or
five in the morning you should have had enough, so wind down with a strong
black coffee at the all-night Moonshine Diner a few yards away on Sixth
Avenue.
You will need a good breakfast every morning to ensure you keep up with New
York's pace. Try the Edwardian Room at the Plaza, which is located superbly
alongside Central Park. Its beautiful light on sunny mornings eases you
nicely into the day.
For the more adventurous who might want to breakfast downtown, tackle the
Texan flavours of Cottonwood on Bleecker St by Eighth Avenue, where a big
plateful of huevos rancheros (hot Mexican eggs) and a large Bloody Mary will
put enough fire in your belly to last through the day - and cure your
hangover, if necessary.
WHERE TO STAY
Most of the well-known New York hotels are grand and expensive in the
old-fashioned way so, for those seeking a more intimate experience, try the
Lowell on East 63rd Street just off Madison Avenue. The Lowell is located
ideally for an evening at one of my favourite restaurants, Le Bilboquet, a
cramped but atmospheric French bistro located across the street and popular
with the beautiful people of the Upper East Side. Le Bilboquet does not take
reservations but, if you have to wait, Philippe, the irrepressible
proprietor, should keep you entertained.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Guns and drugs: Estonia's growth industries - Pelle Noreth
meets smugglers, KGB soldiers and CIA agents in Tallinn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PELLE NORETH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trooper shoves a machine-gun in my stomach and bawls: 'Dokumenti]' There
is no need to be a linguist to know what he means. He and about five
colleagues, all in riot gear, have burst into the restaurant where I am
eating with an English friend, alighting on us as potential smugglers.
Neither of us, alas, has his passport but we don't look hard or crazy enough
to risk our lives by swallowing pure heroin tied up in condoms. The soldier
lowers his gun, grunts and bounds off with his men to intimidate the only
other guests in the restaurant, a young couple frozen in mid-smooch.
Another evening, another place. It is Sunday 10pm at the Viru Hotel
restaurant, one of Tallinn's better establishments. There are few guests
since Estonians, like the Swiss, go to bed early so they can rise with the
sun and put in a good day's work. Even the DJs, who have been playing a
curious mix of Abba and Elton John, have gone home. The only activity comes
from a table by a window offering a view of the snow-covered city below. The
guests seem to be enjoying themselves in a most un-Estonian fashion. There
are about six of them, all male, sitting around a table which looks like a
battlefield, the history of their four-course meal smeared on the white
table cloth. They are surrounded by empty bottles of Russian champagne and a
bottle, half-empty, of Armenian brandy. A pall of smoke hangs over the table
and the pungent whiff of Caucasian tobacco fills the air. The men are in a
boisterous mood, slapping each other's backs and toasting each other loudly.
The contrast to the gaunt and frosty Estonian waiters in black tuxedos
serving them could not be greater.
These are the smugglers - never Estonian, frequently from central Asia,
nearly always rich - whom the Estonian KGB were so desperate to catch.
They are the kings in Estonia's fastest-growing business, toasting each
other's latest deals, which often involve weapons and drugs, though
sometimes it is as innocuous as caviar. Last year, 400 tons of heroin found
their way to the West from central Asia. Much of it through Tallinn,
Estonia's capital, and from there by ship to Helsinki, 50 miles away across
the Gulf of Finland. From there sea and air connections can be made all over
the world.
'Estonia is a favoured smuggling channel for a variety of reasons,' says
Tarmu Tammerk, an Estonian journalist. 'A lot of them have to do with
independence. It is a new country. All the institutions that guard borders
in other countries have to be set up from scratch.'
Four fifths of the heroin consumed in Europe comes from central Asia,
according to Dagmar Thomas-Halasek of the United Nations Drug Control
Programme. The heroin used to come from central Asia through Turkey, across
Bulgaria and then through Yugoslavia.
But the conflict there has forced the smugglers to take a more northerly
route through Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. These countries are ideal places
for drugs smugglers to launder their profits. Their banks, newly set up,
badly need hard currency for start-up capital and, unlike Western banks, are
unlikely to ask any questions.
'They need capital and will take it wherever it comes from,' says Joel
Jutkowitz, a drug expert. 'And, if you're in the drug business, what better
way to launder your money?'
Who can stop it? When Estonia became independent it had no armed forces, let
alone border guards. Ants Laaneots, the newly appointed chief-of-staff,
faces an enormous task in setting up a fledgling army. Barracks, equipment,
trained officers and above all recruits are in short supply because there is
no draft law.
                       *      *      *
The drugs trail starts in poppy fields in the mountainous central Asian
republics of Tajikstan, Uzbekistan or Kirghizia. The opium is refined on the
spot into heroin, which is easier to smuggle. Almost a third of the world's
poppies are grown there, and small farmers are eagerly planting more. Unlike
wheat, opium is not bought cheaply by the state nor does it rot in railway
sidings.
Drugs running is a labour intensive and dangerous industry. Human 'mules'
carry the heroin in condoms in their stomachs or in false-bottomed suitcases
to Estonia. Drugs smuggling is a capital offence in the former Soviet Union.
The drugs are moved by rail or by air, sometimes both, in a journey which
crosses 5,000 km, four time zones and three or four former-Soviet republics,
depending on the route. There are no borders except between Estonia and
Russia. The Russians do not bother to check the border traffic. The Estonian
border guards are young, inexperienced, outnumbered and outgunned. They have
no mines, pill boxes or armour to stop more determined smugglers. It is said
that the secret services of the ex-Communist countries are on the payroll of
the heroin kings, using their contacts and skills to outwit Western drug
squads.
The smugglers spend the profits on sophisticated weapons such as the
American Stinger anti-aircraft missile which costs Dollars 100,000. The
weapons are used in ethnic feuds, supressed during communism but which have
resurfaced with independence. Fighting has been raging in Tajikstan. It
could break out in Uzbekistan at any moment. Any money left over is spent on
whisky, TV sets, videotapes and other goodies to be enjoyed by tribal
leaders in private.
The central Asian republics have a tradition of criminal secret societies,
sometimes promoted by their governments. In the 1970s the bosses of
Uzbekistan pocketed millions of roubles from Moscow by pretending to grow
cotton that did not exist.
                       *      *      *
It was an ice-cold February morning. A freezing wind swept in from the
Baltic. Jaan Tooming, a customs officer, turned up his collar, looked east
and sighed: another blue day, four hours of twilight during which the sun
barely rose above the horizon. He inspected his first shipment. According to
the label, the crates contained 7,500 sports rifles destined for the Isle of
Man. When he opened the crates he found row upon row of tightly-packed,
brand new Makarov machine pistols, 15,000 in all.
The weapons are standard issue Warsaw Pact weapons which would turn ducks
into feathered mulch. Three days later a similar haul of 25,000 guns, with
the same destination, was made in Helsinki, same end destination. The
directors of the Isle of Man company were a mysterious Russian couple who
operated from Yaroslavl, a city north of Moscow. They said the merchandise
had been swapped at the factory where both guns are made. By whom? The
couple refused to say or did not know. According to James Short, a British
security expert, the Isle of Man company is a conduit for the IRA.
The smuggled arms follow a different route from the drugs, often coming from
the 'enemy within', the 22,000 former-Soviet army troops still stationed in
Estonia. Soldiers sell their personal equipment: Kalashnikov rifles,
hand-held rocket launchers and hand grenades. Smugglers pay Dollars 500
(Pounds 251.20) for a Kalashnikov which will, at current exchange rates, pay
a conscript's wages for three years - longer than his entire draft period.
The soldiers' superiors approve. 'Troops ought to sell army property and
material. It's the only way they can survive,' the leader of an Officers'
Council (a disciplinary body) told the Russian newspaper SM Sevodnya.
The former Soviet army, which consists mostly of Russians, has reluctantly
promised to leave within two years what is considered a cushy posting. And
not before time, according to Laaneots: 'We are still an occupied nation.'
'This is the tip of the arms-trafficking iceberg,' Clyde Kull, who functions
as Estonia's Mr Soundbite abroad, told NATO's foreign ministers in April. He
asked for infra red detectors, light arms and patrol boats to stop Estonia
from becoming a channel for 'arms, drugs and strategic weapons'.
'If one arms cache heading for the IRA was discovered,' Kull said, 'the
number that have slipped through unnoticed can only be guessed at.' Yet only
Sweden - which is not even a member of NATO - has responded so far, giving
Estonia a dozen or so coastal patrol boats. Britain and most of the NATO
countries on Estonia's doorstep have done nothing.
But the US, as I found out, is watching the country as closely as it did
before the Second World War when Tallinn was a spies' den and a listening
post on the Soviet Union.
Gerald was fortyish, with a flat Slavic nose and a boxer's lip. He was the
proud possessor of the only tan I saw in Estonia. He said he was a visiting
US businessman who was so 'wowed' by my article for the local
English-language paper, The Baltic Independent, on the illegal arms trade
that he had to take its author out to lunch. He got straight to the point.
'How much do you know about the arms trade?' he asked, which I thought was
an odd question from some one who claimed to export Estonian birch-tree
water to the US for its homeopathic qualities. Loosened up by expensive
French wine, I ditched all my journalistic integrity and told him everything
 -including who my sources were.
'AFP - can you clarify that. Is that a code name?' he asked, looking
excited.
'No that's Agence France Presse. The wire service,' I replied.
'Oh,' he said, his interest in me waning fast.
'Listen,' he said as he paid the bill with a stack of crisp dollars. 'Here's
my fax number in the United States. If you get any more information - hot
information - on arms why don't you just get over to that little fax for
yours and send it me. You will be compensated financially for it, of
course.'
Back in England I checked the number.
'Langley, Virginia,' the US operator chirped. 'Yes sir, that's where CIA
headquarters are located.'
Well, here you are Gerald. Hope your bosses like it.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Long View: Rewards of playing safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE LESS risk and earn a higher return? It is not in the textbooks. If the
opportunity does occur for an extended period it is a sign that something is
badly wrong.
Just a year ago sterling interest rates fell by half a percentage point to
10 1/2 per cent, which at the time seemingly represented just another step
in a long decline. But base rates have managed only another half-point fall
in the past 12 months, amid post-election euphoria. They have recently
appeared more likely to rise than to fall further, though the market's
immediate fears were soothed by Thursday's move to shore up sterling by
borrowing DM20bn.
The phase of continuous double-digit sterling interest rates now goes back
more than four years. It has been a wonderful period for cautious depositors
in bank and building society accounts who even now are receiving something
like 7 per cent net of standard rate tax. In fact, it is often better at
present to invest in money funds that are plugged more directly into money
market rates. But even though the High Street deposit rates may have dropped
a little over the past year, the rate of inflation has fallen by more, from
5.5 to 3.7 per cent, so the real rate of interest has actually gone up. This
is not what is supposed to happen in recessions, when money ought to become
cheap. We have broken the textbook rules again.
There is a colossal distortion of the financial system. Interest rates are
being held high in order to suppress inflation and prop up the sterling
exchange rate. One consequence is that the reward for risk has disappeared.
According to the magazine Money Management Pounds 1,000 invested in a
Halifax account over the past five years would have rolled up to Pounds
1,490 today, for a standard rate taxpayer. In 1987 pounds that is only
Pounds 1,090 but it still represents a positive real return. However, Pounds
1,000 committed to the average unit trust would have shrunk to Pounds 914
(Pounds 670 in terms of the original money).
Now, you can argue that such sums based on share prices just before the 1987
crash are freakish. Moreover the high costs of unit trusts have distorted
the comparison. If you had invested directly in the stock market, on the
basis of the All-Share Index, and you ignored costs but allowed for standard
rate tax on dividends, Pounds 1,000 five years ago might be worth Pounds
1,070 today. Still better, suppose you shrewdly waited to invest until after
the crash. Pounds 1,000 in November 1987 might now have grown to perhaps
Pounds 1,375. No wonder the unit trust marketing men are waiting eagerly
until the effect of the crash drops out of their five-year performance
figures. But this still does not beat the risk-free deposit performance. Nor
does it show up very well against government securities. Over the past five
years Pounds 1,000 invested in long-dated gilt-edged (again, ignoring costs)
would have accumulated to some Pounds 1,400. This is in stark contrast to
the historical pattern: over the past 75 years or so, pre-tax returns on
equities have exceeded those on gilts by 6 per cent a year on average.
There need be no mystery about the strange trends in the investment markets.
High interest rates have supported the sterling exchange rate, which has
reduced the returns from overseas investment. Domestically, profitability
has been suppressed so that dividend growth has not only slowed down but is
now going into reverse.
Those depositors are sitting pretty in all this. But all around us we can
see the damage that is being done. Depositors are being paid more than most
borrowers can possibly afford, especially when the beleaguered banks are
trying to jack up their margins. Businesses by the thousand are being
bankrupted. Between 1m and 1.5m home buyers, mostly young, are technically
insolvent with 'negative equity'. A clash of the generations is looming. The
'woopies', the well-off older people who traded down in the housing market
in the late 1980s and banked the net proceeds are enjoying a double payoff,
with an income bonus to add to their capital windfall. But no nation can
expect to lure its young people into financial ruin and get away with it.
Double-digit interest rates have persisted in the UK for more than four
years now, ever since Nigel Lawson, in the early summer of 1988, realised
that he had problems more serious than a tendency for sterling to rise above
DM3. But while high interest rates can provide valuable short-term shock
treatment, as a long-term therapy for an over-indebted economy they are
ultimately destructive. They must lead to a collapse of asset values and the
failure of the financial system.
The precise timing of any change of approach may depend on external factors
such as the French referendum on Maastricht and the ups and downs of German
interest rates. But a sharp and sudden policy reversal is inevitable in due
course. The British Government will come to regret its decision to enter the
ERM without applying direct measures to force an almost immediate pay and
price adjustment, and without a strategy for controlling the inevitable
shakeout in the property market. This week Norman Lamont has again failed to
intervene in the domestic economy and has relied on rigging the exchange
rate.
As for investors, they can begin to anticipate the return of conditions in
which risk is once again rewarded. But the government can continue to buy
time if it is unconcerned about the cost; and the past couple of months have
shown that bad investment timing can be punished severely.
For the moment, if you have a comfortable nest-egg returning 10 per cent
gross you may reckon that the Bundesbank is still your friend. UK inflation,
you may calculate, could be no more than 2 1/2 per cent over the next 12
months. Enjoy your good fortune so long as it lasts.

FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow dips slightly on bad jobs
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE PRICES fell yesterday in the wake of an unexpectedly bad August
employment report. The markets' decline, however, would have been worse but
for an easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and a big fall in
bond yields, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,281.93.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
0.89 at 417.09. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.44 to 573.44, and the Amex
composite 0.25 to 384.85, although trading on the American Stock Exchange
was disrupted for most of the day by a fire in a neighbouring building.
Turnover on the New York SE was light at 126m shares because of the Labor
Day weekend.
Trading opened amid difficult conditions. At 8.30am the Labor department
reported August non-farm payrolls had declined by 83,000, a figure that
shocked the market, which had been expecting a substantial rise in payrolls.
The fall would have been 100,000 larger but for the impact of a Federally
funded summer jobs programme.
The jobs data triggered heavy selling of the dollar on foreign exchange
markets, sending the US currency more than two pfennigs lower against the
Deutschmark to just below DM1.40. Despite the bad employment news and the
dollar's fall, stocks opened broadly unchanged, helped by expectations that
the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates and by a big fall in bond
yields.
The Fed did eventually cut interest rates just before noon, but not by much
 -it lowered the fed funds target from 3 1/4 per cent to 3 per cent.
Although the move was welcome, it was not the fully-fledged discount rate
cut that the market had hoped for.
Among individual stocks, selected banks were steady or higher on hopes of

regulators had severely criticised the bank for poor management and
supervision of its mortgage operations.
USX-Marathon, the energy subsidiary of USX-Steel group, fell Dollars 3/8 to

closure of a refinery and speculation that the company's annual dividend may
be cut.

FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Government action lifts Tokyo stocks -
But the rise in values may become more difficult to sustain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<TEXT>
After more than two and a half years of decline, the scale of the recent
jump in Japanese share prices seems to reflect a definite turnround in
sentiment.
The Nikkei average has surged amid heavy volume, gaining 4,245.89 points, or
30 per cent from its six-year low in mid-August.
Most market participants seem convinced that the worst is over. 'It's a
very, very powerful rebound, one of the strongest I've seen in my life,'
says Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson.
The first round of buying followed the government's announcement of
emergency support measures for the country's banking system.
After the Nikkei plunged to a new six-year low of 14,309.41 on August 19,
the government announced measures preventing financial institutions from
selling shares to boost profits.
However, the real spur was anticipation of the economic package announced
late on Friday, August 28.
Aside from Y10,700bn in public works spending, additional measures to
support the stock market were included. On the demand side, additional
public investment was allotted to be invested freely in the stock market,
while, on the supply side, financial institutions were 'guided' not to sell
shares.
New offers of former government owned companies, such as Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone and JR East, were also suspended.
The government decided to allocate Y1,120bn this year in addition to the
initially planned Y5,680bn of public funds for investment.
There will no limits on equity investments for Y2,280bn of the allocation
and, in addition, that Y2,280bn will be managed on a five-year basis rather
than the usual one year, easing pressure on fund managers to produce
short-term returns.
However, while hopes of new demand have added to this week's bullishness it
is unlikely that the public funds will pour into the equity market.
Mr Kaoru Shimura, head of public pension fund management at Sumitomo Life,
says: 'We will buy at dips, but we already have 15 per cent in the equity
market, and we are not in a rush.'
At the end of last March, funds of health and welfare ministry pensions, the
postal savings system, and post office life insurance invested into the
stock market totalled Y5,990bn, although the maximum amount allowed was
Y11,000bn.
Investment management for public funds has been among the most conservative
in Japan, and strategists point out that while the government's increase in
allocation boosts the potential of funds into the stock market, it will not
mean aggressive buying by managers of public funds.
'The government is not saying that we should put the money into the equity
market and lose it,' says Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew.
Mr Chudler estimates that on the basis of past allocations by fund managers,
some Y1,700bn will flow into the market during the current fiscal year to
next March.
Meanwhile, the main question is whether share prices have further to rise.
The halt on share sales and the increase in buyers has created a temporarily
artificial environment for the stock market.
While hopes that the government will solve the problems of the banking
industry is currently lifting prices, analysts point out that such
expectations are dangerous.
Mr Tasker at Kleinwort Benson points out that the government is delaying the
surfacing of problems, rather than solving them, allowing time for banks to
recover until the economy picks up. 'It's wrong to think that the bad debt
problems will immediately disappear,' he says.
In terms of share price valuation, stocks also look unattractive. The market
is currently trading at a price/earnings ratio of 50 times, and with the
outlook for corporate earnings still weak, the potential for further gains
may be limited. 'It's hard to find buyers at the 19,000 to 20,000 level,'
says Mr Chudler.
For the current year to next March, Nomura Research Institute, the research
division of Nomura Securities, yesterday revised down its corporate earnings
outlook for 1,400 companies, including financials. It estimates that pre-tax
profits will fall by 17.9 per cent instead of the initial 10 per cent
forecast, due to a worse-than-expected fall in consumer spending.
Even if economic fundamentals improve, analysts point out that a sustained
rise in share prices will not be achieved without a change in the nature of
the market, which is currently oriented around capital gains.
Since over 70 per cent of the shareholders are institutions, who do not gain
from increased dividends due to the tax system, companies have been
reluctant to raise dividends.
On the long term, it will be hard to achieve a stable market recovery
without the participation of individual investors.
However, with the current yield on the Nikkei around 0.8 per cent, and other
fixed income products offering around 4 per cent, it will be hard to
convince individual investors to invest.

FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lose headway on
Italian, US blows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES turned down again in the course of yesterday, reflecting a lack of
buying enthusiasm, the Italian discount rate increase and the US jobless
figures, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS remained volatile although traders were encouraged by what was felt to
be a strong performance from President Francois Mitterrand during Thursday
night's televised debate on Maastricht. Some analysts said that the current
view was that the referendum, which opened officially for campaigning
yesterday, would result in a Yes vote.
The CAC-40 swung between a day's high of 1,803 and a low of 1,751 before
settling to close 1.48 lower at 1,778.98, but 5.4 per cent stronger on the
week.
Corporate news provided a number of features with Euro Disney and Carrefour
both prominent. Shares in the theme park operator were boosted in early
trade on news of better-than-expected attendance figures but later fell back
after Paribas in London said that it had reiterated its sell recommendation.
Euro Disney shares, which had seen FFr88.00 early on, fell back to FFr77.50
before bargain hunters stepped in, bringing the shares up 10 centimes on the
day to FFr82.00. Volume was heavy at 745,000 shares.
Trading in Carrefour was suspended at FFr2,300, down FFr179 or 7.2 per cent
ahead of an announcement from the group after the market had closed. There
were rumours, later substantiated, that the retailer would report a serious
decline in first half earnings, and that Mr Michel Bon had resigned as
chairman.
MILAN moved from in-session stability, with the Comit index 0.08 higher at
371.51 (if 5.6 per cent down on the week) into further decline in the post
bourse. The MIB all-share index was an indicated 1.8 per cent lower in the
later afternoon, following the 1.75 percentage point lift in the Bank of
Italy's discount rate to 15 per cent.
Fiat fixed L102 firmer at L3,873, then tumbled L258 to L3,615 on the kerb.
Pirelli dropped L65 to L1,074 while the computer company, Olivetti, fell L66
to L1,970 and Mediobanca, having broken through technical support at L10,000
earlier this week, shed another L495 to L8,600.
FRANKFURT showed some deterioration in the post bourse, but damage had
already been done when the DAX index closed just 5.75 higher at 1,536.50,
nine points off its high and 1.4 per cent higher on the week. Turnover rose
from DM4.3bn to DM4.9bn.
Dealers said that a further fall in west German industrial orders had added
to mounting evidence of a stagnating economy and built up the pressure on
the downside, but that more significant pressure had come on talk of a
substantial earnings downgrade for Volkswagen by Morgan Stanley.
VW dropped DM4.20 to DM315.80 on the day, and was quoted at DM314 in London
later. In steels, Thyssen suffered from talk of a downgrade by another
securities house, and closed DM6.90 lower at DM196.50; dealers said that
investors dumped Thyssen, and bought Mannesmann which closed DM5.50 higher
at DM238.00.
AMSTERDAM fell back slightly, in line with the weaker dollar. The CBS
Tendency index slipped 0.4 to 109.9, marginally lower on the week.
Impressive results from Elsevier early in the session lifted sentiment as
its first half figures exceeded most analysts' forecasts. Its shares closed
Fl 2.60 firmer at Fl 112.20.
Heineken closed 70 cents up at Fl 172.70 ahead of its interim results,
announced after the close.
BRUSSELS managed a slight gain ahead of the weekend. The Bel-20 index rose
3.5 to 1,070.36, up 0.7 per cent on the week.
Petrofina advanced BFr110 to BFr8,670 while Solvay went against the trend,
closing BFr125 lower at BFr11,750 with some 2,850 shares traded.
Delhaize put on BFr6 to BFr1,500 before announcing a 3.6 per cent rise in
first half profits, after the close.
MADRID was distinguished by its relative calm, the general index closing
0.12 higher at 216.42 and consolidating a rise of 5.3 per cent on the week.
Nordic markets were volatile, COPENHAGEN featuring a fall of another DKr5 to
DKr59 in East Asiatic in a continued reaction last week's loss announcement
as the CSE index rose 2.82 to 271.75. Meanwhile, Aker remained OSLO's latest
open wound, the A falling NKr2.5 more to NKr30 in a flat market. Aker closed
40 per cent down on a week which took in a costly costs debacle for its
Norwegian Contractors subsidiary.
VIENNA was firmer with the ATX index gaining 9.32 to 730.53, a 1.8 per cent
rise on the week.
Wienerberger, the building materials supplier, was one of the most active
issues, up Sch100 at Sch3,200.

FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains on stronger
financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG buying of financial stocks pushed up other shares, and the Nikkei
average rose amid active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 168.81 to 18,555.30, rising 3.2 per cent on the
week. After a brief fall to the day's low of 18,425.73 on profit taking,
heavy futures-linked buying and short covering lifted the Nikkei to a day's
high of 18,833.50 before it shed some of its gains on afternoon profit
taking.
Volume rose to 750m shares from 531m. Foreign investors and investment
trusts led the activity, while institutional investors were inactive.
Advances led declines by 700 to 331, while 113 issues remained unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 23.59 to 1,420.38, closing
over the 1,400 level for the first time since March 31. In London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.75 to 1,153.98.
Banks, brokers, and non-life insurers drew active buying. Traders pointed
out that the financial stocks were among the most heavily sold in the
previous market plunge. 'One third is genuine buying but the rest is
investors, such as hedge funds trying to cover short positions,' said one
fund manager.
Industrial Bank of Japan surged Y220 to Y2,990 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced
Y110 to Y2,500. Nomura Securities gained Y130 to Y1,770 and Tokio Marine &amp;
Fire gained Y50 to Y1,290.
Speculative issues eased on profit taking. Meiji Milk Products fell Y20 to
Y1,130 and Green Cross fell Y30 to Y1,740.
NTT also declined Y15,000 to Y605,000 on profit taking, while Isuzu Motors
lost Y4 to Y386 and Nippon Steel retreated Y4 to Y303.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 275.27 to 20,121.50 in volume of 29.4m
shares. The authorities said that the trading volume of stock index futures
in August fell 25 per cent from July, due to new restrictions on quotations.
However, stock index options volume rose 1.7 per cent to post this year's
highest level.
Roundup
THE region produced a limited response to gains in the UK, and in Tokyo.
SYDNEY picked up slightly after four days of losses, the All Ordinaries
index closing 4.0 higher at 1,651.4, down 1.5 per cent on the week, in
turnover up from ADollars 250m to ADollars 291m.
Traders said that the positive tone was set overnight in London, when
ADollars 32m of Australian shares were traded. Among oil and gas producers,
the Santos bid for Sagasco lifted the oil and gas sub-index by 1.1 per cent.
NEW ZEALAND blue chips lifted the NZSE-40 index by 19.84, or 1.4 per cent to
1,491.58, 0.7 per cent higher on the week, as turnover nearly doubled from
NZDollars 14.4m to NZDollars 27.9m. In KUALA LUMPUR, afternoon profit-taking
tempered modest earlier gains on the continued Tokyo rebound, the composite
index ending 3.46 higher at 581.17 for a week's rise of 1.1 per cent.
HONG KONG also saw profit-taking, but this combined with jitters over
China's expression of anger toward Washington's proposed sale of fighter
aircraft to Taiwan to leave the Hang Seng index 14.95 lower at 5,707.51, up
1.4 per cent on the week in turnover down from HKDollars 2.01bn to HKDollars
1.83bn.
SINGAPORE ended softer, the Straits Times Industrial index easing 2.83 to
1,364.88 while MANILA consolidated, the composite index slipping just 0.27
to 1,392.00. Both were fractionally up on the week.
SEOUL had risen nearly 20 per cent since the government's support package on
August 24, but a spate of profit-taking left the composite index 19.86, or
3.7 per cent lower yesterday at 544.08, still 4.9 per cent higher on the
week.
BOMBAY saw heavy investment and speculative buying as the BSE index shot up
86.57, or 2.8 per cent to 3,166.10, mainly on reports that direct equity
investment by foreigners would soon be permitted.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Heavy trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling futures prices gyrated wildly yesterday after the announcement of
poor employment figures upset the bullish mood that had followed the UK
government's announcement of a Ecu 10bn borrowing to support sterling.
In the early morning, the September and December contracts traded up to
89.83 and 89.89 respectively as sterling continued to rally on the foreign
exchanges, rising above the DM2.82 level.
However, the Bank of Italy's announcement that it would raise its discount
rate by 1.75 percentage points to defend the ailing lira further highlighted
that the UK is the one country in the exchange rate mechanism that has not
altered rates as a means of controlling currency movements. Both contracts
gradually descended to 89.62 and 89.63 at around lunchtime in London.
The very bad non-farm payroll figure in the US sharply depressed the dollar
and pushed sterling to a low of DM2.7750. The contracts were therefore
further depressed, reaching lows of 89.56 and 89.54. But they later
rebounded with the currency. The September contract closed 8 basis points
down on the day at 89.70 and the December contract was down 10 basis points
at 89.68.
Trading in the cash market took similar turns. One year money peaked at 10
1/2 per cent following the US employment figure but later closed at 10 7/16
per cent, which was  3/16 per cent down from the previous close. The offered
rate for 3-months money, which is a guide to where the market thinks base
rates are moving, closed softer on the day at 10 3/8 per cent from a
previous close of 10 1/2 per cent.
One discount house trader said that yesterday's moves made it extremely
difficult to trade in the market. 'All you can do is stick to a long term
view and hold to it, though that's difficult right now,' he said. A clearing
bank trader was confident that the gyration were over, however: 'There is a
new confidence in the government's determination to hold sterling at
DM2.95,' he said.
The Bank of England's operations were straightforward. The Bank forecast a
shortage of Pounds 450m and, at lunchtime, bought Pounds 444m of Band 1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar sinks on payroll figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR dropped more than 4 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday within
an hour of the US publishing extremely poor employment figures, writes James
Blitz.
Both the dollar and the pound had enjoyed a spate of strong speculative
European buying in the morning after the UK government's decision to borrow
Ecu 10bn with which to buy sterling on the foreign exchanges. Many dealers
liquidated long D-Mark positions, pushing the dollar to a high of DM1.4385
while sterling rose to DM2.8217.
The release of the August non-farm payroll figure reversed the upward trend
at 13:30 London time. Dealers had been expecting a monthly rise of 150,000,
but there was a fall of 83,000. The US government's summer jobs programme
added 100,000 to the employment total, meaning that the underlying fall in
employment was 183,000.
The dollar plunged, bottoming out at DM1.3940 and closing in London at
DM1.4030, nearly a pfennig down on the day. Sterling fell to a low of
DM2.7950, but rebounded a little, closing unchanged on the day at DM2.8000.
Yesterday's events give dealers every reason to think that the dollar could
dip to a new low against the D-Mark. The payroll figure will put pressure on
the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates further and dealers noted that
the Fed Funds rate, which the US central bank regards as a key indicator for
interest rate policy, fell by 0.25 per cent yesterday to 3 per cent. Mr Paul
Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London,
said the same August payroll figure last year set the dollar on a downward
trend over the following four months.
The dollar's fall also indicated that, whatever policies the Banks of
England and Italy may adopt to defend their currencies, they are partly at
the mercy of the dollar/D-Mark cross. The UK government's Ecu borrowing plan
may stabilise sterling until the French referendum is over. But Mr Mark
Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London,
warned that sterling's recent recovery appeared to be on the back of
speculative selling, and there was little sign of big flows back into the UK
currency from investment funds.
Several dealers speculated on the possibility of a lira devaluation before
the French referendum, after the Bank of Italy raised its discount rate
yesterday by 1.75 percentage points to no avail. The lira closed at L765.0
against the D-Mark despite intervention from several European central banks.
The stock phrase on dealers' lips yesterday was that a devalued lira could
become the 'sacrificial lamb' by which the rest of the EMS signal their
determination not to realign.

stores

<TEXT>
MOST OF the big US retailers saw only modest increases in comparable store
sales during August - further indication of the sluggish recovery in the
economy.
However, a number warned comparisons with August 1991 had been affected by
the relatively late Labor Day this year, which marks the official end of
summer and children's return to school. Some 'back-to-school' spending, it
was suggested, had been pushed into the current month.
'The impact of this calendar shift was most evident in apparel and other
back-to-school merchandise in those sections of the country where school
openings have been delayed,' commented K mart, the large discount retailer.
K mart saw a 1.7 per cent increase during August, with the general
merchandise side posting a 0.6 per cent improvement and the speciality
chains - ranging from the Payless drug stores to Waldenbooks - advancing by
4.7 per cent.
At Woolworth, there was a 2.5 per cent rise in domestic same store sales,
while Sears reported a 3.5 per cent improvement.
Among the big department store groups, Dallas-based J C Penney fared well,
with a 12.4 per cent rise in same store sales in its main division, and a
12.6 per cent gain at its drug store outlets. But at Neiman Marcus, there
was a more restrained 3.9 per cent rise in comparable store sales; at Dayton
Hudson, a flat performance; and at May Department Stores, a 1.2 per cent
decline.
Wal-Mart, the expansion-minded discount chain which is now the nation's
largest retailer, managed a creditable 10 per cent improvement in same store
sales - although even this was slightly below the 12 per cent improvement
seen in the first seven months to end-August. At The Gap, the fashion
retailer, same-store sales gained 6 per cent.

to quit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Cornelissen is stepping down after nine turbulent years as chief
executive of Royal Trust, the Canadian financial institution controlled by
the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family.
The company, which is Canada's second biggest trust company with operations
in Europe and the US, said yesterday that Mr Cornelissen, 49, will leave his
post before its annual meeting next April. He plans to move from Toronto to
Vancouver. A successor will be appointed later.
Mr Cornelissen, a hard-driving South African-born accountant, has been chief
executive since August 1983. After spectacular growth in Europe and the US
under his stewardship during the 1980s, Royal Trust has recently suffered
large loan losses and has been forced to pull in its horns. Its US
subsidiary, Seattle-based Pacific First Bank, is being sold.
The company yesterday heaped praise on Mr Cornelissen. He is widely credited
with breathing new vigour into Royal Trust, which had a reputation for
stodginess before it was taken over by the Bronfmans in the early 1980s.
But questions have been raised in recent years about Mr Cornelissen's
aggressive management style during a period of slower growth and
retrenchment. His two major international acquisitions, of Dow Chemical's
financial services arm in 1986, and of a string of US savings and loan
institutions in 1989/90, have turned out to be costly mistakes.

FT  04 SEP 92 / China tells US to reverse sale of fighters to Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING, JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA lodged one of the strongest protests heard from Beijing in a long time
yesterday in angry response to the decision by President George Bush to
permit the sale of US warplanes to Taiwan for the first time in 10 years.
China accused Washington of being untrustworthy and of violating the Sino-US
joint communique of August 1982, expressing itself 'shocked and outraged'.
The protest threatened China's withdrawal from arms control talks between
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council if the
decision to supply Taiwan with 150 F-16 fighters was not reversed.
Warning of 'a major retrogression' in Sino-US relations, it said this would
have a negative impact on bilateral co-operation in the UN and other
international organisations.
Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said 'the US government should be
held accountable for any serious consequences'.
At a press conference in Jakarta, where he is leading a Chinese delegation
to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he added: 'On the one hand, the
US government is arguing for arms control, but on the other hand it is
selling such sophisticated fighters.'
Mr J. Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador to China, was summoned to the foreign
ministry in Beijing to be told by Liu Huaqiu, vice-foreign minister, that
the decision was a gross interference in China's internal affairs.
The 1982 communique, one of three agreements forming the basis of Sino-US
relations, expresses US intent to 'reduce gradually sale of arms to Taiwan,
leading over a period of time to a final resolution'. Mr Bush helped
negotiate the understand - ing with China a decade ago.
Proponents of the F-16 sale argue that the US has the right to provide
Taiwan with the arms that it needs for its defence.
The sale of US fighter aircraft to Taiwan was blocked during the cold war.
Washington needed China's help as a counterweight to the military strength
of the old Soviet Union. The role of China in this formerly critical balance
has vanished.
China has been strengthening its own military capability, buying Russian
Su-27 fighters and acquiring the right to manufacture the Russian MiG-15.
Taiwan has been unable to upgrade its airforce in the same manner.
China's rebuke to the US is likely to add to its unpopularity in Congress
where its human rights record is under criticism and its most favoured
nation trade status under debate.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Senior accountant is sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been forced to tighten its internal
controls after one of its partners was found by the accountants'
disciplinary committee to have 'misappropriated' more than Pounds 300,000
last year.
Mr Andrew Oakley, a partner in the firm for more than 20 years, has been
dismissed and excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. He was also ordered to pay Pounds 350
costs.
Ernst &amp; Young confronted Mr Oakley in early spring this year, fired him and
referred his case to the institute.
The firm was able to provide proof for the removal of Pounds 300,000 between
January 9 and October 30 last year, although the sums and the dates are
believed to have been more extensive.
Mr Elwyn Eilledge, senior partner, stressed that no client money was
involved. He added that the firm's internal review procedures had been
examined and tightened and said he was 'reasonably confident' it could not
happen again.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Accountants warned of further fall in salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS must expect salaries to continue to fall in the short-term and
little prospect of an upswing in employment over the next few years,
according to a survey by Challoner James, a financial recruitment agency.
London salaries for newly-qualified chartered accountants have fallen by
between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in the last six months into the Pounds
20,000-Pounds 25,000 range.
Salaries for chartered management accountants fell slightly, but held up
more strongly than any other qualification, reflecting the greater relevance
of the degree to many employers.
There was also strong demand for accountants with language skills and for
jobs in credit control, salaries supervision and internal auditing.
Mr Martin Humberstone, Challoner James operations director, dismissed as
'wishful thinking' optimistic projections that the falling graduate intake
would lead to renewed demand from employers in the mid-1990s.
He said employers were becoming far more selective and increasingly
recognised the need to hire people with sound business experience.
Recruitment firms were still spending considerable time 'rescuing'
newly-qualified chartered accountants hired by companies and struggling
because of a lack of experience, he added.
He said it was common for employers to offer jobs below the advertised
salary because of the intense competition by applicants.
Salaries for existing staff are on average 13 per cent higher than for
equivalents who are newly-hired.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Government faces up to training shake-up: Lisa Wood looks at
pressures on Gillian Shephard as she shapes the future of schemes for
jobless people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MIKE O'REILLY, director of human resources at Wimpey, one of Britain's
biggest construction companies, believes the government should hurry up and
decide what it wants from its training scheme for the long term unemployed.
He believes the scheme - Employment Training - is not creating the skilled
workers that Wimpey needs, partly because of the restrictions on who is
eligible.
He is planning a campaign, supported by other building company training
executives, to persuade the government to extend the scheme to all
unemployed people.
Such a campaign is timely. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, will
today begin receiving submissions to her wide-ranging review of government
programmes for the adult unemployed. Under review is ET itself, Employment
Action, the benefit plus temporary work scheme for the long-term unemployed,
and Job Clubs, which the government claims is a cost-effective way of
getting people back to work.
Just how radical the review is will emerge over the next couple of months,
with Mrs Shephard likely to be constrained by political and financial
pressures. She will face calls from Tory backbenchers who want to follow the
US example of Workfare under which only those long-term unemployed
undertaking community work receive benefit.
Civil servants have given Workfare a lukewarm response, not least because it
would be extremely difficult to run sufficient schemes to mop up the large
numbers of people eligible. It is understood that the government has
similarly been backing off the proposal to cut the entitlement to
unemployment benefit from one year to six months.
Providers of training hope that the review will concentrate on quality, to
equip the UK for any upturn in the economy.
But the Department of Employment - like others in Whitehall - is likely to
be subject to funding cuts in the current Public Expenditure Survey. ET will
be the most vulnerable scheme because the other main training programme,
Youth Training, the scheme for those aged 16 to 18, carries a guarantee of a
place to all who want one. It is politically sensitive for the gov-ernment
that this is met. ET carries no such formal guarantee.
As important is the fact that ET is criticised as ripe for reform. Started
in 1988, before the recession, its clients are mainly low-skill individuals
of whom 47 per cent are inner-city residents who worked in the old
manufacturing industries. About 104,000 people are doing ET in England and
Wales.
The scheme's record is poor. Of those completing schemes only 36 per cent go
into jobs or self employment or full-time training and about 30 per cent get
a qualification.
ET is viewed by many of its clients as a government device to get them off
the unemployment register, while many training providers claim they are
unable to give quality training because the Pounds 800m-a-year scheme is
underfunded.
The Unemployment Unit, a research organisation, said that while job entry
rates could be explained partly by the weakness of regional employment
conditions, qualification rates reflected the poor quality of the training
people were receiving.
The 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales, which
administer government funded training schemes, want a freer hand in who they
can train on ET. In their submission to Mrs Shephard they are expected to
point to a range of alternatives, such as varying periods of training for
different groups depending on their needs. Short intensive courses could
assist skilled individuals recently made unemployed. More disadvantaged
people could have longer training than at present.
Last week G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent the views of Tecs
to government, made it clear that further cuts to their training budgets
were unacceptable. It is likely, however, that if asked to make funding
choices they would opt to have fewer people trained but to a higher quality.
Mr Stuart Bishell, managing director of Astra Training, which took over the
former government Skillcentres and which is the largest provider of ET
training, said: 'We want the focus of government spending on training to be
on those people who are most likely to benefit from it most rapidly.'
Such a move is being considered by the Department of Employment. Mrs
Shephard could argue that in return for cash constraints the Treasury should
allow Tecs greater freedom of choice and allow her department to negotiate
targets. Tecs for example could be paid varying amounts for training
different groups.
But the Treasury wants the existing rules on ET eligibility tightened, not
relaxed. At present Tecs are only allowed to put other groups on ET after
satisfying demand from the long-term unemployed.
Another option being considered by the government is to expand Employment
Action. EA, set up a year ago, is cheaper than ET but has not been a great
success. At present about 23,000 out of 30,000 places are filled. Whether
this scheme could be expanded without some element of compulsion is
debatable.
Tecs would certainly like greater ability to mix and match programmes to
meet the needs of their catchment areas - but not if that means less funding
for training. It is a demand that government will find hard to meet.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Lib Dems outline plan for greater UN powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations should be given the power to intervene in countries'
domestic affairs, as part of a thorough-going reform of its working, the
Liberal Democrats said yesterday.
Sir David Steel, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, said the criticisms
made of the UN over its role in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia
reflected the unwillingness of the international community to consider
changes to nations' attitudes to sovereignty following the end of the cold
war.
'The UN as an organisation has never lived up to the dreams of its founders
nor to its charter,' he said at the launch of Beyond The Nation State, a
document to be discussed at the party's annual conference later this month.
The paper envisages the more systematic development of a range of sanctions
against countries which breach criteria on, for instance, human rights and
the environment. The UN is urged to improve its information gathering and
set up a permanent peacekeeping force.
The paper proposes that Japan should become a member of the Security Council
and that in due course the French and British membership should be replaced
by a single European Community seat.
Sir David said that if the UN was going to be more effective 'you have got
to allow a supra-national authority to invade national authority'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday decided to take Dollars 27m (Pounds 13.5m)
from unspent development funds to pay for Belgian paratroopers who will help
protect UN relief operations in Somalia.
The controversial decision, adopted despite misgivings by the UK presidency
of the EC, is intended to ensure that aid committed to Somalia gets past
local warlords and reaches the starving.
Commission officials say it is the first time the EC has financed troops in
an aid operation, and that this precedent means the EC can be more flexible
in responding to such disasters in the future.
The UK was planning to oppose this use of development funds, which required
the unanimous support of the 12. But, said one EC official, the British
'were left out on a limb, so they shut up.'
A UK official conceded that the 'fall-out is likely to be in looking at
other aid delivery programmes in more flexible ways than the small print
traditionally allows.'

FT  04 SEP 92 / Israel plans structural reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first budget by Israel's Labour-led government will contain no radical
departures from the policies of the previous coalition ousted in the June
election.
But the finance ministry said it was drawing up an extensive accompanying
package of structural reforms which, with the 1993 budget plans, could help
produce the long-term growth promised by Labour.
The ministry's Shk98bn (Pounds 20.4bn) budget proposal, in 1992 prices, is
almost Shk5bn less than expected this year, thanks mainly to a sharp fall in
Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, an associated cut in
housing plans - including Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -
and lower debt servicing costs.
Labour's promise to channel greater investment to development projects is
reflected in a 26 per cent increase in infrastructural spending to
Shk1.45bn. But the plan avoids cuts in social and defence spending which
together account for more than Shk40bn. The budget deficit is projected at
3.2 per cent of gross domestic product.
Details of the reform package have not been released, but officials said it
would include tax reforms, liberalisation of the capital markets, breaking
existing monopolies in telecommunications, transport and agricultural
marketing, loosening the state's grip on land sales and extending import
liberalisation.

A SPOKESMAN for United Auto Workers (UAW) yesterday said progress was being
made in the trade union's talks with General Motors (GM) over the Ohio
strike that has affected more than 30,000 GM workers.
Mr Reg McGhee, the UAW official, said a settlement was not yet in sight, but
the union was cautiously optimistic the talks were moving forward after a
separate agreement was reached yesterday between GM and the UAW over health
and safety issues at a Lordstown car assembly plant.
Talks have been under way since August 28, when some 2,300 workers went on
strike over job security and related issues at a crucial metal-stamping
plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Although the latest accord will not affect the
strike at the metal-stamping plant - the source of the broader shutdown -
the UAW official called it 'a positive step'.
The strike at the metal-stamping plant resulted in GM's decision to shut
down production at a series of car assembly plants around the US. A total of
32,500 additional workers - out of GM's total US hourly workforce of 300,000
 -have been affected so far.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Bush backs indexing of capital gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration yesterday said that President George Bush would ask
Congress to approve cutting capital gains tax by indexing gains for
inflation.
Mr Bush had hoped to boost the lagging economy by announcing the indexation
of capital gains by presidential order, without seeking a legislative change
from Congress.
However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater yesterday said Mr Bush had
been advised by the Justice Department that the president needed to ask
Congress before changing the tax law.
'We are disappointed that the opinion concludes that neither the president
nor the treasury secretary nor the commissioner of the IRS (Internal Revenue
Service) has the authority to act to revise the IRS regulations,' Mr
Fitzwater said in a statement.
Right-wing Republicans both in Congress and in the administration had for
some time been urging Mr Bush to order the indexation, which would, they
argued, have brought both political and economic benefits by offering a
stimulus to investment, and simultaneously picking a fight with Congress.
Mr Bush has repeatedly, though weakly, sought a cut in the capital gains tax
rate from Congress, but has been rebuffed by Democrats, led by Senator
George Mitchell, who argue that it would favour only the rich.
Mr Fitzwater yesterday said that 'the president believes that such indexing
of cost would be sound economic policy - and would be sound as a matter of
fairness.'
Earlier this year, the House of Representatives backed a proposal for
indexing future capital gains as part of a Dollars 90bn tax reform package,
but the bill was vetoed by President Bush because it also included an
increase in the income tax rate levied on richer taxpayers.
Indexation is reported to have been revived by Mr James Baker, the former
secretary of state, when he returned to the White House in an attempt to
salvage Mr Bush's re-election campaign.

<TEXT>
A FEDERAL judge in Washington has been asked to order the Abu Dhabi
government to hand over shares of First American Bankshares, the US bank
illegally controlled by the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International (BCCI).
The unusual legal wrangle was instigated by lawyers acting for Mr Harry
Albright, the independent trustee appointed last June after the Federal
Reserve Board ordered that First American be sold. This move came after BCCI
admitted its guilt in secretly controlling First American.
Mr Albright said the court action was 'essential' and followed 'long and
continuous negotiations' that failed to persuade Abu Dhabi to hand over the
shares.
Mr Sandy Martin, a partner at the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and
Blow, representing Abu Dhabi, said the First American shares had been
registered in Mr Albright's name. However, some of the shares are held by
Abu Dhabi as security on a Dollars 9.5m loan, 'we believe that unless we are
told otherwise by a court it is our obligation to retain possession of the
certificates', he said.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind 71% advance at T&amp;N
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRUITS of investment in the US and cost-cutting showed through in T&amp;N's
71 per cent increase in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 34.7m,
in the six months to end-June.
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of the motor components and
engineering group, said it was considering a German acquisition.
Opportunities were arising as previously expensive companies fell into
losses. 'The time to buy is when people want to sell,' he said.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 712m (Pounds 699m). The main reason
for the profits advance was a better operating margin of 8.4 per cent, up
from 7.1 per cent, before exceptional costs of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 6.8m) for
job cuts and plant closures.
Profit after the exceptionals rose to Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 42.8m). The
pre-tax figure was struck after Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.3m) of payments
related to asbestos claims and interest costs of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds
16.6m). Earnings per share of 4p (2.82p) just covered the maintained interim
dividend of 3.6p.
In the US, where T&amp;N paid nearly Pounds 100m (and brought in Pounds 90m
debt) for JPI two years ago, operating profit jumped from Pounds 6.3m to
Pounds 12m on flat turnover of Pounds 168m (Pounds 164m).
In the UK, the benefits of cost-cutting pushed up operating profit from
Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 20.7m on sales of Pounds 273m (Pounds 275m). Mr Hope
stressed the importance of UK earnings in the face of advance corporation
tax rules that penalised international companies. The tax rate fell below 48
per cent in the first half compared with 55 per cent for 1991.
Although the continental profit figure looked disappointing at Pounds 6.2m,
down from Pounds 7.4m, it was depressed by redundancy costs in Germany and a
six week strike at an Italian factory.
Profits from the rest of the world rose by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 15.5m.
Interim net debt stood at Pounds 180.6m (Pounds 188.8m), gearing of 33.5 per
cent.
COMMENT
It has been much easier to appreciate T&amp;N's industrial strategy of building
up an international auto engineering group than its record on earnings per
share and returns on cash outlay. It has managed to sustain capital spending
at Pounds 80m to Pounds 100m a year, increase research and development, take
heavy rationalisation costs and maintain an uncovered dividend. Something
would have to give - and shareholders have often done so through rights
issues. The crucial link between the industrial strategy and the profit and
loss account - cutting costs to achieve international competitiveness - has
delivered some good news. Even so the 10.85p total dividend looks set to be
uncovered again this year, assuming a pre-tax profit approaching Pounds 70m.
The prospective p/e is about 17 after yesterday's 9p rise in the share price
to 136p. A yield of nearly 11 per cent offers support, although the
distribution level continues to invite some criticism. A German acquisition
of, say, Pounds 100m would weigh down the balance sheet and raise the
spectre of a rights issue as soon as the share price registered significant
gains.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood turns in IPounds 5.8m
loss

WATERFORD Wedgwood reported pre-tax losses increased from IPounds 2.04m to
IPounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.47m) in the opening half of 1992 and warned that the
full-year results would include further rationalisation costs.
Turnover at the luxury ceramics and crystal manufacturer remained stable at
IPounds 130m, a 5 per cent drop on the ceramics side to IPounds 87.9m being
offset by a 16 per cent lift in crystal sales to IPounds 31.3m.
Profit before interest and tax at Wedgwood fell to IPounds 1.47m (IPounds
3.2m), while Waterford's losses increased to IPounds 3.23m (IPounds 2.1m).
'Unabsorbed overheads' related to further short-time working at the
Waterford plant were blamed for the higher losses there.
Mr Richard Barnes, chief financial officer, said recessionary conditions in
the UK and Japanese markets were largely responsible for the decline in
ceramics sales.
Improved conditions in the Irish market and the introduction of the
machine-cut Marquis range of crystal improved the division's sales.
Effective hedging minimised the impact of a decline in the dollar, and the
group was 'well covered' into 1993.
Last month Mr Paddy Galvin, chairman and chief executive of Waterford
Crystal, announced plans for 500 redundancies out of the division's
workforce of 1,900. He said yesterday: 'I cannot say that it is the end of
the road for redundancies. We have a deeply held belief that we should
continue manufacturing at Waterford, provided we can do so economically. If
it is not competitive then we cannot'.
He said the Marquis range 'has met all our expectations and is making
profits' but he declined to reveal what proportion of sales now came from
the imported ware.
Mr Donald Brennan, group chairman, anticipated difficult trading conditions
throughout 1992 which would necessitate 'continued short-time working and
restructuring in both the Wedgwood and Waterford Crystal businesses during
the second half of the year.'
Losses per share were 0.91p (0.45p). Again there is no dividend.

Armour Trust, confectionery maker and supplier of car accessories, announced
pre-tax profits slightly down from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 1.46m for the year
to April 30.
The fall reflected a 6 per cent decline in the contribution from the
automotive division. Confectionery reported record operating profits, the
company said.
Earnings per share were 3.9p (4.1p) and the proposed final dividend is
1.1735p (1.1175p) for a 1.4885p (1.4175p) total.
The shares are traded on the over-the-counter market.

Against a background of continuing strong market pressure, Nestor-BNA, the
international healthcare and specialist personnel group, reported a 12 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits in the first half to June 12.
The decline from Pounds 2.39m to Pounds 2.11m was on sales down 5 per cent

The company said that BNA, the UK nursing agency side, had benefited from
the restructuring in 1991 and its operating profits rose 40 per cent to

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at Thomas Jourdan amounted to Pounds 874,000 in the first
half of 1992, against Pounds 595,000. The latest figure was struck after
exceptional reorganisation charges of Pounds 290,000.
The group makes and markets consumer goods, including trouser presses,
fireplaces, furniture and cosmetic accessories. Further steps were taken to
reorganise, which meant more redundancies and costs; for the year overall,
reorganisation costs were expected to be less than the Pounds 539,000 of
1991.
Turnover for the half year fell to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 11.2m). However, due
to the seasonal nature of the business a significantly larger part of
turnover and profit is earned in the second half.
Losses per share came to 3.75p (2.21p). The interim dividend is again 0.5p.

Edmond Holdings, a housebuilder, moved into a loss of Pounds 22,000 in the
first half of 1992.
The group said its underlying strength enabled an interim dividend to be
paid, although it is cut from 0.65p to 0.35p. Losses per share were 0.03p

Turnover came to Pounds 6.44m (Pounds 7.3m) from completed sales of 116

963,000. Pre-tax profit in 1991 was Pounds 856,000.
Mr Andrew Naish, chairman, said sales and reservations for the year to date
totalled 188, compared with 270 last time.

<TEXT>
DESPITE higher turnover and reduced interest charges, Vinten Group saw
pre-tax profit fall by 8 per cent, from Pounds 4.67m to Pounds 4.29m, in the
first half of 1992.
The group supplies camera mounting equipment and systems to the
broadcasting, video, photographic and defence markets.
Mr Humphrey Wood, chairman, said trading profits in the broadcast and
photographic divisions rose 9 per cent to Pounds 4.23m, from sales of Pounds
22.2m (Pounds 19.9m), assisted by the contribution from Bexel, acquired late
last year. Offsetting that, profits from the surveillance and electro-optic
sides decreased by Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 620,000, on turnover of Pounds
14.3m (Pounds 11.3m).
Mr Wood pointed out that the 1991 results were influenced by defence work
accelerated by the Gulf war.
Earnings per share were 8.8p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is 1.9p
(1.8p).
Vinten is acquiring Gitzo Holding for FFr27.2m (Pounds 2.9m), of which
FFr26.1m will be in cash. Gitzo makes photographic video and television
tripods, and produced a pre-tax profit of FFr900,000 on turnover of FFr30.5m
in 1991. At the year-end net assets were FFr6.6m.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden falls by a third
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON BOWDEN, the housebuilder, estimated that it had earned almost 8 per
cent of this year's expected turnover in 48 hours last month as buyers
rushed to beat the deadline for the re-imposition of stamp duty.
The rush came too late to benefit pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992
which fell by a third from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 10.3m leaving earnings per
share 35 per cent lower at 8.9p. Turnover fell from Pounds 65.4m to Pounds
62.2m.
Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive of the Leicester-based group,
said the group had shown resilience in difficult conditions; the interim
dividend is maintained at 2.5p.
It had made a good start to the second half mainly due to the rush to beat
the ending of the eight month stamp duty holiday on August 19. Mr Wilson
said: 'In two days we sold 100 homes worth about Pounds 8m. It is too early
to say whether this will mean that there will be compensatory dip in
September sales which would normally be expected to rise after the school
holidays.'
Housing profits in the first half fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds
12m) despite selling 643 homes, only 7 fewer than in the comparable period.
Mr Wilson blamed a 5 per cent drop in the average price of its houses from
Pounds 80,000 to Pounds 75,700 for a fall in margins from 22 per cent to 16
per cent.
Mr Wilson said that trading conditions, instead of improving after the
general election, had worsened. As a result the group no longer expected to
sell 1,600 houses this year.
'I shall be satisfied if we sell 1,300, the same as last year. At the moment
we are running slightly ahead of achieving that target.'
He said profits of Pounds 3m from commercial property sales of Pounds 13.5m,
compared with Pounds 3.8m on turnover of Pounds 13.8m, was a good result
given the general decline in the property market.
In the past 12 months the group had increased its housing land bank by
almost 30 per cent to 8,400 plots with planning permission using the
proceeds from last year's Pounds 34.1m rights issue. It had also acquired
200 acres of land for commercial and industrial development around
Leicester.
At the end of June the group had net debt of Pounds 19m, subsequently
reduced to Pounds 8m, compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 163m.
The shares, which had fallen by 10 per cent in three days trading this week,
yesterday recovered 22p to 248p.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur regains its confidence in Ratners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCALIBUR GROUP, the jewellery manufacturer and engineer, said yesterday
that it was now happy to supply Ratners, the jewellery retailer which
announced large losses and new banking agreements last month.
Mr Michael Griffiths, chairman of Excalibur, was speaking after he announced
that he and other members of the management of the company had bought 2.8m
Excalibur shares.
He said the group was 'much happier' about supplying Ratners 'now that
banking support is in place'. Suppliers had been wary of selling to Ratners
fearing bad debts, and this could have put a constraint on the retailer in
the run up to Christmas.
About 13 per cent of Excalibur's jewellery sales go to Ratners, a proportion
that had declined from more than 20 per cent. But Mr Griffiths said that he
would now consider doing more business with Ratners if asked. He said
Ratners was 'paying us superbly'.
Mr Griffiths said that in the consumer division generally the group had 'to
be mindful of what exposure we have' to retailers. However, business was
better in engineering activities.
The Excalibur shares were bought at 8p, well below yesterday's market price
of 13p. Rowe &amp; Pitman, the broker, organised the sale to the Excalibur
management of a large institution's holding.
Mr Griffiths bought 1.2m of the shares, taking his stake to 10.9 per cent.
Mr Richard Griffiths, his brother and managing director, bought 500,000
shares giving him 1.8 per cent. Mr Andrew Leach, finance director, bought
63,000 shares.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Crisis of confidence' in land
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FARM LAND values have fallen by at least 10 per cent since the beginning
of the year, according to a survey carried out by Farmland Market magazine
and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The survey, published today, suggests there is a crisis of confidence in the
market. It cites the recession and the effects of reforms to the European
Community's common agricultural policy, as well as the pressure on people
who have lost money at Lloyd's of London. 'Few whole farms have changed
hands and many are proving unsaleable,' the survey says.
The market in the south-east of the country has virtually ground to a halt,
with prices dropping by up to 30 per cent over the last year. The prices for
quality land in Hereford and Worcester are sharply down, and the
Cambridgeshire market is suffering from poor soil quality.
However, there is still demand for good quality dairy land in Scotland and
the north-west of England, the report suggests.
'Whereas dairy farmers may have the confidence to buy land, arable farmers
are holding back. With few really good medium-sized farms on the market,
potential vendors are showing the same reluctance to commit themselves,'
said Mr Martin Lowry of the RICS.
However, Mr James Laing, a partner in Strutt &amp; Parker, the land agents, said
it was ridiculous to suggest that the UK land market was in crisis. Owners
had taken on board the decline in the market and adjusted prices
accordingly. 'We have sold a considerable number of farms this summer across
the whole country,' he said.
A recent report from Dreweatt Neate, land agents in central southern
England, said there was 'a naive attitude' that any farm on the market was a
result of a forced sale. This was affecting values for properties made
available through retirement, death and business changes.
But it suggested demand remained reasonable, 'considering the poor market.
Where purchases are agreed, with only a few exceptions, negotiations tend to
be protracted and difficult.'

FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Curing communism's farming
blight - Russia's reforming agriculture minister talks to Leyla Boulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S AGRICULTURE minister, Mr Viktor Khlystun, came to office last
November with a mission to reform Russian agriculture. But far too much of
his time is still taken up with day-to-day management of the moribund
farming system build up over seven decades of communist rule.
Although he has no concrete results to show for it, he says market reforms
begun in January have already changed people's psychology. 'You don't need
to chase drunk tractor drivers around any more,' he says. 'But what is
happening now is only the beginning: to talk of the effectiveness of reform
so far is premature.'
Despite the familiar scramble to 'save' the harvest, which according to the
minister will improve to about 96m tonnes of grain, he is confident that
there will be no hunger in Russia this winter as scare-mongers at home and
abroad like to predict.
'We can't sell what is produced. We have 300,000 tonnes of meat in cold
store. Consumption per head will fall compared to last winter, but only
because of a drop in the population's purchasing power (following price
liberalisation in January)' he says.
His very early estimate is that Russia will have to import 17m tonnes of
grain in 1992-93 on top of 3m tonnes already committed by the neighbouring
former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
But this 46-year-old former land-use specialist has made it a very definite
priority over the next year to alter the structure of imports to increase
the share of protein feed so that less imported and domestic grain is wasted
on feeding livestock.
He also wants to encourage domestic farmers to grow more soyabeans and
lupins, which are the components of more economical protein feed.
The balance-sheet of what has actually changed in Russian agriculture over
the past year remains modest.
The poor storage, processing, transport, and distribution systems,
identified by a World Bank report as accounting for the loss of a third of
what is produced, are only just beginning to be tackled. Although he makes
no attempt to hide the short-comings, Mr Khlystun says in his own defence
that 'you cannot create a new storage system in eight months'.
His task in this instance is complicated by the fact that the government is
trying to build up domestic capacity to manufacture storage facilities
rather than purchase ready-made storage complexes offered by foreign
companies. And as long as privatisation is slow and de-monopolisation is
absent, the distribution of food is likely to remain chaotic.
The minister bemoans the fact that proper wholesale markets are still
lacking.
As an example of what is going wrong, Mr Khlystun points to the situation in
the far north Arkhangelsk region, where meat processing capacity is worked
flat out but state trading organisations are not bringing meat into the
shops because of a lack of incentive to sell it.
Despite a series of negotiations with foreign companies, foreign investment
in new processing and distribution capacity has not materialised, not to
mention capital from Russian business sources.
With food processing declared a priority for the government's attempts to
institute an industrial policy next year, Mr Khlystun says financial
incentives will also be on offer although nothing has materialised yet.
Parliament has continued to block legislation allowing the free purchase and
sale of land. But, apart from calling for 'more explanatory work' to win
over recalcitrant deputies under the control of a powerful old state farming
lobby, Mr Khlystun says that a presidential decree is being prepared to set
up a land bank system that will allow the use of land as collateral.
Although Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi was recently given the task of
overseeing agricultural reform, the bulk of the responsibility and the funds
for it remain under the control of the agriculture ministry.
Asked to help one of the thousands of private farmers trying to make it in a
hostile environment, Mr Khlystun was able to demonstrate that the central
government still has some clout in the provinces despite the erosion of the
old administrative-command system. Everybody from the district
administration boss to the two chiefs of the local farming association and
an assistant to the regional governor showed up to sort out the farmer's
problems on the day I visited the the farm.
But there are thousands of other farmers who remain at the mercy of local
authorities which may or may not enforce central government reforms, and of
semi-official organisations who may or may not be honest in transferring
state credits for private farming.
Although he once admitted at a news conference to being embarrassed whenever
he was driven past poorly-stocked food shops, Mr Khlystun finds some comfort
in the long-term view. He believes the reforms will succeed in making
Russian farming more efficient and vastly improve food supplies - but it may
take ten to 12 years.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Shaikhislamov faces up to
his American dream - An exchange visit that is proving something of a
culture shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MR Artur Shaikhislamov, a Russian poultry unit engineer, arrived in
Iowa on a farmer-to-farmer exchange programme in early July, he was stunned
by what he saw. American agricultural technology was impressive enough, but
that was not what really wowed him. He was amazed by the trust between
people and their sense of personal responsibility.
'How can people trust each other in this country? How can they make
agreements? We can't trust people. It's not their property. It doesn't
matter for them how good their work is,' says Mr Shaihislamov.
This kind of market economy culture shock is the least tangible but perhaps
the most crucial result of a farmer exchange that is being run by the Center
for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University in Ames,
Iowa. The programme, in its second year, is at present playing host to ten
agricultural practitioners - farmers, agricultural engineers and
agribusiness executives - from Russia, Ukraine and the Central Asian
Republic.
The programme, which also sends Americans to the former Soviet Union, is
designed to provide links between Americans in the farming business and
citizens of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic states who
are dedicated to agricultural reform and establishing private agribusiness.
It has received financial support from the US Information Agency, the state
of Iowa and the university. It is also receiving assistance from several US
farmers' groups, including the National Farmers' Organization.
On the CIS and Baltics side, support has come from various state governments
and their agrarian academies, national spin-offs from the old Soviet Lenin
All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences.
Last year, 25 people from the CIS and the Baltics came to the US and 25
Americans returned the visits. This year, the exchange has risen to 40 from
each side. The university intends to continue the programme and foresees
useful cross-fertilisation with some of its other activities, such as
research exchanges and a new programme to establish agribusiness
demonstration centres in the CIS.
While it would seem peculiar that Americans would want to assist those who
might one day become some of their fiercest competitors in international
agricultural trade, the farmers involved in the programme seem to want to
play a part, however small, in burying the Cold War and helping those, who
while they might compete in some areas of trade, could also one day be good
customers.
Mr DeVere Noakes, a farmer who offered to host a Soviet farmer, puts it this
way: 'I firmly believe if we are ever to solve international
misunderstandings it will be done at the common person's level. For people
everywhere have the same basic desire we do; to have a family, make a
living, be safe from harm and live peacefully'.
Mr William Meyers of ISU says that while some American farmers object to
lending a helping hand abroad many others believe that by cultivating
relationships with countries that are developing their agricultural
businesses they will able to hatch some eventual commercial ties. They also
believe that if they do not foster such links, others, particularly the
Europeans, will.
The programme has already born commercial fruit. One joint venture has
sprung from the 1991 exchange.
While it may seem inappropriate that CIS and Baltic farmers be exposed to
high technology farming (when it is unlikely that they will be able to
replicate such methods, at least in the near future), Mr Meyers does not
think this will be a source of frustration for them when they return.
He emphasises that far more important than technology - about which many are
fairly sophisticated, even if they cannot afford to buy it - is learning
about farm management decision-making.
While their technical knowledge may be good, seeing how decisions are made
about costs, prices and how to come out ahead in earnings is more valuable,
says Mr Meyers.
Mr Shaikhislamov, who is the chief engineer at the Sredneuralskaya poultry
enterprise near Sverdlovsk in the Russian region of Yekaterinburg, is living
his dream. He taught himself English through two years of night study so
that he might one day be able to travel to see western agricultural methods.
His hosts are Mr Craig Herrig and his wife Cathy, who with Mr Herrig's
brother and sister-in-law run two turkey farms. The four Herrigs produce
350,000 tonnes of meat a year; Mr Shaikhislamov's enterprise produces
750,000 tonnes a year with 500 people. Most of those, admittedly, work in
the hatchery, feedmill and a slaughterhouse, but Mr Shaikhislamov says that
some 100 people work in the raising segment, which is comparable with the
Herrigs' operation.
The Herrigs, who say they volunteered to host a Russian visitor because it
would be 'fun and educational', are often bewildered by what they are
learning of thew inefficiency of Russian poultry production. The American
family does not farm as an independent producer but works on contract
raising turkeys for a large poultry processor. This type of scheme has given
a whole new set of ideas to their guest.
But the older generation is still in charge and minds are resistant to
change. Making money is still regarded as a dirty business.
'I can understand what we can do. I just don't understand how we can
persuade people,' says Mr Shaikhislamov. 'American support would mean a lot
to make the case.' And therein perhaps lies the ultimate value of such an
exchange programme.

<TEXT>
NEWLY-INDEPENDENT former Soviet republics are finding it extremely difficult
to pull apart the defunct empire's highly integrated oil industry, according
a report due to be published next week.
Mr Yevgeny Khartukov, head of the World Energy Analysis and Forecasting
Group, makes this point with 1990-1991 data compiled for each of 15 former
Soviet republics after the Soviet Union's collapse in December.
The figures, to be published by East-West Center, a Honolulu-based
think-tank funded by the US congress, show that 'in spite of the political
situation, all parts of the former Soviet industry are still very
inter-dependent on each other, and this includes not just the have-not
republics'.
Russia, which at the peak of integration in 1990 accounted for 90 per cent
of Soviet crude oil and gas condensate, cannot refine all it produces. That
year and the next Kazakhstan, although it was self-sufficient in crude oil,
had to import Siberian crudes to feed two of its three refineries. Belarus,
Ukraine, Lithuania and Turkmenistan, four other republics which process oil,
accounted for about 16 per cent of refining capacity and had product
surpluses. Three others, which process crude oil from other republics,
Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia could only partly cover their own needs
for liquid fuel, while the remaining six republics - Armenia, Estonia,
Kirgyzia, Latvia, Moldova and Tajikistan are completely dependent on
neighbours with surpluses of refined products.
Mr Khartukov has also updated two scenarios for oil output under attempts to
build a market economy, which he describes respectively as slow
marketisation and economic shock. He believes the oil industry is moving
away from shock therapy to gradual marketisation.
Under the latter scenario, the former Soviet Union would have to begin
importing oil to the tune of 200,000 barrels a day in 1994, with supply at
8m b/d and demand at 8.2m b/d. Under the economic shock option, net exports
would amount to 1.3m b/d, with supply and demand at 7.8m and 6.5m b/d
respectively.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Renewed squeeze pushes zinc
price to 23-month high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC'S PRICE touched its highest level for 23 months on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday but some traders said this was because of a long-running,
options-related technical squeeze rather than any sudden pick-up in demand.
There is concern that a small number of zinc producers and one trader, who
are reported to control about 1m tonnes of annual refined zinc output - or
about 15 to 20 per cent of the western world total - and who previously
squeezed the market in June, are behind the looming supply tightness in the
final quarter of this year.
The LME board is 'closely monitoring' the situation which has once again put
its zinc market into backwardation - where there is a price premium for
metal for immediate delivery. 'The recent intense price volatility is
clearly damaging for most suppliers and users of zinc because of the
uncertainty it generates,' said the Economist Intelligence Unit, in its
recent World Commodity Forecasts report.
However, Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking
group, said that, apart from the squeeze, zinc's price was being supported
by a 'cocktail of stimuli'. These included: labour contract negotiations in
North America this month and next; the fact that zinc consumption had
outpaced production in the first six months of this year; a potential strike
at Centromin in Peru: and, even though LME zinc stocks were at record
levels, producer stocks had fallen by 10 per cent since the end of January.
Mr Moore suggested that there would be only a small supply surplus of zinc
this year - about 60,000 tonnes compared with 140,000 tonnes last year - and
a deficit of 70,000 tonnes in 1993.
Zinc for delivery in three months traded up to Dollars 1,395 a tonne on the
LME yesterday before closing at Dollars 1,394.25, up Dollars 23.75. Cash
zinc closed Dollars 41 up at Dollars 1,445 a tonne. Traders said the next
target for the three-month zinc price was likely to be the resistance
between Dollars 1,400 and Dollars 1,420 a tonne.

Apart from zinc (see above), LME BASE METAL prices remained under pressure,
losing ground as traders feared consumers would be discouraged by a firmer
dollar. The possibility of a rally in the dollar dampening any bargain
hunting interest highlighted the continued fragility of demand from end
users still concerned about low levels of industrial growth in the major
economies, traders said. Comex COPPER futures extended losses by midsession,
with pressure linked to arbitrage trading with London, analysts said. Losses
were limited when the Comex December contract held support above 110.50
cents a lb, which is seen as a major support area. One analyst said sluggish
economies around the world presented a bearish demand outlook for copper,
particularly through the fourth quarter. London COCOA prices regained some
of this week's losses, with dealers citing good trade and industry buying.
The market had absorbed some heavy fund and commission house selling
recently, which looked good for the market, one trader said. But if any news
came out saying crops might be alright, 'it could collapse like a pack of
cards.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce's third-quarter earnings dipped by 7 per
cent, with higher loan loss provisions and expenses offsetting increases in
interest and fee income.
Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 188m (USDollars 157.9m) from CDollars
168m a year earlier. But the bank, which is Canada's second biggest
financial institution and one of the biggest lenders to ailing property
developer Olympia &amp; York, has left its total 1992 loan-loss estimate
unchanged at CDollars 1.75bn.
CIBC wrote off CDollars 1bn in the second quarter to cover expected losses
from O&amp;Y and other problem loans. Earnings fell to CDollars 186m, or 85
cents a share, in the three months to July 31, from CDollars 201m, or 96
cents a share, a year earlier. Return on equity slipped to 12.3 per cent
from 13.4 per cent, and return on assets to 0.57 per cent from 0.67 per
cent. Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 2.7bn on July 31, an increase
of CDollars 282m from the previous quarter. The bank ascribed the rise
mainly to further difficulties in its real-estate portfolio.
The CDollars 1bn second-quarter write-down pushed CIBC to a CDollars 33m
loss for the nine months to July 31. But Mr Al Flood, chairman, said the
bank would report positive earnings for the year as a whole, and would
maintain its quarterly dividend.
Mr Flood, who took over as chairman in June, late yesterday announced nine
new senior management appointments as part of a drive to improve the quality
of CIBC's loan portfolio, focus its business on North America and integrate
its corporate and investment banking divisions.
CIBC is the last Canadian leading bank to report third-quarter earnings. The
others ranged from a 14 per cent improvement at Bank of Montreal to a 57 per
cent fall in net income posted by Royal Bank of Canada.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Austrian oil company slips into
loss in first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian national oil group, blamed a severe recession in the
plastics and chemicals industry as it fell into a pre-tax loss of Sch584m
(Dollars 59.7m) in the six months to June, from a Sch807m profit in the same
period last year.
The loss exceeded forecasts of about Sch500m, and OMV warned it expected a
significant fall in earnings for the full year, although it hoped to end
1992 in profit. Continued low profits from the plastics and chemicals
sectors were expected to be offset by better results from the energy
division.
Mr Wolfgang Ruttensdorfer, chief financial officer, said OMV expected to
return to former levels of profitability in the medium term, and was likely
to maintain its full-year dividend of Sch20 a share.
He added that OMV was launching a cost-cutting programme aimed at saving
Sch1bn a year by 1994.
Staff costs would be reduced through early retirement, natural wastage and a
change in the pensions policy. Capital expenditure would also be cut except
where it relates to OMV's long-term strategy, including plans to secure a
leading position in the oil and gas businesses of central Europe.
First-half turnover this year fell slightly to Sch39.9bn from Sch40.6bn,
with energy accounting for more than three-quarters of this. Profits in the
energy division were Sch305m, with particularly strong results from
exploration and production, and the gas business.
However, slow economic growth and a fall in the price of petrochemical
products led to a loss by the refining business.
The chemicals division made first-half losses of Sch203m, blamed on a
depressed market and competition from cheap imports.
Plastics, however, made the largest loss, at Sch686m, hit by a severe
recession in the polyolefines plastics business.
The Austrian government has plans to merge OMV with the utility
Verbundgesellschaft in a reorganisation of Austria's state-owned industrial
companies, which would create an energy group with turnover of more than
Sch85bn.

AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer active in the US and the Netherlands,
reported a 9 per cent increase in first-half net earnings to Fl 153.3m
(Dollars 93m). However, growth was checked by economic slowdown and the
lower dollar rate in which nearly 50 per cent of sales were denominated.
Turnover advanced 10 per cent to Fl 11.8bn, of which Fl 5.8bn was generated
by the Dutch Albert Heijn supermarket chain where sales advanced 7.1 per
cent. The US operations powered ahead 17.3 per cent, due mainly to last
year's acquisition of the New York-based Tops chain.
Autonomous sales growth in America was put at 3.4 per cent. Six-month
operating profit, excluding income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and
financial costs, was up 10 per cent to Fl 261m.
In the second quarter, operating results fell 5 per cent to Fl 114.8m
against last year but this was counter-balanced by other unconsolidated
income and lower costs and taxes.
Ahold has reiterated its expectation that 1992 net profit will would exceed
the Fl 275.8m of last year, in spite of start-up losses at its new
Czechoslovak operation and slower growth.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Aker executive quits after heavy
write-off

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday
announced the resignation of a senior executive following the disclosure
that the group has written off NKr400m (Dollars 69.3m) against its annual
result.
The write-off relates to engineering changes the group has been forced to
make to a NKr25bn oil platform project being constructed by a subsidiary.
The group's A shares fell NKr7.50 to NKr 32.50 and the B shares dropped NKr
6.50 to Nkr36 following the announcement.
Mr Gregers Kure, president of the group's oil and gas technology division,
who was heavily involved in the Heidrun project - the world's first floating
concrete tension leg platform being built for Conoco Norway - resigned.
In August last year, Aker was forced to take a NKr300m charge against
accounts after a concrete platform it was building sunk in a fjord. Four
months later, the company extended another platform by four metres,
following changes made to specifications by the operator of the project.
Aker said yesterday: 'Preliminary assessments indicate that Norwegian
Contractors (the subsidiary) will record a loss in 1992 of around NKr400m.'
Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's president and chief executive, stressed yesterday that
the group would post a profit in 1992, and would suffer no liquidity
problems as a result of the charge.
Last autumn, Conoco extended the dimensions of the platform which increased
costs of the project by NKr2.1bn to NKr25bn. But this change had been taken
into account when Conoco last December was awarded a NKr2.5bn contract
covering engineering, procurement and construction of the platform.
Mr Oeyvind Kvall, a Conoco Norway spokesman, said that alterations to the
design had also been made last winter, incurring costs of NKr170m which the
two companies agreed to split, but denied that fresh changes had been made.
Industry experts suggest that Aker grossly underestimated the technical
scope of the Heidrun project and that due to the complex, technical nature
of Norway's North Sea oil and gas developments, domestic engineering firms
were being pushed to their limits, and possibly beyond, by the oil
companies.

PHILIPS, the electrical and electronics group, has launched a worldwide
cost-cutting drive aimed at saving 'hundreds of millions of guilders' during
the remaining four months of the year, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
The company declined to specify the precise amount it intends to save, but
said it was likely to be less than one billion guilders.
'It is a general cost-cutting exercise that will take place in all divisions
all over the world,' said Mr Eef Brouwers, a Philips spokesman.
Philips acknowledged that the fresh cost-cutting drive, which comes on top
of a restructuring launched in 1990, was prompted by the depressed state of
many of its markets, particularly consumer electronics from which the
company derived almost half its revenue.
'Economic forecasts are also not so good in many countries that are
important for our business. And there are no signs of a short-term
improvement,' said Mr Brouwers.
Since 1990, the group has tried to change its bureaucratic corporate
culture, improve productivity and revitalise its businesses through a
group-wide restructuring programme known as Operation Centurion.
Last year, the company disposed of non-core businesses which represented Fl
2.2bn (Dollars 1.39bn) in annual sales and involved 10,000 employees. The
exercise led to provisions totalling Fl 73m.
However, Mr Brouwers said the latest cost-cutting exercise would not involve
lay-offs or financial write-offs that might negatively affect the group's
results in the current year.
Philips, which has been struggling to recover from big losses in 1990, last
month reported a fall in second-quarter net profit to Fl 82m from Fl 187m a
year ago.
The company has warned that net profit for the current year will be below
the level of 1991.

report

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank, played down reports yesterday that federal
bank examiners had been critical last month of the management and credit
quality of its mortgage subsidiary, one of the biggest in the US with an
estimated Dollars 24bn of assets.
The criticism, contained in a document dated August 18 and leaked
simultaneously to two US newspapers, accused Citicorp's mortgage operation
of sloppy practices that caused excessive risk to the bank.
According to extracts of the report that were published in the US yesterday,
the examiner found serious issues warranting the attention of senior
management 'in virtually all functional areas' and demanded plans for
corrective action within 30 days.
Citicorp's share price was affected by the reports yesterday, at first
declining by 50 cents and then stabilising at Dollars 16 5/8 , down by
Dollars  3/8 .
The bank released a tersely worded statement yesterday morning, the bulk of
which was devoted to a discussion of the relative legality of US news
organisations receiving and publishing a federal bank examiner's report.
The substantive portion of the Citicorp statement noted that 'if regulators
were requiring us to take material new reserves or restatements, we would
have to disclose that, and we have made no such disclosure'.
The bank said that US mortgage problems 'are not new to our management' and
added that these had been identified and disclosed, and were already being
addressed.
Citicorp also noted that in its 1991 annual report it had said its mortgage
origination activities in the US were restructured and credit criteria for
the US mortgage business 'were reformulated in order to improve the
business's credit performance'.
Citicorp said that for legal reasons it could not comment on 'the content of
what is purported to be a working document of the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency'. A measure of Citicorp's apparent anger at the reports was
the bank's statement that if the two US newspapers actually held the federal
documents 'possession and publication would be illegal.'
The bank added that the report would in any case be 'already outdated as
simply one of many working documents that typically apply to one of our
periodic regulatory audits'.
Citicorp said the information contained in such reports 'is designed to
elicit responses from management and therefore may or may not be entirely
accurate and may not include appropriate context for interpretation by
others'.

CORPORACION Banesto, the holding company for the industrial assets owned by
Banesto, the large Spanish bank, suffered a fall in first-half profits to
Pta2.8bn (Dollars 31m) from Pta19bn in the corresponding period last year.
The result in 1991 was lifted by income of Pta12.8bn from extraordinary
items, most from the sale of its oil refining and distribution subsidiary to
BP. Extraordinary income in the 1992 first half was Pta2.8bn.
Analysts said this year's first-half figures indicated a strong second
quarter by Corporacion Banesto. In the first quarter it lost Pta4.6bn. They
suggested that Corporacion Banesto could be close to achieving its 1991 net
profit of Pta4.5bn.
Banco Central Hispano, Spain's biggest banking group, raised its
consolidated first-half group profits by 9.1 per cent to Pta36.4bn.
Profits from trading were down 6.7 per cent to Pta66.5bn but income from
extraordinary items rose 47 per cent to Pta31.4bn.

FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Widespread gains follow funding plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUOYANT session in UK equities became one of the strongest performances
this year after sterling rallied sharply yesterday afternoon on plans for an
Ecu10bn currency support funding by the British government.
The unexpected move, announced shortly before the important Maastricht
debate on French television, was regarded in the stock market as a sign of a
determined campaign by European political leaders to secure support for the
Maastricht proposals.
The FT-SE Index closed 68.9 up at 2,381.9 after the UK market had joined in
the strong advance across European bourses. The gain in the Footsie was the
largest daily advance since the last day of 1991, with the exception of the
136.2 surge which followed re-election of the Conservative government in
April this year.
Equities had opened higher behind gains in stock markets in Tokyo and New
York. Marketmakers' positions were squeezed as sentiment was also helped by
the absence of any rate move at the Bundesbank's policy meeting, and by a
flow of more satisfactory trading results from UK companies.
The Footsie was already about 35 points up ahead of the UK funding
announcement. Firmness in the dollar encouraged US-orientated stocks and an
early improvement in sterling had eased interest rate fears. But the market
went wild as the Ecu funding, completely unexpected in London, was seen as
an impressive strengthening of sterling's defences.
The leap in share prices following the Treasury announcement reflected
hectic activity by marketmaking firms, which were caught very badly short of
stock and suffered substantial losses. One brave house managed to operate a
trading programme during the excitement. The leading US house with bear
positions in the September contract on the Footsie was badly mauled as the
contract raced in the direction of 2,400.
Traders and analysts alike were stunned by the Ecu funding proposal and it
was some time before the full implications were comprehended. There were the
usual complaints from brokers that it had become extremely difficult to
deal. Once again, bargain sizes were strictly enforced by marketmaking
houses, although there was no sign of any change in normal Seaq screen
quotations.
Equity turnover, which had been trundling along at around 300m shares at
midsession, had jumped to 551.3m by the close. Wednesday's 431.6m-share Seaq
turnover again reflected low retail interest, at only Pounds 752.6m. Traders
believe that retail, or customer, business in equities was restrained
yesterday because the institutions were busy digesting the implications of
the Ecu funding. But market dealers will be watching carefully for
indications of institutional demand for UK shares today.
The final spur to the London market came when Wall Street, after a slow
start, showed an early gain of 20 Dow points. UK securities firms expect to
face a difficult opening to equity dealing this morning. But the funding
news was regarded as a welcome move.

FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT of a support operation for sterling led to a squeeze in the
derivatives market, producing one of its best performances since April,
writes Joel Kibazo.
In the futures sector, the September contract on the FT-SE Index, having
opened at 2,346, traded in a tight range of 2,341 to 2,355 for most of the
morning session with little in the way of feat-ures, although dealers
reported sporadic buying.
The announcement of an Ecu10bn currency support operation brought a squeeze
in the September future which also played its part in pulling the underlying
cash market higher. At the session's best, the contract was trading at
around 30 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6.
Profit-taking just before the official close saw the contract surrender some
of the gain. September closed at 2,411, up 83 from its previous close and
around 27 points above the fair value premium to cash, with turnover
reaching 10,282 contracts.
Traded options were also active. Turnover rose to 41,665 lots from
Wednesday's 27,621, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 12,439 contracts. Asda
was the busiest stock option on 2,079 lots.

FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurance result pleases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPOSITE insurance sector already reflecting some recovery in investor
confidence was boosted by interim figures above expectations and an
encouraging statement from Sun Alliance.
Analysts reworked full-year estimates for the group and are now likely to
predict much lower losses than in their earlier forecasts, which ranged from
deficits of Pounds 115m to Pounds 165m. The half-year loss of Pounds 97.9m,
against last time's Pounds 114m deficit, surprised many specialists. The
shares, which dropped to 214p earlier this year, surged ahead on the figures
to close 31 higher at 253p after heavy turnover of 7.2m.
Mr Youssef Ziai, insurance analyst at Morgan Stanley, the US investment
bank, described Sun Alliance as 'the pick of the composite insurance sector'
and added: 'Improvements in operating results will negate the impact of
mortgage indemnity losses by 1994.' He expects a loss for the year of Pounds
140m, compared with last year's Pounds 466m loss.
Rolls-Royce weak
Disappointing interim results put the skids under Rolls-Royce shares
yesterday, sending them into retreat against a strong market as brokers
weighed in with heavy downgradings of estimates for the full-year figures.
The aero-engine and turbines group reported half-time profits of Pounds 20m,
at the bottom of City forecasts, with a weak dollar cited as an important
factor in the figures.
At the day's worst the stock was down 9 at 123p. However, the strong market
trend later helped to lift the shares off the bottom and they ended 4 off at
128p, with turnover reaching an impressive 11m.
Long-term bear Mr Mustapha Omar at Williams de Broe was sufficiently
dismayed by the interim figures to trim his already low full-year estimate
by a further Pounds 8m to Pounds 80m, a figure now pencilled in by many
other analysts.
Reckitt volatile
Healthcare and household products group Reckitt &amp; Colman saw volatile
trading on the back of its announcement of first-half results.
Interim profits of Pounds 134.2m, up from Pounds 127.6m, were in line with
expectations and the shares showed a gain of 17 at best. However, analysts
returned from their meeting with Reckitt feeling very depressed about
prospects for the company and shaved forecasts to between Pounds 255m and
Pounds 265m for the current year and Pounds 270 to Pounds 290m for 1993. The
stock reversed its gain to show a net fall of 7, but then recovered with the
general surge to close 4 up on the day at 533p.
Ladbroke activity
Strong two-way business in Ladbroke saw volume rise to 14m shares, the
highest this year, after the company reported interim profits of Pounds
103.2m - up from Pounds 98.2m and in line with market forecasts - as well as
an increased dividend. The stock closed 3 up at 151p.
Analysts at Smith New Court, which is positive on the stock, said: 'With a
10 per cent yield, Ladbroke is paying the investor to back it as a recession
recovery play.'
An increased payout from Burmah Castrol was welcomed and the shares rose
sharply well before the rest of the market, and by the close were 26 higher
at 571p.
Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New Court, said the shares 'deserve at
least a market multiple at this stage of the cycle and are still a buy'. Mr
Keith Morris, at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, labelled the stock a 'strong buy' and
said the results 'underline the quality of Burmah's businesses in the teeth
of the recession'.
The rise in the dollar helped the oil majors, BP adding 5 1/2 at 201p and
Shell 10 at 469p. Enterprise Oil, however, slipped 4 more to 320p on fears
of further institutional selling.
Sun Alliance's interim results and the statement from its chief executive of
an improving trend in all its sectors instilled some confidence into other
insurance stocks.
Commercial Union, the biggest UK composite in terms of market
capitalisation, jumped 16 to 471p. Legal &amp; General, badly affected by
mortgage indemnity losses, took heart from the Sun Alliance news and
advanced 15 to 306p.
Insurance brokers, reliant on dollar earnings, were given a substantial
fillip by the sharp rally in the dollar, CE Heath rising 12 to 238p and
Willis Corroon 4 to 159p.
A resurgence of confidence and recovery in the dollar helped the
pharmaceutical sector, which has strong exposure to dollar earnings. Stocks
were also boosted by individual factors. Glaxo moved ahead 28 to 746p
following solid gains in the US overnight.
The shares had traded actively in New York on short-covering ahead of a US
Food and Drug Administration meeting yesterday to discuss increased use of
the company's anti-nausea treatment Zofran, which accounts for about 25 per
cent of Glaxo's income.
Wellcome bounced 29 to 832p as worries over the US holding faded. A belief
that US investors held 10 per cent of the group's shares was hit by a Bank
of New York announcement that 7 per cent was held in the form of American
Depositary Receipts. But agency broker James Capel was telling clients
yesterday that this figure ignored a further 2 to 3 per cent held as UK
shares.
SmithKline Beecham put on 22 at 469p after US group Genelabs Technologies
said it and SmithKline had formed a collaboration for the development and
sale of a hepatitis vaccine.
With the threat of a rise in domestic interest rates now seen as
significantly reduced for the short term at least, many housebuilders were
chased higher. Wilson Bowden rose 20 to 246p after announcing marginally
higher than expected interim profits. George Wimpey, however, remained under
pressure, closing 4 lower at 79p, as dealers fretted about a possible cut in
the dividend.
Franco-British paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton was one of the few Footsie
companies to lose ground. The shares dipped 6 to 206p as an investor sold
stock through Arjo's broker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Turnover was heavy at 6.9m
shares, with a block of 2.5m placed at 197p just before the close of
trading.
There was also said to be switching from Arjo into Bowater, which announced
a healthy rise in interim profits the previous day. Bowater added 15 at
754p.

FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Early Dow rise lost as jobs
data are awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended little changed yesterday after coming off early
morning highs as traders and investors positioned themselves for today's
important jobs data and the approaching Labor Day lengthened weekend, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 1.89 up at 3,292.20, after
having stood 20 points ahead at the day's peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended unchanged at 417.98, although the American SE composite gained a net
2.37 at 385.10 and the Nasdaq composite 3.63 at 574.88. New York SE turnover
was fairly heavy at 212.5m shares.
The sharp rise in Tokyo stocks overnight and a bright showing on European
bourses laid the groundwork for a firm opening in New York. Japanese stocks
have now climbed 30 per cent from their recent floor, an indication, said
some analysts yesterday, that the prolonged downturn in the Tokyo market may
be over.
Apart from Tokyo's advance, investors were keeping their eyes firmly on
today's employment report for August. The consensus among analysts is that
last month's non-farm payrolls rose by 155,000, although most of the
increase is expected to have been related to temporary hiring under a
federal summer jobs programme. Overall, the picture is expected to remain
flat.
Citicorp slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4 on reports that a study by
the Comptroller of the Currency had discovered serious management and credit
quality problems in the bank's mortgage business.
One of the busiest stocks was Gap Stores, which fell Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 33 1/2 in turnover of 3m shares after the company reported that
comparable same-store sales rose 6 per cent in August, a figure that
disappointed the market. May Department Stores shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 59
1/4 after announcing that same-store sales were down 1.2 per cent in August.
The company blamed the fall on the shift in the Labor Day holiday this year.
The repercussions of Hurricane Andrew continued to take their toll. Lennar
Homes dropped a further Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 as investors feared
that more home owners in south Florida who lost their houses in the
hurricane may sue the company for shoddy construction. Lennar says the suit
is totally without merit.
On the Nasdaq market, larger capitalised technology stocks continued to lead
the way with solid gains. Intel rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 62 1/4 ,
Microsoft Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 76 5/8 , Borland Dollars  3/4 to Dollars
43 3/4 and Sun Microsystems Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 27 5/8 , but Apple eased
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 47 3/4 .
Canada
PROGRESS in Canada's constitutional talks helped Toronto stocks withstand
the late retreat on Wall Street. Although slipping from its midday high, the
TSE 300 index finished 16.5 ahead at 3,453.2 and volume was heavy at 36.5m
shares. Advances led declines by 359 to 213.
Also adding to the bullish tone on the Toronto market was the stronger US
dollar, cuts in leading Canadian banks' prime rates and gains in overseas
markets.

FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris takes the lead in the
continental rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN missed out on a continental rally, stoked by a firmer dollar, less
anxiety over the French referendum, and opening gains in the UK market,
writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS's futures-driven rally was frustrated by computer problems which
closed down trading for several hours. The CAC-40 index ended up 69.05 or 4
per cent to 1,780.46, its highest close in four weeks. Turnover was
relatively heavy at FFr2.3bn.
Dealers said that cautious optimism about the Maastricht referendum, the
rally on the UK stock market and a firmer sterling prompted a flood of buy
orders from London and domestic institutions. An absence of poor corporate
results and rumours that the German government was considering fiscal
advantages to encourage investment in eastern Germany also fuelled the rise
in share prices.
Among the day's winners were Michelin, up FFr13.80 or 7 per cent to
FFr204.40 and Euro Disney, FFr4.90 or 6.4 per cent to FFr81.90. Total
bounced back FFr10.40 to FFr205.50 in the wake of its recent losses. Nomura
and Merrill Lynch issued 'buy' notes on the oil refiner yesterday.
FRANKFURT saw more short-covering, and a rise in sympathy with other
markets. The DAX index ended 24.08 higher at 1,530.75; some of this
reflected gains reported in Frankfurt's post-bourse on Wednesday, but there
was a similar extension of the uptrend yesterday afternoon.
Volume rose from DM3.8bn to DM4.3bn. Major blue chip advances included
Siemens, up DM10.70 to DM594.50, Bayer's DM4.70 to DM268.50, DM12.30 to
DM621.80 for Daimler and DM7.10 to DM319.50 for Volkswagen.
Deutsche Bank, too, saw solid interest, gaining DM10.60 to DM612.60. Dealers
said that the bank had held an analysts' meeting on Wednesday, which had a
broadly neutral impact.
MILAN was dragged lower at the opening by heavy selling by one of the larger
domestic brokers, and dealers remained pessimistic about the market in spite
of a late recovery in prices. The Comit index fell 3.91 to 371.43, a new low
for the year, in turnover estimated at more than L100bn after Wednesday's
L92.7bn.
Rumours of a capital increase dragged the widely-held Mediobanca down by
L435 or 4.6 per cent to L9,095. The stock has also been dogged by persistent
rumours about its veteran chairman, Mr Enrico Cuccia.
Italmobiliare remained on the sellers' list, falling L2,010 or 6.4 per cent
to L29,500.
Benetton was brought off the day's low of L10,100 by its first-half results
which were in line with expectations. The stock closed L150 higher at
L10,500.
AMSTERDAM rose 1.7 per cent, investors moving in to buy shares as the dollar
strengthened. Some relatively good corporate earnings news also helped. The
CBS Tendency index added 1.8 to 110.3.
ING put on Fl 2.40 or 5.5 per cent on news of a 7 per cent rise in
first-half net, while Ahold dipped 40 cents to Fl 75.70 on disappointing
first-half profit growth of 6 per cent.
MADRID bet on a French Yes vote on Maastricht, the general index rising
6.48, or 3.1 per cent to 216.30. Banks included a Central Hispano rise of
Pta230 or 7.7 per cent to Pta3,230, after it talked of reducing the number
of its branches by a net 500 to 2,500 next year.
Dealers said that this rise was not volume-driven, and that individual gains
were erratic. In construction stocks, Uralita, which on Wednesday reported
first half profits of Pta14bn after extraordinary profits of Pta21bn, rose
Pta69, or 10.7 per cent, to Pta715.
STOCKHOLM recovered in moderate trading, supported by falling domestic
interest rates and gains in foreign markets. The Affarsvarlden General Index
rose 7.5 to 753.9 in turnover of SKr400m after SKr458m.
New bankruptcies in the real estate sector continued to plague the banking
section, with S-E Banken falling to a year's low of SKr14.5, down SKr0.5.
OSLO's recovery, with the all-share index up 1.8 per cent to 313.02, was
marred by a NKr7.5 drop to NKr32.5 in Aker, which said that its Norwegian
Contractors subsidiary would incur a 1992 loss of NKr400m after
miscalculating the costs of installing a concrete platform at the Heidrun
gas and oil field.
BRUSSELS bounced back from its recent losses, the Bel-20 index ending 20.70
or 2 per cent higher at 1,066.86. Petrofina closed BFr210 or 2.5 per cent
higher at BFr8,560.

FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Budapest looks for strength in salami -
Brokers hope that two new share issues will revive the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never before has so much depended on a sausage, however noble a variety.
Budapest's anaemic stock market, hungering for nourishment, is eagerly
awaiting the flotation of Pick Salami, the leading producer of Hungary's
very own sausage.
Brokers hope that the launch of Pick, which started marketing its flotation
earlier this week, and Danubius Hotel and Spa Company, which follows, will
end a dry spell of share issues, overlay investors' bitter experience of
Hungarian privatisation issues and draw them back to the market.
Above all, the two offerings, which are to be floated in Budapest and placed
privately abroad, have to overcome the poisonous legacy of Hungary's first
privatisation issue.
Ibusz, the national travel agency, went public and launched the Budapest
Stock Exchange in June 1990 in a blaze of glory. But it then lost its
investors, mainly foreigners, a lot of money with the stock falling 44 per
cent from its issue price.
The market as a whole has not dazzled, either. The BSE index, battered by
local wars and a depressed economy, languishes at 826, down from last year's
peak of 1,227 and only 60 points above its all-time low.
Brokers, although embarrassed on many occasions over the past two years by
misplaced optimism, are nevertheless cautiously upbeat about Pick and
Danubius.
Mr Zsigmond Jarai, Hungarian manager of James Capel, the UK broker involved
in both forthcoming issues, says: 'Pick will help to promote a second
chapter in the history of the stock exchange.'
The salami manufacturer and the hotel chain are widely regarded as quality
shares - their earnings are relatively well-insulated against Hungary's
economic recession and their prospectuses are an improvement on those of
earlier issues.
Equally important, the government is trying to make privatisation more
popular and so the pricing promises to be keen to ensure success and provide
investors with a nice capital gain. Pick is likely to be priced at 6 to 7
times earnings, compared with a market p/e of 16.4 at the end of the first
half.
This year's rises in Fotex, a retailing group and the most traded share, and
Styl, a privatised clothing manufacturer, have given punters a taste of the
profits they can make.
The other big difference this time is that interest rates have fallen
dramatically. Three-month Treasury bills yielded just 16.55 per cent at last
week's latest auction, down from 35 per cent a year ago, giving equities a
chance against bank deposits in attracting retail investors.
Many analysts, however, argue that equity issues, while they may be
prestigious and attract attention, remain marginal to the Hungarian stock
market.
Mr Paul Greatbatch, a board member of Lupis Brokerhaz, a leading domestic
broker, says: 'The equity market performs the same role as owning a vintage
Rolls Royce. It is of limited everyday use, but it impresses the
neighbours.'
Turnover in the BSE's 21 shares for the whole of July was only Ft480m
(Dollars 6.3m) and the market's capitalisation is about Ft36bn (Dollars
500m).
Volume is low partly because Budapest's settlement system, convoluted by
foreign exchange controls, pushes trading off the exchange. In Hungarian
shares, foreign markets - Vienna, London and New York - out-trade Budapest
by up to five to one.
But even taking into account the trading abroad, and Budapest's large OTC
market, dominated by bank shares, equities are likely to be dwarfed by
trading in government debt, which Mr Greatbatch describes as Hungary's
'first serious securities market'.
On the one hand, the state budget deficit is growing rapidly, with the
government forecasting a shortfall of about Ft200bn (up to 8 per cent of
GDP) both this year and next; and new legislation forces the government to
finance the bulk of that on credit markets. On the other, banks and
individuals remain downbeat about the economy and risk-averse, so government
paper still looks attractive in spite of falling yields.

FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Discount rate cut
rumours lead Nikkei to 4.5% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUMOURS of a discount rate cut prompted a rally in the futures market, and
the Nikkei average surged 4.5 per cent on arbitrage-linked buying, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 798.77 higher at 18,386.49, having drifted down in the
morning session to a low for the day of 17,396.43 on position adjustment by
dealers. A sharp rise in futures prices on the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange prompted arbitrage-linked buying and the index rose as
high as 18,461.66 in the afternoon.
Volume increased to 500m shares from 417m. Buying by dealers and investment
trusts led the activity, while most domestic institutions remained on the
sidelines. Rises led declines by 727 to 276, with 120 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 47.74 to 1,396.79, and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.85 to 1,131.06.
Speculation that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate
resurfaced. Activity was also spurred by unconfirmed rumours that public
pension funds would start investing in the stock market next week, and that
trading margins for futures trading would be reduced.
Traders said the response to such positive rumours reflected the underlying
bullishness. 'Share prices are managing to disregard downward earnings
revisions by companies and gloomier forecasts for the economy,' said Mr
Chris Newton at James Capel.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y390. Dealers
and individuals traded the issue on reports that an affiliate had developed
a new ceramic engine. Other automakers were firm, too, with Honda Motor up
Y60 to Y1,300 and Mazda Motor gaining Y32 to Y470. Mazda said it would cut
executives' bonus payments and that it was considering a large-scale
restructuring programme.
Ricoh, the office equipment maker, climbed Y60 to Y707. Investors were
encouraged by prospects of an early recovery in earnings.
Banks were strong on active buying. Industrial Bank of Japan forged ahead
Y230 to Y2,770 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y200 to Y1,920. Nomura Securities
was also actively traded, adding Y120 at Y1,640 on hopes of an earnings
recovery due to the recent market upturn.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 441.34 to 19,846.23 in volume of 15.3m

Investors have been encouraged by its restructuring efforts.
Roundup
THE REGION was not immediately susceptible to Tokyo's improving mood.
HONG KONG had one of its quietest days in weeks, turnover dropping from
HKDollars 2.66bn to HKDollars 2.01bn as the Hang Seng index lost 11.99 to
5,722.46.
HSBC led the actives list and shed 50 cents to HKDollars 55.50 on news of a
warrants issue by Nan Fung, helping to push the finance sub-index down
34.45, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,195.87.
AUSTRALIA came off the day's lows on a good showing by transport group
Brambles. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.2 off at 1,526.3 in turnover of
ADollars 253m. Although Brambles' net profits fell 6.2 per cent to ADollars
180.2m, this was at the high end of expectations. Brambles rose 72 cents to
ADollars 15.50.
Another highlight was Santos, up 11 cents at ADollars 2.58 after announcing
an ADollars 2.70 a share bid for gas producer Sagasco, valuing it at
ADollars 560m. Sagasco was flat at ADollars 2.75.
TAIWAN finished lower in volatile trading after heavy profit-taking emerged
in the late morning. The weighted index ended 45.12, or 1.2 per cent, down
at 3,888.49 and turnover rose to TDollars 28.6bn from TDollars 24.4bn.
SEOUL inched higher as late-afternoon institutional buying pulled the market
off the day's lows. The index gained 1.20 at 563.94 in turnover of
Won446.1bn, after Won462.5bn.
BANGKOK saw afternoon profit-taking and the SET index closed just 1.00 up at
763.42, although turnover grew from Bt8.89bn to Bt9.69bn. Thai Airways,
which rose Bt5 to Bt58 on Wednesday, opened at Bt60 and climbed to Bt63
before coming off to finish at Bt58.50.
KUALA LUMPUR did respond to Tokyo, the KLSE index rising 4.79 to 577.71 as
its finance index added 41.15 at 2,258.70 on institutional support for the
sector leader, Malayan Banking, and other established banking stocks.
BOMBAY reversed an early decline to close with the BSE index 38.96 ahead at
3,079.53 on rumours that the government would soon restrict forward deals in
dollars, indicating that full convertibility of the rupee was imminent.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Western Mining tumbles into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian mining group, yesterday
blamed lower metals prices and an abnormal loss of ADollars 200m for a
consolidated net loss of ADollars 8.5m (USDollars 6.07m) in the year to
end-June. Last time the group turned in a profit of ADollars 276m.
Sales were down 6.8 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn.
The board cut the final dividend to five cents, fully franked, compared with
11 cents in the second half of the previous year. This made a total for the
year of 11 cents, fully franked, against 24 cents.
The result was towards the top end of market expectations, and the shares
gained four cents to close at ADollars 5.02.
WMC said consolidated operating profit was down 30 per cent to ADollars
205m, mainly because of lower prices for nickel and oil, and lower earnings
from gold because of lower production.
Equity-accounted net profit, which includes the group's interests in
associated companies, fell to ADollars 161m from ADollars 362m in the
previous year, mainly due to a decline in the contribution from Alcoa to
ADollars 141m from ADollars 278m. The group said Alcoa was performing well
in a difficult market.
Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group, has defied recession in its
main markets, registering a 29 per cent increase in consolidated net profit
to ADollars 223m (USDollars 160.3m) in the year to end-June. Turnover rose
23 per cent to ADollars 4.1bn.
The board declared a final dividend of 15 cents a share, franked to 95 per
cent. The interim dividend was 14 cents, franked to 64 per cent. The total
of 29 cents compares with 27 cents in the previous year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KYOWA Saitama Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank, yesterday unveiled a
restructuring plan including cuts in executive salaries and a cut in capital
spending.
Its move follows similar pledges made by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the largest
commercial bank, earlier this week.
Last week, in its economic support package, the Japanese government called
for the rationalisation of operations at Japanese banks.
The banks are working on a plan to set up a corporation which would buy land
being used as collateral for bad loans and the government has hinted there
might be government help.
The banks' announcements comes as the Japanese business community has
started to express dissatisfaction at the 'special treatment' being given to
the banking industry.
Although other leading commercial banks are expected to follow DKB and Kyowa
Saitama, it will probably be insufficient to win public approval for the
government support the sector is being given.
Kyowa Saitama's programme includes a 5 per cent cut in executive
compensation and a Y45bn (Dollars 366.3m) reduction in capital spending over
the next four years. Entertainment and travelling costs will be cut, and the
number of directors, currently 50, will be cut. The bank will also review
its branch network.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: US Treasury to test single
price auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury plans an immediate start to its experiment with single price
bond auctions with this month's auction of two and five-year notes.
The Treasury plans a year-long test of the single price auction formula,
replacing its current multiple price system for all monthly sales of the two
and five-year notes.
Under the current auction format, the Treasury determines a cut-off price at
which it can sell all the securities it put up for auction, but successful
bidders must pay the price specified in their bids.
With the single price formula, the Treasury will determine a cut-off price
in the same way, but all successful bidders will pay this price.
Mr Jerome Powell, undersecretary for finance at the Treasury, said academic
research suggested this should result in more competitive bidding and should
therefore reduce the US government's borrowing costs.
'You are letting people pay a lower price than they bid or get a higher
yield than they bid, which would appear to cost us money. On the other hand,
everyone bids more aggressively,' Mr Powell said.
Treasury officials argue that securities buyers have an incentive under the
current system to aim for the market consensus. This leads many buyers to
bid through the big dealers who have the most information about the market,
because if they bid too high they will end up owning bonds or notes for
which they have paid more than the market price - the winner's curse.
'The theory is that people would bid more aggressively because no-one would
suffer from this winner's curse,' Mr Powell said.
The Treasury plans to judge the success of the single price experiment at
reducing its borrowing costs by comparing the volume of bids with the volume
of securities auctioned, and the auction yield with the yield of the same
securities in the 'when-issued' market before the auction takes place.
It will also examine the number of competitive bidders, the concentration of
awards with certain firms and the yield dispersion of accepted bids.
Dealers expect the Treasury to sell around Dollars 15bn of two-year notes
and Dollars 10.5bn of five-year notes, the same volume as last month, at the
first single price auction in three weeks' time.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper to pass payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAISHOWA Paper, the Japanese paper manufacturer lead by Mr Ryoei Saito, the
controversial art collector, said it would not pay its interim dividend for
the six months to September.
It had scheduled an interim dividend of Y3 per share, but has been forced to
suspend payment due to the continuing slowdown in the Japanese economy, and
the sluggish paper and pulp market.
To reduce its mounting debt burden, Daishowa has been struggling to off-load
assets, including cross-shareholdings. The company said yesterday it had
agreed to sell its pulp plant and lumber mills in Canada to its joint
venture with Marubeni, a leading trading company, for Y110bn (Dollars 895m).
Daishowa also warned that results for the full year could be worse than
forecast. For the year to next March, it initially estimated a pre-tax loss
of Y20.9bn and an after-tax loss of Y4.5bn on sales of Y416bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
has acquired 50 per cent of Shanghai's container port for HKDollars 1.4bn
(USDollars 181.2m).
The container terminal is to be modernised and expanded to almost double its
existing capacity by 1995.
Hutchison owns 60.5 per cent of Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT), the
world's largest privately-owned container terminal operator, which will
manage the Shanghai port operations with the Shanghai Port Authority,
Hutchison's joint venture partner.
The port of Shanghai lies at the mouth of the Yangtze river and is the
outlet for China's growing industrial heartland.
Brokers welcomed the news. Hutchison recently announced a HKDollars 1.42bn
write-down of the value of its investment in Husky Oil, and followed this by
a share placement at the resultant low stock price.
The newly-formed Shanghai Container Terminals (SCT) will control Shanghai's
three existing terminals, which have a combined capacity of 850,000 TEUs
(20ft equivalent units).
By 1995, capacity is expected to be increased to 1.6m TEUs. In addition, SCT
will have preferential development rights for a planned container terminal
in the new 350sq km economic development zone of Pudong.
The deal comes at a good time for HIT, which is involved in a battle for
Hong Kong's ninth container terminal. If it loses, it will reach full
capacity by 1995, with a throughput of 3.9m TEUs a year. Shanghai would add
a further 41 per cent to that capacity.

BRAMBLES Industries, the Australian industrial services group, yesterday
reported a 6.2 per cent fall in net profit for 1991-92 to ADollars 185.75m
(USDollars 132.6), Reuter reports from Sydney.
'We estimate that this year's profit outlook contains up to 8 per cent
growth which is largely independent of economic conditions,' Mr Gary
Pemberton, chief executive, said. 'It is based on issues specific to
Brambles, such as the expansion of our US activities.'
Mr Pemberton pointed out that the annual profit was in line with the
forecast at the half- year.
'The two big factors in the result were the reduction in interest income and
the severe downturn in the construction industry in Australia,' he added.
Mr Pemberton said the economy in Australia continued to be flat at best.
'For the first time in 18 years, Brambles' revenue in Australia actually
declined.'
He said that despite concerns with the move to European unity, Brambles'
European business had delivered a higher trading profit. Operating profit
for European businesses rose to ADollars 146.30m from ADollars 142.7m.

AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, has defied recession in its
main markets, registering a 29 per cent increase in consolidated net profit
to ADollars 223m (USDollars 160.3m) in the year to end-June. Turnover rose
23 per cent to ADollars 4.1bn.
The group also reported an abnormal net profit of ADollars 43m, reflecting
an ADollars 80.5m profit on the sale of part of its stake in Mayne Nickless,
the transport, security and health group, offset by restructuring costs.
Amcor said profits had been lifted by a strong performance by its core paper
and packaging activities in Australia, and the consolidation of Spicer's
paper from January, when the group increased its stake from 19 per cent to
46 per cent.
The board declared a final dividend of 15 cents a share, franked to 95 per
cent. The interim dividend was 14 cents, franked to 64 per cent. The total
of 29 cents compares with 27 cents in the previous year.
Amcor said the 'excellent' result was achieved in spite of severe recession
in Australia and its other main markets in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.
Activities outside Australia accounted for 35 per cent of sales and 23 per
cent of operating profits.

GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, is planning two more
asset-backed securitisation issues within the next few months.
Mr Maurice Foley, GPA chief executive, speaking yesterday at the Financial
Times conference on World Aerospace and Air Transport, said the company
intended to launch a second Aircraft Lease Portfolio Securitisation (Alps)
fund 'early in the autumn'. The fund would have a value of about Dollars
750m.
A third fund would follow by March 1993.
These two issues follow the ground-breaking Dollars 500m Alps issue by the
Irish company in June this year.
Citibank is the sole lead bank for the next Alps, having been joint lead
bank with Lehman Brothers with the first. The next issue would be structured
'very much like the first Alps,' said Citibank.
Alps 1 was made up of five tranches: two public offerings consisting of
Dollars 208.4m fixed-rate bonds and Dollars 104.2m floating-rate notes, a
Dollars 70.4m private placement and two tranches of subordinated debt.
Mr Foley said that such instruments would help solve a capital shortage in
the airline industry.
They 'offer airlines the opportunity to uncouple from dependence on bank
debt . . . and widen the investor base to those who might not otherwise
invest in airlines'.

Sagasco

<TEXT>
SANTOS, the Australian oil and gas group, yesterday offered ADollars 560m
(USDollars 402.4m) in cash for Sagasco, a quoted oil and gas group
controlled by the state government of South Australia. The offer follows the
government's decision to sell a 56 per cent holding in Sagasco to help
finance about ADollars 3bn in taxpayer support for the loss-making State
Bank of South Australia.
The offer values Sagasco shares at ADollars 2.63, a premium of nine cents
over the share price before the government's announcement in July. Sagasco
shares have been trading at about ADollars 2.75 recently.
Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, Sagasco's chairman, said the offer seriously
undervalued the company, and claimed it breached the federal Trade Practices
Act, which regulates competition. However, analysts said the bid had a good
chance of success, partly because Santos plans to retain Sagasco's workforce
and float shares in its gas subsidiary, probably through a preferential
allocation to South Australian residents.
The proposals were welcomed by South Australian trade union, consumer and
business interests, which feared the state government's decision to sell its
holding would mean a transfer of control outside the state.
There was no comment from the Trade Practices Commission, the federal
competition watchdog, which had ex-pressed concern about the level of
competition in the South Australian energy market.
Mr Ross Adler, Santos managing director, said the bid would allow Sagasco to
remain part of the 'commercial fabric' of South Australia. 'We think the
price is fair and I think (that) from the community's point of view it's a
worthwhile initiative,' he said.
Control of Sagasco would significantly increase Santos's oil and gas
interests in the Cooper and Eromanga basins in South Australia, which form
the cornerstone of both companies' operations.
Santos believes the basins hold sufficient reserves to sustain production at
existing levels into the next century. Oil production from the region is in
decline, but Santos said there was 'considerable potential' for further
discoveries.
It is to fund the acquisition through debt and said its strong cash flow
would allow 'a substantial reduction' in gearing over the medium term.

PANCONTINENTAL Mining, the Australian mining company, staged a turnround to

Group sales advanced to ADollars 214.8m from ADollars 179.3m last time.
Pancontinental said it was well positioned to take immediate advantage of
any further firming in the weak cyclical upturn in certain commodity prices.
It said this would be assisted by the recent fall in the Australian
dollar/US dollar exchange rate.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mixed fortunes for Courtaulds Textiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS Textiles had mixed fortunes in the first half of the year.
Among the hardest hit areas were US lace sales, where customers had
over-ordered last year. 'We turned the machines off which was very costly
but the right thing to do,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive.
Sales of soft furnishings and towels in the UK were depressed by the slack
housing market. Margins held up as a result of tight cost control.
Margins also improved in the company's own-label clothes, where operating
profits were higher despite a 16 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 102.2m.
Retail competition cut margins in branded clothing and left operating
profits at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.8m)
Lingerie label Gossard maintained profits.
COMMENT
There are limits to what a good management can do in the face of such grim
market conditions as those which face Courtaulds Textiles. The company has
worked hard to cut costs and debt, and shareholders should be pleased to see
their dividend rise while interest payments to banks fall yet again.
Nevertheless, the profits outlook is a little worse now than a few months
ago. The company should make Pounds 44m for the full year and show earnings
of 33p a share. That puts the shares on 11.5 times earnings, a touch below
the rest of the sector, which will look increasingly cheap if the dollar
recovers.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Recession trims Williams to Pounds 72m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday signalled its
intention to fund future acquisitions from borrowings as it unveiled a 6 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for the six months ended June 30.
The pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 76.5m to Pounds 72m on increased sales
of Pounds 493.8m (Pounds 470.6m). Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic
continued to be affected by the recession.
Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive, said realisation that the group could not
pay for future acquisitions by issuing shares had led to a change of policy
on debt.
The group has therefore established long-term borrowing facilities of
Dollars 370m (Pounds 185m), repayable in ten years, to help fund future
acquisitions.
Borrowings at the year-end were expected to be between Pounds 120m and
Pounds 140m, representing gearing of under 40 per cent. In the short-term
the group would have net cash of about Pounds 30m.
Mr McGowan said the group had learnt from its failed hostile bid for Racal
Electronics last year - launched as an all-share offer - that paper offers
were unlikely to succeed when financial markets were depressed.
He said: 'Perhaps we will never do any contested bids because we are not
prepared to over pay. However, we are exploring a series of possibilities.
More companies are under pressure to sell and their prices are more
realistic.'
Engineering suffered the biggest setback. Trading profits dived from Pounds
12.6m to Pounds 4.3m because of a fall in orders for military bridges in the
Far East.
Trading profits of the fire and safety international division fell to Pounds
17.6m (Pounds 22.2m) as de-stocking in the aviation industry resulted in a
sharp decline in the purchase of spares.
Yale and Valor, the security products company acquired last year, continued
to boost profits. The locks businesses helped the European consumer and
building products side increase trading profits from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds
32.2m. The North American consumer and building products activities
benefited from the integration of Yale and NuTone which saw its trading
profits climb from Pounds 15m to Pounds 22.6m.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 6m related to the sale of the group's
investment of just under 10 per cent in Racal after taking into account the
loss associated with the sale of Spencer Clark Metal Industries.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 10.9p to 9p. The interim dividend
is held at 5p.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cookson recovers to Pounds 34m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON, the industrial materials group, underlined its continuing recovery
yesterday by announcing a substantial increase in interim profits following
its restructuring.
The pre-tax figure doubled from Pounds 17m to Pounds 34m in the six months
to June 30, while earnings per share bounced back to 4.2p (0.9p). The
interim dividend is unchanged at 3p.
Turnover from continuing operations grew by 4 per cent to Pounds 605m
(Pounds 581m). Excluding acquisitions, the increase was 2 per cent,
reflecting 'difficult trading conditions' caused by the world recession.
Total turnover, including discontinued operations, was Pounds 609m (Pounds
676m).
The company has focused on controlling costs and overheads. Employee numbers
have been further reduced in all divisions, and stand at 12,500, down from a
peak of 16,000. Redundancy costs of Pounds 1.2m compared to Pounds 1.6m last
time.
Mr Robert Malpas, chairman, said the results showed Cookson was continuing
its recovery.
Operating profits rose 39 per cent to Pounds 43m. The figure of Pounds 31m
for the previous first half included Pounds 3m from discontinued operations.
All four reorganised divisions - electronic materials, ceramics, engineered
products and plastics - reported improved profits.
A significant reduction in the level of borrowings during 1991 resulted in
reduced interest charges of Pounds 9m (Pounds 14m). However, at the end of
June net borrowings were Pounds 211m, compared to Pounds 142m at the end of
December, and gearing increased from 33 per cent to 53 per cent.
The increase in borrowings was attributed to the seasonal rise in working
capital and the cost of acquiring the additional 50 per cent stake in
Stern-Leach, which resulted in the consolidation of Stern-Leach's Dollars
66m (Pounds 33.1m) borrowings into the balance sheet.
COMMENT
Cookson is a recovery stock making good on its promise without any help from
trading conditions. The company's new - and streamlined - senior management
team has made creditable progress towards stripping the unwieldy group back
to its core but they have further to go. Expect more disposals businesses,
though not at fire sale prices. Full-year pre-tax profits are projected at
about Pounds 72m, for a prospective p/e of 10.5. The shares stood last night
36p below their 170p high for the year. If trading conditions improve they
could recover quickly that lost ground despite some dollar translation
risks.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hawthorn Leslie back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower debt in the wake of its restructuring agreement, together with a
turnround in mobile telephone operations were behind the return to the black
at Hawthorn Leslie in the first half.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 434,000 (losses of
Pounds 9.48m). Sales were Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 66.8m).
The company is focusing on mobile telecommunications and HL Communications
achieved profit of Pounds 2.2m before interest and tax (Pounds 1.37m
deficit). The comparisons have been restated to reflect a change in the
accounting policy regarding commission paid to dealers.
The results also benefited from the absence of provisions for losses at CP
Finance and Leasing, which is being run down. In 1991 provisions of Pounds
3.7m were carried.
Directors said it was prudent to wait further before re-instating the
dividend.
The shares rose 1 1/4 p to 2 1/2 p.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander plunges to Pounds 3.2m
after property provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property
group, plunged to Pounds 3.25m in the half year to June 30, against Pounds
8.11m.
However, the decline reflected a Pounds 5.29m write down of the value of
properties held for long-term investment. Operating profits before the
exceptional item were Pounds 8.54m (Pounds 8.1m).
The provision was made against the 1987 revaluation of the properties
concerned and was said to leave them substantially above their original
cost. The group's properties are virtually fully let, with negligible
arrears.
Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman, said banking profits of Pounds 4.76m (Pounds
4.28m) were continuing to improve, despite difficult market conditions.
Cash in hand was Pounds 70.5m at end-June, down from Pounds 123.6m a year
earlier. Advances to customers were Pounds 255m (Pounds 265m).
Earnings per share declined from 2.59p to 0.5p, though without provisions,
they would have increased by 19 per cent, partly reflecting the buying in of
14 per cent of the ordinary capital. The interim dividend is unchanged at
1p.

<TEXT>
PROVIDENT FINANCIAL, the personal loan and consumer finance group, reported
a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12.8m,
for the half year to June 30.
Turnover was up by 12 per cent to Pounds 184m, with the main activity -
weekly credit collected from customers' homes - earning pre-tax profits of
Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 10.1m). The improved performance reflected reduced
costs, as the group cut its branches from 404 to 368, and closed 14 Lawson
Fisher credit retailing stores. The group now has 1.3m credit customers.
Staff numbers at the headquarters were reduced from 90 to 50, and head
office no longer provided central services to subsidiaries.
The insurance division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.1m) but
benefited from the market increase in motor premiums, while the banking side
turned round to a profit of Pounds 100,000 (loss Pounds 1.1m).
Earnings per share rose to 16.7p (14.37p) and the interim dividend is lifted
to 9.25p (8.5p).
In August, Car Care Plan, a loss-making subsidiary with net assets of Pounds
600,000, was sold for Pounds 4.6m cash to Motors Insurance Corporation, plus
up to Pounds 500,000 in further conditional payments.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Beneficial Bank to buy Sterling Bank for
Pounds 24.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beneficial Bank, the retail financial services group, is to buy Sterling
Bank for Pounds 24.6m cash from Sterling Trust, the USM-quoted financial
services company.
The price is equivalent to Sterling Bank's net asset value at the completion
date and is subject to the approval of Sterling Trust's shareholders. The
deal has already been approved by Robert Fraser Group, the privately-owned
merchant bank which owns 51.5 per cent of Sterling Trust.
Mr David Hart, chairman of Sterling Trust, said the sale was being
undertaken because the company's shares had been trading at about 57p when
net asset value per share was above 120p. The shares put on 23p to close at
80p yesterday.
Because the sale will leave Sterling Trust with no operating subsidiaries,
its shares are to be suspended when the sale is completed and the group's
quotation may be cancelled if it does not acquire new businesses within six
months.
Mr Hart said no acquisitions were being considered but a range of options
were being examined, including a repayment of capital or a reverse takeover.
Sterling Trust also yesterday reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds
1.56m to Pounds 1.22m in the six months to end-June. Turnover fell from
Pounds 9.26m to Pounds 8.92m. Earnings came out at 4p (5p).

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: US growth helps Burmah Castrol advance 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURMAH CASTROL, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, yesterday
announced interim pre-tax profits slightly higher than expected, helped by
increased lubricant sales in the US and reduced interest charges.
But recession continued to drag down metallurgical chemicals. The company
said it was reviewing its manufacturing capacity and could close up to ten
of its 50 plants worldwide.
In the six months to June 30 profits rose 17 per cent from Pounds 72.2m to
Pounds 84.7m. Turnover fell to Pounds 1.15bn (Pounds 1.16bn), mainly due to
disposals.
The shares gained 28p to 573p.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman and chief executive, said the result was
'fairly satisfactory given the state of our markets'. But he warned the
second half would be difficult as markets remained depressed. Prolonged
weakness of the dollar would also reduce profits.
Lubricants lifted trading profits 11 per cent to Pounds 65.1m (Pounds
58.7m), buoyed by automotive oils sales in the US and Asia. A new synthetic
motor oil is being introduced across the US this month. Launch costs could
knock about Pounds 7m off trading profits in the second half.
Trading profits from the chemicals division, which was expanded following
the 1990 acquisition of Foseco, were almost unchanged at Pounds 17.4m
(17.2m). Metallurgical chemicals, however, fell by 7 per cent.
Disposals of non-core Foseco businesses are now almost complete. Foseco,
which last year diluted earnings by about 6.5p a share, is this year
expected to be earnings neutral.
In other divisions, fuels trading profits rose 62 per cent to Pounds 15.2m
(Pounds 9.4m) helped by a Pounds 1.9m gain on the flotation of a Turkish
joint venture.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 24.3m) as debt raised to finance
the Foseco acquisition was moved offshore to lower interest rate currencies.
The tax rate fell 3 percentage points to 44 per cent with higher UK profits
offsetting ACT write-offs.
Earnings increased 26 per cent to 22.5p (17.8p). The interim dividend is
raised to 8.75p (8.5p).
Gearing at the end of the period stood at 65 per cent, treating convertible
bonds as debt, or 49 per cent if treated as equity.
COMMENT
News that Burmah is considering closing up to 20 per cent of its
metallurgical chemicals capacity shows how it underestimated the likely
length of the recession when it bought Foseco. But this should not detract
from an otherwise solid performance and it has always argued Foseco should
be judged on its long-term impact. The big question for the second half is
currency, since translated dollar earnings could fall by 10 per cent at
current exchange rates. Burmah's international reach will mitigate some of
the downside as it gains from a strong D-Mark and lower input prices, which
are dollar based. Forecast full year net income of Pounds 84m puts the p/e
on a little less than 13. The US synthetic oil launch will depress profits
in the short term, but should add to the shares' longer term attractions.

FT  04 SEP 92 / People: Michael Weinstein
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Weinstein, who has died at the age of 47, must have been one of the
world's most successful personal insurance salesmen - certainly an unusually
cultivated one.
Born and brought up in Philadelphia, he had spent his entire career in
London, from 1973 working for Metropolitan Life, the US life insurance
group. His clientele was drawn from Americans and other foreigners living in
the UK.
With his irresistible combination of social charm and good looks, backed up
with a formidable knowledge of life insurance, business grew exponentially.
In his best year, 1989, he personally sold Dollars 250m worth of policies -
ahead of MetLife's 12,000 other salesmen in the US and overseas.
His success could certainly not be put down to long hours in the office.
Knowing that a good salesman had to be relaxed, Weinstein took long lunch
breaks, afternoon naps and frequent holidays. He even freed himself from the
chore of making routine telephone calls by employing an actor, part-time, to
imitate his voice.
He had an immensely strong will, and he succeeded by setting himself sales
goals. Cynical British friends scoffed at the arcane MetLife honours system
('President's Conference', 'President's Council', 'Million Dollar Round
Table', 'President's Trophy'), but Weinstein used it to motivate himself.
The MetLife commissions enabled Michael Weinstein to enjoy a truly splendid
lifestyle. Everything was in exquisite taste: his social life; the palatial
penthouse apartment in Kensington; fine collections of historical art.
His premature death from cerebral lymphoma is a great sadness for his large
circle of friends and clients - and a considerable financial blow for
MetLife.

FT  04 SEP 92 / People: O'Reilly Jnr picks mining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony O'Reilly Jnr is following his elder brother Cameron into his father's
far-flung business empire. But unlike Cameron, who is keeping an eye on the
O'Reilly family's growing newspaper interests, Tony, 25, is going into the
mining business.
He has been been appointed executive director, planning and corporate
development, at Arcon International Resources which was the scene of a
battle for control recently after the company had acquired Atlantic
Resources, an Irish oil exploration company, headed by Tony O'Reilly Snr.
Professor Conroy, Arcon's founder and chairman, was temporarily ousted from
the board in February by a group of shareholders who thought his company had
paid too much for Atlantic. In the event Tony O'Reilly Snr came to the
rescue by increasing his stake in Arcon to 20.5 per cent and the professor
was reinstated.
His son, who has worked for Dillon Read and the corporate finance team of
Coopers &amp; Lybrand in New York, plays down the family connection. He says the
decision to get involved with Arcon was his idea, not his father's. He had
specialised in natural resources at Coopers and had got to know Bill
Mulligan, an Arcon director.
While Arcon is one of the smallest and least successful of his father's
investments, O'Reilly Jnr hopes to turn it into one of the empire's top
performers.
Arcon has explored only 3 per cent of its 90 square miles and has already
discovered a 6m tonne lead/zinc mine at Galmoy. 'We are in a pre-development
stage with a world class asset,' says O'Reilly Jnr.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology: Heavies move in - After years of work in mass
production, robots are taking on bigger jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drive for competitiveness and low-cost production may have made the car
industry the natural home for the world's robot population, but Karlheinz
Langner and his colleagues at IGM Robotersysteme have other ideas.
Langner, a managing board member at Austria's only robotics company, has his
sights set on industry's heavy brigade. Less visibly than their counterparts
in the car industry, but with increasing urgency, manufacturers of heavy
equipment - anything from excavators to steel bridge sections - want to
improve their product quality and reduce cycle times, increase their
manufacturing flexibility and clean up their workplace.
All these issues, in varying degrees, have been tackled successfully by the
mass-production car industry with the use of robots, but heavy industry is
very different.
In recent years, many heavy engineering companies have been reticent about
robots. They may have been put off by the robot suppliers' sales patter or
unconvinced that a robot can cope with welding, for example, a crane boom or
bulk handling container, particularly if each item to be welded might be
slightly different from the previous one.
Or they might simply have jibbed at the expense - as much as Dollars 350,000
(Pounds 175,000) for a sophisticated system with one or more robots, slides,
gantries and devices to rotate a workpiece that could weigh as much as 15
tonnes. And having purchased a system, some customers have had to solve
software problems themselves to get the robot working correctly.
But companies such as IGM, which celebrates its silver jubilee this year,
are spending heavily to find new solutions for the use of robots in heavy
industry, and that, in turn, broadens the market for the robot suppliers.
Some sectors such as shipbuilding, for instance, are only now waking up to
the opportunities for using robots, which were simply not available five
years ago.
Anybody who has visited a modern car factory cannot fail to be impressed by
the serried ranks of robots spot welding body sections or inserting
dashboards. Such machines, however, are worlds apart from those produced by
IGM, which specialises in arc or continuous path welding and some cutting
robots, and its rivals at the heavy end of the welding equipment industry
such as Esab of Sweden and Cloos of Germany.
A continuous weld is the norm in construction equipment, for example, to
cope with the immense stresses to which plant will be subjected during its
working life, and demands for high-quality welding are increasing.
Grappling with the welding of an excavator boom could require up to 16 axes
of movement from the robot and its surrounding equipment, putting pressure
on the robot supplier not only to design the system correctly in mechanical
terms but to ensure that the software and sensor systems are sufficiently
sophisticated and fast to cope.
In such a market, says Langner, understanding the customer's needs is of
vital importance. But when almost every customer has a different problem
that may require a customised solution, the challenge could be too great for
a small company such as IGM, without the years of experience that produces a
clear product strategy.
Each robot supplier has a different approach, but IGM's is based on two
vital elements, says Langner: a modular design system to allow the company
to respond to individual customers' needs without having to reinvent the
wheel, and the decision to keep all control systems development in-house.
Broadening the appeal of robots to heavy industry requires a combination of
developing the business end of the system (the welding itself), taking the
robot's mechanical engineering to the limits, and constantly updating and
improving the control systems.
IGM develops welding systems together with Fronius, an Austrian welding
equipment company - for the customer, after all, the quality of the weld is
the proof of the pudding. The robot supplier recently introduced a new
high-performance welding technique known as Time (transferred ionised molten
energy), developed originally by a Canadian metallurgical expert.
IGM has also developed an automatic head change facility, allowing welding
to be followed by flame cutting in one continuous cycle. This is being used
by a UK customer for welding steel bridge sections.
As in machine tools, however, while mechanical developments near their limit
it is the brains of the robot system - its software and sensors, and the
programming - that is receiving the lion's share of attention. This is where
the acronyms really begin to proliferate.
So-called off-line programming, where the robot is set up for the next job
without disturbing its present task, is particularly important when it could
take many hours, if not days, to start up a new component on a welding
robot.
IGM's latest contribution is IOPS, which uses computer-aided simulation of
production cells and manufacturing lines to get the best configuration of
the welding cell for each workpiece.
Another important result of the company's R&amp;D work is ISIP, a new
optoelectronic camera system for measuring weld grooves. This uses optical
sensors to determine the position and geometry of the fabrication,
underlining the growing importance of vision systems as the 'eyes' in an
increasingly complex 'eyes-brain-hand' environment.
Perhaps the most significant development at IGM, however, lies at the heart
of the robot software. In a few weeks' time, the company will have running a
prototype of a new robot controller based on the transputer, the Inmos
superchip. IGM had realised some five years ago that it needed to have a
more powerful control system, says Langner, and the new controller will
increase control speeds by a factor of 10.
The new control should be on IGM's robots by next year, but Langner also
sees applications for the control outside robotics, with initial demand of
about 500-1,000 units a year, compared with the 150-200 IGM will need each
year for its robots. 'But we will not market it by ourselves,' Langner
stresses.
