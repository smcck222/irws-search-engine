FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Magnesium bicycle peddles in
from sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Norsk Hydro - the world's largest producer of magnesium - has branched out
into the bicycle business.
Kirk Precision, part of Norsk Hydro and the brainchild of engineer Frank
Kirk, has spent 10 years pioneering high-pressure, high-temperature
die-casting of magnesium alloys. The process allows a lightweight bicycle
frame to be made in just four seconds from the biggest die-casting machine
in the world.
Magnesium alloys for bicycle frames offer several advantages over other
metals: they are one-third lighter, corrosion free, strong and
environmentally friendly.
The 2.5kg of magnesium required for each frame can be extracted from 1.5
cubic metres of sea water, and if the frame was returned to the sea it would
eventually dissolve back to its original state.
The company's mountain bike was voted 'Off Road Bicycle of the Year' in
Japan. Racing and city bikes are to be launched early next year. Kirk
Precision: UK, 071 222 7541.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): No revelations on the cards

The problem with credit cards is that banks and retailers can build up
detailed dossiers on customers without their knowledge or permission.
The latest smart cards, incorporating computer cryptography, allow items to
be bought or cash withdrawn without the bank or retailer knowing details of
each transaction.
The card, which contains a microchip, keeps a tally of expenditure and lets
the owner authorise every transaction using a personal identification
number.
The new cryptographic security feature is based on extended 'public key'
techniques and incorporates a scrambler to separate bank from customer and
customer from store. DigiCash: The Netherlands, 31 20 665 2611.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fast printers to cope with the
load
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Printing lengthy reports or documents, so often a slow and tedious process,
could be quicker and less fiddly using the latest laser printers from
Compaq.
The Pagemaq 15 and Pagemaq 20 are capable of printing 15 and 20 pages per
minute respectively. Both have a paper capacity of 1,500 sheets, thus
minimising trips to the printer to reload.
The new printers connect directly to Novell and Apple networks and can cope
with input from five sources simultaneously. The incorporation of Adobe
PostScript and PCL5 page description languages means only one printer is
required to satisfy the needs of two different software systems.
The Pagemaq 20 is aimed at networks of up to 20 users each; it retails at
Pounds 3,295. The Pagemaq 15 is slightly cheaper at Pounds 2,625 and may be
better suited to smaller concerns. Compaq Computer: UK, 081 332 3354.

secret

<TEXT>
Intercepted fax transmissions, obtained by fair means or foul, can seriously
compromise the wealth of a company.
But a new fax cum scrambler, the Ascom Fax 260, developed by the Integrated
Security Group based in Essex, enables compatible machines, linked by
personalised smart cards, to transmit top-secret messages between authorised
parties.
Faxes transmitted through mis-dialling or intercepted by line-tappers appear
as illegible gobbledegook on the new machine. When not in 'encryptor mode'
the machine functions as a normal fax.
The fax cum scrambler costs around Pounds 1,000 and is already being tested
by the Pentagon and the Intelligence Services in the US. British Telecom
approval for its use in the UK has just been obtained. Integrated Security
Group: UK, 0268 527700.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology: IGM expands its horizons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IGM was founded in 1967 by Gunther Kloimuller and Franz Vokurka, two former
Siemens engineers who are now managing board chairman and supervisory board
chairman respectively at the Austrian company.
It claims about 15 per cent of the world arc welding robot market in money
terms, but rather less in unit terms, as it sells smaller numbers of
relatively expensive equipment. About 50 per cent of the market is in
European hands, with the rest held by big Japanese robot suppliers such as
Yaskawa and GMFanuc.
But with consolidated turnover of Sch524m (Pounds 27m) in the year ended
August 1991, IGM is a minnow in comparison to the Japanese and European
robot giants, and has to exploit every global opportunity to support
research and development spending of about 10 per cent of sales.
To bolster its financial strength, the company went public in 1989, raising
Sch275m from an issue of preference shares, and last year issued ordinary
shares publicly. Just over 50 per cent of the company is retained by the two
founders and their families.
The decision was a timely move. With the worldwide recession in capital
equipment purchases, IGM's sales fell 10-12 per cent in 1990-91, and a
further decline of 4 to 5 per cent is expected for the financial year just
ended.
But IGM has also been particularly effected by the upheaval in the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe, whose share of turnover has dropped from
25.3 per cent in 1989-90 to an expected 14 per cent in the year just ended.
This has prompted an aggressive policy of Far Eastern expansion. A
collaboration agreement last year with India's Bharat Earth Movers was
followed this spring with the establishment of a Korean subsidiary, and IGM
also wants much stronger representation in China.
But the eastern countries are also regarded as very promising long-term  -
the Russians, says Langner, have always been keen on the latest developments
in robotics. Along with its subsidiary in Russia, IGM is negotiating to
establish a Ukrainian subsidiary, and is also manufacturing components at an
86 per cent owned Hungarian subsidiary, Roper Robottechnika.
Although the European Community and Far East are the main export areas, IGM
is also keen to exploit opportunities in the US, where it will open new
offices and production facilities at Milwaukee at the end of this year.

FT  04 SEP 92 / People: Thorpe to SIB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Phillip Thorpe, who had been seconded to London FOX as acting chief
executive following last year's scandal, is not returning to his position as
deputy chief executive of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), but
will spend six months from October assisting Securities and Investments
Board (SIB) boss Andrew Large in a broad review of London's financial
services regulation.
Prompted partly by the general fall-out from the Maxwell affair, as well as
by a request for a limited review of SIB's activities from Chancellor Norman
Lamont, the task Andrew Large has set himself has yet to be clearly defined
 -with the process swinging properly into action when his new assistant can
leave FOX.
Thorpe, 38, who got to know Large when the latter was appointed chairman of
FOX towards the end of last year, practised as a barrister in his native New
Zealand before moving to Hong Kong. After a variety of regulatory jobs, he
was called in to set the Hong Kong Futures Exchange back on its feet after
the 1987 crash.
Known for his direct manner, he is amused by suggestions that he might be
too much of a regulatory insider to cast a sufficiently critical eye over
the workings of SIB. 'I have had three years of serious training for this
event' he says referring to the period he has spent, initially as chief
executive of the AFBD (the futures self-regulatory organisation merged into
the SFA) dealing very closely with the chief regulator SIB.
Meanwhile, at SFA, where Thorpe has been seen as a possible successor when
current boss John Young retires, the official view is simple. 'We all
expected him back on October 1 from FOX. Now we all expect him back on April
1 from SIB.'

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Panel rejects Ewart's claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EWART, the Irish property company whose directors face removal by a
shareholder group, lost its bid to have the Takeover Panel declare the group
a concert party in violation of the Takeover Code.
The Panel agreed that while the shareholders have connected business
interests there was no evidence that they had purchased their shares in
concert with the intention of gaining control of the company.
The battle for control of Ewart, launched at the instigation of Monarch
Properties, its 29.2 per cent shareholder, will be settled later today at an
extraordinary meeting.
Monarch said it had firm commitments guaranteeing it support of 48 per cent
of shareholder votes. Ewart's management has the support of its big
institutional shareholders, including the Prudential, while the dissidents
have the backing of key small private shareholders, some of whom have links
with Mr Philip Monahan, chairman of Monarch.
Documents filed in Dublin and Belfast show that Mr Kevin Anderson holds 3.35
per cent of Ewart through a number of companies including Paramount
Enterprises. He and Mr Monahan both have one-third stakes in Paramount.
The other third is held by companies controlled by Mr Leo Ward, a
businessman. While Mr Ward is not directly a shareholder in Ewart, Savoy, in
which he has a 25 per cent stake, is a Ewart shareholder.
Monarch, in explaining why the dissident shareholders' business connections
had not been disclosed, said: 'We thought it was irrelevant.'

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pentos shares jump 15% despite drop to
Pounds 2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTOS, the bookseller and print retailer, outperformed the stock market
yesterday despite announcing a 17 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the
six months to June 30.
Shares in the group, which owns the Dillons and Athena retailers, jumped 15
per cent to 75p, against a market rise of 3 per cent. Profits fell from
Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.4m, partly as a result of a 32 per cent increase in
interest charges to Pounds 2.5m.
The return was struck on sales 16 per cent higher at Pounds 99.3m (Pounds
85.3m).
Mr Patrick Hooper, finance director, said the group had achieved 'very good
underlying sales' at Dillons. Like for like sales had risen by 3 per cent in
a static market. Overall, Dillons increased turnover by 10 per cent to
Pounds 49.2m.
Mr Hooper said discounting, mostly employed around Christmas, had a minimal
effect in the first half.
He said Pentos was 'keeping its powder dry' with regard to an autumn
discounting campaign involving books covered by the net book agreement. In
the past it campaigned vigorously against the agreement, which sets minimum
prices for most books.
Ryman increased sales by 6 per cent to about Pounds 13.5m, excluding the
office equipment group Wilding which was purchased for Pounds 3.7m in
December. Overall office equipment turnover jumped 94 per cent to Pounds
24.8m.
Athena, the retailer of prints and frame products, had been hard hit by the
property slowdown and sales fell 2 per cent.
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p, from earnings per share 24 per
cent lower at 1.3p (1.7p).

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bulmer gains continental foothold with
Belgian buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP BULMER Holdings, which has 45 per cent of the UK cider market, has
acquired Cidrerie Stassen, a Belgian branded cider company, for BFr414m
(Pounds 7.2m).
Stassen, based in Aubel, near the Dutch and German borders, recorded pre-tax
profits of BFr39m in the year to August 1991 and had assets of BFr115m.
Bulmer said the purchase, which will be funded from additional committed
bank borrowings, was intended to increase its continental presence.
Bulmer already exports cider to Greece, Spain and the US. But has been eager
to obtain a foothold in the growing market on the Continent, where cider has
been successfully marketed against beer as an alternative to wine.
Belgian cider makers have been particularly successful in capitalising on
the growth of the European cider market. Their exports have more than
doubled over the last three years.
Stassen, a family owned company, has expanded its product range in recent
years by the addition of fruit-flavoured ciders to its traditional
continental-style light cider.
Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said: 'With the single market
fast approaching, the acquisition of Stassen provides a bridgehead for
Bulmer's European initiative and for the development of high-quality ciders
in the UK.'
In the 12 months to April 24, Bulmer raised pre-tax profits by 19 per cent
to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 14.4m) on sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 221.9m.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reckitt edges ahead to Pounds 134m - Tough
second half expected with full-year profits little changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the household goods, toiletries, food and pharmaceutical
group with products ranging from mustard to indigestion remedies, managed to
edge interim profits ahead despite the effect of the worldwide recession.
In the half year to end-June pre-tax profits rose by 5.2 per cent to Pounds
134.2m.
The shares initially rose sharply on the news but fell back to close with a
net gain of 5p at 533p. Despite the figures being in line with expectations,
analysts cut their full-year profit forecasts, expecting the second half to
be flat.
Although currency movements had not had a significant effect in the first
half, cutting about Pounds 1m from trading profits of Pounds 151.2m (Pounds
147.5m), Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, warned that currency movements
'will be significantly more adverse in the second half than in the first
half'.
Also the group indicated that trading conditions were getting worse in
continental Europe, especially in Germany and the Benelux countries, while
there were no signs of economic recovery in the UK and North America.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said a 7.2 per cent increase in the interim
dividend to 5.95p took into account the drop in inflation but also the
group's view of the trend of profits in the 1990s despite unfavourable
worldwide conditions.
The dividend increase was slightly greater than the 5 per cent rise in fully
diluted earnings to 21.24p.
He said the results were not directly comparable with the previous year's
because a number of businesses had been sold, notably the US spice and
seasoning subsidiary. Group sales fell 5.9 per cent to Pounds 935.7m, but
were up 5 per cent on a comparable basis. The trading profit rise of 2.5 per
cent to Pounds 151.2m, masked an underlying improvement of over 5 per cent.
The group increased trading profit margins from 14.8 per cent to 16.2 per
cent. Of the rise, nearly two thirds was due to the disposals which had been
of lower margin operations. The other one third came from greater
efficiencies in the business, Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said.
He said there had been a number of new product launches and relaunches
around the world and marketing spending had increased as a percentage of
sales. In the US the company launched Air Waves, an electrical air
freshener, and a range of woodland fragrance air fresheners.
Trading profits from household goods and toiletries were slightly ahead at
Pounds 104.6m (Pounds 103.4m) as disposals took profits out and the cost of
product launches dampened growth.
Food profits rose from Pounds 20.8m to Pounds 21.2m. The pharmaceutical
division made Pounds 20m (Pounds 19.4m) and other activities added Pounds
5.5m (Pounds 3.9m).
Interest payable fell from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds 17m, as the group had
raised over Pounds 150m from disposals.
There was an extraordinary debit of Pounds 52m (Pounds 7.3m) relating to the
sale of the spice and seasoning business, which the group had already
announced. The figure includes trading losses of Pounds 9.1m.
COMMENT
Although Reckitt's range of products is hardly the most exposed to
recession, the group has nevertheless done well to improve profits in such a
hostile environment. The second half will be even tougher going and the
group will do well to get profits up much this year from last time's Pounds
252.3m, implying a prospective p/e of about 13. Reckitt's longer-term
strategy appears wise. Having gained the market positions in the products
and countries it desired through acquisition, it will now concentrate on
building its brands through new product launches and marketing investment.
Even so, when - or perhaps if - the world economy recovers Reckitt's prized
resilience will lose its attractions.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charges behind Ladbroke's
5% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEAR Pounds 14m reduction in interest costs helped Ladbroke Group, the
leisure concern, increase pre-tax profit by 5 per cent, from Pounds 98.2m to
Pounds 103.2m, in the six months to June 30.
The lessening of the interest bill followed a Pounds 464m rights issue in
August last year, which cut net debt from just over Pounds 1.6bn.
By the period end borrowings stood at Pounds 1.05bn, giving gearing of 35
per cent.
Operating profit declined to Pounds 147.8m (Pounds 156.5m) on turnover of
Pounds 1.99bn (Pounds 1.96bn). Interest costs of Pounds 44.6m (Pounds 58.3m)
were covered 3.3 times.
The hotels division, mainly the Hilton International chain, saw operating
profit fall by Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 68m on flat turnover of Pounds 383.2m.
Hotel sales accounted for Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 25.6m).
Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, said: 'The big change is that Japan was roaring
away in the first half of last year, but it has gone the other way because
of cuts in corporate spending on entertainment.' It was the only country
where normally the revenue from food and drink outweighed that from rooms.
Hotel occupancy levels slipped to an average of 65 per cent worldwide.
However, the second half was traditionally better. The dollar-related
profits of the hotel division were mainly responsible for the Pounds 2.5m
sliced off profits by currency movements.
While the UK betting shops and Vernons football pools operation held up
well, recession hit credit betting. This was the main factor behind a fall
in the racing division's profit to Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 45m). Loss-making
shops in Belgium had been closed.
Texas Homecare lifted profit to Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 23.7m) on sales of
Pounds 366.6m (Pounds 318.9m) from 229 stores.
Losses from the property division deepened to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.6m).
Mr Stein said interest that had previously been capitalised was now charged.
Overall, the amount of interest capitalised was cut from Pounds 28.1m to
Pounds 3.1m.
The underlying performance was better. Rents would be worth Pounds 60m this
year. By mid-1994, when rent-free periods ran out and with the tail-end of
the buildings let, the annual rental would be Pounds 80m - a yield of about
8 per cent on a portfolio currently valued at nearly Pounds 1bn.
About a third of the portfolio was due for revaluation. If values were
written down, it was only 'a book entry', he said.
It would not affect the final dividend, which the board was planning to at
least hold at last year's level of 6.23p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 4.92p. Earnings per share, affected by
a higher tax charge and extra equity, slipped to 6.47p (7.82p).

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Diversified Iceland achieves 19% gain to
Pounds 24.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHIFT in strategy, from freezer centre to high street convenience food
retailer, helped Iceland Frozen Foods Holdings report a 19 per cent advance
in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.2m.
However, signs that Iceland's strong like-for-like sales growth could be
slowing down appeared to knock the shares back. Iceland shares closed 16p
down at 485p.
Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman, said Iceland had achieved 11 per cent sales
growth in the six months to June 27, including inflation of some 2 per cent.
This was expected to fall back to 7 per cent in the second half, compared
with 16 per cent in the second half of 1991.
Overall sales improved by 16 per cent to Pounds 480m.
The main sales growth came from chilled foods and an increased number of
weekly transactions. However, operating margins were trimmed back from 6.3
to 6.1 per cent as a result of the lower return on chilled products.
Mr Bernard Leigh, finance director, said he expected that margins would not
fall any further.
The proportion of chilled foods increased from 11 per cent to 13 per cent of
sales. Frozen foods accounted for 57 per cent of volume, against 60 per cent
last year.
Mr Walker insisted that Iceland was not abandoning its traditional frozen
food market. However, he said, 'we are seriously in the chilled food
business, as well as frozen foods'. Iceland was also testing the
introduction of fresh produce in some of its stores.
During the first half Iceland opened 14 new stores, for a total of 542. The
group planned an aggressive opening programme in the second half, and a
record 50 new stores next year.
Capital expenditure would be Pounds 57m for the full year, slightly higher
than initially anticipated.
Profits were boosted by a Pounds 1m reduction in interest charges to Pounds
4.9m.
Gearing was expected to be about 40 per cent by the year-end, against 54 per
cent last year.
The dividend was increased by 17 per cent to 3.1p. Earnings per share rose
from 14.09p to 16.44p.
COMMENT
Iceland's reputation for double digit sales growth has helped the shares
outperform the food retailing sector by more than 30 per cent over the last
year. But doubts are creeping in to the share price, despite thoroughly
commendable results. Again, investors are asking themselves whether
Iceland's philosophy will work in the 1990s. The more the company
diversifies, the less it is standing out from the army of other value-led
retailers. The company's answer appears to be to keep its reputation for the
growth through record store openings. The strong management is likely to
achieve this, but eventually they will have to come to longer-term decisions
on strategy. Forecasts are for Pounds 55m pre-tax. The prospective multiple
of 13 may yet not fully reflect the niggling doubts about Iceland's
philosophy.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hartwell takes Trimoco after share buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTWELL, the Saudi-Arabian controlled motor group, yesterday won control of
Trimoco, another motor trader.
Its target capitulated after another 5 per cent of the shares were sold to
Hartwell, taking its stake to 46.5 per cent.
The cash offer, increased this week to 20p a share, values Trimoco at Pounds
29.6m.
The towel was thrown in with some reluctance. Trimoco said it continued to
believe that the offer undervalued the group and its prospects. Its
recommendation, following the increase in Hartwell's stake, aimed to clear
up any uncertainty among the group's 14,000 small shareholders.
Hartwell now faces the prospect of being asked by Ford to sell four
dealerships. The combined group will have a total of 12 Ford dealerships and
the maximum dictated by the manufacturer is eight.
Mr Ron Farrall, Ford's director of dealer operation, said: 'We have an eight
dealership rule: that I will not negotiate on. The two parties, Trimoco and
Hartwell, are fully aware of our policy.'
He believed the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on UK new car
sales, which was critical of some manufacturers' restrictions, would not
affect rules on the number of dealerships.
If disposals were enforced, about a year's grace might be given and Ford
would help with the sales, he said.
Hartwell would only say that it would continue its discussions with Ford.
Trimoco is dominated by Ford dealerships, of which it has six. It also has
two Vauxhall and one Peugeot.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance reviews reinsurance policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurer, is seeking to increase the level of its
reinsurance protection following continuing heavy losses and a fall in its
asset base and solvency.
In recent years, the company, which is the best capitalised insurer in the
UK, has bought less reinsurance cover than its biggest competitors,
preferring to carry more insurance exposure on its own books.
But Mr Scott Nelson, general manager, indicated yesterday that the policy
was being reviewed following recent weather losses, claims of Pounds 42m
after the IRA bombs in April, and a decline in the value of its equity and
property assets.
During the autumn the company would seek to reduce the limits at which its
catastrophe reinsurance policies came into play.
Mr Nelson warned, however, that conditions on the reinsurance market were
'very tough. We can't be confident that we will achieve what we want.'
COMMENT
Sun Alliance's share price shot up by 31p following its results
announcement, which showed that pre-tax losses at Pounds 97.9m to be less
serious than many analysts had feared. Like its competitors, the company is
beginning to reap the benefits of premium increases and more selective
underwriting.
The fact remains though that failing any sudden turnround in the housing
market, Sun Alliance's heavy exposure to the black hole of mortgage
indemnity insurance will continue to depress the profitability which is
emerging in most of its other businesses until at least well into next year.
Moreover, Sun Alliance has invested more heavily in the UK equity and
commercial property markets than any of its rivals, making it especially
dependent on the fortunes of the wider economy. Potential investors would
need to ask themselves whether those risks are adequately reflected in
yesterday's closing price of 253p. Assuming a maintained dividend, this puts
the shares on a yield of just under 8, compared to a sector average of under
7.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur delays issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inntrepreneur Estates, the joint venture company set up by Grand
Metropolitan and Courage in 1990, has decided to delay its Pounds 250m
debenture issue until the UK economy shows signs of recovering. The issue
was expected to be launched this summer, writes Sara Webb.
The debenture will be used to extend debt maturity profile, bankers said. It
has about Pounds 1.2bn outstanding in five-year banking facilities which it
wants to refinance. The company raised about Pounds 1.5bn from a syndicate
of banks in 1991 for the acquisition of pubs. The main Pounds 1.33bn credit
was syndicated among 20 banks, arranged by Citicorp, SG Warburg, Barclays
and NatWest.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Labour anger as Major rejects recall of parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR leadership reacted angrily yesterday when Mr John Major dismissed
the party's formal request for a recall of parliament to debate
international affairs and the state of the UK economy.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said he was astonished and angry that the
prime minister had rejected the call for MPs to reassemble to discuss the
civil conflicts in Bosnia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, and Iraq, the famine
in Somalia and the British recession.
When the leader of the opposition asks for parliament to be brought back
from recess, the request is usually granted, although there are a few
examples in recent years when it has been turned down.
The rejection of the call was seen at Westminster as a blow to Mr Smith, in
the short term at least. He has already come under fire from some Labour
backbenchers for not having been tough enough in attacking the government
since he became leader in July.
However, Labour frontbenchers argued that the prime minister's refusal was a
mistake which the government would find hard to explain.
While there would have been clear political risks for the government in
agreeing to an emergency debate on the economy, there was surprise among Mr
Smith's aides that Mr Major had not taken the opportunity to bring
parliament back solely for a foreign affairs debate.
Responding to Mr Smith's letter, Mr Major said he had briefed the Labour
leader after he made the decision to offer UK troops which would offer
support to the United Nations' humanitarian relief effort in Bosnia and to
establish a no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
'You agreed then that a recall of parliament was not appropriate and I fail
to see what has happened since then to change that view,' he wrote.
Labour argued that it had not wanted to detract from the London peace
conference last week, but deployment of British troops was now so imminent
that the matter merited debate by MPs.
The opposition's request coincided with speculation that British troops
could join the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia shortly.
The Liberal Democrats, who have been asking for parliament to be recalled
for the past three weeks, said that in not making a formal request more
quickly, Labour had enabled the government to avoid its responsibilities to
Westminster.

FT  04 SEP 92 / BBC plans return to its roots: Blueprint reveals strategy to
quit 'derivative formula' programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC plans to return to its public service origins in order to justify
its future.
Confidential documents prepared for the corporation's board of management
and governors show that the BBC is planning to abandon programmes already
provided by commercial rivals.
Instead, the BBC will concentrate on what is distinctive to it and what it
believes the commercial market will not provide.
What the draft report describes as 'derivative formula' comedy shows and
unchallenging game shows will be dispensed with.
There is still uncertainty in the BBC about what a policy of going for 'the
higher ground' would mean in programming terms. Home produced soaps such as
EastEnders would probably survive, but not necessarily cheap bought-in
programmes such as Neighbours.
The blueprint for the future of the BBC under Mr John Birt, who takes over
as director general on March 1, was due to be published later this autumn.
The intention was to publish the document after a green paper on the future
of the corporation, expected in early October.
A copy of the blueprint arrived at Broadcast magazine, the industry trade
magazine, on Tuesday after the furore about the future of the BBC at the
Edinburgh Television Festival last weekend.
In an important paragraph, the report says: 'The BBC will need to withdraw
from areas in which it is no longer able or needed to make an original
contribution.'
In trying to come to terms with the intensified competition from commercial
and satellite television the BBC emphasises, however, that it must avoid the
'cultural ghetto' that weakened public broadcasting in the US and Australia.
It concludes instead that the BBC of the 1990s 'should offer a range of
distinctive, high-quality programme services in each of the major genres.
That range should encompass programming that appeals to a broad viewing and
listening audience as well as programming which meets specific needs and
interests of smaller audiences'.
The BBC has decided to set itself four main tasks: the provision of news and
information to support fair and informed national debate; development and
expression of British culture and entertainment; programmes and services
creating opportunities for education; interchange of culture and ideas
between Britain and abroad.
On this basis, the BBC will ask the government to renew its Royal Charter in
1996 and the universal licence which finances the corporation.
The details include a continuous news service on radio and a 24-hour
satellite and cable television news service, as well as the restoration of
the corporation's reputation for drama in order to make the BBC 'the
National Theatre of the airwaves'.
Above all else, the BBC points to the need to 'limit and define' its
specific role as a public service broadcaster in the face of rapidly growing
competition.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Kevin Maxwell bankrupt with debts over Pounds 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell, whose father, Robert Maxwell, was one of Britain's richest
men, yesterday became Britain's biggest ever bankrupt, with debts of over
Pounds 400m.
At the end of a 95-minute private hearing in the High Court, a bankruptcy
court registrar declared Mr Maxwell bankrupt on a petition presented by the
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, a company from which
millions of pounds of Maxwell empire pension funds were removed.
Mr Maxwell also faces criminal charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud
involving Pounds 135m following the collapse of his father's empire.
Outside the High Court a grave Mr Maxwell said: 'I stand here today a
bankrupt with a deal of humility. Bankruptcy is a very public humbling.'
'If there is a redeeming feature of the bankruptcy order, it is perhaps that
the thousands of people who have suffered loss can take real satisfaction
from seeing a former director - and I suppose, above all, a Maxwell - suffer
the consequences of their loss personally and in public. Perhaps those
concerned believe this alone justifies the cost to creditors of these
proceedings given the very small extent of my estate and my assets.'
He said the bankruptcy order had been inevitable after the Pounds 406.8m
order the liquidators obtained against him on July 20.
'As I said at the time, I did not have the resources to continue to defend
their claims against me as I would have wished. Had I had the resources, I
would have strenuously denied all the allegations of breach of duty.'
'I believe Bishopsgate's pursuit of my bankruptcy has been misconceived. The
voluntary arrangement which I proposed for my creditors, which they
dismissed, would have been in the best interests of my creditors.'
Miss Margaret Cole, of Stephenson Harwood, solicitor to Robson Rhodes, the
liquidator, said the court had appointed the Official Receiver to take over
Mr Maxwell's affairs.
She said an application under the Insolvency Act would be made to Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, for the immediate appointment of
trustees in bankruptcy, who would be the legal owners of Mr Maxwell's
assets.
The trustees would be Mr Peter Dubuisson and Mr Philip Sykes, partners in
accountants Binder Hamlyn.
Miss Cole said that the trustees, who would collect and distribute to
creditors Mr Maxwell's assets, would have the power to set aside
transactions by him in the last two or five years.
If Mr Maxwell co-operates with his trustees he can expect his bankruptcy to
be discharged in three years. Until then he cannot be involved in any way in
company management.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No less than 12 UK companies with a stock market capitalisation of more than
Pounds 100m - including five Footsie constituents - reported interim figures
yesterday. Not one of them cut their dividend. The average increase in their
payouts, indeed, was broadly in line with inflation at 3.8 per cent. On the
view that dividends are one expression of a company's confidence over the
medium term, the trend must be mildly encouraging. It is worth pointing out,
however, that while yesterday's sample reflected a wide spectrum of
businesses, the only representative from the stricken building sector was a
small housebuilder of proven quality.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke's shares have taken a beating since the election. Yielding around
10 per cent - some 50 per cent above the sector average - investors may ask
if the selling has gone too far. Judging by yesterday's interim results, it
is too soon for a re-evaluation. Hotels and property remain dependent on the
elusive economic recovery. Added to that, Ladbroke has over Pounds 1bn of
net borrowings. Though gearing is only 35 per cent, that has to be seen in
the context of Pounds 831m of intangible assets on the balance sheet and
about Dollars 1bn of property which may face further provisions. At present
the company intends to maintain this year's dividend. What remains unclear
is the extent to which the company's cash flow will allow it to increase the
payment in future.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In many ways Rolls was lucky that its unexpectedly poor interim results came
on a day when the stock market generally pepped up. Its share price, down 4p
at 128p, admittedly stood out as one of a mere handful that fell; the damage
might have been considerably worse, though, if background sentiment had been
weak.
The chief explanation for a first half profit of just Pounds 20m - almost
double last year's figure but well below most hopes for Pounds 30m-Pounds
35m - seems to have been the impact of the dollar. Investors have to take
the company's word that this knocked Pounds 10m off the result; in the
absence of any information about Rolls' forward cover or the assumptions it
makes about realised exchange rates they are nevertheless entitled to be
cautious about the outcome for the year. To some extent, however, the market
has only itself to blame for getting carried away about the prospects for
recovery in civil spares which Rolls was always anxious to play down.
The combination of the company's technological and marketing skills still
holds out the promise of long-term jam; on the basis of yesterday's figures,
though, the progress in getting there is going to be somewhat slower.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having turned its back on hostile takeovers following last year's failed bid
for Racal, Williams is now earnestly proclaiming the attractions of debt
finance. Sceptics will argue that Messrs Rudd and McGowan are making a
virtue out of necessity. The shares are trading at a 15 per cent price
earnings discount to the market, hardly a position of strength. Whatever the
reasoning, the new approach struck a chord with the market. Yesterday's 7
per cent rise in the share price was underpinned by relief that a
respectable set of interim figures was not blemished by an equity-financed
acquisition.
What the future holds for a conglomerate restricted to friendly, debt-funded
acquisitions is another matter. Williams' diversity may leave it less
exposed to the dangers of debt finance in a downturn than some other
companies, but the market will want to see gearing and interest cover
maintained at prudent levels. If the interest bill is to be covered, say,
six times by earnings, around Pounds 200m additional debt could be raised to
fund acquisitions. This hardly leaves Williams hamstrung, but it would seem
to rule out a big move.
On the evidence of yesterday's 6 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits
Williams may yet enhance its reputation for tight management. In most areas
margins continued to improve, and the building products side in particular
is showing remarkable resilience to recession. Without the distraction of
failed bids or controversial accounting policies, such strengths may be
better reflected in the share price. Yet old takeover habits die hard: the
market may well be reluctant for now to put the shares on an above average
rating again.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's big move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Civil servants like elegance, and borrowing Ecu10bn to buy pounds and fund
the borrowing requirement neatly manages to kill two birds with one stone.
Interestingly, this Treasury stunt for supporting sterling pleased the gilt
and equity markets, which both managed healthy gains yesterday. But the
foreign exchanges seemed slightly sceptical. The reaction in gilts is
understandable given that the market now has to face some Pounds 7.5bn less
supply this year. Equities will be impressed not so much by the government's
defence of the ERM parities as by its fierce determination to avoid an
interest rate rise. As for the foreign exchanges, while the amounts involved
are substantial, the money must still be used skilfully to drive sterling
higher.
The gesture of the commitment is certainly the most important part of this
announcement. But investors should bear in mind that if the gamble fails and
sterling eventually falls, the government's loss, though substantial, would
hardly be fatal. And given its rigid adherence to the parity, the Treasury
also seems strangely reluctant in this case to make a long-term commitment.
With interest rates at current levels, the government could save itself 2
percentage points in interest by borrowing marks through 10 or 20 year
bonds, rather than shorter term bank loans.
While the scheme hands the Treasury plenty of firepower in the run up to the
French referendum, this alone is not going to affect significantly the
supply and demand balance in the foreign exchanges. Investors will no doubt
still ponder the fundamental position of the UK economy and the amount of
intervention which may be required if the French say No.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Courtaulds Textiles gloomy over upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS TEXTILES, the UK's second biggest textiles and clothing
manufacturer, issued a bleak warning on prospects for recovery yesterday,
saying that 'there are no signs of improvement in trading conditions'.
The company blamed 'the high level of European interest rates (which were)
seriously depressing consumer spending and business confidence'.
In addition 'the over-valuation of European currencies against the US dollar
undermined competitiveness'. Without the dollar's fall, pre-tax profit would
have risen by twice as much as it did, said the company.
The statement came with the company's half-year results which showed a small
improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 17m from Pounds 16.6m in spite of a
fall in turnover to Pounds 394.9m from Pounds 451.6m. Earnings per share
rose to 12.7p (12.3p) and the dividend was raised to 4.4p (4.2p).
The higher profits were largely the result of cost-cutting and strong cash
flow to cut debt, said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive. 'It is a case of
fewer people with less capital working harder in more difficult
circumstances to make more money.'
'Even the strong businesses have had a tough time. Profits have been
improved by cutting out the weak,' he said.
The difficulties showed up at the operating level, where profits were down
from Pounds 20.4m to Pounds 19.7m. 'Chronic dollar weakness added to the
pressure on margins,' said Mr Taylor.
Courtaulds Textiles is especially exposed to the performance of the dollar
against European currencies because it has 80 per cent of its production in
Europe. The dollar's fall has left the company vulnerable to cheap imports
from the Far East, where many currencies are dollar-linked.
Adjusting for disposals, closures and foreign exchange transactions,
turnover would have fallen only 3.5 per cent, instead of 12.6 per cent.
Since Courtaulds Textiles was demerged from the chemicals company Courtaulds
in March 1990, it has pursued a policy of tight control over costs, working
capital and cash flow.
That cash flow has been used to cut debt steadily from a gearing of 50 per
cent at the time of the demerger to less than 5 per cent forecast for the
end of the current year. This was reflected at the interim stage in a
further fall in interest charges to Pounds 3.1m from Pounds 5.6m. There were
exceptional charges of Pounds 2m.
Courtaulds Textiles shares rose 13p to 386p.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce fails to reach forecasts: Pressure mounts on
Britain's dollar-sensitive companies as US currency weakens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE weak dollar depressed Rolls-Royce's first-half profits, already under
pressure from the slump in the commercial airline industry and a shrinking
defence market.
Although the UK aero-engine and industrial power group's first-half pre-tax
profits rose to Pounds 20m from Pounds 11m the previous year, this was at
the bottom end of City forecasts of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 40m.
The shares fell 4p yesterday to close at 128p in a strong market.
The company said the weak dollar had reduced profits by about Pounds 10m
compared with last year. Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive who succeeds Lord
Tombs as chairman next month, said the company had a dollar exposure of
between 22 per cent and 23 per cent of turnover.
The weaker dollar is benefitting Rolls-Royce's two principal US rivals,
General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
Sir Ralph said the company would pursue its drive to improve efficiency
leading to further job cuts in the second half. The workforce has been cut
by about 9,000 people during the past 18 months and between 800 and 1,800
more cuts are expected in the second half of this year.
Restructuring charges totalled Pounds 14m in the first half.
The company's confidence in the long-term is reflected in the decision to
maintain its interim dividend unchanged at 2.55p but it is uncovered by
earnings of 0.9p per share.
Lord Tombs said the company was encouraged by its strong order books of
Pounds 6.7bn.
First-half turnover declined 2 per cent to Pounds 1.638bn from Pounds
1.67bn.
Aerospace activities reported a Pounds 2m profit compared with a Pounds 10m
loss last year with turnover dipping to Pounds 924m from Pounds 987m. The
industrial power business reported higher profits of Pounds 28m against
Pounds 26m with sales rising to Pounds 714m from Pounds 683m.
Company-funded research and development investments was Pounds 109m in the
first half, down from Pounds 118m a year ago.
Sir Ralph said the civil airline business had strong growth potential, but a
recovery would hinge on a world economic turnaround.
The company was continuing to shrink its defence business but maintaining
the capability to take advantage of a sudden pick-up.
Sir Ralph was optimistic Saudi Arabia would go ahead with its order of
between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn for Tornado and Hawk aircraft.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Losses on housing hit Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE problems of the housing market are holding back the pace of recovery at
Sun Alliance, the insurer, which yesterday reported an interim pre-tax loss
of Pounds 97.9m.
The result compared with a loss of Pounds 114.1m at the halfway stage in
1991. Losses per share rose to 14.1p, from 13.5p, and the interim dividend
was maintained at 5.25p.
Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity business, which insures mortgage
lenders against losses on their sales of repossessed properties, were
estimated at Pounds 108m.
Total provisions against mortgage indemnity claims amounted to Pounds 435m.
Mr Roger Neville, chief executive, said: 'The problem will continue until
the housing market and the economy generally make a sustained recovery.'
The loss overshadowed steady improvements in most other areas, where
underwriting results have benefited from rises in premium rates and a fall
in losses from subsidence and bad weather.
Motor rates have been increased by up to 30 per cent, while rate increases
of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent had been achieved in the commercial
risks market, according to Mr Scott Nelson, general manager.
Rising premium rates helped reduce the overall underwriting loss to Pounds
280.8m (Pounds 305.2m). UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 244.7m
(Pounds 243.4m) but some Pounds 42m of this loss was due to the group's
exposure to the IRA bombs in London this April.
Subsidiaries in New Zealand, South Africa, Denmark and Ireland all reported
underwriting profits.
Life insurance profits rose 9 per cent to Pounds 27.3m (Pounds 25.9m) while
investment income fell to Pounds 155.6m (Pounds 165.2m).
UK staff numbers have been cut by 12 per cent in the past 18 months.
Shareholders' funds at June 30, excluding the value of the life business,
amounted to Pounds 1.39bn. Provision has been made for a fall in UK and
overseas property values during the first half.
Since the end of last year the solvency margin (which measures net assets as
a percentage of non-life premium income) has fallen from 69 per cent to 56
per cent. Excluding minority interests the margin was 51 per cent.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Strength of sterling sparks off interim complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the markets' attention has been riveted on the pound's weakness within
the ERM, company chairmen have been peppering their interim reports with
complaints about sterling's strength.
Yesterday, for example, Rolls-Royce, Courtaulds Textiles Burmah Castrol,
Ladbroke and Reckitt &amp; Colman all drew attention to the impact on their
results. At Rolls-Royce, the weak dollar reduced half-year profits by about
Pounds 10m compared with the same period the year before. Courtaulds
Textiles said its pre-tax interim profit had been half as high as it should
have been because of the dollar's weakness.
Burmah Castrol said that if the dollar remained at its current level, there
could be a 10 per cent deterioration of the dollar-related portion of its
profits in the second half.
For UK companies with operations in the US, every dollar of American profits
is now worth less when converted into pounds. And those that export from
Britain have costs that seem high in dollar terms, placing them at a
disadvantage in the US market or when competing with rivals with costs
denominated in dollars.
Analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, put together a
hypothetical portfolio of companies with high overseas earnings, most of
them heavily exposed to the dollar. It has actually done rather better than
the market as a whole in recent weeks.
Mr Alun Jones of UBS says part of this is due to a relatively strong
performance by big pharmaceutical stocks, which have been affected by
factors other than currencies. Stripping out those companies, however, still
leaves the overseas earners performing no worse than the market as a whole.
He believes this is because the recovering US economy gives many of the
companies concerned healthier revenues, offseting what they lose from
currency translation.
Those companies which suffer the dollar effect without a big enough offset
from US demand, however, have the worst of both worlds. Oil companies and

FT  04 SEP 92 / BP confirms talks on possible sale of Australian mine stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM, the UK oil group, said yesterday it had been negotiating
with a potential buyer of its 49 per cent shareholding in the Olympic Dam
copper-gold-uranium mine in South Australia for nine to 10 months, but it
would take several more weeks before it knew if a deal could be signed.
Analysts suggested this might provide an opportunity for Western Mining
Corporation, which owns the other 51 per cent of Olympic Dam and is the
operator, to trigger its pre-emptive right to buy the BP stake.
WMC would have 90 days to exercise its right to buy after being informed by
BP of the agreed sale terms.
BP said it had also still to discuss the potential sale with Australia's
Foreign Investment Review Board. This implies the would-be buyer is not
Australian, which rules out both WMC and another potential front runner,
CRA.
While refusing to identify the potential buyer, BP denied press suggestions
that it was talking to Cogema (Cie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires), the
French uranium group. Analysts suggested yesterday that some Japanese or
South African groups might be interested in the stake. Gencor of South
Africa said recently it was on the verge of announcing an important offshore
investment. 'Could this be it?' asked Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst with Societe
Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities.
He said Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, might also be a potential buyer.
BP's search for buyers has been complicated not only by WMC's right of first
refusal but also because there is a clause in the joint venture agreement
which requires BP to finance 100 per cent of the expansion of Olympic Dam up
to 120,000 tonnes of copper a year. Capacity at the mine was recently
boosted to 65,000 tonnes but any potential buyer would have to agree to take
on BP's commitment to spend several hundred million dollars on further
expansion.
WMC derived a net profit of ADollars 19m from its investment in Olympic Dam
in 1991-92, on revenue of ADollars 130.3m (Pounds 46.7m). The mine is valued
in the group's books at ADollars 425m.

FT  04 SEP 92 / IBM to form separate PC unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines has decided to spin off its personal
computer operations as a separate business.
The world's largest computer manufacturer said yesterday that it had
established a new unit, the IBM Personal Computer Company (IPCC), with
responsibility for developing, manufacturing, distributing and marketing the
company's range of personal computers.
IPCC will be based in Somers, New York State; Mr Robert Corrigan has been
named president and Mr Edward Rogers, chief financial officer. With
inherited annual sales of about Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.5bn), it starts life
as the world's largest personal computer concern.
Yesterday's announcement confirms earlier reports that Mr James Cannavino,
IBM's general manager of personal systems, has been anxious to focus IBM's
personal computer activities in a single, autonomous division.
IPCC will remain within IBM's corporate structure but will have greatly
increased freedom in setting budgets, sourcing components and recruiting
staff.
The personal computer business depends on speed and flexibility to market
changes and is far removed from the mainframe and minicomputer businesses
which constitute IBM's traditional strengths.
IBM created the modern personal computer market, but has increasingly been
under pressure from competitors manufacturing copies, or clones, of its
best-selling design and marketing them through unconventional channels, such
as mail order. It has seen its global market share slide from more than 30
per cent to under 20 per cent as competitors, including Dell and Compaq as
well as Asian manufacturers, have brought out innovative, low-cost products
of equivalent quality.
In Europe and Canada it has already formed wholly owned subsidiaries to sell
low-cost clones sourced from Asia.
Industry observers said the formation of IPCC seemed a cosmetic gesture
rather than a fundamental attempt to create a true personal computer culture
within the mainframe giant.
They say the company's products will continue to be marketed by IBM's sales
force while the structure of the personal computer business in Europe will
remain largely unchanged.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES CHRISTIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have received a carefully crafted 'Computation of interest and notice
to pay' from the Inland Revenue explaining why I owed it 20 pence - yes 20 -
on tax overdue for the period July 1 to July 3 1992. Now, I appreciate the
tax man has got me bang to rights and I have no option but to pay up, but
doesn't the Revenue work for the same government that has consistently
refused to introduce legislation to allow traders a statutory right to levy
interest on the monies they are owed?
In the commercial world we can count ourselves lucky to be paid within 60
days. As for charging interest on late payments, forget it - the only way
many businesses can ensure prompt payment is to offer their customers a
discount on the price. All of which prompts me to ask: do the government and
the Inland Revenue live on the same planet as the rest of us?

Everyone knows that 'man' is the answer to the Sphinx's ancient riddle of
'what moves on four legs in the morning, two in the day, and three in the
evening?' But what, besides doing that, travels on six legs late at night?
The answer is a drunken customer of the Red Lion inn at Liskeard in
Cornwall, where boozers who've had one too many at closing time are issued
with four-footed walking frames to help them home.
Landlord Chris Warden, who found the 20 frames in the cellar when he took

FT  04 SEP 92 / Observer: Abs's last stand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't cross Hermann Abs, the grand old man of German banking. It may come as
a surprise but there are still some executives in Germany who haven't yet
taken this basic banking tenet to heart.
The latest casualty is Klaus Gallwitz, director of the Stadel, Frankfurt's
premier art gallery, who has been forced to take early retirement. The
reason is one row too many with the almost 91-year-old Abs, who besides
being Deutsche Bank's honorary president, has been the gallery's chairman
for two decades and more.
Gallwitz's departure next March will put an end to 19 years of feuding with
his chairman. Their relationship seemed doomed from the start. Abs
interfered with Gallwitz's first artistic decision at the gallery - the
removal of a sentimental Goethe portrait from prominent display.
Matters then went from bad to worse, the last straw coming 11 months ago
when Gallwitz sent Abs a present for his 90th birthday - a catalogue of the
museum's contents with completely blank pages.
For a town which probably spends more than any other in Germany on culture -
DM 470m a year - the saga of Abs and the art gallery director is fast
becoming an embarrassment. The burghers of Frankfurt, who have to foot the
bill, are increasingly nettled by the nonagenarian's meddling.
Abs apparently favours Herbert Beck, director of the nearby Liebig sculpture
museum, to take over from Gallwitz. Linda Reisch, the present cultural
administrator of Frankfurt, is keeping her mouth shut, but it is rumoured
that she is backing Christoph Vitali, head of another local museum. If
Vitali doesn't get the job he may move on.
In the view of a growing number of Frankfurters, however, Abs should be the
one to resign.

Helping out Halton Borough Council does not sound quite as romantic as
buying up hundreds of square miles of African rainforests to save the
gorillas. But it adds another green strand to the colourful career of Tim
Midgeley, director of Biomass which has won a 20-year contract to recycle
all the council's household rubbish
The Staffordshire-based environmentalist and businessman hit the headlines
in May when Biomass took over Oxford United Football Club, which was
previously owned by the late Robert Maxwell. Like Cap'n Bob, Midgeley is a
man with big ideas and he wants Oxford to have an 'ecologically benign
stadium' partly powered by solar panels. It would demonstrate Biomass's
ethics of sustainable use of energy to Oxford United's fans.
Two years ago Midgeley, who once worked in the environment department,
teamed up with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers' president Roy Lynk to
mount a Pounds 1.5bn bid for Powergen, backed by the venture capital arm of
the Legal &amp; General insurance group. It came to nothing. But Midgeley
remains upbeat on the idea of investing in energy. 'Watch this space - coal
could be very interesting', is all he'll say about Biomass's future plans.

Heaven knows there are pressing questions aplenty facing the European
Community finance ministers at this weekend's meeting in Bath. Quite apart
from the present mayhem in currency markets, there's the matter of how to
stop the exchange rate mechanism etc from going down the plughole if the
French say no in the referendum on September 20.
So what sort of a programme has Britain's Norman Lamont in mind for his EC
guests?
Well, dinner tonight of course. But his welcoming letter says it's to be a
'purely informal occasion, at which I do not intend any business to be
done.' Then 'for our spouses there will be an opportunity to visit Wells and
to see an example of how traditional English country cheese was prepared in
the West Country.'
While the letter includes an agenda, the topics seem hazily focused to say
the least - 'the economic situation in the Community', for example. And
thereafter Lamont devotes two pages to asking his European counterparts to
join him in discussing how to gain greater powers for their own Council of
EC Finance Ministers.
Such things are highly important, no doubt. But this does seem an odd moment
to have the community's finance supremos contemplating their navels and
advancing their trade union interests.

FT  04 SEP 92 / British unions seek Blackpool illumination: Next week's TUC
meeting will hear demands for the organisation to develop a more focused
role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there any point in having a Trades Union Congress? The 1,000 delegates
who meet in Blackpool next week for the 124th annual gathering of Britain's
'parliament of labour' must be tired of hearing that question from sceptical
outsiders.
But it is not an unreasonable one, even from people who believe that trade
unions continue to have an important role in industrial life. Indeed, it is
a question that the congress will debate this year, albeit in coded form.
The TUC is, confusingly, both the annual seaside gathering and a bureaucracy
based in London with regional branches. The latter employs about 230 people
and attempts to define and communicate common union standpoints and enforce
certain club rules, such as those banning the poaching of members by rival
unions.
Consideration has been given to making the seaside gathering a biennial
affair but the idea was rejected on the grounds that it is, in the words of
one TUC official, a 'unique PR opportunity'. That might seem an odd notion
given that for several years, and this year more than ever, pre-TUC media
coverage centres on when Mr Norman Willis, the jovial but ineffectual TUC
general secretary, will resign.
Almost all industrial countries have a central trade union body similar to
the TUC. Some, such as France, have the misfortune to have two, based on
historic religious and political rivalries. Common sense suggests that as
long as there are unions there needs to be some body to co-ordinate their
actions and views.
'We are the glue for the unions,' claims Mr John Monks, the TUC's deputy
general secretary. He should take over from Mr Willis within the year if the
leaders of the big unions are prepared to translate their private criticism
of Willis's leadership into action.
But does the TUC, even after the recent 20 per cent cut in staffing, really
need the same staffing levels as it had in 1979, when there were more than
12m trade unionists, as opposed to today's 7.5m? And does it need the myriad
of committees producing papers which have little impact? More important,
should it take up the time of senior trade unionists, who might be better
occupied seeking ways to run their own unions more efficiently?
The answer of leading 'rationalisers' such as Mr Gavin Laird, the general
secretary of the AEEU craft union, has for many years been a loud 'no'. Many
other general secretaries, bruised from painful rationalisations within
their own unions, also resent contributing so much to the Pounds 8m that the
TUC will receive from its affiliates this year.
Some of them, such as Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general union, talk
about a far more compact 'centre of excellence' providing important
information on European Community directives, health and safety, the
environment and other subjects that unions may find difficult to research on
their own.
The problem in the past has always been that nobody could agree on what the
TUC should cease doing to allow it to become that 'compact centre of
excellence'. That excuse no longer holds, if it ever did, thanks to three
developments:
The fourth consecutive defeat for the Labour party and another Conservative
government hostile to union views mean the TUC's traditional lobbying
function on national issues looks almost redundant. The function will not
disappear entirely; one side-effect of the recent abolition of the National
Economic Development Council has been to open the doors of the Treasury and
other Whitehall departments to discreet delegations from the TUC. But there
seems little point in the TUC laboriously producing an alternative Budget
every year or, as it is currently planning, duplicating the work done by the
unemployment pressure groups.
The emergence of 'super unions' threatens some of the TUC's functions. The
three or four large unions which will be established from the current spate
of mergers, and which will account for more than two-thirds of TUC members,
are likely to need only the TUC's core activities such as trade union
education, and health and safety work. The small unions, which most need the
TUC's services, will be outvoted over trimming services. This may eventually
drive them into the arms of the super unions.
The government's intention to abolish the TUC's Bridlington agreement, which
regulates the competition for members between unions. This is arguably the
TUC's most important role in a country with multi-industry unions. Under the
government's plans, workers will be allowed to join any union. As a result,
the TUC's regulatory function will be severely impaired and a new round of
internecine warfare between unions could further damage their standing.
At next week's conference there will be much talk of refocusing the TUC and
a motion will be passed which will cut its official priorities from 17 to
just six, including health and safety and relations with Europe. But when
asked what the TUC would stop doing as a result of the motion, a senior TUC
official could only say that 'some committees will analyse things in less
depth'.
This will not be a watershed congress for rationalising the TUC. But coming
in the wake of Labour's election defeat the organisation is edging towards a
broader based politics and a a more disciplined emphasis on delivering
services to members.
The TUC is also making an effort to find more common ground with employers
and hence it has invited Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, to address the congress. However, it is
hard to see anything meaningful coming out of this new relationship.
The TUC and the big unions are well aware that the tide of industrial and
political affairs is working strongly against them but so far they have been
impotent to do anything about it. In the short-term things will get worse as
the government's latest reforms of the unions and public services - the
heartland of trade unionism - further diminish numbers and influence.
Yet the paradox for the TUC and the big unions is that if they wish to have
national influence again they will only do so by becoming far less
political. Union leaders are prepared to see some loosening of the Labour
link but they are loathe to see it cut completely.
The unions cannot be written off. Strikes are at an all time low but strikes
are not necessarily an indicator of union power. More than a third of
employees are unionised, more than two-thirds in the public sector, and more
than half are covered by collective bargaining.
But if the unions are to maximise their potential influence they need to be
better led. An important test of the unions' ability to achieve this will be
the extent to which they can put their own house, the TUC, in order.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: No benefit in an ad hoc union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof PETER NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Co-ordinated by the UK's chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, the EC finance
ministers last week issued a ringing affirmation of the current central
parities within the exchange rate mechanism. This fixity in the teeth of
such profound shocks as German monetary unification means that we now live
in an ERM that is essentially an ad hoc economic and monetary union, where
all national policies are determined by the Bundesbank's reactions to
Chancellor Kohl's generosity on unification. This has all the disadvantages
and few of the advantages of a formal single currency.
Yet at Maastricht the UK government prided itself in not committing itself
now to the permanent parities implied by a formal Emu, and was reluctant to
trust Britain's monetary policy to a similarly unelected (yet more broadly
based) European central bank. Sometimes it is hard to follow the higher
consistency of the Treasury mind, which seems to have adopted as its motto:
'If it's hurting, it's working' - the logical converse of Mr Major's famous
slogan.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: Baccalaureate better than early educational
specialisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A broad-based examination with top grades at A-level or better ('Exam
standards', September 3) already exists. The International Baccalaureate
offers a demanding but flexible mix of numerate, literate, creative and
social subjects with three taken at non-specialist and three at university
entrance level. The system is highly developed, valid for a wide range of
students and internationally recognised.
Why have only a few enlightened schools in the UK adopted the IB? Resistance
seems to stem from the universities, or at least the prejudices of some
specialists, which are transmitted to the school system. What is wrong with
British education (we should say English, for the Scots are better) is not
that it fails to reach the highest standards for a few exotic plants in the
hothouse, but that it excludes many from discovering their growth potential
by excessive early pruning.
The IB is an excellent preparation either for further studies or for
professional development. I have an architect and a molecular biologist in
my own family to prove it. As an executive search consultant, I constantly
see evidence that early specialisation is a handicap to be overcome rather
than an asset in producing rounded, educated problem-solvers. If British
business is to compete globally, it needs engineers who speak Japanese,
lawyers with scientific training, finance directors with geo-political sense
and politicians who understand what all these people do.
Why continue to mess about with half-baked solutions to Britain's
examination needs when a tried and tested system could be adopted which
would put Britain on a par with the best of international standards? If
there are real objections to the IB, I should be interested to hear them.

   From Messrs N P WILLIAMS, M VETROVSKY and I VOHLMUTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As directors of the sixth largest privatisation fund in the Czech
Republic - and one which has not promised any inflated returns - we believe
that it is your leader that is confused by coupon privatisation ('No free
lunch', August 21).
We are regulated by the Investment Fund Law of Czechoslovakia and licensed
by the Czech Ministry of Privatisation. We often find our meetings with
Czech managers - discussing the restructuring plans for the companies that
they manage but we will own on behalf of our shareholders - constructive and
useful. Frequently, representatives of the companies' new foreign partners
are also present at these meetings. Are you implying that companies such as
Nestle, BSN, Philip Morris, Glaverbel, Holderbank and Dow Chemical, to name
but a few, are not able to produce competent management for Czech companies?
The combination of coupon privatisation with direct foreign investment into
the same company will definitely contribute, to quote from your leader, to
'spreading wealth among the citizens, injecting new skills into the economy
and creating tradeable financial assets'.
Czechoslovak economic reform cannot be looked at partially, being a
three-pronged approach to the problems of the former command economy: first,
macroeconomic stabilisation with tight control of government budgets
combined with a stable money policy; second, privatisation both of large
enterprises and small businesses; third, restitution, recreating a
property-owning middle class.
We believe, unlike yourselves, that the success of this triple approach  -
with six-month interbank rates at approximately 12.5 per cent, the large
company privatisation mentioned above and the plethora of new small and
restituted businesses - is giving capitalism an excellent name]

FT  04 SEP 92 / Small boat on a stormy sea: Sweden's economic malaise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is in the middle of a severe economic crisis which the centre-right
government of Mr Carl Bildt believes can be solved without abandoning
free-market policies.
The Stockholm bourse has fallen 3.3 per cent this week, although it rose
slightly yesterday, and short-term interest rates of more than 14 per cent
are some of the highest in western Europe. The disclosure on Tuesday by
Sweden's Central Bank that SKr22bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in capital flowed out of
the country last week, forcing it to raise base rates by 3 percentage points
to 16 per cent, has done nothing to calm jittery foreign exchange markets.
Likening his country to a small cargo boat in stormy seas, Mr Bildt says
SKr30bn of cuts in government spending over the next three years, already
announced, and cuts in corporate taxation from 30 per cent to 25 per cent
should reassure foreign investors.
Certainly there are some positive economic indicators. Inflation is running
at an annual average of less than 3 per cent, the visible trade balance of
SKr41bn is strong, household savings have risen by 2.3 per cent this year,
and there has been an improvement of 3 per cent in manufacturing
productivity.
Over the past 11 months the government has launched a series of measures
designed to open the country to the rigours of market forces. These include
privatising its 35 state-dominated companies, abolishing restrictions on
foreign ownership of Swedish companies, and the removal of the tax on share
dealings. This autumn a package is promised to increase the supply of
venture capital available for small and medium-sized companies.
However, many observers believe Mr Bildt faces severe problems in parliament
over the next few months if he tries to implement the unpopular programmes
needed to tackle Sweden's budget deficit, which could be as high as
SKr160bn-SKr180bn in the current financial year or about 8 per cent of GDP.
Last year the figure was SKr70bn. An estimated half of the deficit arises
from falling tax revenues because of the recession and the cost of funding
unemployment benefit. The rest stems from the extravagant transfer payments
of Sweden's welfare state.
'What I cannot understand is why the market should react now to our
political situation when it did not do so before,' complains Mr Bildt. He
argues his four-party coalition has always lacked an overall parliamentary
majority and has had to rely on support either from the right-of-centre New
Democracy party or the Social Democratic opposition.
But co-operation remains difficult, partly because of the personality clash
between Mr Bildt and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader. Last
night, however, the Social Democrats called on the government for all-party
talks on a national agreement to solve the economic troubles.
Political anxieties are of little concern to Sweden's central bank. It is
worried about the government's commmitment to reducing the budget deficit,
and fears that ministers believe it will correct itself when economic
recovery eventually arrives. Mr Bengt Dennis, the bank's governor, provided
a breathing space for the government to decide deficit-trimming policies
with last week's interest rate rise - but so far the move has had little
effect.
The government believes the bank should deal with the short-term
difficulties of capital outflow while it concentrates on implementing its
medium-term free-market strategy. Since July 1989, when Sweden abolished its
foreign exchange controls, the country has survived five financial crises,
each of which has seen substantial capital outflows.
Compounding the current financial crisis are the depth and persistence of
Sweden's recession which has severely hit the manufacturing sector with
plant closures and bankruptcies. In addition, the financial system is in
crisis, with huge loan losses from property speculation in the late 1980s
hitting many banks and insurance companies.
At the moment the government refuses to change course. Some observers
believe Sweden will either have to devalue its currency or accept an
austerity programme to cut the budget deficit. Mr Bildt believes 'there is
no alternative' to his free-market reforms. But unless the markets settle
down, he may be blown off course, plunging Sweden into a political, as well
as an economic, crisis.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A matter for debate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN VICTORIAN times the British parliament usually rose in July or early
August and did not reconvene until the following February. This fact is well
known to readers of Anthony Trollope, who depicts the rulers of the time
spending the autumn in their own and each others' country houses, some of
them working away conscientiously at official papers but all confident that
the longer the recess lasts, the better the Queen's government can be
carried on.
Mr John Major is known to be a keen admirer of Trollope, and it would seem
that he has imbibed this point of view. This year he sent parliament home
for its summer holidays in mid-July, earlier than any of his predecessors
have done in recent years. Normally it would not reassemble until October 19
 -September and early October being nowadays the season, not so much of
grouse and pheasant shooting as of party conferences. But parliament can be
recalled when important events require its attention.
Mr John Smith, the new leader of the opposition, feels that recent
developments in the international situation - notably in the former
Yugoslavia, in Iraq and in Somalia - are sufficiently grave to justify that.
Mr Major feels otherwise.
His decision to reject Mr Smith's request is not unprecedented, but it can
only be justified if the opposition's request appears merely mischievous.
Perhaps there was a hint of mischief in Mr Smith's suggestion that
parliament should also debate 'the current condition of the domestic
economy'. This, as he says, 'remains in deep recession'. It has not (alas)
significantly changed since parliament last sat. But the very continuance of
that state of affairs, combined with uncertainty over the French referendum
result, has raised widespread doubts about the viability of the government's
economic policy, especially in relation to the exchange rate. Mr Smith
personally has not so far advocated a different exchange rate policy; but
any leader of the opposition would be bound to relish the prospect of seeing
the prime minister questioned by his own backbenchers on that subject, or
indeed about his hopes and fears concerning the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Major's desire to avoid such questions for the time being is
understandable. But it is not a sufficient reason for refusing Mr Smith's
request. Nor is the statement (which Mr Smith himself disputes) that they
had agreed last month that a recall of parliament was 'not appropriate',
presumably meaning not necessary, to discuss the situations in Yugoslavia
and Iraq.
The fact is that in both those cases the government has taken very serious
decisions, putting the lives of British servicemen at risk. In the Yugoslav
case, especially, there are real grounds for anxiety, both about the exposed
position of the UN troops and about the fact that this half-baked
'humanitarian' military intervention does nothing to reverse the forced
population movements or to discourage would-be 'ethnic cleansers' elsewhere
in eastern Europe.
Mr Smith should be given credit for considering the position carefully,
rather than calling for the return of parliament as a mere knee-jerk
reaction. His request should be taken more rather than less seriously for
that reason.

FT  04 SEP 92 / No exit from a vicious circle: A harsh economic climate is
taxing Nordic countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nordic countries hoping to join the European Community later in the
decade are enduring a highly uncomfortable wait in the ante-room. Sweden,
Finland and Norway - which have all lodged applications to join the EC or
are about to do so - are suffering an exceptional buffeting from the
currency unrest swirling through Europe.
The economic and financial jitters rippling through Scandinavia deliver a
grim message for members of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), such
as Britain or France, that complain about the Bundesbank's tight monetary
policies. The Nordic experience shows that the fall-out of the monetary
turmoil caused by the strong D-Mark and weak dollar can be still greater for
countries outside the ERM than for those inside it.
Sweden is in the eye of the storm (see below). The stern currency action is
part of an attempt by Mr Carl Bildt's minority government to maintain the
confidence of the financial markets in his economic reforms. It comes,
however, at a time when Sweden is still grappling with its most severe
recession since the 1920s - and when Mr Bildt's efforts to prove the markets
wrong may be coming apart at the seams.
Finland, which raised interest rates yesterday for the third time in less
than a month, has subjected its economy to an unprecedented squeeze. Norway
is still struggling after six years of crisis in its troubled financial
sector. And Denmark, the sole member of the foursome already within the EC,
is weathering a bout of financial market nervousness caused by its No vote
against the Maastricht treaty three months ago.
One senior Finnish diplomat called yesterday's renewal of interest rate
increases by the Bank of Finland 'very grim news'. The tough economic
adjustment policies in force throughout the Nordic region, he said,
represent a belated effort to repair economic weaknesses which should have
been righted during the 1970s and 1980s.
'This is the price for past sins of omission. Sweden, for example, managed
to pass over the effects of the 1973-74 oil shock by expanding the
public-sector share of the economy. Now we're paying double,' he said.
Even by the dour standards of the highly subdued world economy, the four
Nordic economies are in an extremely difficult position. They have been
experiencing the pain - and none of the advantages - of adherence to
Europe's hard-currency 'club'.
According to Mr Keld Holm, international economist at Lehman Brothers, the
London investment bank, the Nordic region is locked in a series of
interconnected vicious circles - with no exit in sight. 'Everything has come
at once,' he says, 'the lack of US recovery, the weak dollar and the
currency troubles in Europe, where international investors have been
withdrawing funds to place in economies of the 'hard core' of the ERM.
Everything now looks a little more gloomy.'
Sweden, Norway and Finland, although outside the ERM, have unilaterally
committed themselves to maintaining their currencies within set fluctuation
bands against the Ecu, the EC's composite currency unit. But they have
conspicuously failed to attain ERM-type credibility.
The financial markets appear to believe that, in an unforgiving
international climate, the Nordic governments may have to ease their tough
economic policies. As a result the past fortnight's surge in international
demand for the D-Mark has led to large-scale withdrawal of funds from Nordic
money and bond markets.
The Nordic countries have become anti-inflation champions. The annual rate
of price increases in all four is now down to between 2 and 3 per cent,
below the German level. Yet this virtue has not been rewarded by any
improvement in economic performance.
Real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates - varying between 15 per cent in
Finland and 8 per cent in Denmark - are the highest in the industrialised
world. Yields in long-dated bonds in all four markets have risen by between
1 and 1.5 points since the Danish setback on June 2 damaged the markets'
faith in the sustainability of international anti-inflation efforts.
The extreme monetary squeeze, combined with high levels of debt produced by
often ill-fated commercial and residential property lending during the
1980s, have exacerbated strains in the banking and insurance sector. This
has been a general factor behind the wariness on international financial
markets.
The Swedish economy is due to decline by a further 1 per cent this year,
following a fall of 1.2 per cent in 1991, and growth of only  1/2 per cent
in 1990. Finland will register a contraction of an estimated 1/2 per cent
this year after a 6 per cent fall in GDP last year.
Norway will chalk up domestic (non-oil) GDP growth of only 1 1/2 per cent
this year, the same as Denmark. The Copenhagen government has managed to
bring its current account on balance of payments into sizeable surplus - but
1992 will be the sixth successive year where economic growth will fail to
exceed 1 3/4 per cent.
Sluggish economic growth, combined with the effects of mounting unemployment
on increasing social security pay-outs, is putting great upward pressure on
budget deficits.
These economic challenges are damaging the spirit of political consensus
which Nordic governments need to keep alive to sustain their campaigns to
join the EC. The Danish No to Maastricht, combined with realisation that EC
membership will in some cases speed up painful restructuring in formerly
protected economic sectors, has led to a general increase in scepticism
about the effects of joining the EC.
For the moment, the general mood in the Nordic countries remains, on
balance, favourable to EC membership. Latest opinion polls indicate that 54
per cent of the population are in favour of joining in Finland, compared
with 41 per cent in Sweden (and 46 per cent in Switzerland and 38 per cent
in Austria, the two other countries which have also applied).
Collapse of the Maastricht treaty, if voted down in the French referendum
later this month, could, ironically, ease some Nordic difficulties in
passage to the EC. Acceding to the free-market provisions of the Treaty of
Rome would prove less politically taxing than agreeing to the
further-reaching commitments of the Maastricht treaty in matters such as
foreign policy and defence.
A French No to Maastricht would also increase still further Nordic exposure
to the pressures of the financial markets. It would thus heighten the
region's need to come fully inside the EC club rather than hovering
uncertainly outside.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Personal View: Public services and public perceptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since 1979 British public services have been the participants - often
unwilling - in a series of reforms which have brought parental choice in
schools, an internal market in the National Health Service, the compulsory
contracting-out of some local authority services and the introduction of the
Citizen's Charter.
Much of this activity has generated a sense of unease among the consumers of
these services, many of whom seem to believe that the essential virtues of
public service are being sacrificed and that the government's true motives
are to achieve further privatisation and to cut spending.
After five years at the head of the Audit Commission, trying to promote
value for money in the public sector, I am convinced that most of these
reform initiatives make sense, and over time will improve both the
efficiency and quality of service. But if the government is to convince the
public that the changes are positive, it will need a more consistent and
systematic justification for its reform programme.
In fact, the Thatcher government did not take office with a fully fledged
programme for the overhaul of public services ready in its handbag. What we
have seen over the last 13 years is a series of experiments, which have
taken different forms in different places.
Nowhere have the underlying principles of the government's approach to
reform been brought together in a coherent way. In a pamphlet published this
week by the Social Market Foundation*, I attempt to fill that gap.
With its experiments, the government has been playing with the construction
of social markets - systems which duplicate in the public sector, as far as
possible, those pressures for efficiency and quality of service which exist
in the private sector. It has done this, for example, by introducing
compulsory competitive tendering in local-authority refuse collection and by
establishing an internal market in the NHS.
In the course of doing so the government has thrown up a number of valuable
ideas. What it must now do is write the rules of the game, and ensure that
everyone plays by them.
The last decade has shown that competition between public services does
provide a powerful stimulus for their improvement. It may, in the short
term, lead to what opponents describe as 'two-tier' levels of service. But
that is how markets operate, and how they generate improvements across the
board. So some element of competition must exist in the social market.
The competition reforms in local government and the NHS have also shown the
value of instituting a clear split between purchaser and provider within
public services, with one set of organisations responsible for specifying
the level of service and policing its delivery, while another focuses on the
provision of services on a daily basis.
The work of the professional inspectorates, which has belatedly been brought
into the public domain, and of the Audit Commission, has shown the
importance of independent public inspection and audit. And the Citizen's
Charter is beginning to show that when public services are obliged to
describe the standards of service they are seeking to meet, they generate
powerful consumer pressure from below.
All these pressures must be present throughout the public sector. They help
ensure that social values are maintained within a market system.
But while all these innovations have selectively shown their worth, only in
the NHS have they been brought together into a coherent whole. Much of local
government remains protected from competition. In the school system it is
still unclear who is meant to be purchasing education on behalf of the
parent. And independent audit, which was introduced into the NHS in 1989, is
being removed from the school system in 1992.
Looking to the police, one can see that almost none of the reform ideas that
have proved themselves elsewhere have been thought to have any relevance.
There is no clarity about what the police are required to do, what the
criteria for success or failure are, who the purchaser of police services is
and who the provider is. And the inspection of police services remains
exclusively the province of former chief constables.
Of course, there will always be those who argue, specifically, that it is
dangerous to embark on the reform of the law enforcement forces and,
generally, that the government should consolidate its existing reforms
before embarking on more. However, if the principles of the social market
approach are valid, as I believe they are, then there is no reason to deny
the police their benefits.
If the government was prepared to set out the principles on which its
programme is based, then it would allay public concern about the direction
of its reforms, rather than creating more anxiety. That not only means
explaining how market disciplines are to be introduced, but also explaining
how social values are to be maintained.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Currency games
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY THE markets were not entirely unimpressed by the British
government's decision to up the stakes in the currency game. The 0.73
pfennig rise in sterling on the day, to DM2.7975, was at least in the
direction the government wanted following its announced intention to borrow
Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in foreign currencies. The question is whether first
thoughts are likely to be overtaken by second ones.
The proceeds of the foreign currency borrowing announced yesterday - half to
be in D-Marks and half in a mixture of currencies - will be used to support
sterling over the rest of the financial year. Since the reserves were
Dollars 44.5bn at the end of August, the government is now in a strong
position to punish those prepared to sell the pound short, even though it is
already near its floor in the ERM.
These borrowings will also count as part of the finance of the public
sector's borrowing requirement. Ecu10bn is a substantial amount, although
still less than a quarter of the total borrowings needed in this financial
year. Nevertheless, the fact of borrowing in foreign currencies does
emphasise the government's commitment to its policy. If the government were
really as confident as it pretends, it would be doing as much of its
borrowing as possible either in index-linked gilts  - a bargain for a
government expecting zero inflation - or in D-Marks.
Does this mean the chancellor can claim that 'these arrangements demonstrate
once again the government's clear determination and ability to maintain
sterling's position in the ERM at the existing central rate regardless of
the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty'? Only up to a
point.
By failing to raise interest rates as sterling declined, the government has
not, in fact, shown its determination to maintain sterling's position at the
existing central rate. The decision to borrow rather than raise interest
rates, might come to be judged by the markets as a - potentially costly -
sign of weakness.
More fundamentally, no government wheeze, however skilful, no action,
however brave, can remove all doubts. The credibility of the parity will be
determined by its consequences for economic performance. On that the jury
remains out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT BUSH has taken a calculated risk in allowing, for overtly
electoral reasons, the sale of 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. Sacrificing
established policy to win votes - or using subsidies to buy them, as with
the wheat sales announced separately on Wednesday - is as old as elections
themselves. But this job-saving order for General Dynamics threatens to
undermine Mr Bush's bold and sensible approach of constructive engagement
towards China. Mr Bush's calculation is that the importance of trade with
the US, which yielded China a Dollars 13bn surplus in 1991, will dissuade
Beijing from retaliation.
Since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Mr Bush has struggled to keep
China in the fold rather than isolate it. In the face of strong domestic
opposition, he has maintained its most-favoured nation trading status while
keeping up pressure on human rights. The rationale is to strengthen the hand
of economic reformers in China who want to open the country to the outside
world, boosting economic freedom. The west's hope is that political freedom
will follow.
China has not given Mr Bush much in return. Its continuing determination to
stamp ruthlessly on any political dissent was underlined this week with the
arrest of a dissident on his return to China and the expulsion of his
foreign friends. However, broader issues are at stake. Beijing has been
exerting pressure on North Korea over its nuclear programme, and last week
established diplomatic relations with South Korea. In the uncertain security
environment in Asia it would be better to enlist the co-operation of the
widest range of regional powers including China, rather than sow the seeds
of possible confrontation.
It is difficult to see how selling fighters to Taiwan fits in with this
approach. Washington agreed with Beijing in 1982 to limit and eventually end
arms sales to Taiwan. Now it argues that the military balance has been
altered by Chinese purchases of advanced fighters from Russia. Taiwan should
have the right to defend itself, but this sale will scarcely ensure its
long-term security. The way towards peaceful reunification of China, desired
by both governments, lies in the investment links which have developed in
recent years, between cash-rich Taiwan and the labour-rich mainland.
Mr Bush is gambling that Beijing's reaction will consist simply of protests.
The Chinese will be uncomfortably aware that Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
challenger, has promised a much tougher line against China on human rights
issues. However, from the fury in Beijing yesterday it was impossible to
tell whether Mr Bush has calculated correctly. The threatened Chinese
withdrawal from arms control talks within the UN Security Council would be a
serious setback to containment of weapons proliferation.
More immediately, the sale could upset current trade negotiations between
Washington and Beijing. Quite legitimately, Mr Bush is pressing for a
relaxation of China's import restrictions, which before this week looked set
to be granted and would certainly help persuade Congress to renew China's
MFN status. Progress on these issues far outweighs the domestic benefits to
be obtained from selling a few fighters.

Farnborough

<TEXT>
Out for a spin: the US-built McDonnell Douglas MD 520N helicopter, which is
built without a tail rotor, flies over Farnborough as the site is made ready
for next week's international air show, Paul Betts writes.
In spite of a challenge from the new Berlin show, Farnborough and Paris
remain the leading international shows. Farnborough has been chosen this
year by the Russian aerospace industry for an unprecedented marketing drive
to sell military and commercial aircraft in the west and seek joint
ventures.
Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace Companies,
which organises the show, said yesterday that 437 Russian officials were
expected at Farnborough.
The group will include 81 leading figures from the Russian government and
from leading aerospace companies and design bureaux. 'We've never had such
an attendance with all the Russian decision-makers present,' Sir Barry said.
'They clearly see aerospace as one of the few areas from which they can
derive economic benefit.'
Russia will exhibit 20 aircraft including seven never yet shown in the west.
The display will include the YAK-38 and YAK-141 vertical take-off fighters,
the Sukhoi Su-24MP swing-wing attack aircraft and the Su-35 twin turbofan
fighter.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Cadbury shop-steward change opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS are to oppose a move by Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft
drinks group, to cut the number of shop stewards it recognises at two of its
factories.
Cadbury has given unions - including the TGWU general union and AEEU
engineering and electrical union - 90 days notice of its decision to
derecognise 29 of the 39 shop stewards at the Somerdale factory, near
Bristol, and 26 of the 45 at its Bournville assortments factory in
Birmingham. Both factories also intend to withdraw facilities for full-time
conveners.
Mr Brian Revell, TGWU national officer for the food industry, who had talks
with Cadbury yesterday, said the company's traditional Quaker-inspired
paternalism might be drawing to a close. 'The existing values of
co-operation and mutuality are being threatened by a change in management's
attitude towards trade unions,' he said.
Cadbury said the decisions to cut the number of shop stewards had been taken
locally by managers at two of the group's five confectionery plants. It
added: 'To suggest this represents a sea-change in the way we relate with
trade unions overstates the case.'
The formal disputes procedure has been invoked and meetings have begun. It
is understood the unions have no immediate plans for industrial action.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Union leaders 'support end to block vote'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX out of 10 union leaders would support abolition of the union block vote
at Labour party conferences, according to a survey disclosed yest-erday.
The results will hearten party members who want a fundamental reappraisal of
Labour's links with the unions.
Until now senior union leaders have expressed caution about the depth of
reforms due to be implemented by next year's Labour conference.
The survey in New Statesman and Society magazine also indicated that eight
out of 10 union leaders would support the introduction of a
one-member-one-vote system for the selection of Labour parliamentary
candidates.
Three quarters would back one-member-one-vote for the election of the Labour
leader.
The magazine pointed out that support for abolition of the block vote does
not translate into backing for the abolition of party-union links.
One of the respondents in the survey who backed abolition added: 'We need a
reputable link mechanism before abolition.'
One possible solution - the automatic conversion of members of unions which
pay a political levy to Labour into individual party members - was backed by
three out of 10 union leaders. But some respondents argued strongly that
union members wishing to become party members should pay the full individual
membership fee.
In a series of questions on how union leaders rate shadow cabinet members,
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, came first above Mr John Smith, party
leader. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, was third and Mr Robin Cook,
shadow trade and industry secretary, fourth. In last year's poll Mr Smith
came first.
The New Statesman said it seemed that the Labour leader had already begun to
exhaust his honeymoon period.
Questionnaires were sent to 100 union leaders and 36 were completed.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Salary warning for accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS must expect salaries to continue to fall in the short-term and
little prospect of an upswing in employment over the next few years,
according to a survey by Challoner James, a financial recruitment agency.
London salaries for newly-qualified chartered accountants have fallen by
between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in the past six months into the Pounds
20,000-Pounds 25,000 range.
Salaries for chartered management accountants fell slightly, but held up
more strongly than any other qualification, reflecting the greater relevance
of the degree to many employers.
There was also strong demand for accountants with language skills and for
jobs in credit control, salaries supervision and internal auditing.
Mr Martin Humberstone, Challoner James operations director, dismissed as
'wishful thinking' projections that the falling graduate intake would lead
to renewed demand from employers in the mid 1990s.
He said employers were becoming far more selective and increasingly
recognised the need to hire people with sound business experience.
Recruitment firms were still spending considerable time 'rescuing'
newly-qualified chartered accountants hired by companies and struggling
because of a lack of experience.
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has been forced to tighten its internal
controls after the discovery that one of its partners had 'misappropriated'
more than Pounds 300,000 last year.
Mr Andrew Oakley, a partner in the firm for more than 20 years, has been
dismissed and excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. He was also ordered to pay Pounds 350
costs.
Ernst &amp; Young confronted Mr Oakley in early spring this year, fired him and
referred his case to the institute.
The firm was able to provide proof for the removal of Pounds 300,000 between
January 9 and October 30 last year, although the sums and the dates are
believed to have been more extensive.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Sections of NUM consider buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIGNIFICANT move away from the National Union of Mineworkers' rejection of
all forms of privatisation of British Coal appears to have developed. Two
sections of the union have joined a consortium to consider taking a stake in
the smokeless fuels Coal Products Division.
The cokemen's section of the NUM and the Cosa white-collar section have
linked up with three other unions - BACMS, the colliery managers union, and
the two general unions GMB and TGWU, to ask the union-backed bank Unity
Trust to investigate the possible role of employees in a buy-out.
Mr John Meads, general secretary of BACMS, said that all five unions or
union sections were involved in asking Unity Trust to 'represent the
interests of employees within the framework of a possible
management/employee buy-out'.
British Coal's coal productions division employs only about 600 people and
made an operating profit of Pounds 2m for the year ended March 28. Last year
it had debts of Pounds 50m. It has not yet filed its separate accounts for
this year.
The business is seen as having good potential to generate cash given British
Coal's recent decision to close the loss-making Avenue Coke and Chemical
plant near Chesterfield, Derbyshire, which produces Sunbright fuel for the
domestic closed-fire market.
The NUM's refusal to countenance any co-operation with coal privatisation
has contrasted with the stance of the break-away Union of Democratic
Mineworkers which has prepared an employee buy-out bid backed by Lloyds
Merchant Bank.
However, an earlier deviation from the union headquarters' hard line
occurred when the Scottish NUM expressed interest in an employee buy-out for
Longannet pit, Fife.
The latest move by the cokemen and Cosa could signal the start of a revolt
against Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, by union officials arguing as
the UDM does. The UDM view is that privatisation is not desirable, but that
if it cannot be stopped it is sensible to win as much influence as possible
over the organisations that emerge after it.
British Coal has already announced that it is discussing the sale of Coal
Products with two rival management buy-out groups and Anglo-United, owner of
Coalite smokeless fuel.
The two rival MBOs are led by Mr Steve O'Donoghue, the former finance
director of Coal Products, and Mr David Foster, Coal Products' operations
director.
While Mr O'Donoghue appears to have the backing of the majority of Coal
Products managers, the emergence of two rival MBOs could put the British
Association of Colliery Management in a difficult position. It has been
promised funds to help draw up an employee buy-out bid.
BC has said that it would back the bid offering the 'best value' for its
business. This week it said it was inclined to sell Coal Products piecemeal.
Anglo has said that it is confident of putting together an attractive
financial package. If it acquired Coal Products it would be expected to
close some of the plants.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Hour of reckoning for training schemes: Pressures on
ministers responsible for programmes for the jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, will today begin receiving
submissions to her wide-ranging review of government programmes for the
adult unemployed.
Under review is the ET scheme itself as well as Employment Action, the
benefit-plus-temporary-work scheme for the long-term unemployed, and
Jobclubs.
Mrs Shephard is likely to be constrained by political and financial
pressures. She will face calls from Tory backbenchers who want to follow the
US example of Workfare under which the long-term unemployed receive benefit
only if they undertake community work.
Civil servants believe it would be difficult to run sufficient Workfare
schemes to mop up the large numbers of people eligible.
It is understood that the government has similarly been backing away from
the proposal to cut entitlement to unemployment benefit from one year to six
months.
Training providers hope the review will concentrate on quality in order to
equip the UK for any upturn in the economy.
But the Department of Employment - like others in Whitehall - is likely to
be subject to funding cuts in the current Public Expenditure Survey.
ET will be the most vulnerable scheme because the other main training
programme, Youth Training - the scheme for those aged 16 to 18 - guarantees
a place to all who want one. It is politically important for the government
that this is met. ET carries no such formal guarantee.
ET is criticised as ripe for reform. Started in 1988, before the recession,
its clients are mainly low-skill individuals, and 47 per cent are inner-city
residents who worked in the old manufacturing industries. About 104,000
people are doing ET in England and Wales.
The scheme's record is poor. Only 36 per cent of those completing schemes go
into jobs, self employment or full - time training and about 30 per cent get
a qualification.
Many of its clients view ET as a government device to get them off the
unemployment register, while many training providers claim they are unable
to give quality training because the Pounds 800m-a-year scheme is
underfunded.
The Unemployment Unit, a research organisation, said that while job entry
rates could be explained partly by the weakness of regional employment
conditions, qualification rates reflected the poor quality of training.
The 82 Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) which administer government
funded training schemes in England and Wales want a freer hand in who they
can train on ET schemes.
In their submission to Mrs Shephard they are expected to point to a range of
alternatives, such as varying periods of training for different groups
depending on their needs. Short intensive courses could assist skilled
individuals recently made unemployed. More disadvantaged people could have
longer training.
Last week G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent the views of Tecs
to government, made it clear that further cuts to their training budgets
were unacceptable. It is likely, however, that if asked to make funding
choices they would opt to have fewer people trained, but to a higher
quality.
Mr Stuart Bishell, managing director of Astra Training, the largest provider
of ET training, said: 'We want the focus of government spending on training
to be on those people who are most likely to benefit from it most rapidly.'
Such a move is being considered by the Department of Employment. Mrs
Shephard could argue that the Treasury should allow Tecs greater freedom of
choice in return for cash constraints, and allow her department to negotiate
targets. Tecs could for example be paid varying amounts for training
different groups.
But the Treasury wants the rules on ET eligibility tightened, not relaxed.
At present Tecs are allowed only to put other groups on ET after satisfying
demand from the long-term unemployed.
Another option being considered is expanding Employment Action. Set up a
year ago, EA is cheaper than ET but has not been a great success. About
23,000 out of 30,000 places are filled. Whether this scheme could be
expanded without some element of compulsion is debatable.
Tecs would certainly like greater ability to mix and match programmes to
meet the needs of their catchment areas - but not if that means less funding
for training. It is a demand that government will find hard to meet.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Big battalions improve finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of the largest trade unions improved their financial position last
year, according to a survey by the Labour Research Department, a union
research organisation.
The survey found many unions had taken steps to reverse financial declines,
but the LRD warned the situation was still precarious.
A number of new pressures faced unions, including the government's
forthcoming legislation on the 'check-off' system of members paying union
contributions.
The proposed law will require members regularly to re-authorise their
payments. LRD said this could increase the likelihood of 'disaffected or
disorganised members dropping out'.
Finances of most of the unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress
worsened in the late 1980s for several reasons, including falling
membership. The TUC warned last year that 'the maintenance of effective
control of expenditure must remain a major priority'. The LRD found
membership generally fell again last year, but most unions increased their
dues.
Six of the biggest 10 unions performed better last year than in 1990. These
were Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse, the public service unions; the GMB general
union; MSF, the manufacturing, science and finance union; and Usdaw, the
shopworkers union. All produced a surplus on income and expenditure. Only
Nupe and Usdaw produced a surplus in 1990.
The biggest deficit of Pounds 12.4m was incurred by the TGWU general union.
The union said yesterday that it believed it had turned the corner by
cutting staff and raising dues.
Ninety large companies have paid 227 departing directors a total of nearly
Pounds 33m over the past 18 months, according to the LRD.
The LRD survey of companies paying out 'golden handshakes' worth more than
Pounds 100,000 showed an average pay-out of Pounds 144,720. At least nine
directors received more than Pounds 400,000 each.
A similar survey last year found 85 companies paid 186 directors a total of
Pounds 25.1m, an average pay-off of Pounds 135,079.
Sometimes golden handshakes had riders on them, said the LRD, with
agreements by the recipients not to work for main competitors for a period
of time.
The LRD is proposing that the rules governing disclosure of company
financial information on such payouts needed tightening as the majority of
company accounts did not detail payments to individual directors.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Lib Dems seek UN reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations should be given the power to intervene in countries'
domestic affairs, the Liberal Democrats said yesterday in proposals for
wide-ranging reform of the UN.
Sir David Steel, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, said the criticisms
made of the UN over its role in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia
reflected the unwillingness of the international community to consider
changes to nations' attitudes to sovereignty following the end of the cold
war.
'The UN as an organisation has never lived up to the dreams of its founders
nor to its charter,' he said at the launch of Beyond The Nation State, a
document to be discussed at the party's annual conference later this month.
The paper envisages the more systematic development of a range of sanctions
against countries which breach criteria on, for instance, human rights, the
right to peaceful co-existence of nations and the environment. The UN is
urged to improve its information gathering and set up a permanent
peacekeeping force.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Traditional family households in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE traditional family of mother, father and young children all living
together has become a social minor-ity.
The proportion of households containing two parents with dependent children
has moved from being the second main household group to being the
third-largest. For the first time it has been overtaken by those consisting
of people living alone.
The General Household Survey, published yesterday by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys, shows that by 1990 26 per cent of
households contained only one person, compared with 25 per cent made up of
married or cohabiting couples with dependent children.
The biggest of the three main household types - married or cohabiting
couples without dependent children - accounted for 36 per cent of
households.
Households containing two parents and dependent children have been in
decline throughout recent years, falling to 25 per cent in 1990 from 32 per
cent in 1982.
During the 1970s and 1980s there was a sharp increase in the number of
single-parent families - the great majority headed by mothers - and the
survey illustrates many of the social and economic consequences of
single-parenthood. Single parents are more likely to live in rented
accommodation lacking amenities like central heating.
They also face what the survey describes as 'striking' differences in income
compared with other families. In 1990 a majority of single-parent families -
53 per cent - had a weekly income of Pounds 100 or less, compared with only
4 per cent of two-parent households. Only 8 per cent of single-parents had
weekly incomes of more than Pounds 350, something enjoyed by 55 per cent of
other families.
Another striking social change during the past 20 years has been a growth in
the number of married women working. The survey shows that by 1990 the
proportions of married and single women in employment were almost identical
 -71 per cent of married women and 72 per cent of single. In 1971 only half
Britain's married women worked.
The survey detects 'substantial differences between the occupational status
of similarly educated men and women'. Among working people with degrees, men
were twice as likely to be in professional occupations - 39 per cent
compared with 18 per cent.
A similar pattern exists among employees without educational qualifications,
with 48 per cent of women in semi-skilled or unskilled manual jobs against
29 per cent of men.
The survey illustrates the extent to which socio-economic background
influences educational attainment. A total of 35 per cent of people whose
fathers had professional backgrounds have degrees or equivalent
qualifications. The figure is just 2 per cent for those whose fathers were
in unskilled manual jobs.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rises on DM borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING received a strong boost in the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday after the UK government announced plans to borrow Ecu10bn in
foreign currencies and sell them for sterling on the currency markets,
writes James Blitz.
Announcing that they would borrow half of the sum in D-Marks and sell them
for pounds in the next few days, the UK government pushed the currency above
the DM2.80 level for the first time since the dollar fell through its
all-time low two weeks ago.
The news had a strong effect across the foreign exchanges, raising the US
dollar against the D-Mark and sharply depressing the Italian lira. In
London, sterling ended 1 1/4 pfennigs up at DM2.8000, while the dollar
closed some 2 pfennigs better at DM1.4115. The Italian lira finished in
London on its ERM floor against the German currency, at L765.40. In New York
the dollar rose further to end at DM1.4155.
Dealers said the Ecu loan committed the government to hold the pound at its
current parity of DM2.95. The move will act as an alternative to boosting
the UK's foreign exchange reserves by Dollars 13bn, by creating an immediate
demand for sterling in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum.
If the UK government supports an EMS realignment, this will entail a
substantial loss on the loan because D-Marks will have been purchased at the
current rate. 'Norman Lamont is putting his money where his mouth is,' said
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London.
The pound was boosted by a feeling that the government had pulled off a
surprise coup. One analyst called it a 'double whammy': while the conversion
of D-Marks into sterling should hold the pound above its ERM floor, the gilt
market will come under less pressure because of the government's large
borrowing requirement.
Mr John Shepherd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities in London, said the
balance of the government's strategy on the pound had changed. 'Until now,
they have had the option of either devaluing or raising interest rates,' he
said. 'They are now saying that their response to a No in the Maastricht
referendum will be to raise rates.'
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, believed the
move has bought the government time. 'All it does is put the government in a
position of borrowing money to spend its way out of the problem,' he said.
The UK's move highlighted the plight of the Italian authorities, who have no
scope to borrow foreign currency in the same way. Before the UK
announcement, the lira was supported by intervention from both the Italian
and Belgian central banks. In US dealing, it was trading well outside its
ERM bands at a low of L766.50 to the D-Mark.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Big rally in futures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures rallied sharply yesterday afternoon after the Bank of
England announced that it would borrow Ecu10bn to buy sterling on the
foreign exchanges.
After a week in which both cash and futures have priced in a rise in UK base
rates, dealers were totally surprised by yesterday's announcement. Many
regarded it as an ingenious means by which to support sterling against the
D-Mark.
According to one trader, the borrowing of at least DM5bn will act as an
antidote to last month's depletion of the UK's foreign currency reserves,
which were sharply depleted following last month's heavy intervention.
Others noted that the borrowing would heavily support the UK gilt market and
the government's borrowing requirement, by reducing the pressure to hold
gilt auctions.
The announcement was followed by a dramatic rally in sterling futures. The
September short sterling contract added 28 basis points in the afternoon to
close at 89.74. There was much heavier trading in the December contract,
however, which rose 30 basis points from its opening level to close at
89.70.
Three-month money immed-iately fell by  1/4 percentage point on the offered
side to 10 3/8 per cent. The rates for everything from five months out to
one year fell by  7/16 , to close at 10 7/16 per cent on the offered side.
All these moves restored prices to where they had been before the dollar
dropped through its historic low against the D-Mark two weeks ago. However,
one clearing bank dealer said the Treasury's move will only be deemed
successful if major investment funds buy sterling on the back of it. 'If
they move funds into sterling, rates could go down even more,' he said. 'If
not, the effects will quickly be forgotten next week.'
The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 450m at the start of
its money market operation, although it took most of the day to be removed.
A commercial bank dealer said the shortage was in the discount market, while
the clearers were probably square or even long, following Pounds 1.205bn of
exchequer transactions yesterday.
The Bank purchased Pounds 1m of Band 1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent and
Pounds 114m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Late assistance was
Pounds 105m.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Positive response to currency
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AND with one bound he was free]
The innovative foreign currency borrowing plan announced yesterday by Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, achieved more than its primary goal of
strengthening the pound. It also boosted UK equities, the gilt edged and
money markets and the dollar.
Mr Lamont has put his money where his mouth is by making clear the Ecu10bn
borrowing in foreign currencies will be converted into sterling through the
foreign exchange market in addition to any normal market intervention.
Some Ecu5bn will be borrowed in D-Marks - some in the next few days, the
rest by the end of this month - and sold for pounds.
The British government has borrowed foreign currencies on many occasions
before to strengthen its gold and currency reserves. But this is the first
large borrowing in D-Marks for many years and the first occasion in which
the government has committed itself to converting the proceeds into
sterling.
The effect has been to create a demand for the pound and to underline the
government's commitment to sterling's DM2.95 parity in the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Lamont now has a very real incentive not to devalue the pound in the
European Monetary System, because that would raise the cost of servicing and
paying back the debt.
As the markets responded positively to the British government's decision to
tie the pound more closely to the D-Mark, officials were hopeful the UK may
be able to avoid a damaging rise in bank base rates from their current 10
per cent level in the event of a French No vote in the September 20
referendum on the Maastricht treaty.
The borrowing programme is also intended to strengthen Britain's defences
against a further slide in the US dollar and a consequent appreciation of
the D-Mark.
With President Bush's fortunes uncertain ahead of the US election in
November, the Treasury and Bank of England are aware the US could order a
further cut in official short-term interest rates, despite their being an
already wide 6.75 percentage points below equivalent German rates.
The sterling proceeds of the Ecu10bn borrowing programme will be used to
help finance the public sector borrowing requirement, which in this
financial year is expected to overshoot the government's Pounds 28bn target.
But the size of the borrowing - equivalent to Pounds 7.27bn - reflected the
UK authorities' assessment of what would impress foreign exchange markets
and does not reflect any official estimate of the likely borrowing
overshoot.
Governments are normally wary of borrowing large sums of money abroad. It is
a measure often associated with the lax finances of 'banana republics'.
But the Treasury and Bank reasoned yesterday's plan was to deal with an
external problem created by the upward pressures on the D-Mark and the
dollar weakness that had left the pound unfairly caught in the crossfire.
According to officials, the borrowing plan is acceptable when seen in the
context of the UK's firm to tight monetary stance. The plan was hatched by
the chancellor, senior Treasury officials and monetary experts at the Bank,
headed by Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor, as sterling's position on
the foreign exchange markets deteriorated recently.
It is hoped the measure could even prove a good deal for the British tax
payer, if, as expected, the borrowed funds will be converted into sterling
while the pound is weak in the ERM and paid back when it is stronger.
As they contemplated yesterday's measures, officials could only think of one
serious downside risk - that the Treasury would lose in the event of a
collapse of the ERM or a devaluation of the pound. But these contingencies,
as Mr Lamont has repeatedly underlined this summer, form no part of
government economic policy.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts surge on borrowing move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government bond market surged two points in one of the strongest
rallies seen in recent months following a Treasury announcement that the
government will be borrowing the equivalent of Ecu10bn in a variety of
currencies.
The borrowing decision has two positive implications for the gilt market as
it reduces funding pressure and will help to support sterling in the foreign
exchange markets.
UK economists said the Ecu10bn borrowing - which is equivalent to about
Pounds 7bn - would greatly reduce the government's need to borrow in the
gilt market.
'The bottom line is that the government will have to sell Pounds 7bn fewer
gilts' said one dealer.
According to economists' estimates, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PBSR) for 1992/93 will be about Pounds 33bn, against Treasury forecasts of
Pounds 28bn. According to Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt-Edged, the government's remaining funding in the gilt market will be
cut from Pounds 13bn to Pounds 6bn as a result of the borrowing plan.
Volume in the futures market was double normal levels with about 45,000
contracts traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which opened at 95.20,
rose to 97.12 while in the cash market the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07
climbed from 113.00 to 115.00 yielding 9.43 per cent.
Long and medium-dated gilt issues showed the strongest gains, reflecting the
fact that these are the maturities where funding pressure was expected to be
heaviest before yesterday's announcement.
FRENCH government bonds rallied, pulled up by the surge in gilt prices. The
Matif futures contract climbed from 104.86 to 105.58 and dealers said the
market managed to take the French Treasury's auction of FFr11.8bn of stock
in its stride. However, the French market will be waiting to see the outcome
of the television debate between President Mitterrand and Mr Philippe Seguin
which was scheduled for last night.
US Treasury prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as traders
and investors anxiously awaited today's important August jobs data.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 98 5/8
, yielding 7.359 per cent. There was even less movement at the short end of
the market, where the two-year note was unchanged at 100 9/32 , to yield
4.085 per cent.
All week trading has been conducted in the shadow of today's employment
report, with most participants reluctant to take large positions for fear of
being caught cold in the event of a major surprise in the jobs figures.
The consensus of analysts expects non-farm payrolls to have risen 155,000
last month, following the 198,000 increase in July. Half of the monthly
gain, however, is expected to result from the hiring of temporary employees
under a federally funded summer jobs programme.

FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Funding programme to have
dual function
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury's new Ecu10bn multi-currency funding programme, announced
yesterday, represents an innovative two-pronged attack on the government's
financial difficulties.
The financing will have the dual function of supporting sterling in the
foreign exchange market and funding government spending.
The Bank of England, charged with arranging the Ecu10bn borrowing, must
tread a fine line between securing the lowest possible interest rate costs
and achieving its foreign exchange objectives.
The first part of the financing consists of a multi-currency revolving
credit facility totalling Ecu5bn, the largest ever completed. The entire
proceeds of the facility will initially be drawn down in D-Marks and then
sold for sterling, providing a substantial boost for the pound.
The first half of the facility, due to be signed today, will be drawn down
in the next few days, and the remaining DM5bn later in the month.
The interest rate on drawings is  3/32 point above the London interbank
offered rate, and drawings can be made in D-Marks, dollars, yen, Swiss
francs or Ecu. The facility, arranged by Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, Midland
Bank and National Westminster Bank, runs for three years.
The zero risk weighting of UK debt, which means that no extra capital has to
be earmarked, allows banks holding the paper to earn a reasonable return.
The margin, given the extremely large size of the deal, was considered about
as narrow as banks would accept. Although a recent three-year loan for the
European Community paid interest of only  1/32 point over Libor, the size of
the deal was much smaller at Ecu500m and the deal proved difficult to
syndicate: Credit Lyonnais has kept about 70 per cent of the paper.
In the case of the UK's Ecu5bn facility, the four UK banks are taking about
70 per cent of the paper between them, with the remaining 30 per cent split
between a group of international banks.
The other half of the Ecu10bn borrowing programme, which starts next month,
is much less defined. Although termed a 'multi-currency note issue
programme', it does not consist of any pre-set documentation, but rather
will be made up of a variety of borrowings, which could be structured in any
form - bills, notes or bonds, - for any maturity, and in any currency.
However, the need to match funding costs and foreign exchange action will
limit the range of options.
Once a further Ecu5bn has been raised - which is expected to be before the
end of the financial year - the Bank may raise additional amounts to
refinance the bank credit on finer terms. The whole amount will again be
used to buy sterling. It is possible some of the funding could be done
through the Bank's existing Ecu bill and note programmes, but any such
funding would be in addition to the existing programmes.
Apart from its recent forays into the Ecu market, the UK has not raised
funds in a foreign currency since the mid-1980s, when a series of
floating-rate notes denominated in dollars were launched. Its last
syndicated facility was a Dollars 1.5bn facility in 1977.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE borrowers dominated primary market activity today, with deals in
the dollar and yen sectors.
Japan Development Bank launched a Y100bn seven-year deal, via Nomura, which
met broad demand in the wake of extensive pre-marketing.
The rally in the Japanese bond market, oversold earlier in the week,
provided a more positive tone for the offering. Other potential borrowers in
the sector include the European Investment Bank and the World Bank.
The JDB issue was bid at 99 1/2 at the end of trading, unchanged from its
fixed-price reoffer level.
Meanwhile, Hokuriku Electric Power launched the first of an expected spate
of offerings in the dollar sector by Japanese utilities. The Dollars 200m
five-year deal was considered quite attractively priced to yield 54 basis
points over the five-year Treasury yield at launch.
Demand for five-year Eurodollar bonds is growing, due to the steep increase
in yields between three and five-year bonds, which is tempting some
investors further along the yield curve.
In the Swiss bond market, the Republic of Ireland launched a SFr100m private
placement of 7 1/4 per cent notes due 2002, arranged by Swiss Bank
Corporation.
Two more banks launched subordinated floating-rate note issues, with minimum
and maximum coupon levels. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Dresdner Bank added a
total of Dollars 200m to the recent supply of paper.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Combing the Fringe - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most popular bit of the Edinburgh Fringe has been the local based
Communicado Company's version of Cyrano de Bergerac played in the spanking
new den of the Traverse Theatre. Rostand's rhyming couplets have been
faithfully translated by Edwin Morgan into the Glaswegian vernacular and
somehow manage to give both an immediacy and a sense of history to the
piece. 'You're so macho' is a phrase which fits the aspirations of 17th
century France.
There is plenty of cross-dressing, music, and sword-play, indeed an
enveloping air of braggadocio which suits Cyrano well. The play is performed
at such a lick that the ingredient which made it a success with Victorians
its pathos, is lost. Cyrano's poetic wooing of his beloved Roxanne on behalf
of the witness Christian should be one of the saddest moments in the
theatre, but here it is played fast, furious, and for laughs.
Tom Mannion has energy and charm enough for Cyrano, but the lack of feeling
robs him of some nobility. Sandy Mcdade, too, seems untouched by the selfish
vanity of Roxanne. However the nose, always a key factor in the success of
Cyrano, is monstrous but credible.
This is ensemble playing of great gusto. Much of the text may be lost on
foreigners, but a Scottish audience hugely enjoyed the wit and vitality in
Gerry Mulgrew's production.
The Fringe, like the Festival, makes no critical sense - one person's
pleasure is another's purgatory. My two favourite shows made it to award
short-lists and then faltered. John Shuttleworth is both funny and bathetic.
He is the creation of Graham Fellows, whose last taste of stardom was hiding
behind Jilted John, in 1978's excruciating pop novelty hit.
Shuttleworth is a redundant security guard from a Rotherham sweet factory
who holds master-classes in light entertainment, passing on the skills he
has honed appearing in local old folks homes. He teaches microphone
technique (including vibrato); self-promotion; and song writing on the
Yamaha organ. His first step on the showbiz ladder was through a memorial
verse he sent to the deaths column of his local newspaper and he has not
been bothered at all by the absence of a sense of humour, talent, or
success.
Fellows could find himself the novelty hit of 1993.
Emily Woof is equally enigmatic. Her show is wilfully mis-entitled Sex III.
It is a series of drama school exercises taken to perfection. The delicate,
wistful Woof turns cartwheels, sings, plays the piano, and cavorts on a
trapeze. She also recounts the misadventures of a young girl, obsessed with
Anna Karenina, who hopes to meet her boyfriend in Spain.
Rarely has style triumphed so gracefully over content. Woof's narrative
leads nowhere - except to a succession of heart-tugging images. She starts
as the spitting image of the cover of the Penguin Classic of Tolstoy's
novel; she ends a disconnected, half-naked androgyne. The piece is
transfigured by Woof's physical perfection as she crashes a balloon,
performing the splits declaiming, 'don't stretch your legs for fear of
becoming a boy', and, at the finale, like Anna leaping to her death, Woof
flings herself off the trapeze. When inconsequence carries this much impact,
it becomes its own art form. A mesmeric performance.
Last year, the stand-up comics wrote themselves plays. This year they seem
rather stranded, like flailing dinosaurs left behind by changing taste. The
best on offer was the American Thea Vidale, who uses sex to please
feminists; blackness to appease anti-racists; and good old-fashioned common
sense to charm everyone.
Somehow you accept her analysis of male inadequacies, her almost physical
brow-beating of the audience, because Vidale has no illusions about herself
or her race. The act flags in the middle as she picks out American
obsessions, but it ends strongly. I even accepted the pay-off homily about
her children's bleak future in a racist society.
If there is a theme to the Fringe it is the exploitation of the
possibilities in the current popularity of opera. In Kill Me I Love You, a
quartet of professional opera singers known as Opera Circus, subjects famous
arias to heavy mugging. Donizetti's Love Elixir becomes Foster's Lager, and
Carmen emerges as a baritone in drag. Mime specialist David Glass directs.
I preferred Recital, in which soprano Helen Noonan declaims the life of a
diva. She begins by looking like the Countess in Der Rosenkavalier, all
Madame de Pompadour finery, and ends in tatters. Deserted by lovers and
toadies alike, her life falls apart, a decline conveyed through the arias
she performs, down to a splendidly resonant 'Remember Me' from Purcell's
Dido. The gap between the artificial life of the prima donna and the
emotions in opera's greatest moments are powerfully conveyed.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Olga Borodina - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE who left Edinburgh before the final week must be kicking themselves.
By accident, the festival brought together two recitals of Russian song and
one of them proved to be unforgettable: when people look back on the 1992
festival, they will remember it as the year that Olga Borodina sang
Tchaikovsky.
Before she appeared, however, there was an unplanned curtain-raiser. Dawn
Upshaw had cancelled a recital and her place was taken by Elena Prokina, a
young soprano from Odessa, who had already appeared this year in concert. By
starting with a selection of Tchaikovsky arias, she neatly fitted in with
the festival theme and presented her shining Slavic timbre to good
advantage. She has an appealing stage presence and her Rachmaninov songs,
with Iain Burnside the pianist, were natural, genuinely felt, and often
beautiful.
By the end of the next morning, however, her recital had been blown out of
the mind. Olga Borodina made her first Edinburgh festival appearances in
concert last year. At one, which included fragments of Musorgsky's
unfinished operas, she sang what was in effect a soprano part and surprised
audiences expecting to hear a deep Russian mezzo with the gleaming ease of
her top notes.
The capabilities of her voice were thus already known. What could not have
been predicted was the intensity of her singing in recital. Long pauses
intervened between the songs, as Borodina prepared herself, exchanging nods
and thoughtful glances with her pianist, Larissa Gergieva. If that is what
it takes to summon such spell-binding concentration, it was worth it.
The programme at the Queen's Hall was all Tchaikovsky. In theory, an ominous
proposition, likely to be burdened with a preponderance of slow and morose
music; in performance, a revelation. Borodina has the crucial recitalist's
gift of being able to create for each song a mood of its own and - no less
important - to focus her attention on the moment that holds the essence of
what it has to say. Even 'None but the lonely heart' came across with new
force.
In her final group, two songs were outstanding. For 'Night', in which
Tchaikovsky fearfully peers into the blackest depths of depression, the
singer called up her darkest, deepest contralto tone, a searing sound that
is descriptive of Russian suffering in all its forms. To follow that with
'Once again, as before, I am alone', sung in a plaintive and hollow voice,
as though in the grip of intense pain, was almost too much to bear. At last
the festival's theme felt complete: the whole tragic story of Tchaikovsky,
the man and musician, was here.
As for Olga Borodina, it is hard to believe that she is at the outset of an
international career. This young Russian is already an impressive
recitalist. One trembles to think what heights she might scale in the years
to come.

In the late 1970s Tony Garnett, producer of Up The Junction and Cathy Come
Home caused a furore when he produced Law And Order. Here was a (short)
drama series which suggested that all was not perhaps quite as it should be
with our law enforcement. Some policemen, it implied, might be a bit, er,
bent. Mary Whitehouse and others produced a mass knee-jerk response of
outraged indignation. How sweetly naive it all seems today after such
widespread revelations of police corruption, and so many appalling cases of
the wrong people being prosecuted (and persecuted) and imprisoned. High time
for a series which looks at the way in which our police are allowed to
investigate their own, ahem, shortcomings.
Judging by the opening episode, Between The Lines (9.30 BBC1) has the
authenticity of The Bill (not surprising since John Wilsher who wrote it
previously did 30 episodes of that ITV series), the gritty bureaucratic
detail of such modern police series as Waterfront and a bit, though for some
viewers perhaps too little, of the wham-bam action we used to get in The
Sweeney.
This looks like being the best police series for a long time.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Dave Valentin at the Jazz Cafe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT has happened to the flute? There was a time when music was bristling
with the things - from the Arran-knit folk of James Galway to the 'gentry'
rock of Ian Anderson's Jethro Tull. Jazz music too has had an on-off affair
with the most fragile of wind instruments, usually where it has been wielded
as a second choice to the sturdier saxophone.
The late Eric Dolphy and Roland Rahsaan Kirk were wild about it, the
tradition being just about continued by tenor/alto player James Moody. Apart
from him though, and our own Eddie Parker, the instrument seems to have been
sidelined in recent years.
American Dave Valentin, heard at Camden's Jazz Cafe for three nights this
week, is a full blown flautist, however, who is equipped to redress the
balance. His playing is lively Latin jazz first, and alluring world music
second. Unfortunately, away from his New York-based quintet and accompanied
instead by a taciturn five-piece jump band in the cold environment of the
Jazz Cafe, it proved hard for Valentin to generate much heat. Not that he
didn't try hard.
With a broad selection of standards from Wayne Shorter's 'Footprints' to
Gershwin's 'I love you, Porgy', Valentin's robust playing and tough
intonation showed that the flute can still be an easy alternative to the
reed.
Technically accomplished in the regular registers (he was taught as a
youngster by arch-jazz flautist Hubert Laws), Valentin overblows
energetically, putting substance and solidity into the usually airy notes of
the instrument.
Often, he expands the flute's vocabulary further by bringing his huge
collection of 'ethnic' flutes and pipes into the act. At Camden he dug into
a kitbag full of Peruvian pipes and Bolivian flutes for a solo and
improvised skit which employed reverb and delay.
This technique, often used nowadays with strings and where the soloist
accompanies himself via the echo chamber, must be a new departure for the
flute.
Here Valentin's eery voicings, blown over a repeating and bleeping cycle of
notes, added a new dimension to the most universal and folk-rooted of
instruments.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: An Ancient Triptych - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO anyone averse to good acting, intelligent theatre and classical culture,
I commend Andrei Serban's An Ancient Trilogy. This hammy and phoney
mumbo-jumbo, out at the Corn Exchange, is proving one of this Edinburgh
Festival's bigger hits. The performers are the National Theatre of Bucharest
from Romania. Serban, a director internationally celebrated for his opera
and theatre work, returned to his native Romania as General Manager of this
troupe in 1990.
He has assembled three plots from ancient Greek drama - Medea, The Trojan
Women and Electra, each of which he first tackled for Western troupes in the
1970s. (These may be a triptych but they certainly are no trilogy.) The
texts, said to be 'performed in ancient Greek', are a mish-mash. Medea, for
example, includes extensive Latin (via Seneca's play); and the Greek texts
are so mauled that it is not until Electra that you hear any of the iambic
pentameters that are, as with Shakespeare, the basic metres of the original
dramas. The tight formal structure of Greek theatre has been jettisoned.
That would be fine if Serban's version was of serious stature. But he has
reduced each plot to its most obvious ingredients, has removed all the
psychological insights and dramatic tension that make the original plays
remarkable, and has ladled cheap multiculturalism over the whole affair
(little bits of Aztec and Indian manners, lots of Kabuki intonation). Worse,
he has encouraged his Romanian cast to deliver crude, exaggerated,
unspontaneous and fake-intense performances.
Here is how to act in this kind of show. In leading roles you either stare
wide-eyed non-stop (this means you are in extremis) or hold your jaw up
parallel to the floor (this means you are bloody but unbowed). You snarl,
you wail, you blink real tears, you have a whale of a time. You produce your
voice in strained, chesty tones, sometimes quiet but usually loud. You avoid
naturalism, or sincerity, or restraint, like the plague.
If a single actor behaved like this, everyone would recognise it as ham,
worse than the worst of Joan Crawford. When a whole company carries on this
way, though, it becomes a 'style' and people fall for it. These Romanians
have the added cachet of coming from a former iron curtain country, and
therefore of being martyrs and heroes. They were, of course, rapturously
cheered.
Most popular of the three is The Women of Troy - which, with its
horrors-of-victory theme, is always a good show for the best kind of Amnesty
International sentiments. It is an easy play in which to create big
sensations, and Serban does so full-throttle. The first half takes place on
three sides of the audience, and sometimes in the middle. High up above us,
Cassandra (bare midriff) foretells disaster; Astyanax is caught and led to
destruction; his mother Andromache hurls herself to her death. The bitch
Helen is stripped, raped, tortured and killed.
But the play's real tension and serious poignancy of utterance are ignored.
The audience can sit during the second half to watch Polyxena be sacrificed,
and Hecuba and the other women be led off to slavery: much ritual
moan-groan-drone chanting. A great drama is reduced to Wimmin of Troy. In
Electra, Serban resorts to more spurious sensationalism (for example, a
9-foot snake).
He makes rubbish connections between the plays. Clytemnestra, for example,
ends in the same position as Medea did. The fact that this means nothing is
of no consequence here. It is merely meant to seem 'mythic'. It makes a big
effect. It wins a big hand. This is Theatre of Quick Sensation. Leave your
brains and hearts outside.
Continues at the Corn Exchange, Edinburgh, until September 5

FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: The Merry Wives of Windsor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALSTAFF was hauled back on stage at the behest of Queen Elizabeth I,
probably in 1597, to feature in The Merry Wives of Windsor, the worst sequel
Shakespeare wrote. The play is supposed to have been written in two weeks,
the temporal equivalent of half a Messiah, one Barchester Chronicle or any
Barbara Cartland novel.
Merry Wives makes poor comedy; but as a spectacle - as this production at
the Royal Shakespeare Theatre proves - it can entertain well enough: a good
stab at a bad play.
Two problems in the play persist on stage. The first is the fat and the
fatuity of Falstaff. He still has a kind of forward-waisted charm, a libido
which outstrips capacity, and a wit which occasionally turns on itself: 'I
have a great alacrity in sinking'.
But Falstaff in Windsor lacks the edge and viciousness of Falstaff in
Cheapside, never here the degraded genius who puts sensuality in the service
of intellect. Falstaff, as William Hazlitt knew, became the butt rather than
the originator of jokes.
The second problem is the lack of scope written into this good-humoured
petit bourgeois piece of suburbia. If Othello was the great Pillow Case,
then Merry Wives looks like the great Basket Case. The action is domestic,
and little is in question, not even the honour of Berkshire girls Ford and
Page.
A good director looks elsewhere, to the mechanics of the play, acknowledging
the elements of knockabout farce. In 1985, Bill Alexander kicked the action
into the 1950s, and gave the play a nostalgic prop or two. Here, the
energies of David Thacker's production have gone into the outrageous design
and costumes (William Dudley).
The set is an origamist's delight of twisted paper-look stairways and
cut-out balustrades, erected with Pisan inclination. The Elizabethan
costumes, bold but washed-out colours, people the set with visual vulgarity.
The action suffers from inexplicable pauses (Mistress Quickly crosses the
entire stage just to pat Falstaff's page on the head) and journeys to the
outermost parts of the set. But the acting, along with Guy Woolfenden's
sweet incidental music, keeps the play afloat.
Benjamin Whitrow as the fat - metabolically challenged - knight manages to
negotiate the passages where Falstaff uncharacteristically has to listen to
others; Whitrow conveys character in hearing, and that bespeaks high
technical skill.
Ron Cook's stock Frenchman, Dr Caius steals the show; he minces and drawls
with panache, and one expects him to transform into Inspector Clouseau at
any minute. John Nettles acts a dependable bucolic Master Page, attached to
his 12-bore.
It is a shame he is not in the culling vein when he finds the fat man with
antlers under the oak in Windsor forest. He could have saved Shakespeare -
and his nine operatic rewriters, including Salieri, Balfe, Verdi and Vaughan
Williams after him - some degree of embarrassment.
Master Ford, the jealous husband is rightly overplayed by Anton Lesser, who
finds a psychotic rage in the character. This is the comic version of
Leontes from The Winter's Tale, and the proper balance to Falstaff.
Around him, Gemma Jones and Cheryl Campbell as the Mistresses Page and Ford
make the most of the schoolgirl humour grafted on to their womanly appeal.
Falstaff even gives Mistress Ford the ubiquitous 'toe-job', a topical
reminder that the action is, after all, in Windsor, even if all Windsor
wives these days are not exactly merrye.
Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, (0789) 295623. In repertory

FT  04 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Prague awaits a second revolution - The
low level of building activity in the Czech city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prague's commercial property market is slowly emerging from the stranglehold
of 40 years of communist control. But the virtual absence of cranes above
the city's elegant skyline shows that it has not been a spectacular
transition.
Prague's beauty is part of its appeal for foreign companies wanting a
foothold in eastern Europe. But the need to preserve the city's heritage is
also a barrier to the tide of modern office development. Foreign investors'
high expectations following the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989
have been further dampened by worldwide recession, excessive red tape and
concern about the split between the Czech lands and Slovakia.
'Progress is slower than a lot of people originally anticipated,' says Mr
Richard Steer of Gleeds, the quantity surveyors, which has an office in
Prague. Mr Michael Hodges of Jones Lang Wootton (JLW), chartered surveyors,
says that the initial flood of enquiries from developers interested in the
Prague market subsided 'when they found they could not get through the
bureaucratic barrier'.
Nonetheless, the market is slowly developing. The early days after the
revolution, when there was a wild scramble for office space led to monthly
rents of up to DM100 a square metre. Today, prices have stabilised and the
letting market is more open.
Leases, for example, now tend to be between two and five years and modelled
on those of Austria and Germany. Before the revolution, buildings were let
on the basis of a 'commercial agreement', a document which merely stated the
names of the landlord and tenant.
But developers and investors must still contend with inadequate telephones,
poor infrastructure, disputes over land ownership, and difficulties in
getting planning permission.
The confusion over land ownership is being resolved; Czech citizens have
been allowed to claim property confiscated between 1948 and 1990, provided
claims were filed by September 30 1991. However, several claims to the same
parcel of land have created problems.
Construction is also becoming easier in Prague. Until recently, it was
difficult to acquire materials locally. Before the revolution, when
companies ran out of materials they sometimes abandoned work. The materials
for Prague's Atrium Hotel, for instance, were brought by truck-load from
France. Gleed's Mr Steer says that it is now possible to use local
construction groups for most jobs except the installation of lifts and air
conditioners. As a result, construction costs can be 30-40 per cent less
than in the UK.
Other problems, such as foreign investment, have been exacerbated by the
break-up between the Czech lands and Slovakia; political uncertainty has
frightened potential investors.
But these fears are overdone, in the view of Czechs, who believe that
Slovakia will be the loser from the political split. They say that the Czech
lands have attracted the bulk of foreign investment and have a more
diversified economy that contributes between Dollars 300m and Dollars 1bn in
subsidies to Slovakia every year. The relative affluence of the Czech lands
is underlined by the presence in Prague of international retail chains such
as clothes retailer Benetton, McDonald's, the fast-food chain, and furniture
supplier Ikea, and the sale of western goods in shops.
Nonetheless, political uncertainty is checking the expansion of western
companies. So too, in some cases, is the civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
'A surprising number of foreign investors are ignorant of where these places
are,' says Mr Chris Bennett of accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, which has
offices in Budapest, Prague and Warsaw.
Tourism in Prague has also levelled off. In sharp contrast to the experience
of the past two years, hotel rooms are now obtainable at short notice. Some
developers suggest bureaucracy is also becoming more entrenched as officials
become more burdened with the paper work associated with the transition to a
market economy.
Permission to build the Atrium Hotel, for instance, needed to go through
more than 100 stages of approval. (Prague, the Czechs recall, provided the
bureaucrats of the Austro-Hungarian empire.) The difficulties of getting
planning permission are largely due to the city's desire to preserve its
baroque heritage, which means that most development work will be confined to
refurbishment.
There are some exceptions. In the case of the European Business Centre, the
first new office building to be completed since the revolution, the
developers, the Vienna-based European Property Development company, set back
the facade to accommodate four more floors.
The difficulties in the market are not wholly the fault of obstructive
bureaucrats. Much of the problem in assessing how the market will develop
lies with the overambitious and underfunded developers.
Many schemes have been proposed and then dropped. 'Some entrepreneurs
raising bank debt created a bigger animal than they could cope with,' says
Mr Angus McIntosh of Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors. 'They bit off more
than they could chew in terms of finance and planning permission.'
The Czech authorities' slow decision making and the unreliability of foreign
developers also hamper the compilation of statistics about the market. JLW
has had a rough stab at estimating market size; it says that 10,000 sq m of
refurbished office space is available, while another 40,000 sq m is in the
pipeline.
Nobody can be certain about how demand will respond when the developments
comes on stream. JLW says rental levels will eventually be sustained by the
emergence of local businesses able to afford modern offices. Rents will not
sink below a monthly rate of DM50-DM55 a square metre, it predicts.
Among foreign investors, Germans, followed by Americans and Austrians, lead
the pack. French companies have also been active. The largest office
development project under construction in Prague is the 24,000 sq m
International Business Centre, built by CBC, the French construction
company. Another prominent site in the city centre will be developed by
France's La Caisse des Depots et Consignations.
In contrast, there is little sign of an investment market developing in
Prague. Some buildings have come on to the market after they were reclaimed
by their former owners. However, these properties were offered at inflated
prices, resulting in few sales.
According to JLW's Mr Hodges, an investment market might develop over the
next 12-24 months, if the country attains political stability and if there
is sufficient investment class property. He predicts that Prague's property
market will reach the same stage of development as Budapest in a few years.
For all the problems that investors and developers have encountered, most
dealers in the market are optimistic about its future. 'In five years it
could be a blue chip market,' says Gleeds' Mr Steer. Mr Phil Hudson of
property consultants East 8 agrees. 'The potential is tremendous,' he says.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Management: Teaming up for development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of multi-disciplinary 'project teams' is rightly becoming the rage.
Organisations are realising that it brings a string of advantages  - in
terms of speed, cost and quality - over the traditional practice of passing
projects from one narrow specialist department (or 'function') to another,
each of which does its work in turn.
Two particular spurs to this trend are the widespread introduction of total
quality management, and the growing need to accelerate the time it takes to
bring new products and services to market.
But few companies have really mastered how to manage their project teams.
Some have made the mistake of relying on a 'lightweight' approach, in which
a relatively junior person is given limited powers of co-ordination, and the
key resources - including specialists on the project - remain under the
control of their respective functional managers.
Others have gone an important step further, but not far or systematically
enough. Sensibly, they have not only moved all the members of the team to a
single location ('co-located' them), they have also appointed 'heavyweight'
project managers: senior people with responsibility for the work of everyone
involved in the project.
But they have failed to follow a set of detailed organisational and
leadership principles which pioneering companies have demonstrated to be
vital to the success of 'heavyweight' teams.
These principles are discussed in a new book by two of Harvard Business
School's leading professors, Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark*. An extract
is also published in the current California Management Review**.
Their work focuses on the management of product development, but much of it
also applies to a wide range of other team processes, in both manufacturing
and service industries.
Examining the challenge of managing heavyweight teams, the academics warn
that they may not merely conflict with the functional organisation  - an
obvious risk - but may also undermine senior management's influence and
control.
Wheelwright and Clark outline six principles to minimise such difficulties:
Creation by senior management of a clear mission for the team, in the form
of a project charter which sets out broad performance objectives.
Creation by the project leader and core team (as distinct from its
subsidiary members) of a detailed contract book, against which it is willing
to be evaluated. This should include a detailed work plan, an estimate of
the resources required, and an outline of the results to be achieved.
Staffing of the core team throughout the project by, typically, one member
from each primary function of the organisation. Other staffing principles
include, wherever possible, not allowing a core member of the team to occupy
a similar position on another team.
Project leadership in a very different style from that used with lightweight
teams. Heavyweight leaders not only manage, lead and evaluate other members
of the core team. They also champion the basic concept around which the
product, process or service is being shaped. They spend time out of the
office, talking not just to project contributors inside and outside the
company, but also to customers, dealers and so forth. This includes
gathering market data at first hand.
Team member responsibilities are wide. As well as each member's own
functional responsibility (for example, for all appropriate marketing
expertise), each core member also shares responsibility for the team's
overall performance.
An executive sponsor is needed in senior management. This person acts as a
channel for communication with top management, and as coach and mentor for
the project and its leader, while also 'empowering the team to lead and
act'.
Creating a team that really is 'heavy' - one with effective leadership,
strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to integrate across functions
 -also requires changes in the day-to-day attitudes and behaviour of
engineers, designers, manufacturing and marketing specialists, conclude the
Harvard duo.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Management: Second opinions on health reform - Keeping up
the pressure for change in Britain's NHS is not proving easy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great reform in Britain's National Health Service, designed to stimulate
efficiency through internal competition, is doomed to collapse within the
next four years into cosy, bureaucratic arrangements that militate against
change.
That will, at least, be the case if a simulation exercise played by health
professionals in the NHS's East Anglian region proves correct. The exercise
found that close links soon developed between health authorities and
particular hospitals, with the attractions of familiarity and the status quo
proving stronger than the competitive opportunities of playing the market.
Having won the fight for the reforms against political opposition and
introduced them in an initially sceptical NHS, ministers recognise that they
still have to maintain the momentum for change. Even if the East Anglian
exercise does not prove an exact portent of the future, keeping alive the
spirit, as opposed to the mechanics, of the changes may not be easy.
The separation of healthcare purchasing from its supply - the
purchaser-provider split - has been achieved. But contracts between
purchasers and providers are negotiated by managers who, until last year,
were colleagues in the old-style NHS. They share the same origins and
culture, and in some cases, the same offices. In many parts of the country,
there is only one local hospital with a natural catchment population.
In spite of the fury that accompanied the introduction of the reforms,
perhaps not so much has changed after all. Although the financial structure
is different, real competition does not always seem to be the driving force.
The possibility of the reforms simply replacing one bureaucratic structure
with another is not only exposed by the East Anglian simulation; some
academic research points to the same conclusion. A study by Bristol
University school for advanced urban studies found that the NHS market
structure, far from being competitive, was 'closer to a bilateral monopoly,
with a single purchaser and at best a few providers'.
The school's Julian Le Grand recently told the Social Policy Association
conference that the extent of competition would depend on the willingness of
patients to accept treatment at more distant hospitals. But a study
conducted in Sheffield suggested that 38 per cent of patients were not
prepared to travel at all, while another 36 per cent were willing to journey
no more than 10 miles for treatment.
If patients cannot be relied upon to contribute to competitive pressures on
the NHS, it becomes all the more important that the service has a management
structure which offers the best chance of achieving the intentions of the
reforms.
So far, the most evident management changes have been in the hospitals,
where doctors are becoming more involved in managerial decisions and
managers of self-governing trusts enjoy decision-making autonomy unknown
before last year.
But the NHS's bureaucratic structure - based on district health authorities,
regional health authorities and a central management executive reporting to
an NHS board and ministers - remains as it was before the reforms. Some of
this is about to change.
A working group of the NHS executive is examining the management structure
and will report to Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, soon. Bottomley has
warned that the service must not 'slip back into the old ways of monolithic,
oppressive over-planning'. Andrew Foster, NHS deputy chief executive, says a
solution based on modern management approaches points to a lean structure at
central and intermediate levels.
The 14 English regional health authorities are unlikely to emerge from the
review in their present form. Once responsible for running region-wide
services as well as allocating funds to district authorities, they look
increasingly vulnerable now that services are based on a direct relationship
between districts and hospitals. With most hospitals and other services
likely to become self-governing trusts by the middle of the decade, some
form of management structure between trusts and Whitehall needs to be
retained. But trust managers fear that giving this responsibility to the
present regional authorities would be to nudge the service back towards the
monolithic over-planning feared by Bottomley.
John Greetham, chairman of St James's University Hospital, Leeds, and of the
NHS Trust Federation which represents managements of self-governing trusts,
believes regions should be replaced by a smaller number of scaled-down
bodies. He argues that there also needs to be a new approach to the
allocation of capital to maintain the dynamic of the reforms.
'In the old-style NHS, regions allocated capital. They did this on the basis
of a strategic over-view, nepotism, special pleading and political
pressures. You are bound to get bureaucratic and political fudging if an
organisation distributes capital like this.'
Greetham believes the way forward is to allow rival trust hospitals to bid
for new, region-wide capital projects on a competitive basis. 'Competitive
bidding would encourage trusts to devise more imaginative and cost-effective
ways of meeting needs. This would not always be by putting up new buildings
 -it could be a high-technology mobile unit serving several hospitals.'
On the purchaser side, Charles Marshall, general manager of Newcastle health
authority - a job he will soon be leaving to run London's Middlesex and
University College Hospitals - agrees that in the past, funding priorities
have too often been set by powerful, established hospitals. The reforms
shift this power towards purchasing authorities, and many are beginning to
involve the public in discussions about priorities.
Newcastle has set up user groups from among patients to help determine
priorities, although Marshall stresses that 'we must listen to the public
but are paid as managers to take difficult resource decisions'. Health
authority managers must make these decisions, aware that they are now
'advocates for the patient rather than defenders of particular hospitals'.
The reforms - introduced at speed because of political pressures - still
leave many uncertainties for managers. GP fund-holders, for example, are
favoured by ministers because their ability to purchase hospital treatment
on behalf of individual patients introduces genuine market-style choice into
the NHS.
Too many fund-holders exercising market-style choice, however, can unbalance
the equally pressing need for district health authorities like Marshall's to
plan health provision around agreed priorities. One solution, he suggests,
might be for groups of GP fund-holders to use the health authority as their
purchasing agent.
Another question for the future concerns whether it makes sense for district
health authorities and family health service authorities - which run the
family doctor and community services - to retain their separate identities.
In an innovative development in the NHS's Trent region, both sets of
authorities - while retaining separate identities by law - have decided to
blend their accounting, information and support services and will begin
appointing joint staff.
Restructuring the NHS's bureaucracy will never evoke the same passions as
the introduction of the reforms - or the uproar that will break out later
this year when the government faces decisions over whether to close famous
London hospitals.
If the warnings of the East Anglian simulation exercise are correct,
however, getting the shape of the management structure right may hold the
long-term key to whether the reforms meet their objectives.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Users warn on N-power levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE energy users warned yesterday that proposals to reduce the Pounds
1.2bn nuclear levy on electricity bills would not be substantial enough or
speedy enough to solve the problems facing industry.
Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers, said he was
encouraged that the industry regulator Offer and the generator PowerGen -
both of which have called this week for a cut in the levy - accepted that
power prices were uncompetitive.
He said: 'However, I am also disappointed that the solution being proposed
is far too small, and on a timescale which will not solve the serious
problem on energy costs.'
The 11 per cent levy was imposed on all electricity bills after the
privatisation of the fossil-fuel generators to subsidise the higher costs of
other sources of electricity. More than 95 per cent of the levy goes to
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator.
Mr Brogden has told Offer and the Department of Trade and Industry that
ICI's chlor-alkali business on Merseyside, which is one of the biggest
consumers of electricity in the UK. has faced increases in electricity costs
of almost 60 per cent since April last year.
This had made it increasingly uncompetitive with producers in Europe and
North America, and had brought cuts in production.
Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said he was
pleased that Offer was 'prepared to listen'. He said, however, that a
reduction in the nuclear levy did not go far enough and industry should be
the principal beneficiary of any reduction in prices.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Shipbuilder to shed 510 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YARROW Shipbuilders, GEC's naval shipyard in Glasgow, is to shed 510 jobs
because of a gap in its order book. The jobs are in ship outfitting, one of
the final stages in shipbuilding.
Yarrow is finishing two ships now and has orders for a further five
frigates, and outfitters for these ships will not be needed for 12 to 18
months. The company said yesterday that it will then employ the number of
staff losing jobs now.
Yarrow, which employs 2,750 people, cut 645 jobs last December, mainly in
fabrication, as it finished work on the Type 23 frigates Iron Duke and
Monmouth. The fresh wave of redundancies comes in spite of orders for five
frigates earlier this year. In January the shipyard won a Pounds 400m order
for three more Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy. Yarrow had hoped for
earlier orders, but the government procurement process was slowed by the
Options For Change defence spending document.
Yarrow was also awarded a Pounds 322m contract in January for two frigates
for the Malaysian government. That was the first overseas warship order for
Yarrow since it was sold by the government in 1985.
Work has started on the three Navy frigates and design work is under way on
the Malaysian order. Both contracts will maintain work at the yard until
1997. Yarrow said they 'were too late to maintain continuity of employment'.
Volunteers will be sought, but there are likely to be compulsorily
redundancies. The jobs will be cut by the end of the year.
Mr John Carty, Clyde district secretary of the AEEU engineering and
electricians' union, said he was 'extremely disappointed'. He would meet
management next week to look for ways to cushion the blow.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said the announcement was
another nail in Britain's industrial coffin. 'If we throw people in
manufacturing jobs out of work we will only end up importing what they used
to make, which is a disaster for everyone,' he said.
The UK's biggest offshore module yard yesterday warned that it may have to
shed 1,500 jobs next spring unless it wins orders it is pursuing against
intense competition, Chris Tighe writes.
The warning from AMEC Offshore, which operates extensive facilities on the
Tyne and employs 3,500 people, underlines the serious job-loss implications
of the downturn in the offshore industry.
In the past 10 days nearly 400 jobs have been lost in north-east England's
offshore sector. Redpath Offshore on Teesside, part of the Trafalgar House
group cut 200 jobs while 196 went at AMEC Offshore, including the loss of 76
which will take effect today.
AMEC Offshore completed two large contracts this summer and work on the
current order book will end next spring.
Yesterday the company said the 1,500 job losses would affect both direct
employees and subcontractors taken on in the past year. It added that the
figure was a 'worst-case scenario' - it hopes its tenders for projects in
Norway and the UK sectors of the North Sea will win more orders.
ELECTRICIANS employed by Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, yesterday
staged a 24-hour unofficial strike to protest at the provision of training
in electrical work for boilermakers on the company's payroll, Chris Tighe
writes.
The action by 550 electricians was condemned by senior union officials. It
highlights the problems faced by UK shipyards in maintaining a balanced
range of workforce skills while fighting to replenish dwindling order books.
Swan Hunter has some orders up to the end of 1994, but its workload now
consists almost entirely of outfitting. It needs to retain men in the
front-end steel trades in order to bid successfully for new orders.
The company, which last Friday announced 1,425 job losses among employees
and contract workers, reducing its workforce to 2,200, has identified 100
boilermakers whom it plans to train to work in other trade areas. The first
batch of 11 are due to start on-the-job electrical training today.
The electricians held a meeting yesterday morning and failed to return to
work.
The company said yesterday that training for multi-skilled working was
within the provisions of its versatility agreement. Mr John Cunningham,
chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at
Swans, said the action by the electricians had breached that agreement. 'We
have agreements with the company; some people have misunderstood them,' he
said.
Mr Cunningham said a meeting between union leaders and management yesterday
afternoon had produced a solution to be put to shop stewards today. The
versatility agreement would be honoured and work would continue normally, he
pledged.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Abu Dhabi briefed on BCCI investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, ROBERT PESTON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH officials are confident that criticism of Abu Dhabi's role in the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International affair by the inquiry headed by
Lord Justice Bingham will not be so severe as to risk a row between the two
governments.
Officials say criticism of Abu Dhabi's role in the affair is far less
extensive than that levelled at other institutions, especially the Bank of
England.
Extracts from Lord Justice Bingham's final conclusions relating to Abu Dhabi
were circulated among Foreign Office officials early last week after being
delivered to the Treasury and the Bank of England. This followed months of
activity by UK diplomats aimed at limiting the damage the BCCI affair might
do to relations between the UK and Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in
BCCI. Last year the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, was the
UK's second largest trading partner in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia.
A draft of the Bingham report criticises Abu Dhabi for delaying giving the
Bank of England information on the scale of the fraud at BCCI. It highlights
as a serious omission a nine-month delay in communicating details of the
losses and fraud - including the theft of Dollars 2.2bn of Abu Dhabi's
funds.
Abu Dhabi and its advisers are understood to reject what they see as a slur
on the emirate's reputation, but Abu Dhabi government representatives have
reassured British officials that the emirate is prepared to continue to keep
bilateral relations separate from the issue of BCCI.
It is understood that Abu Dhabi is considering a study prepared by the
Ministry of Defence on how UK military personnel and defence equipment could
be used in the reorganisation and modernisation of armed forces in the UAE,
which Britain considers an important ally against Iraq.
A federal judge in Washington has been asked to order Abu Dhabi to hand over
shares of First American Bankshares, the US bank illegally controlled by
BCCI, Alan Friedman in New York writes.
The move was instigated by lawyers for Mr Harry Albright, the independent
trustee for First American appointed last June after the Federal Reserve
Board ordered that the bank be sold. Mr Albright said the action followed
long negotiations that failed to persuade Abu Dhabi to hand over the shares.
Mr Sandy Martin, a partner at the Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs and
Blow, representing Abu Dhabi, said the shares had been registered in Mr
Albright's name. However, some of the shares are held by Abu Dhabi as
security on a Dollars 9.5m loan.
'We believe that unless we are told otherwise by a court it is our
obligation to retain possession of the certificates,' Mr Martin said.

THE PHONELINE service which played a tape of an intimate conversation,
allegedly between the Princess of Wales and Mr James Gilbey, was yesterday
condemned as 'an unreasonable invasion of privacy'.
ICSTIS, the watchdog on premium-rate telephone services, censured The Sun
newspaper for arranging for the 23-minute tape to be played to callers who
paid up to 48p a minute to hear it. It banned The Sun's use of numbers with
the prefix 0898 for the tape.
The Sun today refuses to scrap the scheme, and says it has moved it to a

BANKS are levying much heavier charges on corporate customers than personal

Charges to banks' corporate customers varied so widely that companies should

Mr Clark said his group's research had identified a large retailer which
paid Pounds 2m a year in bank charges, but which ought to be paying at least
Pounds 300,000 less.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Car sales figures expected to be low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGURES for last month's sales of new cars, to be published today, are
expected to show that registrations were virtually unchanged from a year ago
at about 370,000, Kevin Done writes.
The result is a serious setback for the motor industry, which had hoped that
August would mark the beginning of the long-awaited recovery in demand for
new cars.
Most leading carmakers had earlier forecast sales in August of about 400,000
and the industry now faces a serious problem of excess stocks.
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, the leader of the UK new-car
market, said that sales for the full year were now forecast to total no more
than 1.55m.
This would be a 2.5 per cent fall from last year's already very depressed
level of 1.59m and would be a 33 per cent fall from the peak level of 2.3m
reached in 1989.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Inner-cities obstacle to council tax: Shortfalls of up to
22% estimated in property values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORTFALLS OF up to 22 per cent in property valuations for the new council
tax, which replaces the poll tax in April, are included in estimates by the
Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities.
The impact of the lower-than-expected valuations is partly offset by the
valuers' discovery of more than 1m more homes than the government had
estimated. But, according to the association's provisional results published
yesterday, the base for the tax - the total value of homes in England - will
still be 1.8 per cent below the value on which the government based its
estimated tax rates.
Millions of households could be in lower tax bands than estimated and the
government appears to have overestimated values most in inner-city areas.
The association's figures - based on data from the Department of the
Environment - show that only 18 per cent of homes in England have been
valued at more than Pounds 88,000 (in tax bands E to H). The government
estimated last year that 28 per cent of homes would be worth more than this.
More than 67 per cent of homes are worth less than Pounds 68,000 (tax bands
A to C), against the government's 1991 estimate of 55 per cent.
This overall figure conceals much larger reductions in the tax base in
London and some large cities.
In inner London, for example, the tax base will be 8.5 per cent below the
government's 1991 estimate. It will be 9.6 per cent under in Bristol, and 15
per cent under in Liverpool. The tax base for the shire counties as a whole
will be virtually as estimated.
The variation is even more marked in inner-city London boroughs. Hackney's
tax base, for example, is 22 per cent less than the government had
estimated. The government had estimated that more than two-thirds of
Hackney's homes would be worth more than Pounds 88,000: the valuers have
assessed only 15 per cent at more than this, with 72 per cent worth less
than Pounds 68,000.
Kensington and Chelsea is one of the few London boroughs to show a rise in
its tax base, which is up 13.6 per cent. The increase is largely because of
a jump in the number of homes worth more than Pounds 160,000, up from 36 per
cent to 45 per cent.
The over-estimation of valuations means tax rates at every band would have
to be higher if the tax is to raise the Pounds 6.8bn used in the
government's figures last year.
This could increase the problem of convincing the voters that the tax is an
improvement, even though many households would pay less than expected
because their home fell in a lower band.
COUNCILS in England collected almost a quarter of this year's poll tax in
the three months from April to June, compared with 12 per cent for the same
period last year, according to environment department figures published
yesterday.
The figures showed 24 per cent of the 1992 tax was collected in the second
quarter. Last year's poll tax collection was delayed by the Pounds 140
reduction announced in the Budget. However, non-domestic rate collection is
also up this year at almost 26 per cent compared with 23 per cent in
1991/92.
The figures show councils are continuing to collect poll-tax arrears from
last year. Another 4 per cent of the poll tax for 1991/92 was collected,
bringing the total income to more than 93 per cent of the target.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Recyclers set sights on load of rubbish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRAWNS, Christmas trees and electricity could be the by-products of a
council's ambitious scheme to recycle or re-use virtually all of the
domestic rubbish in its area.
Halton Borough Council in Cheshire yesterday announced that it had signed a
20-year joint venture with Biomass Recycling, a recently-formed waste
management group, to re-use 98 per cent of the contents of household
dustbins by 1995.
The contract is the most radical response to the Environmental Protection
Act, which set councils a target of recycling 25 per cent of refuse by the
turn of the century.
Mr Tony Barratt, the council's development manager, said: 'We thought the 25
per cent rule would require us to put in Pounds 500,000, which we haven't
got. The Biomass scheme will save the council Pounds 10m over 20 years.'
Halton council claimed that the scheme would 'totally eclipse' the
government targets, but the Department of the Environment said only material
that was strictly recycled - as opposed to used for energy generation -
would count towards the quotas.
Many recycling schemes have been uneconomic, given the cost of sorting
rubbish, but Biomass said it expects to make 'rapid profits' from Halton's
40,000 tonnes of annual domestic waste. Recyclable material - mainly metal
and plastic - will be sorted centrally, avoiding the costs of collecting
different types of rubbish separately.
Biomass has signed a 20-year contract with Norweb, the regional electricity
company for north-west England, to sell it the gas from the decomposition of
waste. Norweb will use the gas to generate electricity.
Mr Tim Midgeley, a Biomass director, said 'the technology we're using is as
old as the hills'. He added: 'It's crackers no one has done this before.'
Biomass will use water warmed by the decomposition to farm prawns and
crayfish. It wants to use the eventual compost for enriching soil to grow
Christmas trees. Set up by the Jardine Matheson Group to help local
authorities meet the Environmental Protection Act, Biomass will invest
Pounds 1.6m in the first year on the central sorting technology.
Mr Midgeley said: 'Each tonne of waste is worth around Pounds 40 to us,
including about Pounds 5 from reclaimable plastics, Pounds 10 from metals,
and around Pounds 12 from energy.'

FT  04 SEP 92 / US dismisses China's protest on F-16 sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITE House yesterday rejected the strongest protest heard from China in
a long time over the decision by President George Bush to permit the sale of
US warplanes to Taiwan.
China accused Washington of being untrustworthy and of violating the Sino-US
joint communique of August 1982, expressing itself 'shocked and outraged'.
China threatened to withdraw from arms control talks between the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council if the decision to
supply Taiwan with 150 F-16 fighters was not reversed.
However, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, immediately
dismissed the Chinese objections. 'The president made his decision based on
the stability of the region,' he said. US officials noted that China had
recently acquired enough modern Russian-built fighters to throw Taiwan's air
defence capabilities 'out of kilter'. The Chinese protest warned of 'a major
retrogression' in Sino-US relations and said this would have a negative
impact on bilateral co-operation in the UN and other international
organisations.
Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said 'the US government should be
held accountable for any serious consequences'. At a press conference in
Jakarta, where he is leading a delegation to the Non-Aligned summit, he
added: 'On the one hand, the US government is arguing for arms control, but
on the other hand it is selling such sophisticated fighters.'
Mr J Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador to China, was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry in Beijing yesterday to be told by Liu Huaqiu, vice-foreign
minister, that the decision was a gross interference in China's internal
affairs and 'undermines the great cause of China's peaceful reunification'.
The 1982 communique, one of three agreements forming the basis of Sino-US
relations, expresses US intent to 'reduce gradually sale of arms to Taiwan,
leading over a period of time to a final resolution'. Mr Bush helped
negotiate the understanding with China a decade ago.
Proponents of the F-16 sale argue that the US has the right to provide
Taiwan with the arms that it needs for its defence.
The sale of US warplanes to Taiwan was blocked during the cold war.
Washington needed China's help as a counterweight to the military strength
of the old Soviet Union. The role of China in this formerly critical balance
has vanished.
China's rebuke to the US is likely to add to its unpopularity in Congress
where its human rights record is under criticism and its most favoured
nation trade status under debate.

Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night went further
than any western leader in accepting Beijing's intransigent attitude to
criticism of its human rights record, Our Foreign Staff writes. 'According
to the Chinese, the most fundamental human right is to be able to live, not
to die of hunger, to have a house to live in . . . I think it is half true,'
he said.
After much agonising, Japan last month accepted an invitation for Emperor
Akihito to visit China in October. The Emperor is expected to acknowledge
Japanese guilt for wartime brutality, while stopping short of an outright
apology.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Algeria takes another step in slide towards civil war: In
the wake of last week's bombs, Francis Ghiles sees growing conflict between
fundamentalists and the ruling council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MONTHS after Algerian President Mohamed Boudiaf was assassinated by a
bodyguard, the bomb which last week killed nine people and wounded scores at
Algiers airport marks another step down a road leading North Africa's
largest country towards ever greater civil strife.
Worse is in store if one is to believe leaflets distributed by the banned
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) this week, which warned of attacks against
those who 'tell lies' - that is, political parties and journalists which
support the five-man Council of State which, since the aborted elections of
last January, has ruled Algeria.
The kilogramme of TNT which exploded in an airport crowded with immigrant
workers returning to Europe after their annual visit home, and Algerians
returning from holidays abroad, was designed to kill civilians. A telephone
warning avoided a similar tragedy at the Air France booking office in the
heart of the city, which was wrecked by a bomb.
These incidents follow scores of others aimed at civilian targets, such as
town halls and telephone exchanges, and which mark a shift in the tactics of
opponents of the regime.
Until the summer, terrorist attacks, most of them by FIS supporters or
members of more radical Islamic groups, avoided civilian targets. At least
130 members of the security forces have died since January.
No one knows for sure who was behind the murder of Mr Boudiaf and who
planted the bomb at the airport. The FIS never formally claimed
responsibility for the late president's death, but said the fate which Mr
Boudiaf met was inevitable. Although some powerful vested interests had much
to lose from Mr Boudiaf's strong wish to combat corruption, the view that
they were behind his murder remains unsubstantiated.
As for last week's bomb, the FIS has simply stated that it does not aim to
kill its own people.
The 'invisible hand' much loved of the Algerian press is at work again, and
those Algerians who love to explain everything in terms of conspiracies can
listen to radio and press reports which regularly accuse the CIA and the
French special services of all the sins visited on Algeria.
The FIS, a broad grouping which eight months ago held 48 per cent of the
popular vote in Algeria's first multi-party elections before the process was
aborted, gives the appearance of being utterly fractured. The so-called
'jazairist' majority, which had said it would respect the result of the
poll, appears to have lost ground to the 'salafist' hardliners whose
conviction has, all along, been that violence alone could bring about an
Islamic republic.
Salafist members have in recent weeks received vocal support from the
dissident PFLP-General Command, a Palestinian dissident group led by Mr
Ahmed Jibril, formerly headquartered in Syria but now backed by Iran, and
from the Hizbollah Radio Baalbech. Two of its most prominent members were
last week expelled from France.
Four things are clear, however:
The determination of the Islamic activists to resort to ever-increasing
violence.
The desire for peace and order among broad sections of the Algerian public,
who nonetheless show little overt support for their leaders.
The equal determination of the authorities to fight back, using the security
forces and professional soldiers.
The unity of the army.
Whatever disagreements there may be on what exactly constitutes the right
amount of force to deal with the FIS, there appears little disagreement
about the need to restore the authority of the state.
Civil war is by no means inevitable, although the hearts and minds of the
Algerian people have not yet been won by either side.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Bombings mark split in Kenyan opposition
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BOMB exploded in Nairobi yesterday outside the venue for an opposition
delegates' congress, raising fears of an eruption in violence between
tribally based rival factions of Kenya's main opposition party.
Police fired teargas at the venue as clashes between stone-throwing rivals
injured several supporters.
Police also removed an unexploded bomb from outside the house of Mr Jaramogi
Oginga Odinga, leader of one of the feuding factions, hours before the
registration of delegates for the congress of the Forum for the Restoration
of Democracy (FORD) which will pick a presidential candidate.
Observers believe the stage is now set for a possibly violent showdown today
between the two factions within the party. This would further erode the
credibility of FORD ahead of the country's first multi-party elections in 26
years, expected next month.
The debilitating division in FORD has considerably boosted the electoral
chances of President Daniel arap Moi, 68, who last year was under intense
pressure to move towards political pluralism, clean up his human rights
record and resuscitate an economy awash with corruption and mismanagement.
Western donors and the International Monetary Fund last November suspended
aid worth about Dollars 40m a month until Mr Moi, who has ruled Kenya for 14
years, addressed these concerns.
In recent months FORD, which earlier this year was riding a crest of popular
euphoria, has almost collapsed in a power struggle fuelled by ethnic
conflict and personality differences.
Two wings have emerged, one led by Mr Odinga, who is a Luo, and which is
supported by many young professionals who fought for an end to the one-party
system. The other wing is led by Mr Kenneth Matiba and Mr Martin Shikuku. Mr
Matiba is from the dominant Kikuyu tribe and Mr Shikuku claims to speak for
the Luhya tribe, Kenya's third largest.
Both groups are playing the tribal card, which remains the single most
important political factor in Kenya.
Party elections last month to choose delegates to the conference were
chaotic. Several districts did not hold elections and there were widespread
allegations of ballot rigging.
The division, expected to be made formal today, has allowed Mr Moi to
exploit the disintegration in FORD and to travel the country to press his
campaign themes of stability, unity and development for Kenya in a troubled
region.
Western donors, with the exception of the US, have begun to look more
favourably on Mr Moi's political position. The government has also made
progress in tackling the three key economic issues raised by donors -
curbing the budget deficit which last November, was heading for 6.7 per cent
of GDP; restructuring of the large and inefficient public sector; and
curbing gross corruption.
An IMF mission will visit Kenya this month and is expected to approve
government policies. This could pave the way for resumption of aid - which
would boost Mr Moi's electoral chances.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CUBA yesterday accused the US of forcing it into poverty and hunger, and
appealed to the non-aligned movement to support Havana in breaking the US
trade embargo.
Mr Juan Bosque, Cuba's foreign minister, told the non-aligned summit in
Jakarta that President George Bush's policy towards Cuba had become 'more
aggressive, more ignominious, more brutal'.
The embargo had compounded the crisis caused by the collapse of the eastern
bloc which accounted for almost 80 per cent of Cuban trade, he said.
Mr Bosque said Cuba had been closed off from any form of credit or
development assistance, leaving the economy in a critical situation. He
accused Washington of applying 'immense pressure . . . throughout the entire
world to prevent our country from obtaining oil'.
Describing the embargo as a 'declared economic war', he said 'imperialist
aggression will not sway the Cuban people . . . it will not make us renounce
our principles and abandon our struggle'.
The US was also attacked by Mr Taha Ramadhan, Iraqi vice-president, for its
imposition of the 'no-fly zone' in the south of the country. He said it was
'an aggressive decision which violates the sovereignty of Iraq and against
which we are mobilising all the peoples of Iraq'.
Mr Ramadhan has invited representatives from the non-aligned movement to
visit southern Iraq to 'see for themselves how life is actually lived' and
to 'expose the falsity of the fabricated allegations floated around by the
enemies of Iraq'.
The prime ministers of India and Pakistan held bilateral talks in Jakarta
yesterday on the disputed region of Kashmir.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, described the meeting as
'very useful and constructive'.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, said the two countries
would maintain a dialogue on the issue but he was not expecting
instantaneous success.

A PRECARIOUS peace was holding in Afghanistan yesterday amid concern that
fresh fighting between mujahideen factions might break out if Uzbek militia
forces in Kabul are not pulled out by tomorrow's deadline, agreed under a
ceasefire last week.
The militia have been at the centre of a dispute between the government of
Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani and hardline guerrilla leader Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar.
Mr Hekmatyar has been demanding the removal of the militia from the capital,
as a condition for peace.
At least 2,000 people were killed last month when Hekmatyar troops pounded
Kabul with rockets and gunfire. Another 100,000 fled the city in search of
shelter and food. A ceasefire began at the weekend when the Afghan
government agreed to the withdrawal of the militia. A new buffer force was
to be placed between Mr Hekmatyar's forces and government troops to prevent
fighting.
However, there were no signs that the militia was preparing to leave or that
the buffer force would be in position by tomorrow. Although there has been
no serious fighting this week, there have been allegations from both sides
of ceasefire violations.
Iranian President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani begins a four-day visit to Pakistan
on Sunday. Islamabad sees this as a chance to explore closer economic
co-operation and discuss issues such as Afghanistan.

FT  04 SEP 92 / South Africa to trim civil service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DEREK KEYS, the South African finance minister, yesterday announced plans
to cut central government employment by up to 5 per cent next year, a
significant step toward tackling the bloated civil service as part of a
structural adjustment programme for the economy.
Moves to trim the civil service, which has been used by National party
governments since 1948 to provide near-guaranteed employment for white
Afrikaners, have always been fiercely resisted. But faced with the prospect
that a multi-racial interim government would expand the bureaucracy further,
Pretoria has clearly decided to try to get staff numbers under control
before such a government comes to power.
The move could prove politically controversial. South Africa's central
government and provincial administrations employ some 750,000 people, out of
total public sector employment (including state enterprises) of 1.7m. Some
600,000 of these employees are white, and most of those are conservative
Afrikaners. Mr Keys said yesterday it was essential to 'restrain the growth
in the consumption spending of general government in favour of a much higher
rate of fixed investment in new productive capacity'. Toward that end, the
cabinet had set new spending guidelines for government departments for the
1993-94 fiscal year involving a 3 per cent real spending cut.
He said President F W de Klerk had challenged heads of government
departments to achieve this goal through productivity improvements,
including staff cuts.
Mr Keys painted a bleak picture of the state of government finances for the
current financial year, which ends next March.
He said he expects the government deficit before borrowing to equal at least
6 per cent of gross domestic product, 1.5 percentage points above the
budgeted figure and nearly twice the 3 per cent figure used as a guideline
by the International Monetary Fund.
This is partly the result of a shortfall in revenues due to South Africa's
economic recession, the longest since 1908.

PROSPECTS for the resumption of talks between the African National Congress
and the South African government received a setback yesterday when the ANC
reaffirmed its two-month suspension of discussions on a new constitution and
called for popular protest to put pressure on Pretoria.
ANC leaders emerged from a three-day meeting of the organisation's national
executive committee to declare that resuming talks would be pointless until
the government took firmer action to halt township violence. 'Government
must take steps to prove that it is not just paying lip service to the
elimination of violence,' said Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general.
Earlier, the troika of European Community ministers met President FW de
Klerk in their efforts to break the negotiations deadlock. They were due to
leave South Africa last night after a two-day visit during which they met
leaders of the main South African political parties.
Negotiations over the past fortnight between Mr Ramaphosa and Mr Roelf
Meyer, minister of constitutional development, appear to have foundered over
the issue of violence, and the release of ANC political prisoners, both ANC
preconditions for the resumption of wider-ranging talks on a post-apartheid
constitution.
The two men are to continue discussing this, but it is unclear that the ANC
can bring much more pressure to bear on government to force further
concessions. After last month's week-long campaign of mass action, it is
unlikely the ANC can mount another sustained campaign. And while talks
remain deadlocked, business confidence will remain low as the country's
worst economic recession in memory continues.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Rabin to avoid radical budget

<TEXT>
THE FIRST annual budget drawn up by Israel's Labour-led government, to be
presented to the cabinet on Sunday, will contain no radical departures from
the policies of the previous coalition ousted in the June election, finance
ministry officials said.
But they said they were drawing up an extensive accompanying package of
structural reforms which, taken together with the 1993 budget plans, could
help produce the long-term growth promised by Labour when Mr Yitzhak Rabin
defeated the Likud party.
The ministry's Shk98bn (Pounds 20.4bn) budget proposal, at this stage framed
in 1992 prices, is almost Shk5bn less than expected expenditure this year
thanks mainly to a sharp fall in Jewish immigration from the former Soviet
Union, an associated cut in housing plans - including Jewish settlements in
the occupied territories - and lower debt servicing costs.
Labour's promise to channel greater investment to development projects is
reflected in a 26 per cent increase in infrastructural spending to
Shk1.45bn. But the plan avoids cuts in social and defence spending which
together account for more than Shk40bn. The budget deficit is projected at
3.2 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with an anticipated 4 per
cent this year.
Details of the reform package have not been released, but officials said it
would include tax reforms, liberalisation of the capital markets, breaking
existing monopolies in telecommunications, transport and agricultural
marketing, loosening the state's grip on land sales and extending import
liberalisation.
Jewish immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union last month was the
highest for four months, continuing a trend of gradual recovery from a low
point in May, but still only at half the level of a year ago. The Jewish
Agency said 4,933 immigrants arrived, a small increase over July but a
significant rise over the 3,361 who arrived in May, the lowest monthly total
since the wave of immigration began in late 1989.

<TEXT>
OPPOSITION leaders in Tajikistan made plans yesterday to end a month-long
political impasse by dissolving the presidency, a day after demanding the
resignation of hardline President Rakhmon Nabiyev.
The plan, which the opposition intended to put before a special parliament
session today, came amid fresh fighting in the streets of the southern
regional capital Kurgan Tyube. The city has been the centre of violence
between Mr Nabiyev's supporters and his opponents, in which more than 2,000
have died and 100,000 have fled.
Observers say the proposed parliamentary move amounted to a political coup
d'etat.
'They'll declare him non-president tomorrow, either legally or not, and the
diplomats are going to have an interesting time. Whom do we listen to?'
asked a senior diplomat in Dushanbe.
Mr Nabiyev remained in hiding yesterday and protesters kept possession of
his palace.
A senior KGB official said Mr Nabiyev had taken refuge in a Commonwealth of
Independent States garrison in Dushanbe.
Mr Nabiyev, Tajikistan's former communist party boss, has steadily grown
weaker since taking power in an election last year.
In May he ended a 51-day protest by handing over eight of the most powerful
seats on his 24-member cabinet to the opposition. But last month he had to
fight off yet another attempt to unseat him in parliament.
In its declaration on Wednesday, the opposition stopped short of stripping
Mr Nabiyev of power. But in effect its plan achieves the same end.
Mr Nabiyev has not surfaced since protesters stormed his palace on Monday,
saying he refused to stop his supporters from attacking opponents in Kurgan
Tyube. The protesters were comprised mostly of refugees from fighting in the
city.
Opposition leaders have severed television broadcasts from neighbouring
Uzbekistan and one of two Moscow television channels, which they believe are
hostile to Tajikistan.
The move further isolated this nation of 5m people, who share a 1,100-mile
border with China and Afghanistan.
In July, Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov cut all aircraft services to
Tajikistan, fearing that weapons from the fighting could be smuggled in. A
severe fuel shortage has limited trade to a trickle.

CANADA is to hold a national referendum on a new constitution that aims to

country's nine English-speaking provinces, writes Bernard Simon from
Toronto.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney yesterday announced that the vote would be
held on October 26.
The vote will not be binding, but is expected to determine whether or not
the Quebec National Assembly and other provincial legislatures proceed with
ratification of the national-unity proposals drawn up last month by Mr
Mulroney and provincial and aboriginal leaders.
A public opinion poll published yesterday indicates that the package enjoys
a wide measure of support among voters, with 61 per cent of Canadians
outside Quebec and 49 per cent of Quebeckers in favour of the deal.

FT  04 SEP 92 / FT Conference (World Aerospace and Air Transport): Aircraft
launch programmes cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERCAPACITY in the commercial aircraft industry, rising costs of new
product development, and airlines' continuing financial problems will lead
to a sharp cut in programme launches over the next two decades.
This warning was given by Mr Adam Brown, planning director of the European
Airbus consortium, at a Financial Times conference yesterday.
The three leading aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing, Airbus and
McDonnell Douglas, had launched a total of 19 new or important aircraft
derivative programmes during the past 20 years.
'I find it extremely difficult to envisage more than a quarter this number -
that is, at a maximum four or five - major product launches in the next 20
years', Mr Brown said. Future programmes are expected to include a new
400-600 seater super jumbo aircraft, a second generation supersonic airliner
to replace Concorde, and new derivatives of existing widebody and narrowbody
twin-engine airliners.
Overcapacity has largely resulted from the new aircraft order frenzy by
airlines from 1988 to 1990 which has created a total firm order backlog
equivalent to five years of future production compared to the industry's
historical average of just over two years.
From peak delivery levels of this year, Mr Brown expected aircraft industry
business volumes to shrink from 800 deliveries this year to about 400 in
2004, picking up to around 600 aircraft a year by 2008-2010.
The industry remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects for air
travel and new aircraft demand, but future aircraft delivery forecasts would
ultimately depend on the ability of airlines to finance new aircraft
purchases.
'The key challenge facing airlines in the 1990s is not one of shortage of
aircraft as in the late 1980s, but of a shortage of capital,' Mr Maurice
Foley, deputy chairman of GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing group, said. The
airline industry's huge losses during the past two years were catastrophic
for a business which needs to finance at least Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15bn) a
year in new aircraft.
'Since mid-1990, the world airline industry has lost at least Dollars 10bn,
an amount roughly equivalent to its entire earnings in the previous six
years,' Mr Foley said. 'For any industry, such a setback would be a
significant blow: for one which must finance over Dollars 30bn-worth of
assets per year on average, it is a catastrophe.'
Similar concerns were echoed by Mr Brian Rowe, head of US General Electric's
aero-engine activities.
He said the main question facing the industry was: 'How do we continue to
develop large commercial engines when our customers are losing
multi-billions of dollars a year and it seems they are still a few years
away from relief?'

FT  04 SEP 92 / Collor scandal has put Brazil's economic reforms on ice:
Political uncertainty has frozen the process of financial modernisation and
seen old evils return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO MANY Brazilian businessmen 1992 has been a wasted year in the quest for
economic stabilisation. They have already transferred their hopes to next
year.
In some ways, however, the economy has proved remarkably resilient to the
corruption scandal which this week led to the initiation of an impeachment
process against President Fernando Collor.
Since the scandal began in May, stock markets have swung with the day's
rumours but the currency has remained stable. August's monetary expansion
was the lowest this year at 15 per cent and this week the central bank
succeeded in selling Dollars 1bn of government bonds. Investment decisions
are generally on hold, though the central bank said yesterday that the stock
market last month suffered a net outflow of Dollars 80m in foreign capital.
What apparent stability there is is a tribute to Mr Marcilio Marques
Moreira, the economy minister, who says his biggest achievement has been
preventing Mr Collor resorting to massive spending or an economic shock
programme alleviating the recession in the hope of winning some popularity.
'You can't imagine how many people are going to the president each day and
suggesting this,' he says.
However the political uncertainty is producing a return to the process of
protective pricing, pushing inflation above the 20 to 22 per cent a month
level it has stuck at for almost a year. Mr Moreira, who once predicted 2
per cent inflation by December, now admits that 'to push inflation down in
this climate is very difficult and I don't expect it to decrease much this
year'.
The 'Collorgate' crisis has had even worse effects on the government's
attempts to balance its budget, distracting congressional attention from a
USDollars 20bn tax reform package which the ministry warns must be approved
this year if Brazil is to avoid 'fiscal disaster' and the collapse of its
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Failure to implant fiscal reform means the economic team is continuing to
rely on a policy of high interest rates as its only weapon against
inflation. This has deepened industrial recession, causing a fall in tax
revenues, while domestic debt grew 156 per cent in real terms in the first
six months of this year - a problem the central bank governor refers to as
'the elephant in the basement'. More than 40 per cent of next year's budget
is devoted to debt servicing and amortisation.
Tax revenues are expected to be down 13 per cent this year partly because of
increased evasion spurred by the revelation of high-level corruption.
Next year's deficit-based budget, completed this week, highlights the
parlous state of government finances. Unable to increase revenues, the
government plans 22 per cent cuts in investment. This follows a 35 per cent,
or USDollars 8bn, reduction this year. Mr Moreira admits: 'It's incredible
how things are not collapsing with the cuts we have made.'
Some Brazilian economists argue that the country is trapped in a cycle where
tight money produces deeper recession leading to falling tax revenues and
the issuing of more domestic debt to raise funds.
The policy is taking its toll on the private sector. Last year 249 of
Brazil's 500 biggest companies finished in the red with combined losses of
USDollars 2.5bn. Some joke that the only people making money are those
selling black cloth for use in the anti-Collor demonstrations.
But there is some good news. This year's exports are expected to reach a
record USDollars 36bn-38bn, producing a surplus of Dollars 15bn, partly
because of a strong agricultural performance. The country hopes to achieve
growth this year of 2 to 3 per cent compared with 1 per cent last year.
Liquid foreign exchange reserves are at the record level of USDollars 21bn,
reflecting high foreign capital inflows - USDollars 7.7bn in the first five
months.
Mr Collor's supporters claim that the corruption charges against him were
provoked by objections of 'invested interests' to his modernisation
programme of dismantling cartels and reducing tariff barriers. They are now
spreading fears that a government led by Mr Itamar Franco, the man who would
take over in the event of Mr Collor's ouster, would abandon this and resort
to a shock programme, wasting all Mr Moreira's efforts at austerity.
However, what Mr Collor has done is forge a consensus behind modernisation
which it would be difficult to go against. Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, an
opposition congressman, says: 'History will give Collor credit because he
had the courage to confront monsters and taboos in the economy.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of Americans living below the poverty line soared last year to
its highest level since President Lyndon Johnson launched his War on Poverty
in 1965.
The US Census Bureau reported yesterday that 35.7m people were living below
the level it defines as poor - an income of Dollars 13,924 for a family of
four, or Dollars 6,932 for someone living alone - compared with 33.6m in
1990.
In addition, Census Bureau economists said that the wealthiest 20 per cent
of families had incomes averaging 8.4 times the poverty level, compared with
a ratio of 6.1 per cent 25 years ago.
The new Census Bureau figures place 14.2 per cent of the population below
the poverty line, up from 13.5 per cent in 1990 and 12.8 per cent in 1989,
but lower than in 1982-1984, during the last US recession.
Earlier this week, the Commerce Department announced that personal incomes
last year failed to keep pace with inflation for the first time in nine
years. Average personal pre-tax incomes rose by 2.4 per cent, to Dollars
19,092, compared with consumer price inflation of 4.2 per cent.
Census Bureau statistics show that 40 per cent of adults defined as poor
worked, and 9 per cent of them held full-time, year-round jobs.
Nearly three-quarters received public assistance in some form, and 29 per
cent had no medical insurance.
Poverty was most pervasive in the south, where 16 per cent of the population
were counted as poor. The poverty rate reached 14.3 per cent in the west,
13.2 per cent in the mid-west and 12.2 per cent in the north-east.

OTHER reactions to President Bush's announcement echoed Australia's
dissatisfaction:
THE EC: An official described the move as 'belligerent', asking if
increasing farm support was compatible with the joint EC-US pledge to secure
a Uruguay Round deal, David Gardner reports from Brussels. No wheat
programme had been mentioned at talks this week between Mrs Carla Hills, US
trade representative, and Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs
commissioner, he added.
But Brussels seemed to be pulling its punches, adhering to the informal
truce agreed with the US on bilateral farm trade disputes, in the hope of
getting an overall Gatt settlement before the end of the year.
CANADA: Ottawa will try to protect its grain markets, Mr Charles Mayer,
grains and oilseeds minister, said, Reuter reports from Ottawa. He called
the US action a unilateral move lowering world grain prices. 'It is like
hitting a fly with a hammer'. It would hit everybody, driving down their
prices, he declared.
Canada might have been willing to co-operate with the US, Australia and
Argentina to try to stem the war with Europe over markets, but the US had
acted unilaterally. It was an election year (in the US), and if Washington
had wanted to talk about the Europeans, 'it would have been better to talk
with us to see if we could do something, but they gave no indications at
all. It's like getting into a fight with a skunk: everyone comes out
smelling.'
BRAZIL: The foreign ministry yesterday confirmed Brazil would not buy the
500,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat offered by the US, Christina Lamb reports
from Brasilia. The decision calmed the fears of Argentina which since 1986
has replaced the US as Brazil's main wheat supplier.
This year Brazil is expected to buy 2m tonnes of Argentine wheat under
Mercosur, the free trade zone formed last year between Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay. Brazilian diplomats said they were keeping 'an open
line' with Buenos Aires. Brazil wants to avoid further strain with its
Mercosur partners, already worried that its huge economic and political
problems could make the agreement collapse.
ARGENTINA: The government was 'surprised' and 'displeased' by the US
decision, John Barham reports from Buenos Aires. Argentina has seen its
wheat exports plunge to Dollars 525.6m (Pounds 264m) last year from Dollars
1.47bn in 1981, due largely to EC and US subsidies. Mr Alieto Guadagni,
international economic relations secretary, said farm subsidies now cost
Argentina Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn a year in lost export revenues. He had
not yet worked out the impact of the new US subsidies, but believed
Argentina was 'satisfied' by Brazil's decision not to buy subsidised wheat.
Last year, Brazil angered Argentina by importing subsidised US wheat.

Chicago wheat futures were easier in late trading yesterday after
Wednesday's sharp rise following President Bush's subsidy announcement,
David Blackwell reports. Traders said the market was under pressure because
not all the 28 countries targeted for EEP wheat from the US might be
interested, especially China. Yesterday's initial downward movement came as
Egypt's bid for 600,000 tonnes of EEP wheat was rejected on price, traders
said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE is to buy 40 new F-16 fighter aircraft from the US in a
government-to-government sale, with delivery expected to start in 1993, the
Greek defence ministry said yesterday.
The price is still to be finally negotiated but is likely to be about
Dr160bn (Pounds 457.6m). The purchase will mark the final stage of a Dollars
2.5bn (Pounds 1.25bn) Greek air force procurement programme dating from
October 1984. Greece already has 40 F-16s, bought from General Dynamics, the
manufacturer, under a deal that included a number of offset agreements.
The Greek government believes that delays in implementing the offset
accords, which included a Dollars 50m investment programme and manufacture
of F-16 components in Greece, reduced their potential value for the economy.
It also wants to avoid prolonged bargaining this time in case production of
F-16s is phased out earlier than expected. Otherwise, Greece could find
itself in the awkward position of receiving the aircraft from Turkey, its
Nato ally but rival for control of the Aegean Sea. Turkey has a joint
venture agreement with General Dynamics to make the F-16.
Meanwhile, a dispute with Dassault of France, supplying the Greek air force
with 40 Mirage 2000 combat jets, was resolved last week. The contract was
amended to cover upgrading of the air-to-air radar on 28 aircraft already
delivered.
After Greek pilots flying the Mirage 2000 complained of radar failures in
rainy weather, the government refused to take delivery of the remaining 12
aircraft under the existing contract.
Under the revised agreement, Dassault is also to provide, free of charge, a
Falcon 900 military transport fitted out as a passenger aircraft. It will be
used by Greek government officials.

<TEXT>
A SPOKESMAN for United Auto Workers (UAW) yesterday said progress was being
made in the trade union's talks with General Motors (GM) over the Ohio
strike, which has affected more than 30,000 GM workers.
Mr Reg McGhee, the UAW official, said a settlement was not yet in sight, but
the union was cautiously optimistic the talks were moving forward.
The talks have been underway since August 28, when some 2,300 workers went
on strike over job security and related issues at a crucial metal-stamping
plant in Lordstown, Ohio.
Separately, an agreement was yesterday reached between GM and the UAW over
health and safety issues at a Lordstown car assembly plant. Although this
accord will not affect the strike at the metal-stamping plant - the source
of the broader shutdown - the UAW official called it 'a positive step that
indicates the two sides are willing to negotiate an end to the situation.'
The strike at the metal-stamping plant resulted in GM's decision to shut
down production at a series of car assembly plants around the US, which were
suffering shortages of components. A total of 32,500 workers  - of GM's
total US hourly workforce of 300,000 - have been affected so far.
Over the past week the following plants have been shut down because of the
Ohio strike:
The Tennessee plant that employs 6,000 workers assembles GM's low-priced
Saturn model;
The Lordstown, Ohio plant that employs 7,000 workers and assembles Chevrolet
and Pontiac models;
A Baltimore van plant with 2,900 employees;
A Michigan plant with 4,200 workers that assembles Cadillacs and
Oldsmobiles;
A Buick and Pontiac plant with 4,200 workers in Wentzville, Missouri;
A Buick plant in Flint, Michigan with 4,200 workers
An Oklahoma Buick and Oldsmobile plant with 4,000 employees.

BRAZIL'S accord with the International Monetary Fund is 'on hold' until the
resolution of the corruption scandal, according to Mr Marclio Marques
Moreira, economy minister, writes Christina Lamb.
Mr Moreira said: 'We are not unrealistic enough to want the impossible. It's
unlikely that we'll receive any payments from the Fund this year.'
Brazil failed to meet both first and second quarter fiscal targets of the
Dollars 2.1bn agreement signed in January and has drawn down no payments
since the initial tranche. A meeting to discuss new targets has been delayed
and Mr Moreira said yesterday: 'We won't renegotiate the targets until after
the crisis.'
However, he denied that the delay might jeopardise an accord with creditors
over the country's Dollars 44bn commercial debt. The Brazilian draft
termsheet was presented to the Advisory Committee of creditor banks in New
York this week and Mr Moreira said, 'We will certainly have the termsheet
agreed and signed before the IMF meeting on September 21.'

plans

THE Australian government and farmers' organisations reacted angrily
yesterday to US plans to increase sales of subsidised wheat, despite US
assurances that Australian export markets would not be damaged.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said Australia 'strongly objected' to the
announcement by President Bush that the US will subsidise with an additional
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) the export of 29.1m tonnes of wheat to 28
countries in 1992-93. The announcement was 'hard to square' with earlier US
assurances that the export enhancement programme (EEP) would be implemented
so as to minimise the impact on Australia's unsubsidised wheat exports.
The announcement sent 'a negative signal' about US commitment to Gatt's
Uruguay Round world trade talks, stalled earlier this year after the US and
EC failed to agree reductions in farm support.
Officials said the Australian government was especially angry about the
extension of the EEP programme to countries such as Pakistan and South
Africa, which Canberra regards as an attempt to widen the scope of US sales
at the expense of unsubsidised competitors.
The Bush plan was defended on Australian radio by Mr Steven Censki, acting
director of the US agriculture department's foreign agricultural service,
who denied it represented an escalation of US subsidies. 'It's more the
method of announcing the EEPs has changed. We bundled all the initiatives we
would announce during the new year together into one large announcement,' Mr
Censki said. 'It provides more certainty to our export trade; we think it
provides more pressure on the EC to reduce its subsidies.'
But farmers' organisations said the programme would drive down world prices.
Mr Ian MacFarlane, president of the Queensland Grain Growers Association,
called it an 'electorally driven bastardisation' of world markets. Mr Bruce
Lloyd, deputy leader of the the National Party, said the US was now
Australia's 'number one trade enemy'.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Mexico to privatise nine ports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government is to privatise the country's ports in an attempt to
boost their productivity, the finance and transport and communication
ministries have announced.
Mexico is to auction concessions to manage nine ports across the country,
including those at Acapulco, Progreso, Lazaro Cardenas and Manzanillo.
Puertos Mexicanos, the state ports authority, is to be disbanded.
The share of trade handled by Mexico's ports has been steadily falling over
recent years, with the US port at Houston handling more Mexican goods than
any national port, thanks to lower prices and greater reliability.
The privatisation is part of a broader government programme to privatise the
country's infrastructure. The government has said it will sell off
concessions to run selected airports, and has awarded concessions to build
3,700km of toll roads.
While the Mexican economy is slowing down, the transport and communication
and construction industries grew by 7.6 per cent and 4.9 per cent
respectively in the first half of this year.
Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, has said Mexico will need another
Dollars 4bn to complete the toll road programme. The government is designing
international infrastructure bonds, but has urged the private sector to
raise capital.

FT  04 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Britain could recover EFA outlay -
Production set to yield Pounds 11bn to UK treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is likely to recover the full value of its investment in
the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) if it goes ahead with the programme, Mr
John Weston, a senior British Aerospace official claimed yesterday.
Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence, told a Financial Times conference
that EFA production could yield over Pounds 11bn to the UK Treasury in taxes
and revenues, including from exports. A world market existed for up to 3,000
aircraft of this category up to the year 2015. At the same time, he hinted
at an imminent deal with Saudi Arabia for additional Tornado aircraft,
predicting Tornado production would continue to 1996.
BAe production work on existing UK and Saudi orders for the
Anglo-German-Italian aircraft has already virtually ended. Rejecting
suggestions that the EFA was a 'gold-plated super-bird,' he said significant
scope existed for cutting the cost of the project but the aircraft was
already designed to be as small and light as possible.
Reports by the Eurofighter consortium and partner companies on prospects for
making a cheaper aircraft would be available next month. These studies
coincide with a review of requirements by defence chiefs of the four nations
involved, including Germany, which has said it will not go ahead with
production.
Mr Weston argued that industrial offsets associated with purchase of an
alternative aircraft would 'in no way' compensate for loss of technology or
export business. He echoed complaints voiced at the conference by a senior
executive of the US manufacturer McDonnell Douglas about what was seen as
excessive government interference in management of defence contracts.
Mr Thomas Culligan, vice-president in charge of programme development and
marketing, said US defence contractors had been subjected to 'increasing
government oversight and regulation' in the last decade. He urged
'constructive change' in the procurement system to remove obstacles to
performance. Mr Weston said similar problems existed in the way many UK
contracts were managed, with companies having to cope with 'armies of
accountants'.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Major's problems will outlive vote -
He wants and expects a Yes, but has no illusions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the moment British politics is held in thrall. The conventional wisdom
is that the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht will be a
watershed for Mr John Major's government.
The Euro-sceptics - Conservative and Labour alike - relish the prospect of a
No vote on September 20. They predict that chaos in the financial markets
would untie sterling from the D-Mark through devaluation or the break-up of
the exchange rate mechanism. With economic and political union derailed, the
nation states of Europe would be free to cast off the shackles of Brussels.
On the other side of the argument, many of Mr Major's supporters foresee
political salvation in a Yes vote. The pressures in the ERM would evaporate,
reviving confidence in the economy. With his government holding the EC
presidency, Mr Major could then direct his formidable political talents to
persuading the Danes to rejoin the enterprise.
No-one should be surprised at the polarisation of the debate. In recent
years the nation's politicians have been incapable of discussing Britain's
place in Europe in anything other than blacks and whites. At Westminster you
are either for or against Europe.
The adversarial shorthand is convenient for both sides. The uncertainties
over the French vote are offered by the British government as an explanation
of its inaction in the face of deepening economic gloom. For the Tory
Euro-sceptics the referendum provides a focus for their assault on Mr
Major's economic strategy and his alleged willingness to surrender
parliamentary sovereignty.
There are advantages also for the media too. The notion that the
government's fortunes hinge on a single throw of a set of Gallic dice is
tailor-made for headline-writers.
However, those charged with steering British policy are confident of nothing
but that, whatever the result, the implications will emerge in different
shades of grey.
Whitehall is working to the assumption that the French electorate will
endorse European union. But there is plenty of contingency planning in case
France votes no.
The starting point is that the government would withdraw from the House of
Commons legislation to ratify Maastricht. Beyond that, most of the
assumptions in Whitehall would dismay the Euro-sceptics. Ministers dismiss
the notion that French rejection of Maastricht would provide Mr Major with a
chance to redraw Europe as he wished.
In a reference to Lady Thatcher's implacable opposition to European union,
one senior official commented bluntly: 'It's simply nonsense to think that
Europe would be turned overnight into a continent of Thatcherites.'
How Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand would react is
not clear, but no one believes they would abandon their ambitions to bind a
united Germany to a more unified Europe.
For his part, Mr Major's disdain for the federalist ambitions of some of his
European partners has not dented his conviction that Britain cannot be
sidelined: that it would have to remain at the centre of whatever followed
Maastricht.
Nor does he consider that a No vote would offer a let-out from the
commitment to hold sterling to its DM2.95 central rate in the exchange rate
mechanism - underlined yesterday by the Treasury decision to raise Ecu10bn
(Pounds 7.25bn) in foreign currencies through the foreign exchange market.
He shares the growing concern of Tory MPs that the recession is being
prolonged by high German interest rates. But his commitment to the
anti-inflation discipline of the ERM pre-dated Maastricht and would outlive
it.
It is not hard to find cabinet ministers who would breathe a sigh of relief
if the markets forced a revaluation of the D-Mark against all currencies.
But they are far from convinced that the prime minister would be prepared to
retreat from DM2.95. They are certain that if France held firm, then Mr
Major would risk the political backlash from a rise in interest rates rather
than have sterling tagged with the lira as one of the sick currencies in the
system.
The implications of a Yes vote are similarly ambiguous. Lady Thatcher
offered another reminder yesterday that the Euro-sceptics are determined to
disrupt and, if possible, defeat British legislation to ratify the treaty.
They draw comfort from private acknowledgement in Whitehall that French
support for the treaty may do little to persuade the Danish electorate
eventually to change its mind.
The assumption among ministers is that French backing for Maastricht would
remove the pressure for a rise in British interest rates. But there remain
doubts that that in itself would be enough to pull the economy from
recession. In the words of one minister this week: 'We will all breathe a
huge sigh of relief - and then say to ourselves what the hell do we do now?'
There is little doubt that Mr Major wants and expects the French to say Yes,
but he can have few illusions that an electorate across the channel will
solve his problems.

FT  04 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Standard bearer for Mitterrand's Yes
campaign - William Dawkins profiles the French European affairs minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE earnest, neatly tailored Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, French European affairs
minister, has over the past few weeks become both the workhorse and standard
bearer of her government's pro-Maastricht campaign.
The 46-year-old European affairs minister has been on the stump somewhere in
the French provinces almost every day since mid August and will have visited
more than 40 cities before the campaign is out. She has lobbied in the
provinces far more than any other government minister.
Yet for all her admirable qualities, Mrs Guigou's campaign must be a factor
in the surprise emergence of a majority against European union in some
opinion polls. One found her less convincing than Philippe Seguin, the
Gaullist MP who has taken the highest profile in the no campaign, and less
convincing than the rabidly anti-Maastricht head of the Front National, Mr
Jean-Marie Le Pen.
The indefatigable Mrs Guigou bought her campaign to the Euro-faithful
earlier this week, at a European Movement youth conference in a seaside
holiday village near Biarritz.
'Success or failure hinges not so much on turning back the no vote as on
those who have not yet made up their minds,' she
told her audience of student campaigners. They should concentrate on the
details of the treaty because much of the no vote was based on ignorance and
misunderstanding.
Campaigners should remind local townsfolk that hardly a French commune
lacked afacility, built with the help of EC cash. She omitted, however, to
mention that France was a net contributor to EC funds and that its
contributions were likely to rise as a result of the treaty.
Even so, it was clear, competent stuff. Mrs Guigou knows the treaty
backwards and she talked to her young audience without a trace of
condescension. She bore heckling with calm good humour and hit back trick
questions with skill.
So why has Mrs Guigou's approach not won more votes? It could be that her
style is so clearly Parisian, a disadvantage when so much of the no vote
appears to be a protest against the political establishment. To some, she
appears reserved, though this is said to be symptom of underlying shyness.
Oddly, Mrs Guigou's background is quite like that of her arch-opponent Mr
Seguin. They were both born in colonial north Africa and went to the elite
civil service college, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration following high
flying careers in the public administration. Yet Mrs Guigou has come out of
this quite a different person - a cool technocrat, as against the more
populist Mr Seguin.
Despite both sides' entreaties to the French populace to vote purely on the
issues style counts for something in this - as in any other - political
campaign.

<TEXT>
MR Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday issued a ringing
appeal for a 'positive result' from the French referendum on European union,
as Bonn stepped up its campaign to save the Maastricht treaty.
The future of Europe was at stake, he said. The intervention of both Mr
Kinkel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the French campaign underlines the
growing concern in Bonn at the stumbling ratification process throughout the
Community.
Mr Kinkel reminded all EC member states of their commitment to press ahead
with ratification.
In Spain the government presented a draft bill to parliament proposing to
speed up ratification. Parliamentary committees will decide next Tuesday
whether to adopt the bill, which could rush the treaty through in a month or
less.
Italian leaders launched a campaign to press parliament into ratifying the
treaty before the French referendum.
The full Senate could ratify Maastricht four or five days before the
referendum.

economic fears

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Sapin, France's finance minister, yesterday attempted to squash
fears about the implications of the Maastricht treaty for the French economy
by saying that long term interest rates could come down if France voted Yes
in this month's referendum to ratify the treaty.
The finance minister was careful not to specify when they would do so.
He warned of the economic consequences of France rejecting the treaty. 'I am
not one of those who say it would be Maastricht or chaos,' he said. 'But it
would be very bad for the French economy.'
Mr Sapin' statement helped to boost the Paris financial markets. The CAC 40
Index rose by 4 per cent during the day to close at 1,780.
The economy has emerged as a central issue in the referendum debate. The
anti-Maastricht lobby has fuelled French public concern about the power of
Germany within the European Community by arguing that, as part of a unified
Europe, the Germans would be able to wield greater influence over the French
currency and interest rates.
Interest rates are a source of concern for Paris given the cost of borrowing
 -with an annual inflation rate of around 3 per cent and bank base rates of
9.85 per cent - is among the highest in Europe and is one of the main causes
for the recent sluggishness of the economy.
However, the government's hopes of reducing rates have been scuppered by the
high level of German rates. Last autumn Mr Pierre Beregovoy, now prime
minister and then Mr Sapin's predecessor at the finance ministry, was forced
into an embarrassing volte face when he briefly tried to hold French rates
below those of Germany only to be forced to raise them again when the franc
came under pressure on the currency markets.
Mr Sapin has continued Mr Beregovoy's rigid economic policy of continuing to
countenance relatively high long term interest rates in order to protect the
franc. Yesterday he argued that the ratification of the Maastricht treaty
would create a stable economic environment in which France would have the
necessary flexibility to reduce rates again.
He refused to be drawn on what would happen to interest rates if the French
rejected the treaty. However, he warned that such a result would create
tension within the European Monetary System and would have a 'negative'
effect on the French economy.

<TEXT>
THE German health minister, Mr Horst Seehofer, yesterday publicly snubbed
the country's medical profession as a result of a virulent campaign against
his plans for reforming the health service.
He withdrew his acceptance of invitations to special meetings in Bonn and
Cologne, saying in a letter to the heads of two leading medical
associations, that his opponents had broken the basic rules of decency and
overstepped the limits of good taste in a series of newspaper
advertisements. These included charges that the scheme amounted to
'disguised euthanasia', and a copy-line: 'Die early, cost less.'
He would examine the factual evidence submitted by the profession, he wrote,
but attending the meetings in the 'emotionally heated' climate would be
'meaningless'.
Mr Seehofer's plan - approved by the cabinet in July - to reduce annual
federal contributions to the state-subsidised health service by DM11bn
(Pounds 3.9bn), has been strongly criticised by doctors and dentists.
The main targets are proposals to limit the number of doctors in the
national health service, cuts in fees, prescription limits and increased
charges for patients.
Several medical groups yesterday dissociated themselves from the
advertisements, published at the end of last month and paid for by a Berlin
doctors' organisation, and asked for the dialogue to start again as soon as
possible.
Meanwhile, the Hartmannbund, representing 50,000 practising doctors and
10,000 students, yesterday launched a new protest campaign, and started
raising a petition signed by patients.
The drugs industry, which will have to contribute to the economy drive
through a 5 per cent cut in drugs prices, has run a low-key campaign and
offered alternative reductions designed to achieve the same budgetary effect
as Mr Seehofer's across-the-board cuts.
The health insurance groups, which claim their outgoings are increasing at
double the rate of their income from contributions, have welcomed the
reforms. There has been no significant protest from patients.

FT  04 SEP 92 / New attacks threatened by Karadzic

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAV peace talks which opened yesterday in Geneva have been immediately
undermined by a threat from Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Bosnian Serbs,
to launch a fresh offensive throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The threat came as an Italian aid aircraft crashed in unknown circumstances,
apparently killing all four crew, close to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. It
was carrying blankets from the port of Split in Croatia to the capital's
besieged inhabitants. All relief flights to Sarajevo were suspended.
Mr Karadzic, in a letter to Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said
he was drawing up plans to 'stop by force' the flow of weapons to Bosnia's
government forces. Bosnian Serbs have accused the international community of
supplying the arms.
'I am told that we will face a strategic dilemma within days which will
require us to use force to halt the illegal supply of weapons if the
international community will not act,' he said. Mr Major's office said it
would be drafting a reply 'over the next few days'.
The letter stems from recent developments in the eastern Bosnian town of
Gorazde, which Serb forces had besieged for four months. The siege was
lifted last Sunday after Serb forces started to withdraw under instructions
from Mr Karadzic. As they did so, forces loyal to the Bosnian government
rapidly moved to regain lost territory.
Local Serb commanders immediately accused the United Nations of supplying
weapons to largely Moslem forces in Gorazde, after a convoy had managed to
reach the besieged city late last month. The UN has consistently played an
impartial role in its peace-keeping efforts in Bosnia.
A Serb commander said at the time that his forces would not make the same
mistake again, implying that the UN was partial, and indicating that the
Serbs would not be prepared to lift sieges of any other towns or cities in
Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic's letter clearly reflects the pressures weighing on Serb forces.
'Every measure and sanction against the government of President Alija
Izetbegovic (of Bosnia) to halt this escalation must be taken,' Mr Karadzic
warned.
Since Bosnia's independence was recognised last April, Serb forces have been
able to capture more than 70 per cent of Bosnia because they are backed by
the Yugoslav federal army. For its part, the Bosnian government has been
unable to defend itself because it has not been exempted from the UN arms
embargo.
Reuter adds: Rescue teams last night reached the site of the crashed Italian
relief aircraft, a UN refugee spokesman said in Zagreb. 'Pieces of aircraft
are scattered all around.'
A French armoured personnel carrier from Sarajevo and a US Chinook
helicopter had reached the site near Jasenik in mountains west of Sarajevo.
Another six armoured vehicles are heading for the site.
While the cause of the crash was still unknown, a UN spokesman in New York
said no military activity had been reported in the area at the time the
aircraft disappeared from radar screens.

Finland's central bank yesterday increased interest rates by one percentage
point to 18 per cent, the third rise in less than a month, in an attempt to
stem the outward flow of capital from the country, write Robert Taylor in
Stockholm and Hilary Barnes in Helsinki. Last month the country's reserves
fell to FM23bn (Pounds 2.9bn) from FM31bn.
Since last November, when Finland devalued the markka by 12.3 per cent
against the Ecu, the international money markets have mistrusted the ability
of the fragile centre-right coalition government to deal with the country's
most serious economic recession - despite government spending cuts.
The government yesterday released its draft 1993 budget, which allows for a
deficit of FM47.7bn and expenditure of FM175.3bn.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's security service, in an extraordinary leak to the
press, suggested yesterday that his visit to Japan might not take place
because Tokyo was unable to fully guarantee the Russian leader's safety from
terrorist attack, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Against a background of fierce diplomatic posturing over the territorial
issue which is dominating the Russo-Japanese agenda, it was not clear
whether the leak was sanctioned at a high level to prepare for a
cancellation of the visit.
It could be a crude attempt to embarrass the Japanese for insisting that
Russia must return the South Kurile islands before economic assistance is
available. Alternatively it may be a fit of pique by the security forces,
who complained the Japanese were forbidding them from bringing firearms into
the country.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S growing political corruption scandal has claimed another victim with
the suicide of Mr Sergio Moroni, a Socialist member of parliament under
investigation by magistrates in Milan.
Mr Moroni, 45, is the most senior and politically prominent of the three men
linked with the investigations who have now taken their lives. Mr Renato
Amorese, the secretary of the Socialist party in Lodi, near Milan, killed
himself three months ago, and Mr Mario Majocchi, deputy chairman of Italy's
builders' federation, took his life in July.
The corruption scandal yesterday also saw the arrest of another prominent
businessman, Mr Paolo Rinaldi, chief executive of the recently privatised
Cementir cement group. He was formerly managing director of the Caltagirone
group's construction arm.
The investigations took a new turn this week with the appearance of
prominent industrialists before magistrates in Milan. On Tuesday, lawyers
for Mr Giuseppe Garofano, deputy chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, one of
Italy's biggest private-sector groups, said he had paid L200m-L300m (Pounds
94,000-Pounds 140,000) to the Christian Democrat party in Lombardy in 1990.
They said the payments were a personal gift, rather than an undeclared, and
therefore illegal, contribution by the Ferruzzi-Montedison group to the
party.
Swiss police last week arrested Mr Raffaele Politano, long-serving private
secretary of Mr Paolo Pillitteri, the former Socialist mayor of Milan. Mr
Politano had been sought by police in Milan for two months on charges
relating to the corruption investigation.

FT  04 SEP 92 / OECD Economic Report: Greece urged to tighten up on its
structural reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE must apply its economic adjustment programme more rigorously if it is
to close a widening gap with the rest of the European Community, the
Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warns in
its annual report on the Greek economy.
Determination has been lacking in crucial areas of structural reform, such
as curbing tax evasion, reducing over-staffing in the public sector and
promoting competition, especially in the banking sector, the OECD says.
'The Greek government has to speed up the reform process and take firm
action especially in its own domain - fiscal consolidation and public sector
efficiency - where it has greater powers and responsibilities,' the report
says.
Greece last year launched a medium-term stabilisation programme aimed at
cutting public borrowing to under five percentage points of gross domestic
product, and trimming inflation to less than 10 per cent, enabling the
drachma to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS.
After falling behind target in 1991, largely because of unrealistically high
revenue forecasts, the programme is being revamped to meet the Maastricht
targets for European monetary union.
The OECD predicts a short-term improvement in 1992-93 with inflation down to
14 per cent by the end of the year and Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
declining to 11 per cent of GDP in 1993. However, its report was prepared
before last month's launch of a revenue package expected to add 2-3 points
to the yearly inflation rate.
Growth in GDP is projected at 1.7 per cent this year, rising to 2.2 per cent
in 1993. It will be driven by a substantial rise in public investment as big
infrastructure projects get underway, with support from EC structural funds.
The OECD notes that the government has taken 'courageous deregulation
measures in many fields,' abolishing price controls on a wide range of
products and services. It calls for a more effective competition policy,
including reform of 'oligopolistic practices' in banking, where high
borrowing costs and inefficient procedures act as a deterrent to growth.

THE UK chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, will try to engage his fellow EC
finance ministers in matters other than the French referendum on Maastricht
and turbulence on foreign exchange markets when they gather for informal
weekend discussions in Bath this evening.
Current strains in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System and the Community's increasingly lacklustre growth prospects can be
expected to play a big part in working sessions tomorrow.
But the chancellor has also placed on the agenda the EC's relations with
non-EMS countries, the trade problems of eastern and central Europe, and his
belief that finance ministers should have an expanded role in Community
decision-making.
As if to emphasise the non-Maastricht element of the talks, the ministers
and central bank governors will be joined for lunch tomorrow by Mr Jacques
Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
He is likely to criticise the limited access granted by the EC to exports
from eastern and central Europe.
However, European monetary officials are uncertain how far such issues will
grab the attention of ministers, most of whom are beginning to suffer at
first hand the effects of the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy to curb
the inflationary pressures of German unification.
The European Commission, which is revising its economic forecasts, now
expects the European economy will grow by only around 1.25 per cent this
year and next, against earlier expectations of annual growth of about 2 per
cent.
Although the ministers will refrain from overt 'German bashing' at the
meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, and Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, president of the independent Bundesbank, will be left in no
doubt as to the problems that Germany's money market interest rates of just
under 10 per cent are causing for the rest of the Community.
Mr Schlesinger in particular will be urged to reconsider German interest
rate levels in the light of lower than expected inflation in the German
federal states and growing signs of slowdown in Germany's industrial
economy.
The meeting in Bath has been widely billed as preparing contingency measures
to combat financial market turbulence in the event of a French No vote on
September 20. But officials stressed yesterday that 'it will not be a forum
for drawing up battle plans'.
Such an approach could give the unwelcome impression to financial markets
that ministers already expect the French referendum to reject the Maastricht
treaty.
Instead, the meeting is likely to have a more general discussion of market
developments and to reaffirm last Friday's statement by EC finance ministers
which stressed that the EMS defence mechanisms have already been activated,
and which ruled out a realignment of the ERM parities.

FT  04 SEP 92 / German GDP falls 0.5% in second quarter

THE slowdown in the west German economy was confirmed yesterday, with second
quarter figures for gross domestic product showing a drop of 0.5 per cent
against the previous quarter.
In comparison with the same period last year, the economy still showed a
small positive growth rate of 0.6 per cent, according to the Federal
Statistics Office, although that was also sharply lower than the 3.2 per
cent posted in the unseasonally mild first quarter of the year.
At the same time, there was a slight drop in unemployment in both halves of
Germany in August, although it amounted to less of an improvement than
normal for the time of year.
Joblessness in western Germany fell by 6,100 to 1,821,600, a constant rate
of 6 per cent. In the east, where the official unemployment level is
suppressed by subsidised job creation schemes, short-time working, early
retirement and retraining programmes, the number out of work fell by 19,500
to 1,168,700, down from 14.6 to 14.4 per cent.
In the hothouse atmosphere of the German economic debate, the figures were
immediately subjected to conflicting interpretations.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, emerged from his
fortnightly board meeting to insist that they showed 'we are neither in a
recession, nor can one speak of recessionary tendencies in western Germany'.
He admitted, however, that there were some elements of weakness in the west
German economy, particularly in exports and in domestic demand for
industrial equipment.
The Bundesbank made no move to alter its key interest rates to signal any
relaxation in its tough monetary restraint. Mr Schlesinger said the discount
rate increase agreed in July (from 8 to 8.75 per cent) had done what it been
supposed to do: namely, increase domestic bank lending rates, but barely
affect money-market and capital market rates.
He rejected international pressure for some relaxation, saying there was no
room yet to relax the interest rates, nor any reason to raise them.
However, the Bundesbank stance was sharply criticised by the DGB union
federation, which called for a relaxation of interest rate policy to help
the fight against unemployment. It accused the bank of risking a recession
in order to force inflation below 3 per cent.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, also insisted that Germany was not
facing an outright recession, while admitting that 'the risks for a
continuation of the economic expansion have clearly grown.
Although there were no recent figures for the east German economy, there was
still no sign of a lasting improvement there: the collapse of trade with
east Europe, and a drop in domestic demand, had both hit recovery prospects.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Russia learns the painful dictum of cash on delivery: An
issue 'at the centre of the reforms'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIKTOR Ratnikov, director of Moscow's Babayev chocolate factory, says
life has improved greatly since July 1, when Russian enterprises were
ordered to deliver goods only if customers paid for them.
It is a principle accepted readily enough in the west. But for Russian
market reformers, the issue of the day remains billions of roubles in unpaid
bills accumulated by thousands of factories around Russia.
They came about when state-owned enterprises, which account for 90 per cent
of economic output, continued to trade with each other after prices were
liberalised in January, even when they did not have enough money to pay for
goods.
The government's expectations that managers would behave rationally and cut
costs and prices proved unfounded. Other problems were a slow banking
system, a cut in funding for ministries which had ordered goods in advance,
and the absence of a tried and tested mechanism for declaring enterprises
bankrupt.
The arrears reached Rbs3trillion (thousand billion) by the end of June,
accounting for more than half the country's industrial production of
Rbs5trillion for the first half of the year. By the end of July, they were
back down to Rbs1.19trillion. The amount fell as enterprises demanded
payment, as mutual debts were cancelled out and as some enterprises received
fresh injections of working capital from the government.
'This issue is at the centre of reforms,' says Mr Alexander Mozhin, a senior
Russian official who handles relations with the International Monetary Fund,
which has set budget and inflation targets to achieve financial
stabilisation. 'Either you give enterprises extra credit with the dangers of
deteriorating into hyperinflation . . . or you accelerate reforms which
increase unemployment.'
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who believes it is his job
to support production in the absence of western-style capital markets, has
already made his choice. He caused a storm of protest among more radical
reformers in the government when he issued an order to finance net arrears
remaining after the authorities worked out which inter-enterprise debts
cancelled each other out.
Under pressure from the government, Mr Gerashchenko revoked the order, which
according to one of his deputies, Mr Sergei Ignatiev, would have cost
anywhere between Rbs500bn and Rbs1.5trillion in new credit. But at least Mr
Gerashchenko put at the top of the agenda a problem which had been allowed
to fester before his appointment in July.
The key challenge now is to teach enterprises a lasting lesson which will
make them change their behaviour in future. The government's critics warn of
social instability and a loss of Russia's industrial base if large-scale
unemployment is allowed. The radicals in the government argue that there can
be no growth without financial health.
'One of the dangers in trying to clean up arrears is that you fail to create
disincentives for the accumulation in arrears in future,' Mr Richard Erb,
the IMF's deputy director, cautioned in Moscow last week. 'Progress in
implementing bankruptcy procedures will be important to make clear to
enterprises that they are responsible for the credit standing of enterprises
they are dealing with.'
At a meeting of regional governors, two senior ministers publicly disagreed
over the issue. In one corner was Mr Anatoly Chubais, the radical deputy
prime minister responsible for privatisation, who said that the net arrears
were to be the exclusive preserve of a debt managing agency. Such an agency,
the solution favoured by the IMF, would reimburse net creditors by selling
off the debts or property of the net debtors, dove-tailing neatly with plans
to begin privatisation of large and medium-size enterprises.
In the other corner stood Mr Vasily Barchuk, the finance minister, who wants
to clear up the problem as quickly as possible because indebted enterprises
do not pay taxes and worsen the budget deficit. He said the agency would
take far too long to start up and he advocated a one-off indexation of
enterprises' working capital to bring it back in line with rapidly rising
prices.
He was overheard saying later that he needed 'one trillion (roubles)' for
his project, compared with the Rbs300bn which the government has told the
IMF it needs to spend on indexation of working capital in the second half of
this year. The enterprises see indexation as necessary because the cash they
had to operate became almost worthless after the explosion of prices in
January. But the problem is that it is difficult to make sure enterprises
will not use the money to raise wages or to keep producing large inventories
of unsaleable goods.
Stressing his commitment to an anti-inflationary policy, Mr Yegor Gaidar,
the acting prime minister, denied any fundamental differences in approach
within the government.
The solution, which is already emerging, is turning out to be a messy
compromise. While Mr Chubais pursues the agency idea, perhaps making some
headway in rationalising and privatising enterprises, the central bank will
continue to provide new money over and above budget revenues, with as yet
unmeasurable consequences for a supposedly strict monetary policy.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Council tax values too high says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIGURES released yesterday by the Labour-controlled Association of London
Authorities reveal that the government has over-estimated property values
for the new council tax - some by a wide margin.
The lower than expected valuations mean that the tax rates for each band
will be higher than the government's original estimates if the council tax
is to raise the planned total when it replaces the poll tax next April.
However, while this will mean higher bills for some, others will gain by
finding themselves in a lower tax band than expected.
The figures are the first to include valuations for every local authority in
England. They show that values have been under-estimated in some inner-city
areas. In Liverpool, for example, the tax base will be 15 per cent below the
1991 estimate; in the London borough of Hackney, it will be 22 per cent
below.
Mr Mike Williams, deputy city treasurer of Birmingham City Council, said the
valuations had put more properties in the lower bands than had been
expected. He said: 'The numbers in Band A (the lowest category) are
particularly high at over 40 per cent . . . I think the DoE is in real
trouble over this.'
The figures were released two days after the Department of the Environment
sent the draft council tax valuations to local authorities, requesting that
they should not go on general release. Ministers have consistently refused
to publish the data, or comment on reports based on results sent to some
councils.
The history of the poll tax has made ministers and civil servants wary about
publishing projections. One of the reasons for the tax's unpopularity was
that when the bills came in they were much higher than estimates.
Band rates may rise, Page 7

FT  04 SEP 92 / Mitterrand warns on Maastricht rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night raised the French referendum
campaign on Maastricht to a new pitch, warning in a three-hour television
debate that rejection of the treaty would be a 'serious setback' for France
and Europe.
Mr Mitterrand, whose approval rating has been in steady decline, refused to
make any link between the outcome of the September 20 vote and his own
political future.
In his first TV debate for four years, Mr Mitterrand sought to explain and
defend the treaty on political and economic union. As well as fending off
spirited and often hostile questioning from selected private citizens, he
crossed swords in a surprisingly courteous duel with Mr Philippe Seguin,
Gaullist standard bearer of the No campaign.
With opinion polls indicating a close result, the impact of the debate on
the referendum is hard to predict, given that neither Mr Mitterrand nor his
antagonist made any serious blunder.
The see-saw nature of the referendum campaign was highlighted by publication
of a poll conducted earlier this week for Societe Generale, the French bank,
showing 52 per cent of the electorate planned to vote No. This poll
contradicted five others published this week, all indicating a narrow Yes
majority. The TV marathon was marked by an intervention from German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who told French viewers that fears of losing their
identity in the EC were misplaced. He saw no reason for any French
'inferiority complex'.
Mr Mitterrand said the Germans were 'making a big sacrifice' in agreeing to
monetary union. 'Their pride is the D-Mark,' he said.
In his case for a No vote, Mr Seguin strongly criticised Mr Mitterrand for
committing France to a single monetary policy over which it would have
little control and for pushing France towards the goal of a federal Europe.
Mr Seguin stressed that Britain had won the right to opt out of monetary
union, but France had not.
Mr Mitterrand claimed Maastricht was necessary for the European Community to
protect itself. While barriers were coming down between EC states, the
Community still lacked common policies to assure its internal and external
security.
He acknowledged that a referendum defeat would pose severe problems for him.
But 'worn' though he and his unpopular Socialist government were, he denied
he was such a liability that he should step down to win approval for
Maastricht.
Mr Seguin called for renegotiation of Maastricht to introduce more democracy
into EC decision-making, a bigger say for national parliaments, a new common
currency in parallel to national currencies, and a greater opening to east
Europe.
A Yes vote in the French referendum is a clear favourite with the
bookmakers. Ladbrokes is quoting 1-2 (bet Pounds 2 to win Pounds 1) for a
majority in favour, with a No vote offered at 11-8.

FT  04 SEP 92 / Thatcher attacks Major's stance on EC union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced fresh criticism from Lady Thatcher over
Britain's economy and its approach to Europe as he prepared to underline his
personal commitment to the Maastricht treaty on European union.
In another thinly veiled attack on her successor, the former prime minister
said Mr Major's determination to hold sterling's value against the D-Mark in
the European exchange rate mechanism was prolonging the British recession.
In a phrase recalling her battles over exchange rate policy with her former
chancellor Mr Nigel Lawson (now Lord Lawson), she added: 'If by artificially
controlling the exchange rates between countries you try to buck the market,
you will soon find the market bucks you - and hard.'
Her remarks - delivered in a speech in South Korea - came as the Foreign
Office signalled that Mr Major would reaffirm his strong support for
Maastricht in an important speech on Monday when he opens the flagship
conference of Britain's EC presidency.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe,
said Mr Major remained convinced that Maastricht was 'good for Britain and
good for Europe'.
Mr Major plans to devote most of his speech to setting out his vision of a
wider, liberal and outward-looking Europe, but Mr Garel-Jones said the prime
minister would 'undoubtedly re-emphasise' his firm commitment to Maastricht.
Speaking at the launch of the conference, Mr Garel-Jones said the UK
expected the French electorate to vote Yes in the September 20 referendum.
'I do not anticipate the collapse of the Maastricht treaty. I do not
anticipate anything but a Yes vote.'
But he acknowledged also that in its role as EC president, the UK was
drawing up contingency plans in the event of the treaty's rejection by
France.
Among the starting points were the commitment to maintain sterling within
the ERM, and an assumption that the intergovernmental co-operation on
foreign and defence policies enshrined in Maastricht would proceed without a
formal treaty.
Whitehall officials said the plans included an emergency meeting of EC
foreign ministers in New York on the day after the referendum. The
ministers, who will be attending the United Nations general assembly, could
then decide to call for an emergency summit of EC leaders.
Lady Thatcher's intervention provided a further reminder to Mr Major that,
whatever the French result, his party's Euro-sceptics plan a concentrated
campaign to prevent ratification of the treaty by the British parliament.
In a speech which also included a number of transparent sideswipes against
rising public spending and borrowing by Mr Major's government, Lady Thatcher
drew parallels with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and warned
that attempts to create artificial federations fuelled nationalism and
risked conflict.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UK will borrow D-Marks to aid Pounds: Sterling up 1 1/4
pfennigs - FT-SE gains 68 points / Pressure on interest rates eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, JAMES BLITZ and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government acted decisively to support sterling yesterday with an
innovative plan to borrow D-Marks that immediately eased pressure for an
increase in UK interest rates.
The announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the government
would borrow Pounds 7.27bn of D-Marks and other currencies and sell these
for sterling lifted the pound by 1 1/4 pfennigs.
It closed at DM2.80 in London - its highest close against the D-Mark since
the dollar began its plunge to record lows nearly a fortnight ago. In New
York it edged further ahead to DM2.803, while in early Far East trading
today it was quoted at DM2.8065.
The decision also gave UK equities their biggest one-day gain since the
Conservative election victory in April. The FT-SE 100 index gained 68.9 to
2,381.9.
The plans to borrow the equivalent of Ecu10bn in foreign currencies and the
unprecedented commitment to convert the proceeds into pounds ensure strong
demand for the pound in the weeks ahead.
The plans were quickly interpreted by the foreign exchange market as
tangible proof that the UK government was determined not to devalue the
pound from its DM2.95 parity in the ERM.
That message was hammered home by Mr Lamont: 'These arrangements demonstrate
once again the government's clear determination and ability to maintain
sterling's position in the ERM at the existing central rate, regardless of
the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty,' he said.
The dollar also rose yesterday, gaining some 2 pfennigs in London to
DM1.4115 and improving further in New York to DM1.4155. In Tokyo this
morning it opened at DM1.41625. Interest rates and yields fell on the
sterling money and gilt-edged markets, raising hopes that the government
will be able to avoid an increase in bank base rates from 10 per cent, even
if the French vote against the Maastricht treaty on September 20.
The borrowing plan - which consists of a three-year multi- currency
revolving credit facility with a group of international banks and a
longer-term multi-currency note issue programme - begins almost immediately.
The Treasury said the government would borrow half the Ecu10bn in D-Marks
this month. It will borrow some DM5bn from the banks 'over the next few
days' and convert the proceeds into sterling. Further borrowings of about
DM5bn will follow later this month.
The UK government has won attractive terms from the banks with an interest
rate on the three-year loan of only  3/32 point over the London interbank
offered rate.
On sterling money markets, the three-month interbank rate, which often acts
as a guide to future base rate movements, closed down  1/4 per cent at about
10 5/16 per cent. Prices of UK gilt-edged stock advanced strongly by 2
points.
Officials were also keen to release the news ahead of this weekend's
informal meeting of European Community finance ministers in Bath, which had
been widely expected to discuss contingency plans in case of a French No
vote.
Yesterday began on a more optimistic note after a sharp rise in Japanese
equities lifted the Nikkei average by 798.77 or 4.54 per cent to 18,386.49.
The upward trend continued this morning, with the Nikkei up another 135
points in early trading.
In France, where Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said long-term
interest rates may come down in the event of a Yes vote in the referendum,
shares advanced by 4 per cent.
The day brought no further increase in German borrowing costs. The
Bundesbank left its leading interest rates unchanged.
Yesterday's UK action was discussed in advance with the German central bank,
although it was not contingent on the outcome of yesterday's discussions of
its decision-making central council.

<TEXT>
THE PAN AM Building, the 59-storey skyscraper which sits on top of New
York's Grand Central station and has been an integral Manhattan landmark for
nearly 30 years, is no more.
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which owns the building, said yesterday
it would remove the now-defunct airline's name - currently displayed in
15-foot lights - and replace it with 'MetLife'.
The insurer said that the letters would be replaced over the 'next few
months'.
'Since Pan Am is no longer a tenant in the building and virtually out of
business, it makes sense to replace the sign with a familiar name that
symbolises strength, stability and long-term commitment to New York City',
Mr Robert Schwartz, MetLife's chairman, said in a statement.
Rumours that the insurance company, second largest in the US, was thinking
of removing the Pan Am name have circulated for some time. Earlier this
year, MetLife advertised for rental space in the building. Photographs
accompanying the ads had the Pan Am name airbrushed out.
That prompted some lobbying to persuade MetLife to keep the Pan Am letters -
originally demanded at 30 feet by the airline's founder, Juan Trippe, when
Pan Am moved into the building designed by Walter Gropius.
But MetLife claimed yesterday that letters were running five to one in
favour of the change, with families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing
 -causing a Pan Am 747 to crash - anxious to see the old name disappear.

FT  04 SEP 92 / UN seals treaty to outlaw chemical weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The United Nations-sponsored Conference on Disarmament agreed yesterday to
send a treaty banning chemical weapons to the United Nations for approval,
despite a last-minute Iranian move which threatened to block it, Reuter
reports from Geneva.
The decision ended 24 years of negotiations on the pact, which will be the
first to ban the use, possession and manufacture of chemical arms.
Negotiations on the pact, replacing the 1925 Geneva Protocol which banned
simply the use of chemical weapons, began in 1968 but were deadlocked by
Cold War rivalries.
The talks gained momentum after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev achieved power in
Moscow even though the old Soviet Union did not admit until 1987 that it had
any chemical weapons.
But even after the long negotiations the 190-page draft text which will go
before the UN General Assembly later this year only just scraped through the
39-nation conference.
Iran, terming itself the last victim of chemical attacks during its 1980-88
war with Iraq, said yesterday that it would veto the adoption of the treaty
because of the composition of the body that will police it.
Iran held separate negotiations with other Asian members in an apparent
attempt to ensure that it was fully represented on the 41-member executive
council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The
organisation will be based in The Hague.
The Asian nations, which will have nine seats on the council, decided to
continue negotiations among themselves on how to distribute their seats.
Other Asian members, including China and Pakistan, had earlier expressed
strong reservations about the treaty, largely because they saw its
inspection regime as too intrusive.
After almost seven hours of bickering and to an ironic round of applause,
the conference finally agreed to pass the draft treaty to the UN General
Assembly.

The Ukrainian government refused to bow to strikers' pay demands and sought

The strike was called by the Council of Free Trade Unions, once the official
trade union under communism. Strikers have closed most airports and train
stations, stranding thousands, including a delegation from the International
Monetary Fund.
Support was weaker in the mining region of eastern Ukraine.
Most politicians back government efforts to stop the wage and price rise

<TEXT>
ALCOA, the world's biggest aluminium group, has sold its 44.3 per cent
interest in Grupo Aluminio, an aluminium producer in Mexico, as part of a
strategic change of direction there.
The buyer, Grupo Carso, a diversified Mexican company, paid Dollars 50m and
Alcoa says it will show a pre-tax loss of about Dollars 3m on the
transaction.
Aluminio owns an aluminium smelter with an annual capacity of about 66,000
tonnes, which was shut temporarily earlier this year because of depressed
market conditions, and associated fabricating operations, including three
mills.
At the same time, Alcoa has bought a metals distributor, Alutudos, from
Aluminio for an undisclosed sum. Alutudos operates 15 distribution centres.
Alcoa said yesterday it was making an evaluation of its strategic options in
the country.

Profits before tax of Isotron, the Wiltshire-based irradiation service
company, amounted to Pounds 2.74m for the year to June 30, a fall of just
2.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 2.81m.
The directors said the result reflected a 'significant improvement in
performance' during the second half. They pointed out that pre-tax profits,
down by 10 per cent at mid-term, expanded 5 per cent in the second six
months.
Earnings worked through at 14.8p (15.1p) and a final dividend of 2.57p makes
a 3.94p (3.59p) total.
Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said the group ended the year with a strong
balance sheet, nil debt and cash of Pounds 3.8m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to profits in the first half to end-June was yesterday reported by
Cussins Property Group, the Newcastle-based contracting and construction
group.
Profit on ordinary activities before tax was Pounds 437,000, against a
restated loss of Pounds 271,000.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 7.22m to Pounds 8.08m
and was struck after reduced interest charges of Pounds 355,000 (Pounds
1.05m).
Mr Peter Cussins, chairman, said the core north-east housebuilding business
was performing well and the current level of reservations promised further
improvements in the second half.
Borrowings and overheads continued to be reduced, he said, while asset sales
were being achieved despite the difficult market.
Earnings per share came out at 3p (3p losses). Mr Cussins said the
restoration of the dividend was dependent upon the elimination of the
deficit on distributable reserves, which currently stood at Pounds 1.43m.
The sale of the Denmark Centre for Pounds 3.2m would eliminate Pounds
785,000 of the deficit, he added.

<TEXT>
Grafton Group, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY concern, lifted
pre-tax profits 14 per cent to IPounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.75m), in the six
months to June 30.
Mr Michael Chadwick, chairman, said the results reflected improved returns
from Irish operations and a reduced contribution from the smaller UK
operations. The milder winter helped the group during the half year.
Turnover improved to IPounds 48.7m (IPounds 45.7m) generating trading
profits of IPounds 2.55m (IPounds 2.17m). Interest charges rose to IPounds
698,000 (IPounds 553,000).
The interim dividend is stepped up to 2.75p (2.5p), payable from earnings of
8.6p (7.5p) per share.
For the full year, Mr Chadwick said the group was benefiting from the
investments and acquisitions made in 1991 and expected to record an increase
on the IPounds 3.55m pre-tax achieved last time.

CLASSIC FM, Britain's first national commercial radio station, yesterday
criticised BBC Radio 3 for moving towards its position in the marketplace.
Mr John Spearman, chief executive of the new station, to be launched on
Monday, said the recent format changes at Radio 3 seemed to be taking it
towards the position it thought Classic FM would occupy.
Mr Spearman, who said he was an avid Radio 3 listener, said: 'This reduces
consumer choice rather than expanding it. I am sorry about that.'
There was plenty of room for both Radio 3 and Classic FM in the market, he
said.
The new station, which will broadcast on a range of frequencies from 100-102
FM in different parts of the company, will open at 6am on Monday with
Handel's God Save The King.
The first advertisement - advertising sales have already exceeded Pounds
1.3m in just over two months - will be for Barclays Bank.
Classic FM, which will concentrate on melodic classical music, hopes to
attract a weekly audience of 2.8m - 70 per cent of them from the ABC1 social
groups.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PALESTINIANS last night gave their most upbeat assessment of peace talks
with Israel since the process was launched in Madrid last October.
A senior Palestinian official said that proposals for a common agenda tabled
by Israel yesterday represented a 'considerable narrowing' of the gap
between them.
Waving a copy of the Israeli document, he said: 'For the first time I feel
as if the Israelis are really negotiating. This document, which responds to
our proposals of Tuesday, represents a considerable narrowing. With some
amendments, which should not be too difficult, this can be a document we
will sign. And if we do sign, it will be a real breakthrough because this is
not just a procedural matter. There is also political substance to it.'
The senior Palestinian official said that he hoped the common agenda would
be ready for signing when negotiators returned from a 10-day recess on
September 14.
All five teams at the Middle East peace talks - Israel, the Palestinians,
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - have also agreed to extend this round of
negotiations, the sixth since Madrid, until September 24 to compensate for
days lost next week.
Most of the Israeli delegation is returning to Jerusalem today for
'intensive consultations'.
President George Bush and Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting US secretary
of state, are also lending their weight to the process.
Mr Bush had a private dinner with King Hussein of Jordan - who is recovering
from major surgery - at the White House on Tuesday evening, and Mr
Eagleburger is seeing each of the heads of delegation.
Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiating
team had worked all night on the common agenda proposals which incorporated
ideas put forward by the Palestinians and 'tried to take account of their
sensitivities'. He added: 'Every step brings us closer to a common agenda.'
The agenda includes such items as the concept for Palestinian
self-government in the occupied territories, elections, ideas for peaceful
co-existence, and confidence-building measures to be taken in conjunction
with negotiations. It was also agreed in principle yesterday to set up two
sub-committees on human rights issues and water resources.
The senior Palestinian official said he was particularly pleased Israel had
included references in its latest document to UN resolution 242, which
enshrines the principle of exchanging occupied land for peace. 'This had
already been given to the Syrians and Jordanians. Now we have it,too,' he
said.
Reuter adds from Tel Aviv: Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, told a
group of industrialists yesterday he expected agreement within a year on a
plan for Palestinian self-rule in Israeli-occupied lands.' I have said in
the past that I hope to reach agreement within nine to 12 months. With all
the difficulties, I still believe it.'

Tajik radio and television, which reported the vote, said government and

Mr Nabiyev was believed to be in a garrison of the former Soviet army in

His status as a popularly elected president leaves the legal consequences of
the no-confidence vote in doubt.
Meanwhile, anti-government protesters who had been holding 35 officials

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (10): Drive for greater
efficiency - look at new challenges facing companies in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL TERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by European producers of industrial and consumer goods to
rationalise manufacturing strategies and to increase competitiveness are
presenting logistics and distribution providers with new domestic and
international challenges.
British Steel is aware of the stiff competition it faces in its planned
assault on European mainland markets. Physical distribution is an important
plank in its campaign and the costs and efficiency of the service will help
determine the success or failure of the venture.
The company is engaged in a far-reaching review of its transportation and
delivery operations. High on the agenda for discussion is the setting up of
regional distribution centres closer to customers and the development of
world class information technology (IT) links between production plants,
distribution operators and customers.
Meanwhile, the company spends some Pounds 375m a year on shipping products
to mainland Europe and tends to deal direct with transport operators and
suppliers rather than go through forwarding agents.
Its sales in Europe represent about 2.5 per cent of the total European
market and the objective is to achieve significant increases.
Its main European destinations are Italy, Germany and Spain, followed by
France, Greece and the Netherlands. Short sea vessels under 4,000 tonnes dwt
are the main mode British Steel uses to ship products to the mainland, some
64 per cent of the total. Last year the vessels carried 1.8m tonnes.
The use of sea vessels able to negotiate river and canal systems allows
British Steel to deliver direct to Duisburg, Paris, Lyons and Bonn without
the need for transhipment and double handling.
Mr Patrick Doolan, British Steel director for supplies and transport, a
confirmed ship user, concedes the mode faces strong competition from rail.
It depends on whether investment occurs in rolling stock and systems on the
same scale as for ships.
At present 11 per cent of British Steel's European deliveries are by rail
and 4 per cent by combined transport. All British Steel's main works are
rail connected as are most of its large customers. It uses Railfreight
Distribution's (RfD) conventional wagon train ferry service to France, and,
to a limited degree, United Transport's (UT) lift-on/lift-off intermodal
units which sail between Hull and Tilbury and Rotterdam on UT ships.
Mr Doolan is unhappy with uncompetitive railway rates, the critical shortage
of rail wagons and British Rail's inability to come up with a design for a
single wagon to carry the 24 metre beams which British Steel wants to market
to the continental construction industry.
He has a limited degree of interest in the Channel Tunnel, arguing that much
of its business is not sufficiently time-sensitive to warrant it.
Twenty-one per cent of British Steel's deliveries to Europe go by road. P &amp;
O Ferrymasters is British Steel's main supplier of roll-on/roll-off trailers
services to the continent. Hauliers have to meet stiff equipment
specifications - coil-carrying trailers must have air suspension,
rubber-lined wells and a protective tarpaulin covering.
Mr Doolan recognises the importance of a partnership between British Steel
and its suppliers but insists on maintaining competition between contractors
by sharing cargo between different routes.
TNT Contract Logistics is developing a special trailer to make its
distribution of car parts to General Motors' assembly plant at Uusikaupunki,
Finland, more cost-effective.
Using a combination of covered trailers and rail, TNT delivers 400 tonnes of
parts a day from Frankfurt. For the back load only 40 per cent of space is
filled with returning empty packaging. TNT has to turn to the open market to
fill the rest.
The new trailer has been designed with an hydraulic scissor platform which
allows TNT to convert it into a double-deck transporter that can be used on
the return journey to carry finished cars.
German forwarder Kuhne &amp; Nagel (K &amp; N) first became involved in distribution
25 years ago when its client, Tschi Bo, asked it to organise the
distribution of coffee beans whose import it had arranged.
Now K &amp; N organises the roasting of the beans in Berlin and the delivery by
road to 5,000 specialist retail outlets throughout Germany. Today, the
company also carries out European distribution for Gillette and Phillip
Morris.
K &amp; N, an established international forwarder with 350 offices in more than
60 countries, recognised the logistics opportunities emerging in Europe and
set up a specialist logistics department in Switzerland.
It acquired companies in Holland and Italy, countries which it identified as
offering areas of opportunity.
These acquisitions, together with its 12 existing common-user warehouses in
Germany, give the company a strong base for domestic and intra-European
services, said Mr Peter Dohne, head of European logistics.
Alert to the re-emergence of rail as a significant freight transport mode, a
main board member has now been given responsibility for developing rail
services.
The company's Paris office regularly uses the SNCF high-speed
temperature-controlled rail service for perishable goods between Paris and
Marseilles.
Distribution has become a critical factor in Europe's paper industry.
Manufacturers, suffering from a decline in demand and the dumping from
overseas of cut-price products, look to logistics to reduce costs and to
increase efficiency.
It is a buyer's market where the manufacturers expect their distribution
specialists to develop supply systems that result in zero damage and avoid
customers the penalty of holding costly a inventory.
St Regis, a leading UK producer of paper for packaging, exports some 140,000
tonnes a year to Europe. Its customers in the Benelux countries and northern
France expect orders to be delivered within 24 hours.
To meet this demand the company is setting up down-the-line warehouses to
hold stock closer to the customers and thus speed up delivery reaction time.
Third party contractors will be asked to provide and manage the warehouses.
In an enterprising attempt to further develop the European market, logistics
contractor, TDG, has launched a company providing would-be exporters from
the US and the Far East with a start-up service for entering Europe
As well as providing normal distribution services, the market development
and management services offered by Prism include business planning, customs,
tax handling, sales management, marketing and credit control.
Commented John Cole, head of TDG's distribution division; 'The service helps
potential exporters avoid any heavy investment risk. It provides us with the
chance to create a partnership with a new client.'

KOICHI SUZUMURA, chairman of NYK Line (Europe), smiles and politely declines
to put a figure on how much NYK has invested in inland distribution in the
UK and Europe. One can say it is substantial, he agrees; and, yes, the rate
of investment could accelerate rapidly over the next two to three years,
always depending on demand.
NYK, a leading Japanese shipping line, is one of the most advanced of
several Japanese transport groups which have quietly been laying plans to
become leading players in the European distribution market. It now has 1,300
UK employees, most of whom are involved in inland logistics.
Nippon Express, which by contrast does not operate deep sea shipping, has so
far invested Pounds 40m in fixed assets in Europe, Pounds 9m of which is in
the UK. In 1991, rapidly growing net revenue, excluding air freight,
totalled Pounds 68.5m, of which Pounds 15.7m was in the UK.
Other Japanese companies in Europe include Mitsui, a large, diversified
trading house, and parcels companies, Yamato and Kintetsu.
These companies pose a threat to existing operators within the market. They
have a reputation for being thorough and patient; above all, they have the
'inside track' with Japanese manufacturers.
NYK plans to become a 'logistics megacarrier', offering door-to-door
services, worldwide. In the US, for example, it is now a leading railroad
operator, following the acquisition of Southern Pacific Transportation.
Europe is an important part of the global jigsaw. Growth in cargo shipments
between Asia and Europe is set to accelerate as Europe unifies and NYK is
responding by building 'comprehensive distribution capabilities'.
The initial emphasis will be on movements to, and between, points of
manufacture: 'We are not intending to develop our inland traffic to
retailers,' he says, pauses, smiles, and adds: 'As yet.'
Mr Suzumura says NYK's transport involvement in the past has started and
ended at the dockside. The move inland greatly broadens the scope of the
group's activities.
In the UK, NYK has two separate operations. New Wave Logistics, a global
logistics brand within NYK, is starting from a greenfield site (its large
warehouse in Milton Keynes has Panasonic as an important customer) with a
Japanese managing director.
New Wave runs separately, for the time being at least, from UCI Logistics,
acquired from United Carriers Group in July 1991. UCI was bought because it
has strong market knowledge and gives the company a foothold in inland
transport, with a broader customer base than purely Japanese manufacturers.
It contains several long-established road transport concerns: Robsons
Distribution, a network warehousing and haulage firm; Hudson Shepherd, a
domestic groupage operator; and Thompson Jewitt International, a leading
groupage operator between the UK and Europe.
The importance of local knowledge is stressed by Allan Binks, chairman of
UCI (and United Carriers) and until the late 1980s a senior executive within
Transport Development Group. He comments: 'Sony might be the biggest
electrical goods manufacturer in the world, but Comet and Currys will
determine the way they are delivered to their stores. When it comes to
establishing an operation and breaking into the market, it's extremely
difficult unless you have got a power base from which to build.'
NYK, and other Japanese companies, are likely to buy Continental transport
companies in future.
Nippon Express is concentrating on developing logistics business with
Japanese manufacturers at present, but says that will have changed by the
mid-1990s. Japanese companies will establish a quality reputation in
distribution, much as they have in cars and electronics. 'There will be a
demand for contract warehousing by a Japanese company,' spokesman Mark
Pester predicts.
Touche Ross consultant Ray Hoare highlights the Japanese strength in finance
and planning: 'They have a long-termism which the UK has not developed. As a
result, they may well achieve the same result in distribution as they have
in manufacturing.'
While the ambitions of overseas groups such as UPS and Federal Express of
the US, and TNT and Mayne Nickless of Australia, are much publicised, the
threat from Japan is still not fully appreciated within the transport
business, according to Jack Mather, chief executive of NFC (formerly
National Freight Consortium).
'The Japanese are the hidden force. They'll come in on the back of Japanese
manufacturers - they all trade and link together - and use them as a base.
Then they'll spread to other customers.' They will offer formidable global
systems for shipping, storage and distribution. Kuhne &amp; Nagel and Danzas
will be targets. 'Even NFC is not big enough. We have to form strategic
alliances with shipping lines.'
Mr Mather envies the way Japanese groups work together: 'They don't have
contracts, they have working relationships. I wish we Brits did it.'

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (12): Toeing the line -
Profile of Transfesa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL TERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUT FOR the foresight and persistence of the Spanish distribution group
Transfesa, Spain would find it difficult to integrate its railfreight
industry with its European partners.
Its trade with the rest of the Community, especially exports of fresh fruit,
would be suffering.
Through an accident of history Spain and its Iberian neighbour Portugal have
a rail gauge which is 23cm wider than that in France and the rest of the EC.
For years it meant long delays at the Franco-Spanish border points while
goods were unloaded from one train and re-loaded into another.
It put the shelf-life of perishable goods at risk and escalated the handling
costs of all products.
Transfesa is a specialist in railfreight transport. When it started
international operations in 1951 it recognised the need to streamline
procedures at the border.
Its engineers identified the need for a facility to quickly change the axles
on the rolling stock.
Given the Spanish government's massive support for Spain's export industry,
it is surprising how disinterested the Spanish Railways, RENFE, was in the
proposal. So was French Railways, SNCF. Neither of them thought the idea
could work.
But Transfesa pressed ahead and invested Pta6.3m (Dollars 67,000) erecting
two axle changing depots at the Franco-Spanish frontier stations at Hendaye
(opened in 1950) and Cervere (opened 1951) and providing ancillary
equipment.
The system entails lifting the wagons by crane and is very labour intensive.
The depots have an axle changing capacity of 300,000 two-axle wagons a year
and at the moment are changing axles on 140,000 wagons a year.
Last year a new patented automatic system whereby the axles are lifted and
lowered hydraulically in a pit was introduced to the Hendaye depot. With the
new system each wagon's axles can be changed in four minutes, and four
wagons can be changed at once, in eight minutes. A train of 1,000 tonnes can
change axles in 50 minutes.
International traffic passing through the depots is made up of Transfesa's
own wagons and loads being moved by RENFE and SNCF.
Goods include car parts for assembly, finished cars, fruit, cereals, bulk
paper, chemicals, powders and granulated products.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cakebread Robey losses deepen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cakebread Robey, the Middlesex-based builders merchant, has announced a drop
of 8.8 per cent in turnover to Pounds 11.39m for the first half of 1992, and
an increased pre-tax loss of Pounds 667,000. The loss for the whole of 1991
was Pounds 1.65m following a first half deficit of Pounds 191,000.
The loss was struck after redundancy costs of Pounds 56,000. There is again
no dividend.
Recession caused merchanting sales to fall by a further 7.9 per cent and bad
debts at Pounds 178,000 for the half year are already well above the
previous year's total. Manufacturing turnover fell by 14 per cent.

The net asset value of American Trust stood at 200.5p at July 31 - a decline
of some 5 per cent on the 210.3p of 12 months earlier.
The trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, saw attributable revenue for
the six months to end-July fall to Pounds 1.99m (Pounds 2.07m) for earnings
of 2.41p (2.51p) per share, a decline which partly reflected a less
favourable dollar/sterling rate.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of Michael Page Group, the recruitment agency, fell from
Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.29m for the half year ended June 30. Turnover was
virtually static at Pounds 21.3m.
Although the directors do not envisage any improvement in trading
conditions, the interim dividend is held at 0.6p, payable from earnings of
1.36p (2.13p) per share.
Operating profits of the UK executive recruitment businesses rose
marginally, primarily as a result of increased market share.
Operating profits in France and the Benelux countries fell by 40 per cent
and 45 per cent respectively following a significant downturn in employment
markets. The German subsidiary, established in July 1991, traded at
break-even.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cussins Property back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A return to profits in the first half to end-June was reported by Cussins
Property Group, the Newcastle-based contracting and construction group.
Profit on ordinary activities before tax was Pounds 437,000, against a
restated loss of Pounds 271,000.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up from Pounds 7.22m to Pounds 8.08m
and was struck after reduced interest charges of Pounds 355,000 (Pounds
1.05m).
Mr Peter Cussins, chairman, said the core north-east housebuilding business
was performing well and the current level of reservations promised further
improvements in the second half.
Borrowings and overheads continued to be reduced, he said, while asset sales
were being achieved despite the difficult market.
Earnings per share came out at 3p (3p losses). Mr Cussins said the
restoration of the dividend was dependent upon the elimination of the
deficit on distributable reserves, which currently stood at Pounds 1.43m.
The sale of the Denmark Centre for Pounds 3.2m would eliminate Pounds
785,000 of the deficit, he added.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
English &amp; Overseas Properties cut its losses from Pounds 554,000 to Pounds
438,000 pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. Turnover improved from
Pounds 575,000 to Pounds 792,000.
Profits were struck after taking account of property write-downs totalling
Pounds 659,000. Directors said they hoped to avoid the need for further
provisions at the year-end.
They pointed out, however, that as a consequence of the first-half provision
distributable reserves were not sufficient to enable payment of the interim
dividend - 0.6p was paid previously.
The company, together with its advisers, was investigating ways to
reorganise its capital and reserves to overcome this problem. It hoped to be
'able to re-address the payment of a dividend' at the year-end.
The cash position was described as 'very strong,' with balances of some
Pounds 5m.
Losses per share were cut from 9.46p to 1.88p. Exceptional provisions for
the corresponding six months accounted for Pounds 675,000.

However, overseas demand, particularly in the US and France, fell
substantially.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 3.51m). Investment income added
Pounds 75,677 (Pounds 59,165) but there were interest charges this time of
Pounds 17,408 (nil).
Earnings emerged at 9.65p (12.87p) and the interim dividend is maintained at
2.25p.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Contracting-out trend helps Serco advance
37% to Pounds 3.39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREND for both government and companies to contract out non-core
services lay behind a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at Serco Group
in the six months to June 30.
The company, which holds contracts as varied as the maintenance of Hyde
Park, Ministry of Defence radars and one in three London traffic lights,
increased profits from Pounds 2.48m to Pounds 3.39m on turnover up 40 per
cent to Pounds 65.4m (Pounds 46.8m).
The results were boosted by two months' contribution from International
Aeradio Limited, acquired in April from British Telecommunications for
Pounds 12.3m.
Mr Richard White, managing director, said IAL contributed about Pounds 6m to
turnover.
For the year as a whole the acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral
after profits of about Pounds 800,000 are absorbed by interest costs.
Excluding IAL, the underlying business expanded at about 20 per cent, the
same rate as in previous years.
'Our markets continue to be very strong,' Mr White said.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.5p (3.9p).
Fully diluted earnings of 17.1p (14.8p) maintained dividend cover at 3.8
times. About 70 per cent of turnover came from the public sector.
The company's background is in defence contracts, which now account for 40
per cent of turnover, against 48 per cent a year ago.
Serco successfully retendered for one large contract during the period,
while a further four or five contracts will be re-awarded in the second
half.
However, less than 20 per cent of next year's expected revenues are related
to contracts up for renewal.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Crown in regulatory talks on French sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRISTOPHER Chataway, chairman of Crown Communications, the USM-quoted
commercial radio group, is today expected to have crucial talks with the
CSA, the French radio authority, over the sale of its loss-making French
radio company.
Last week Mr David Haynes, chief executive, announced that the company was
close to selling the RFM network subject to CSA approval.
Crown has disclosed neither the potential buyer nor the purchase price, but
it is believed that NRJ, an independent French commercial network, is
bidding less than Pounds 5m for the 114-station network.
RFM's main asset is a radio masthead, valued at Pounds 12m in the September
1991 accounts. Price Waterhouse, the auditor, qualified the accounts because
it could not say whether the value was fairly stated.
There is doubt whether the CSA will approve an early sale to NRJ. A previous
sale proposal was rejected.
New legislation on French radio ownership is also planned and it is not
clear whether the CSA would do anything that could lead to an increased
concentration of ownership before the new legislation has been passed,
probably next year.
To add to the complexity, renewal of RFM's Paris licence, which accounts for
75 per cent of group revenue, is up for ratification in the next seven days.
Renewal was agreed in principle several months ago.
A sale of RFM and a reduction of Crown's losses is seen as vital for the
financial health of the company.
For the year to September 1991, RFM accounted for nearly half Crown's
pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.79m.
Last week Mr Haynes said that LBC, Crown's London commercial radio station,
would soon move into a small surplus.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Psion shares tumble as advance to Pounds 1m
fails to impress City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENCOURAGING sales of its new series 3 electronic organiser helped Psion lift
profits from Pounds 270,000 to Pounds 1.05m pre-tax for the half year ended
June 30.
However, the market had been hoping for Pounds 1.2m and expressed its
disappointment with the USM-quoted portable computer manufacturer by
knocking its share price down 21p to 93p.
The City was also disappointed with a 43 per cent improvement in first half
sales to Pounds 16.5m - Pounds 18m had been expected.
Earnings per share rose to 3.16p (0.08p) and the interim dividend is held at
1p.
Mr David Potter, chairman, blamed the lower-than-expected profits on the
recession which is still depressing UK sales - especially among corporate
customers.
As a consequence, the HC range of portable data capture devices failed to
live up to best expectations. Pre-tax profits were only 6.5 per cent of
sales while 10 per cent had been anticipated.
However, Mr Potter announced two potentially significant deals.
The group is to supply Motorola of the US, the world leader in radio
telephone systems, with HC computers fitted with integral radio modems. The
devices will be able to transmit data over public data networks enabling,
for example, sales executives to maintain contact with headquarters while
travelling.
It will also supply Acorn, the UK leader in schools computers, with the
series 3, modified for use by secondary school students.
Mr Potter thought the contracts would result in sales of only a few thousand
machines to begin with, but that the potential for portable data
communications devices was large. Analysts are predicting full year sales of
Pounds 35m with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.5m.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Own-label boost for Invergordon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING DEMAND for supermarkets' own-label Scotch whisky helped Invergordon
Distillers Group lift interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds
14.6m.
Volume sales to retailers such as Tesco and Safeway rose 12 per cent as the
whisky market polarised between premium brands and value-for-money products.
Mid-priced standard brands were squeezed as sales of Scotch through pubs and
clubs continued to decline, said Mr Chris Greig, managing director.
Operating profit for the six months to June 30 increased from Pounds 15.5m
to Pounds 16.1m on turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 40.1m (Pounds 39.6m).
Volume sales of whisky rose 9 per cent. In the UK, volumes increased 6 per
cent against a similar market decline. Exports rose 14 per cent compared
with the industry's overall gain of 6 per cent.
Mr Greig dismissed fears of industry over-production. Total output during
the first half of the year was some 11 per cent lower than in the
corresponding period in 1990, and 7.3 per cent below last year's comparable
figure.
Output from the grain distillery had been maintained at last year's level
but its four malt distilleries were operating at just under 60 per cent of
capacity compared with 65 per cent last year.
'This year the industry is producing substantially less than it is selling,'
Mr Greig said. 'There is no doubt that any surplus stock will be quickly
used.'
White spirit products - boosted by the new joint venture distillery at
Greenwich - rose 68 per cent. Invergordon, which supplies gin and vodka
manufacturers, intends to introduce its own branded gin next year.
Earnings per share rose from 6.8p to 7.7p. The interim dividend is lifted to
2.8p (2.5p).
Invergordon, which last year fought off a Pounds 350m bid from Whyte &amp;
Mackay, refused to comment on the prospect of the bidder, which retains a 41
per cent stake, returning in two months' time.
Mr Greig said: 'The best way to see off any predator is to perform.' Apart
from its trading results, he pointed out, it had cut net borrowings from
Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 25.7m and reduced gearing from 85 per cent to 49 per
cent in the past 12 months.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (9): Operators keep their
cool - Safety scare leads to tighter laws on temperature controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of food safety scares in 1988 and resulting UK government
legislation have had a marked impact on temperature-controlled distribution
activities over the last couple of years.
On the technological side, for example, distribution service operators have
invested heavily in sophisticated new temperature-monitoring systems for
their vehicles. They have also stepped up staff training to try and ensure
higher standards of operational management control.
In a separate development, the movement of fresh produce, in particular, has
become an increasingly pan-European affair. And with creation of the
European Community Single Market now imminent, that trend is expected to
become even more pronounced.
The overall result is that the distribution of chilled and other
temperature-sensitive products - often referred to by the industry as the
'cool chain' - has become an increasingly specialised business.
Current patterns of temperature-controlled distribution activity began to
emerge during the mid-1980s as leading retailers led the way towards
consolidated operations.
Previously, retail outlets had tended to take deliveries from individual
manufacturers, so-called van sales. 'A better cool chain arrived almost by
default as improving technology was incorporated into these consolidation
centres,' comments Mr Mike Burbage, managing director of Wincanton
Distribution.
'Also, the type of refrigerated vehicles required for larger consolidated
drops were of a better type than those which were used previously for van
sales. Numerous other benefits emerged, too, particularly improved
information technology systems which enabled shorter lead times, less
inventory, better sales forecasting and so on.'
Concurrent with those changes, some of the manufacturers who had
traditionally tended to control their own temperature-controlled
distribution operations began to contract out such activities to specialist
service providers. However, while cool chain standards had in many cases
already reached high levels of safety and sophistication by the late 1980s,
the food safety scares of 1988 undoubtedly gave that development a further
boost.
One of the main thrusts of recent UK government legislation on food safety
as far as distribution activities are concerned has centred on establishing
a series of new temperature control limits for goods in transit. In April
this year, for example, it became necessary to ensure that
temperature-controlled foods carried in small vehicles (7.5 tonnes or below)
are kept at or below 8 degrees C.
The same stipulation for food carried on larger vehicles was established as
law in April last year. As a third stage in that legislation, April 1 next
year will see the introduction of regulations requiring certain foods to be
kept at or below 5 degrees C, except in small delivery vehicles.
Generally, the UK's new food safety legislation has been welcomed by the
leading distribution service operators in that sector. They say the biggest
impact is being felt at what is generally accepted as the weakest link in
the supply chain - the point of interface with the supplier or manufacturer
where each individual driver is responsible for accepting products into that
chain.
In that context, Mr Bruce Giles, a regional director with Christian Salvesen
Distribution, emphasises the importance of proper driver training. 'The
regulations mean that the industry needs to make certain that all drivers
are equally well trained and equipped to accept responsibility for this
crucial decision and for any others that may need to be taken by them
throughout the rest of the supply chain,' he adds.
In addition to better training of drivers and other staff, companies
operating vehicles in the temperature-controlled distribution sector have
also invested in new equipment. One particularly prominent development in
that context has involved the widespread installation of more sophisticated
temperature-monitoring systems on distribution fleet vehicles.
Mr Ian Veitch, business development director of Exel Logistics Temperature
Controlled Services, says there is a growing emphasis on computer-controlled
systems which will record temperatures throughout a delivery run. 'Some
retailers are now saying we should be able to present a complete temperature
history of their products,' he adds.
Wincanton Distribution has also introduced movable curtains in certain
vehicles to segregate chilled products from empty cages which, it says, can
carry a lot of latent heat. Other moves by Wincanton include the
introduction of dual evaporator fridges and under-slung fridges which reduce
noise and operate at lower CFC levels.
Recent years have seen considerable fluctuations in specification demands of
chilled distribution vehicles. In the early days of consolidated or
composite deliveries, for example, vehicles were often divided into two or
three compartments, each operating at different temperatures.
Then, as retail outlets increased in size and drop sizes grew larger, so
demand increased for vehicles to make full load deliveries of one particular
range of products. Now, says Mr David Howes, managing director of Christian
Salvesen Distribution, there are signs of a renewed demand for
two-temperature vehicles. 'There are two conflicting trends at work. On the
one hand, you have the large out-of-town retail stores taking more full
loads of chilled or ambient goods. But at the same time, the major retailers
are opening up smaller outlets in smaller towns which is once again
increasing the demand for composite deliveries.'
Another trend in the field of temperature-controlled distribution involves a
growing demand from users for added value services. Included in that
category, are tray washing, waste management, recycling of packaging
materials, bar coding of imported fresh produce, and the in-store
maintenance of freezer/chilled cabinets.
Demand is also growing for pan-European distribution operations. That trend,
says Mr Veitch of Exel Logistics TCS, is particularly evident in the fresh
produce sector. 'Manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly looking at the
economies of scale benefits to be gained from supplying customers from one
European point,' he adds.
Further evidence of that trend comes from European transport company P &amp; O
Ferrymasters which recently took delivery of 20 x 13.6-metre tri-axle
refrigerated trailers to support the development of specialised operations
which include twice-daily shipments of temperature-controlled products
between the UK and Holland.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (8): Accent on quality
controls - Operators are now seeking qualification for standard approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING demand from manufacturers and retailers for all suppliers to
achieve recognised quality standards is now clearly reflected in the
distribution services sector.
Contract logistics organisations, road hauliers, freight forwarders, express
delivery companies and other distribution service providers are all seeking
qualification for British Standards BS 5750, the International Standard ISO
9000 or the European Standard EN 29000.
But while few if any distribution companies of significant size are now
prepared to opt out of chasing such formal recognition, debate continues
over the real merits of achieving and maintaining BS 5750 or similar
standards.
'In a service industry like transport and distribution, the meaning and
value of a concept like 'service quality' is still, to a large extent, in
the process of being defined and there are strongly opposing views on the
value of BS 5750,' acknowledges Mr Len Davis, personnel director of BS
5750-accredited third party contract distribution company Applied
Distribution Limited (ADL).
'At the one extreme, you have people who will insist that every one of their
suppliers must have approval. At the other extreme there are those who
dismiss it as irrelevant.'
Another BS 5750-qualified company, TNT Contract Distribution, agrees some
operators are questioning whether the level of investment in manpower and
money needed to maintain BS 5750 accreditation is justified in terms of
business growth.
'But we believe the cost can be justified by the continuing improvements in
the quality and consistency of service provided and the significant volumes
of new business won,' adds a TNT spokesman.
Mr Philip Honor, managing director of Transport Development Group logistics
company Williams Distribution, which also recently gained BS 5750
accreditation, emphasises that there are internal as well as external
benefits to be gained.
'We have found the process extremely useful. Whether or not it results in a
direct increase in our customer base remains to be seen,' he adds. On the
international distribution side, Mr Gerry Burgin, managing director of
freight forwarder Trans Global Air, the first UK top 10 forwarder to gain BS
5750 accreditation, is even more emphatic about the merits of such
recognition.
'This is without question the way forward in our industry. BS 5750 is a
guarantee of quality and excellence in service delivery which more and more
importing and exporting businesses require from their freight distribution
partners.'
Adding weight to that argument, Mr Duncan McWilliam, group quality and
customer service manager for TNT Express Worldwide, says there are now more
than 7,000 companies in Continental Europe approved to BS 5750/ISO 9000
standards and some 13,000 in the UK 'and they are demanding that their
suppliers be quality approved'. Pointing out that various parts of the TNT
Express international and UK domestic organisation are already accredited
with BS 5750, he says benefits include the fact that 'it requires the
development of an infrastructure within an organisation that is able to take
corrective action when things go wrong so that the mistake or problem is not
repeated'.
Some companies use specialist outside consultants to help them qualify for
quality standards recognition while others have undertaken the work
in-house.
The former LEP Group UK contract distribution company Swift Transport
Services, for example, chose the latter course. Swift, which was sold by LEP
earlier this year to a holding company led by its senior management,
recruited a full-time team from within the company. That was followed by a
thorough audit of existing operational systems to identify the best methods,
and a survey into the attitudes and motivation of employees towards quality
improvement.
Initial demand for distribution service companies to achieve BS 5750 or
similar accreditation came mainly from manufacturing companies, particularly
multinationals in the higher technology sectors. Their interest stemmed from
a growing awareness that having implemented sophisticated manufacturing
controls, the majority of remaining quality issues were arising after the
end of the production line - for example, delays in the arrival of goods or
variability in delivery.
Manufacturers' efforts to establish product quality have generally focused
on monitoring production processes through systems such as Statistical
Process Control (SPC). If that control is established, runs the theory, then
there is no need to worry about measuring the output because it will be
exactly as required.
Increasingly, the same thinking is being applied in the area of distribution
and logistics, says Mr Martin Christopher, professor of marketing and
logistics at the Cranfield School of Management.
'If you have got your logistics system under control, in other words you are
monitoring and managing the key points along the way, then the output, which
is customer service if you like, will meet the customer service levels you
want to achieve.'
In the past, says Mr Christopher, people used to think of 100 per cent
delivery reliability as impossible. But, he points out, 100 per cent is
achieved all the time in some areas of activity. If it was not, how many
days a year would people be without electricity, how many days a year would
the tap water be undrinkable?
Other logistics industry experts point out that if a manufacturer wants to
be a single source supplier to a leading automotive industry company, for
example, it is taken for granted that it will meet the product
specifications or he would not even have been invited to tender. But the
only thing which is going to keep that company there as a preferred single
source supplier is the fact it delivers the quantity and quality required,
on time, to the point of use on the production line.
However, those same sources also point out that gaining BS 5750 or similar
accreditation does not ensure a distribution company will meet all its
customers' needs. Rather, say supporters of the concept, such standards are
likely in future to be seen as simply a starting point, a basic criteria
they will have to subscribe to. 'Simply having a BS 5750 certificate on the
wall does not create a quality company. The only guarantee it makes is that
the company concerned has the systems and procedures required to deliver the
agreed service,' says ADL's Mr Davis.
'Cost-effectiveness, for example, is considered by most customers to be an
essential part of service quality. However, BS 5750 has nothing to say about
the value-for-money of service provided by an approved company - that
judgment is left entirely to the customer.'
A similar point is made by a leading international distribution industry
executive, Mr John Boyce, chairman of the British Shippers' Council air
transport committee. He is a 'reasonable supporter' of quality assurance
standards.
'But I have to say that achieving such standards will not in itself improve
service quality for the shipper. You may get people achieving 100 per cent
compliance with the prescribed standard but if that standard is not what the
shipper wants, what is the point?'

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (7): More jam tomorrow on
roads - Environmental pressures are increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACK SEMPLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE transport and distribution industry is finding itself under increasing
pressure from environmental influences, which raise many issues but provide
few solutions.
Road congestion, which is already regarded by many as a barrier to the UK's
economic growth, can only get worse. Transport bosses complain that
motorways are starting to become congested at night, as well as during the
day.
'The congestion issue will hit the transport industry quite seriously over
the next few years,' according to Dr Mike Monaghan, director of environment
for P &amp; O. The group, which operates barges on the Rhine, is looking
seriously at an increase in rail freight and coastal shipping to bypass the
roads in Britain.
However, these alternatives will bring only marginal benefit: 'The nub of
the problem is the private car, not the commercial vehicle. That's where the
massive growth has been.'
Substantial new road programmes and spending on public transport are needed,
according to the Freight Transport Association; but the signs are not
encouraging. One leading transport group cites the Channel Tunnel as a
frightening example of government 'penny-pinching, bungle and lack of
clarity.
'They have a hell-bent, doctrinaire approach about not investing in public
services. As a result, Railfreight Distribution and its links to the
Channel, launched with such a fanfare three years ago, has fallen flat on
its face.'
The view is widespread. James Watson, chairman of NFC, warned recently that
the freight industry will view the tunnel as little more than 'an expensive
hole in the ground'. Transport Development Group's leading cross-Channel
operator, Beck &amp; Pollitzer, already hauls by rail to Boulogne, but says it
will go on using ferries and the roads for the UK leg of its international
operations, after the tunnel opens.
In London, the area of greatest congestion, the government offers its
low-cost Red Route scheme, 300 miles of priority routes with strictly
enforced parking bans. It promises slightly faster and more predictable
journey times for delivery vehicles. Ironically, however, even this
programme is proving to be a mixed blessing for the distribution industry,
which is already complaining of inadequate access to shops on the trial
routes.
Increasingly, transport operators are finding problems even before they go
on to the road. Rights of residents and the local authority to object lorry
operating bases were introduced in the mid-1980s, but over the past two
years have been greatly strengthened through changes of interpretation of
existing law.
Apart from dedicated industrial zones, expansion and growth has become
extremely difficult, even on some sites zoned for light industrial use. 'The
government doesn't realise the extent of the problems,' according to
Jonathan Lawton, a prominent transport lawyer. Showpiece distribution
centres seldom have environmental problems; but there are real worries for
small- to medium-sized transport operators.
The 'headline' environmental issue on lorries, however, is weights. Local
newspapers frequently carry news of accidents involving juggernauts or
protests against them and the anti-lorry sentiment this reflects has
dominated political action for more than a decade.
Gross lorry weight is equated, quite mistakenly, with size. Ironically,
since the furore over the increase in weights from 32 tonnes to 38 tonnes in
1983, increases in both the length and (in the case of refrigerated
vehicles) width of articulated lorries have gone almost unnoticed.
The controversy over lorry weights continues, however. There is strong
support within the Department of Transport for a further increase from 38 to
44 tonnes, to reduce the number of heavy trucks on the roads. Running on six
axles instead of five, these trucks would also do less damage to roads,
officials believe. A unilateral move by Britain to 44 tonnes, which is
already allowed in some EC countries, remains a possibility.
Legislators are in disarray, however, on lorry weights. The method used to
calculate the damage lorries do to roads, and also the tax levied on them,
are regarded by engineers as crude.
Technical advances in 'road friendly suspension', especially air suspension,
promise reduced road wear. But the benefits are largely unknown. 'It could
be 50 per cent or it could be 1,000 per cent,' according to Peter Sweatman,
who heads a UN-sponsored research programme.
Reducing the environmental impact of exhaust emissions has become a
substantial area of cost for lorry manufacturers and therefore, ultimately,
operators. While no exact figures are available, Daf estimates that the
industry has spent around Pounds 150m a year in this one area of research
over the past five years.
This is a cost which will continue during the 1990s, as the industry strives
to meet stringent EC emissions targets. However, the research is running
into the law of diminishing returns. 'Clean burn' improvements become more
marginal, at the expense of slightly greater fuel consumption.
Manufacturers complain that legislators are doing little to clean up engines
in operation.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (6): US giant wraps up
takeover - Competition in UK domestic parcels sector intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent arrival of the world's largest package delivery company on the UK
domestic parcels scene will further sharpen the already fierce competition
in that sector of the distribution market.
The company concerned, US-based United Parcel Service, finally made its move
into the UK parcels business at the end of June with the acquisition of
privately-owned operator Carryfast.
The latter, which has 17 depots, 350 vehicles and an annual turnover of
around Pounds 31m, operates one-day guaranteed and three-day guaranteed UK
delivery services.
In contrast to the UPS expansion, rival US parcels giant Federal Express had
just a couple of months earlier vividly illustrated the tough nature of the
UK domestic parcels market by pulling out of that business and other
European operations because of continuing losses.
That withdrawal had in fact left only one other of the world's big four
express companies, TNT, active in the UK domestic sector. The fourth member
of the quartet, DHL, sold its UK domestic delivery organisation Elan to a
group of venture capitalists in August last year.
The FedEx retreat this year triggered an important battle for business among
remaining parcels delivery operators seeking to win some of the estimated
Pounds 40m worth of former FedEx business. The market's second largest
carrier, Securicor Omega Express (SOE), got a head start by paying FedEx
around Pounds 7m for the US company's business goodwill and other assets.
But other operators were predictably quick to try and win some of that
business away from SOE - market leader Parcelforce, for example, claimed
that following the Fedex withdrawal, it picked up an additional Pounds 4m
worth of new contracts by the end of May.
Looking ahead, the next known big development on the UK parcels delivery
scene could well involve the recently- announced plans to privatise
Parcelforce. The Royal Mail organisation is reckoned to have more than 30
per cent of the market. It made a loss in the financial year to end-March
1992 of Pounds 24m but that was a substantial improvement on the Pounds 131m
incurred the previous year. Mr Peter Howarth, managing director of
Parcelforce prior to his promotion last month to become managing director of
Royal Mail, confirms that recession has hit the overall UK parcels business
very hard. 'There was a reduction of 20 per cent in the volume of express
traffic during 1991/92 and a reduction of 40 per cent in the non- urgent
market,' he says.
To survive in that sort of market, says Mr Colin Millbanks, chief executive
of Mayne Nickless group parcels carrier Parceline, companies have had to
focus firmly on bottom-line performance rather than, as had been the case
until the recession, concentrating on building up volumes.
As an example of that trend, he points to Parceline's performance for the
year ended June 30, 1992. 'Revenues increased 6 per cent, shipments
increased 1 per cent but package throughput reduced by 1 per cent and our
costs are 1 per cent lower year on year in absolute terms. Clearly we have
increased margins considerably.'
In addition to the leading players, there are reckoned to be something like
1,000 smaller companies operating in the UK domestic parcels delivery
market, ranging from one-man operators to medium-size franchise
organisations. Although none of them handles even 1 per cent of the overall
market, it is estimated that those smaller operators together account for
around 55 per cent of the urgent parcels business and 45 per cent of the
non-urgent sector.
'With smaller operations and lower overheads, including the growth of
franchising, this area could in time pose a greater threat to the larger
established companies than current market influences,' suggests Mr Howarth.
Further adding to the competition for UK parcels distribution business,
particularly at the heavier end of the market, is a growing move by more
traditional road transport companies to upgrade some of their operations to
offer faster, time-definite deliveries.
Kent-based Laser Transport, for example, recently entered the UK express
market with the launch of next-day, two-day and three-day delivery services.
For their part, established parcel delivery companies are putting an
increasing emphasis on the provision of more information and improved
customer care.
Stimulating that development, they say, is the fact that customers are
increasingly taking for granted the provision of fast, reliable delivery
services at acceptable rates.
'Companies are requiring more management information from their express
carriers to enable them, for example, to analyse expenditure by departments
and service levels used. As companies increasingly need to be accountable,
so do the carriers,' says Mr David Kennard, managing director of Securiguard
group parcels company City Link.
But parcels companies also say that both they and their customers are
becoming more selective about the volumes and types of information passed
between them. For example, there was at one point a clear move by some
operators to introduce systems which could provide customers with fast proof
of delivery (POD) information about all their shipments. More recently,
though, there has been something of a rethink on that subject.
'It is easy to kid yourself that everyone wants POD information the minute a
shipment arrives,' says Mr Jonathan Smith, general manager London and South
East for British Rail parcels company Red Star.
'But we have found that what most people really want is for us to be
pro-active when there is a problem. They want to know what has happened, why
and what we are doing about it.'
Support for that view comes from Mr John Bintliff, chairman of Elan. He
agrees that the main information requirement of most customers is for news
about 'exceptions', that is, when parcels are not delivered as scheduled.
'Initially, we telephoned that information, now we are faxing it direct off
screen and in future, I am sure we will use EDI (electronic data
interchange) systems,' he adds.
In line with that increased customer care, parcels delivery companies are
also developing new services and even partnership arrangements to cater for
particularly specific requirements.
A recent example of that trend is provided by TNT Sameday, part of TNT
Express (UK). It has formed a partnership with Hutchison Paging (UK) to
provide a two-hour replacement pager service for customers in mainland
Britain and Northern Ireland. When delivering the pagers, TNT Sameday
motorcycle riders will display the Hutchison brand on their vests and a
magnetic logo on their machines.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (5): Number one on the 'wish
list' - Information technology moves up the table of priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVEMENT of information technology (IT) systems is now the number one
target for future development by distribution industry executives.
Fuelling that interest is the desire to reduce as far as possible the
paperwork traditionally associated with distribution operations.
But complicating the picture is the fact that distribution companies often
have to work with a wide range of customer IT systems and service
requirements. According to research conducted for the UK Institute of
Logistics &amp; Distribution Management's recently published 1991/92 Survey of
Distribution Costs, IT improvement has moved from number three the previous
year to number one on the distribution sector's 'wish list'. In terms of
areas where changes were being actively considered, IT systems achieved a
rating of 13 per cent, ahead of strategy review (10 per cent),
centralisation of distribution ( 9 per cent), and expansion of warehouse and
automation of warehouse (both 8 per cent).
'Generally, there appears to have been a shift from a short term focus to
longer term issues such as IT and strategic developments,' comments the ILDM
survey, conducted in conjunction with Touche Ross.
Such thinking is confirmed by leading individual distribution industry
executives. Mr John Galloway, logistics director of ASDA Stores, says the
high ground for the 1990s will be for the retailers and distributors who
plan logistics strategies based on tomorrow's expectations as well as
today's requirements.
'And those expectations are the fast and accurate transfer of information
and shared experiences,' he adds. Distribution industry IT development over
the past few years has followed a number of paths. One has involved the
establishment by large multinational operators of global systems designed to
increase the efficiency of dealings with large customer bases.
Particularly prominent in have been the leading express companies such as
TNT, Federal Express, United Parcel Service and DHL, all of which are now
important players on the general international distribution scene.
Leading freight forwarders are also moving that way - Swiss-based Danzas,
for example, has developed a programme called Danzlink which, it claims,
will have a far-reaching effect on European forwarding.
'Danzlink allows shippers to exchange information with both Danzas and any
other freight forwarder which conforms to UN/EDIFACT syntax rules, PC
(personal computer) to PC and PC to mainframe,' it adds. That sort of
flexibility will be crucial to future distribution industry IT development,
say informed observers.
IT services group Eyetech, which has worked with distribution companies such
as UK parcels carrier Elan, elaborates on that point. 'A couple of years
back there was a lot of talk among distribution companies about using IT
systems development to tie in customers. But that was always a rather naive
view - customers were never going to be happy with that sort of situation,'
says Mr Alan Redhouse, chairman of Eyetech.
'The key is to find systems which are sufficiently flexible, within very
wide margins, to deal with anything the customer wants to send or receive. I
think we will also start to see the emergence of systems which will suit any
carrier.'
Another significant area of distribution industry IT development centres on
finding ways of enabling smaller distribution companies to successfully
participate in the use of EDI and other systems.
The EC, for instance, is supporting a Pounds 5m project to test the
usefulness of advanced EDI and other information systems for smaller
pan-European transport operators. Britain's involvement is being
co-ordinated by Professor Michael Browne who is sponsored by transport
company BRS to research distribution issues.
'The success of the bigger carriers over the past five years has relied on
the ability to use advanced information systems using EDI. We aim to harness
technology and make it accessible to smaller operators,' he says.
Another marked trend in distribution industry IT development has seen some
distribution service companies' focus on the development of case-specific
software and hardware solutions for particular local applications.
That is the case at Transport Development Group which includes a range of
different UK and Continental distribution companies. Mr Kevin Ashby, IT
adviser to the TDG board, says group computer requirements are shared where
feasible but individual companies then put in what they need locally
'because they are closer to the coal face'.
'We have to cater for individual customers' different IT demands and service
requirements. Some customers, for instance, will insist that you, as a
distribution service contractor, use their systems for things like stock
control but may leave you to use your own system for fleet management,' he
adds.
NFC group UK delivery company Lynx reinforces the need for IT systems
flexibility. 'For the larger users of our services, it is important to keep
data systems flexible, to match their existing supply-chain management
information systems in the areas of order processing, materials planning and
inventory management,' says Mr Kevin Appleton, Lynx sales and marketing
director.
Another feature of general distribution industry IT development is a
continuing move to expand the scope of such systems beyond simple warehouse
and fleet management operations.
TNT Contract Logistics, for example, has just launched a new computer
software package called Class (Contract Logistics Administration Services
System). Mr Iain Speak, general manager of TNT Contract Logistics
Netherlands, says one of the main features of Class is that it allows the
company to undertake the full accounting role for clients, in addition to
providing them with distribution services.
The advantages of EDI implementation to the freight and distribution
industry are summed up by IT company A T &amp; T EasyLink Services. 'Companies
can exchange transport data with trading partners with greater speed and
efficiency and can ensure that the dispatch of goods is monitored at every
stage of transportation,' claims the company.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (4): Flying in the face of
competition - Airfreight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER suggestions that traditional international airfreight services would
be overwhelmed by competition from new-style integrators offering express
movement of goods worldwide now appear wide of the mark.
Certainly, the long-established providers of airfreight services - airlines
and freight forwarders - have over the past decade lost much of their
intra-European distribution business to specialist express delivery
operators using their own air and truck networks.
On the broader global scene, though, the airlines and forwarders remain a
significant force. Their well-established connections and varied
capacity/routing options often enable them to offer their customers, the
shippers, a wider and often more flexible range of distribution
possibilities than their integrator competitors.
Emphasising that point, Mr Klaus-Michael Kuehne, chairman and chief
executive of large Swiss-based forwarder Kuehne &amp; Nagel AG, claims many
international customers need 'more flexibility in their day-to-day business
than that offered by a highly sophisticated but rather inflexible air
network (of an integrator)'.
The global airfreight market can in fact now probably be broken down into
three broad sectors - traditional air cargo, special commodities and
express.
The last-named, express, is now dominated by integrators such as FedEx, TNT,
United Parcel Service and DHL. International airline efforts to develop
their own door-to- door express services, either alone or in conjunction
with freight forwarders, have largely proved unsuccessful.
Latest example of that involves Skyracer, an airline-owned door-to-door
delivery company, which was recently shut down by principal shareholder
Swissair, the Swiss airline, because of 'disappointing revenues and limited
prospects for growth'.
Even that failure, though, has not deterred all airlines from trying to
establish new air express operations. Next development in that context is
likely to come from German airline Lufthansa which is planning to launch its
own overnight freighter network in Europe next year using two full
freighters and seven 'quick-change' B737 aircraft which can carry passengers
during the day and cargo at night.
But the main roles for most airlines as far as the international air express
market is concerned now appear to lie in acting as carriers for the
integrators or as wholesalers. British Airways Cargo, for example, has over
the past few years developed a strong on-board courier network under the
name Speedbird Courier.
Currently, says Mr Peter White, managing director BA Cargo, Speedbird covers
more than 70 international routes to and from the UK, with up to 124
couriers flying each day.
'A timetable is published detailing all the flights on which a Speedbird
Courier travels. Space is sold to both retail and wholesale courier
companies. Support is received from both small and large retailers,
including the big four (TNT, FedEx, UPS and DHL), and over time, retailers
have discontinued their own couriers on routes operated by Speedbird
Courier,' he says.
Other airlines have decided to tackle the express market with an 'if you
cannot beat them, join them' approach. Most obvious example of that involves
Lufthansa and Japan Air Lines which have over the past couple of years each
built up a 25 per cent stake in air express company DHL.
Mr Rainer Butz, vice-president cargo Europe for Lufthansa, admits the German
airline's decision to buy into DHL followed the failure of earlier efforts
by the carrier to break into the express market through joint ventures and
co-operation with various major freight forwarders.
He stresses, though, that the involvement with DHL is an alliance aimed at
promoting co-operation rather than a merger or classic takeover. 'The
co-operation currently covers over 100 synergy projects. The most impressive
to date has been the development of a same-day service in Germany where
Lufthansa and DHL can combine their resources optimally,' he adds.
Other examples of co-operation between potential rivals include instances
where integrators are offering freight capacity to forwarders. Most obvious
example of that involves US-based integrator Federal Express which in
addition to developing its own international air express services is also
seeking to forge alliances with forwarders to create jointly-branded express
and express cargo services.
The second major sector of international airfreight services involves
special commodities such as perishable products, live animals,
project/outsized cargoes and hazardous goods. That business looks set to
remain largely in the hands of its traditional carriers, the airlines and
forwarders, which have the experience and facilities necessary to handle
them properly.
The main future battleground between airlines/forwarders and the integrators
is likely to involve the third sector of the airfreight market - traditional
air cargo. That encompasses the transportation of normal industrial and
commercial shipments moving in parcel, container or pallet form.
The integrators are already making substantial inroads into that market,
forcing the airline and forwarders to look hard at ways of improving their
services. Mr Butz of Lufthansa picks out some of the key issues in that
context.
'It will be increasingly necessary to improve product quality and to
quantify this quality. Airfreight must not be allowed to become merely a
commodity. It must maintain a clear, unmistakable performance profile.
Product enhancement through improved information systems will be an integral
part of this process,' he says.
'Just as important as the improvement in cost quality will be constant
effort in the area of cost improvement. Cost-cutting will have to be
intensified. But the shipping community should not, however, anticipate
services in 2000 at 1970s' prices.'
Many airfreight shippers claim they would be prepared to pay more for better
quality airfreight services from scheduled airlines. But, they argue, they
are often being asked to pay premium rates for less than premium services.
That point is made strongly by the chairman of the British Shippers' Council
air transport committee, John Boyce. By monitoring airlines' performance, he
says, shippers have been able to establish that some of the better airlines
are aiming to get 90 per cent of cargo flown as booked. 'So they are
expecting us to pay the going rate for a service which will certainly fail
10 per cent of the time and probably more,' he claims.
Mr Boyce argues that in addition to better value for money, shippers also
want airlines to offer a wide choice of airfreight services.
In that context, he suggests carriers should consider introducing different
product classes for cargo along the lines of those used for passenger
services. For example, a 'first class' service might offer a 100 per cent
flown-as-booked guarantee, while 'business class' cargo might be given
greater priority than 'economy' freight.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (3): Mixed pattern of change
 -UK retailers are rethinking their policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILLIP HASTINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION, tougher competition and greater availability of information
technology systems are encouraging UK retailers to rethink their
distribution policies. But the pattern of actual change is mixed.
Some retailers are veering away from contracting out more distribution
activities to third party specialists and bringing parts of those operations
back in-house. Helping to encourage that change is the continuing
development of information technology (IT) systems which can give retailers
tight control over areas of distribution activity where they also now have
plenty of practical experience.
Other retailers, though, are heading in the opposite direction and seeking
to establish even closer and wider-ranging partnerships with their
distribution service providers.
That mixed picture is confirmed by the Research Services Department of the
Institute of Grocery Distribution in a study which focused specifically on
the involvement of third party specialists in the centralised distribution
operations of leading multiple stores.
According to IGD research carried out during 1991, third party penetration
of that sector ranged from 35-45 per cent for ASDA, J Sainsbury and Tesco
and 60-65 per cent for CRS, Gateway and Safeway, to 85-95 per cent for
Iceland, Kwik Save and CWS, and 100 per cent for Wm Low and Grandways.
Mr John Galloway, logistics director for ASDA Stores, told the recent UK
Institute of Logistics &amp; Distribution Management (ILDM) annual conference
why his organisation had opted to use a mix of contractors and self-managed
distribution operations to service its 206 superstores.
'It allows us to understand the difference between logistics professionals
whose aim is to generate a profit and people like ourselves to whom
logistics is a cost centre within the overall business,' he said.
During the 1980s there was in fact a pronounced general move among retailers
towards contracting out more of their distribution operations, a trend
confirmed in the 1991/92 Survey of Distribution Costs just published by the
ILDM.
In the consumer goods (CG) retail sector, for example, the ILDM survey found
that around 70 per cent of transport expenditure went on third party
dedicated or shared user services and 30 per cent on in-house operations.
For the food, drink and tobacco (F D &amp; T) retail sector, the figures were
around 48 per cent and 52 per cent respectively.
But the picture is changing again, says the ILDM. 'Interestingly, when
compared to last year, transport has shifted away from third party, both
shared and dedicated, to own account operations,' comments the ILDM.
The same survey also found that own-account operations continue to dominate
the storage side of distribution activities.
There, 85-90 per cent of expenditure by the CG and F D &amp; T retail sectors
went on in-house operations.
A report published this year by management consultants Price Waterhouse
confirms those trends. According to a survey of 'Competitive Trends in
Retail Logistics', undertaken with the help of the Cambridge Centre for
Competitive Logistics Research, 'while sub-contracted transport services
were generally perceived to be adequate to meet competitive requirements
over the next two years, 80 per cent of retailers felt that third party
warehouse and stock management performance was inadequate.'
Other industry surveys and consultants' reports have suggested that there
is, or at least has been, considerable dissatisfaction among some retailers
over the efficiency of distribution operations run by third party
contractors.
But a study of retailers and manufacturers carried out on behalf of third
party contractor Applied Distribution Limited (ADL) claimed such
dissatisfaction has been just as apparent among companies running their own
distribution set-ups.
'The main problem for own-account operators was inefficiency, most
frequently in vehicle utilisation but also in picking and loading rates,'
commented ADL. 'Those using third parties identified two major areas of
concern. These were a lack of 'professionalism' and understanding of the
client's business, and severe teething problems with newly-established
contracts.'
Adding to the dissatisfaction of some companies using third party operators,
suggests Mr John Kelly, chairman of logistics industry consultants Davies &amp;
Robson, have been the terms of their contracts. 'For example, companies
found their contractors expecting inflation-linked cost increases at a time
when their own turnover is declining,' he said.
Not surprisingly, third party distribution companies generally play down
suggestions of any large-scale reversion to in-house distribution
operations.
They blame much of that 'speculation' on a delayed reaction to events in the
1980s when some distribution companies took on contracts for which they did
not have the right management and ran into problems.
Mr John Harvey, chairman of contract distribution group Tibbett &amp; Britten,
says he believes there will a continuing rundown of in-house distribution
operations. And he claims retail distribution is likely in future to be
increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large specialist
contractors.
'When distribution contracts come up now, we usually only see a very
selective list of companies invited even to tender,' he says. Other trends
becoming apparent in the retail sector include new types of contract
distribution arrange-ments.
There are signs in the furniture sector, for instance, of more tripartite
agreements. A recent example of that involves a contract won by home
delivery specialist Federal Express Systemcare to deliver all orders for
Stag Meredew products placed through the Allders Department Stores group.
Retailer demand for fast supply of products, often at short notice, is also
leading to an increased role in that market for parcels service companies
offering overnight delivery. The sort of operation involved is typified by
the service parcels carrier Parceline provides for Entertainment UK, a
Kingfisher group company which supplies CDs, cassettes, videos and computer
games to Woolworths and other major retail groups.
Flexibility is all important, explains Mr Glyn Angel, Entertainment UK
supplier logistics manager. 'When the demand for a new record release is
exceptionally high, it is critical that shops are replenished very quickly.
Parceline is able to provide us with extra trailers at short notice to
collect and distribute overnight,' he says.
Predictably, another development set to strongly influence future patterns
of UK retail industry distribution activity is the imminent advent of the
European Community Single Market.
That development is, for example, likely to increase cross- border
distribution activities. And the need to develop pan- European networks
could open up new opportunities for third party specialists.
'Controlling the supply chain will become a much larger task and if
retailers wish to retain the economies of scale they have gained in the UK,
it is likely we will see an increase in demand for the services of logistics
specialists with European or global reach,' claims Mr Martyn Pellew,
divisional sales and marketing director for Exel Logistics.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (2): On track to speed up
network - Action to save EC's combined transport plans from stagnating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL TERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN transport ministers will next month be urged to agree urgent
financial backing for a proposed new Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.7bn) strategy to save
the Community's combined transport plans from stagnating.
The proposals will for the first time also seek to include intra-Community
maritime container movements for special treatment under combined transport
regulations.
The 10-year support plan for dedicated track, terminals, rolling stock and
unit load devices is being put forward at a time when combined transport
activity is slowing down and road congestion escalating.
But in spite of the urgency of the situation, some countries, notably the
UK, are doing little to encourage the development of combined transport
systems.
Combined transport traffic growth in Europe in 1991 has slipped from 20 per
cent annually to 5 per cent. A T Kearney, the management consultants whose
report for the European Commission in 1987 predicted combined transport
traffic would triple by 2005, has now extended the time scale by five years.
Rudy Colle, director-general of the International Union of Combined
Road-Rail Transport Companies (UIRR), explained that the decline in 1991
volumes resulted from a drop in national traffic caused by increased
competition from road hauliers.
The UIRR's 12 member companies were set up by the railways with hauliers as
shareholders so as to dispel hauliers' fears over the railways' conflicts of
interest.
But many other hauliers and distribution contractors are not committing
themselves fully to the system. They fear the railway companies cannot
provide a reliable service.
Transport Commissioner Karel van Miert will tell the Transport Council
ministers that the economic and social gains of the Commission's plan far
outweigh the costs.
Commission officials calculate that a Community-wide combined transport rail
network will cost Ecu1.4bn over 10 years. Terminals and equipment will cost
Ecu600m.
It is hoped that up to two-thirds of the cost will be funded by the
operators and the remainder by national governments and the Commission.
Ministers will be told combined transport operators cannot themselves
finance the investment required for the rail and terminal network. The
margins that they are forced to operate on to remain competitive with
hauliers are too slender to afford the heavy investment.
This is due to deep price-cutting in the liberalised road transport market
and the difference in hidden costs between road and rail, where road
hauliers get their infrastructure free and escape the costs of the
environmental damage they cause.
Mr Van Miert will argue that for combined transport to be effective, it is
essential to develop a community-wide network and not rely, as at present,
on isolated lines.
The plan will concentrate on the most productive lines first. These are in
Germany, Italy and France.
Eventually the network will stretch from Scotland and Ireland, to the
Iberian Peninsula and across to Greece and the borders of eastern Europe.
To encourage new private operators, the ministers will be asked to agree to
pilot projects aimed at establishing ground rules on how small road hauliers
get access to terminals and the conditions for market entry. The projects
will involve inland waterway and short-sea container operations.
The Competition Directorate, DG IV, will also be involved because of a
possible need to draft a derogation from competition rules. The special
nature of combined transport entails operators of different modes to enter
agreements with each other that could be interpreted as being against the
Treaty of Rome's competition rules.
But there is still widespread scepticism over the railway's commercial role
in combined transport.
A new intermodal company, Allied-Continental Intermodal (ACI) is being
launched in the UK today by Intercontainer, the European Railways'
intermodal company, SNCF and Railfreight Distribution (RfD) to compete
directly with the newly-formed UIRR associate, Combined Transport Ltd (CTL).
This is causing concern in the UK industry.
ACI is owned by the railways whereas CTL is 36 per cent owned by private
hauliers and forwarders. But a spokesman at RfD insisted that CTL has
nothing to fear and will receive service quality equal to that given to the
new company.
To encourage combined transport the Commission has agreed derogations which
allow governments to give discounts on vehicle excise duties and permit
gross lorry weights of 44 tonnes for vehicles in combined transport.
The Belgian, German, French and Italian governments allow one or both of the
derogations. The UK government allows neither, preferring to stick with its
38-tonne gross lorry weight limit until 1999. The 32.52 tonnes restriction
on drawbar sets will be raised to 35 tonnes next year.
Because this makes British operations less competitive than those on the
European mainland, UK firms are reluctant to invest in combined transport
equipment. The UK has fewer than 2,000 swap bodies, the most popular
intermodal system, compared to more than 100,000 on the mainland.
The Rail Users Group, the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage
Association continue to urge the government to adopt a more helpful
attitude.
UK-based Grand Transport Systems, a leading European supplier of intermodal
equipment for combined transport, makes little effort to market its products
in the UK because of delays and uncertainty over the provision of combined
transport infrastructures on the British side of the Tunnel.
RfD managing director Ian Brown says he now has government approval to spend
Pounds 50m to increase the clearance height to European loading gauge
standards of tunnels and bridges on the Channel Tunnel routes. It will allow
his new fleet of medium deck height wagons to carry 9ft high containers.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (1): Efficiency and quality
rule - Distribution services are becoming more sophisticated as the demand
intensifies for increased reliability and maximum cost savings. Phillip
Hastings looks at an industry facing the challenge of new safety legislation
and greater use of information technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION and increased competitive pressures are combining with much
greater use of sophisticated information technology systems to make
industry's distribution operations more efficient and cost-effective.
In Europe the trend is being re-inforced by the rapid approach of the
European Community Single Market. A number of companies have already moved
to set up pan-European distribution networks - admittedly not always with
the success that had been hoped for - and others are considering similar
moves. At the same time, the international and domestic UK distribution
sectors are both focusing on quality, with more and more service operators
seeking to achieve recognised standards such as BS 5750 or ISO 9002.
The continuing drive for greater efficiency is highlighted in a survey by
the UK Institute of Logistics &amp; Distribution Management of more than 480
companies across a broad spectrum of UK industry and commerce. This showed
that distribution costs as a percentage of companies' overall turnover fell
from just under 5.2 per cent in 1990/91 to 4.7 per cent in 1991/92. That
compares with 8.5 per cent in the mid-1980s and 17 per cent at the start of
that decade.
However, there is still a considerable difference between the impact on
small companies and on large organisations of distribution costs. In the
industrial manufacturing sector, small companies with an annual UK turnover
of less than Pounds 50m report that on average, distribution costs amount to
nearly 16 per cent of turnover.
For medium-size companies with a turnover of Pounds 50m to Pounds 300m the
figure is a little more than 5 per cent and for large companies, just under
4 per cent.
'These results are consistent with previous surveys and indicate significant
economies of scale for many larger operators,' adds the ILDM.
However, the continuing overall improvement in distribution service
efficiency has not been enough to quell discontent among some distribution
service users.
There is particular dissatisfaction over the efficiency of distribution
operations run by third party contractors, particularly in the retail
sector. Other reports have found that companies with in-house distribution
services are also experiencing problems in achieving desired efficiency
levels.
Companies using third party contractors cite lack of understanding of their
business by service providers, poor standards of management and excessive
teething problems in the early stages of a contract as their main
difficulties.
Organisations running in-house distribution activities mention inefficiency
in the use of vehicles and facilities as weak links. Running their own
distribution operations uses financial and human resources which could be
better employed in other areas.
Partly in an attempt to resolve these problems, there has been a move
towards achieving recognised quality standards.
While distribution companies admit that gaining BS 5750 or similar
accreditation does not ensure customer needs will be fully met, they argue
that a standard is likely in future to be seen as a starting point, a basic
criterion which will have to be met.
Distribution service providers which do not meet that criterion, consultants
suggest, will find it increasingly difficult to receive invitations to
tender for new business.
Environmental issues such as traffic congestion and pollution are also
becoming significant factors in distribution service activities. London's
'Red Routes' scheme, for example, bans parking on certain roads to try to
ensure a free flow of vehicles.
Other restrictions on the movement of traffic are also complicating
distribution activities.
The UK's Freight Transport Association highlights recent proposals to put a
total ban on lorries in the Slade Green area of Bexley, Kent, at night and
at weekends.
The ban would prevent lorries collecting or delivering goods, with no
movements to or from premises, between 9pm and 6am, Monday to Friday, and
from 1pm Saturday to 6am Monday.
The FTA claims that companies situated on some busy industrial estates in
the area could face complete closure or relocation if the ban is introduced.
Other environmental issues affecting the distribution industry include a
continuing controversy over maximum truck weights in the UK. Meanwhile,
efforts to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial vehicles and to cut
emissions continue.
There is also an increasing emphasis on safety and this is particularly
evident in the specialised field of temperature-controlled distribution.
Continued tightening of legislation on food safety has forced operators to
invest in more staff training and new equipment.
Overshadowing domestic UK issues, though, is the coming of the EC Single
Market and its likely impact on distribution activities. At present, few
distribution service providers offer full pan-European coverage, and the
past two or three years have seen more and more companies forced to rethink
their expansion plans or even pull out. The most significant instance of
this was the withdrawal of giant US parcels company Federal Express from
European regional and domestic delivery because of continuing heavy losses.
A number of UK distribution companies have also run into problems with their
expansion on the Continent and even the more successful ones such as Exel
Logistics, Transport Development Group and McGregor Cory have tended to move
fairly cautiously.
There are definite signs, however, of renewed interest in the development of
European services. In June, for instance, the UK-based Hays group announced
it had bought French distribution company Groupe FRIL for Pounds 37.5m.
According to Mr Ronnie Frost, Hays' chairman and chief executive, the group
has for several years been searching for a significant company to expand its
presence in Europe.
More recently, Mayne Nickless group UK domestic parcels carrier Parceline
announced it was moving into Continental Europe using a networking operation
and an international forwarding company.
'We are not about to put at risk the improving profitability of Parceline by
taking on heavy costs from day one. We are getting into Europe with minimum
investment and risk, with variable costs rather than fixed costs,' Mr Colin
Millbanks, Parceline chief executive says.
Another stimulus for UK distribution industry interest in Continental
European business is the construction of the Channel Tunnel and its
associated freight links. Together with European Commission efforts to speed
up the development of railfreight and combined road/rail transport services,
the Tunnel is pushing rail transport much more firmly into the general
distribution industry spotlight.
Still to be answered, though, is the question of whether railfreight and
combined rail/road transport will be viable for a wide range of goods in
addition to the former's traditional bulk traffics. Crucial factors will
include the development of efficient transhipment operations and good
consignment control capabilities.
In fact, good information technology systems, increasingly including EDI
(Electronic Data Interchange), are already playing a critical role in
general distribution service development.
And research carried out by consultants Touche Ross for the ILDM shows that
improvement of such systems is now the number one target for future
development among distribution industry executives.

FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy deal hits Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOUGHT deal involving the purchase and sale of a 2.1 per cent stake in
Enterprise Oil, regarded as the UK's leading independent oil exploration and
production company, triggered a steep decline in the share price.
After opening on a relatively steady note at 343p, Enterprise dropped as
news of the placing filtered into the market. The 2.1 per cent block, some
9.6m shares, was bought by broker Hoare Govett from a single UK institution
and placed with a number of Hoare's institutional clients.
Hoare said it had placed the shares at 318p each and that no corporate
holders had been involved on either the buying or selling side of the deal.
The placing took only 20 minutes, according to the broker. The Seaq ticker
revealed that a block of 9.6m Enterprise shares had been traded at 315 1/2
p, indicating that Hoare took a 2 1/2 p a share turn on the block.
At worst the shares touched 323p, before finishing a net 21 down at 324p.
Turnover, almost entirely accounted for by the bought deal, reached 20m.
The seller was not revealed but specialists ruled out Elf Aquitaine, the
French oil concern, which has a substantial holding of Enterprise shares via
its Elf-Enterprise joint venture.
Norwich Union, with an 8 per cent stake (36.7m shares) was seen as a
possible seller, as was Prudential, with a 4.9 per cent interest (22.3m
shares). On the other hand, Schroders, with 3.39 per cent (15.5m shares),
was believed to be a firm holder. Among other investment institutions,
Gartmore was suggested as a possible seller of Enterprise stock.
Rank sold
Not even confirmation of the disposal of one of its London hotels could lift
the recent gloom that has descended on Rank Organisation, and the slide in
the shares continued apace yesterday, this time caused by a profits
downgrading from broker BZW.
Following Tuesday's downgrading by Kleinwort Benson, BZW yesterday shaved
its current year forecast by Pounds 14m to Pounds 246m and cut the following
year's figure by Pounds 35m to Pounds 285m, 'to take account of the tougher
outlook for leisure in the UK'.
Ms Jane Anscombe at BZW, however, believes the recent falls in Rank have
been overdone, as have worries over the balance sheet, and said: 'We are
actually buyers at these levels.' The shares closed 14 lower at 477p after
brisk trade of 1.7m.
Rank confirmed that it had sold its Athenaeum central London hotel for what
analysts believe to be Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m.
Tarmac drops
A thoroughly demoralised building sector provided the market's weakest
individual performer in building materials and contracting group Tarmac,
which dropped 9, about 14 per cent, to 56p, the lowest level since the
mid-1980s. Almost 11m Tarmac shares changed hands, making them the market's
third most heavily traded stock.
The latest bout of selling pressure was said to have been triggered by
Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, which was said to have pencilled in a
loss of around Pounds 15m for this year.
Abbey National was prominent in the banks sector, with hints of a broker buy
recommendation said to have triggered an advance of 7 to 270p.
Sun Alliance softened 2 to 222p in front of today's interim figures, which
are expected to show a loss of between Pounds 115m and Pounds 165m.
The electricity distribution companies tumbled as private investors sold
their stock ahead of the final 70p call on the shares due on September 15.
The Electricity Package was under pressure in front of Friday's cessation of
trading, closing Pounds 100 down at Pounds 3055, with dealers detecting
signs of sizeable overseas selling, particularly from the US.
Among the individual electricity stocks, Midland fell 14 to 306p on heavy
turnover of 3.6m, while Yorkshire and London each lost 13 to 353p and 286p
respectively.
Dealers feared that the big institutional deal in Enterprise Oil might spark
a similar trend in other UK oil independents. It was remembered that the
Clyde Petroleum share price had suffered as a result of similar
institutional activity earlier this year.
Along with Clyde, Goal, Premier and Monument Oil &amp; Gas were viewed as
potentially vulnerable to the recent retreat by crude oil prices, when the
latter are seen in sterling terms. The severe weakness of the dollar has
left sterling oil prices at around their lowest for some 20 years, according
to oil analysts. Lasmo shares, given a severe mauling by the market since
the group won control of Ultramar, eased 2 to 129p.
A stock overhang and worries that the poor late summer weather in the UK
will affect full-year profits at Cadbury Schweppes combined to depress the
shares, which ended 8 down at 421p.
Ladbroke Group was in demand ahead of today's half-year statement and moved
forward 5 to 148p. Granada Group appreciated 6 to 243p.
Housebuilders continued to attract determined selling across the board, with
Wilson Bowden, scheduled to reveal interims this morning, a further 6 lower
at 226p. George Wimpey, reporting half-time results next Tuesday, slipped 2
to a low for the year of 83p as dealers pondered the possibility of a cut in
the dividend.
Owners Abroad, still depressed by the recent Smith New Court profits
downgrade, continued to languish and finished 2 cheaper at 54p.
Demand from the US was said to have been the reason for an advance by
British Airways of 10 to 234p on turnover of 3.4m shares.
A trader shopping for around 250,000 shares in IMI caused a squeeze in the
stock, which moved ahead 7 to 239p. Siebe gained 6 at 581p. UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew is said to have a positive view on both stocks.
An initial decline in British Aerospace was followed by a strong rise, with
brokers Kleinwort Benson and SG Warburg reported to have shown a keen
interest in the shares. They were eventually 12 ahead at 217p after turnover
of 1.4m.

FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close to an uncertain session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IRREGULAR trading session saw the UK equity market regain the FT-SE 2,300
mark to close very firmly yesterday, although much of the impetus came from
other sectors of the London financial arena.
Stock index futures led the underlying blue chip stocks, and a recovery from
early weakness was also encouraged by gains in government bonds and in the
December contract on sterling futures, or short sterling as it is known in
the City. Also, as equities moved towards the close, the pound was edging
higher against the D-Mark.
Dealers doubted whether the big institutions had played much part in the
recovery in equities which left the FT-SE Index ahead by 14.6 at 2,313.0 at
its final reading.
Trading volume was swollen by a handful of individual deals, notably a
bought deal of 9.6m shares in Enterprise Oil. The day's Seaq volume total of
431.6m shares implied a return to more normal business levels after the bank
holiday weekend. Tuesday's Seaq total of 312.8m was worth only Pounds 589.5m
in terms of retail business.
The session opened nervously, with traders apprehensive regarding prospects
for today's meeting of the Bundesbank policy council.
Worries over the implications of sterling's weakness for domestic interest
rate prospects continued to overshadow equity investors. A leading UK
brokerage house expressed bearish views on the stock market and share prices
were soon undermined by a disappointing start in stock index futures.
The Footsie was soon down to the 2,282 area without seeing any great weight
of selling. At this point the market rebounded and steady, but not strong,
demand for the blue chips sent the Footsie to just above 2,314. Optimism
flagged later when Wall Street made a slow start to its new session, showing
a gain of only 4.32 on the Dow in early deals. The futures market came to
the aid of equities again at the close, taking share prices to just under
the day's best levels.
Market strategists pointed to the presence of several of the leading London
securities houses in the derivatives markets as an indication that technical
forces had driven the rally in share prices.
With the interest rate outlook still the prime factor in the market,
particular attention was paid to the recovery in sterling futures, which
were regarded as heavily oversold following pressure from a leading UK bank
last week.
Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon commented: 'September 20 (the date of
the French referendum on the Maastricht proposals) is still a long way away;
and DM 2.7780 is very close.' The UK stock market is likely to remain highly
nervous until that date, and vulnerable to changes of mood in the interest
rate futures markets.
Yesterday's recovery was led by gains in the international stocks which had
suffered particularly severely during the market's downturn.
Domestic issues, including the store and building shares which are
vulnerable to interest rate worries, found it more difficult to join in the
market's upswing.

FT  03 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY increased sharply in the derivatives markets yesterday as a strong
advance in government bonds encouraged several London securities houses to
take a more positive view of the interest rate outlook, writes Terry Byland.
In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE Index opened lower but rose
strongly at mid-morning, touching a day's peak of 2,330 before its official
close of around 2,328, a premium of around 7 to the fair value figure, which
incorporates dividend flows and financing costs.
Dealers identified two leading UK houses and one US house as determined
buyers of the stock index futures. However, there was further selling of the
September contract by a US house which has followed a determinedly bearish
tack for several weeks.
In traded options, volume jumped from Tuesday's 15,060 contracts to 27,495
yesterday, with 17,619 representing calls. The FT-SE contract traded 10,153
lots, compared with 6,424 previously. Tesco topped the actives list in stock
options with 2,249 contracts, as a large line of shares appeared in the
stock market. Cadbury-Schweppes options, also overshadowed by stock in the
equity market, had 1,178 lots transacted.

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late burst of buying gives
Dow sharp boost
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER trading quietly in a narrow range for most of the day, US stock
markets posted sharp gains on a burst of late buying yesterday, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.05 at 3,290.31, its
high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.91 at 417.98, while the
American SE composite improved 1.29 to 382.73 and the Nasdaq composite rose
5.64 to 571.25. New York SE turnover came to 187.5m shares.
Investors were keeping a wary eye on the dollar, which showed a mild
improvement against the D-Mark in New York trading yesterday. The fact that
the dollar has roughly held its own over the past few days has helped equity
sentiment, but the market remains concerned that the US currency's weakness
leaves little room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
The day's only economic news was a 1.1 per cent decline in July factory
orders, mostly accounted for by a fall in transportation orders.
Consequently, the data had little effect on share prices, which remained
trapped in a narrow trading range until late afternoon, when demand picked
up.
The late rush of buying was believed to be investors anticipating gains in
the market that traditionally occur in the few days before the Labor Day
weekend holiday. Investors were also thought to have been encouraged by the
market's ability to hold its current levels in spite of continued bad news
on the economy.
General Motors shed Dollars  1/2 in early trading as industrial strife
escalated at its Lordstown metal stamping plant in Ohio, causing further
disruptions at numerous plants across the country. GM stopped production at
two more assembly plants on Tuesday, bringing the total of idle factories to
six. The stock recovered later, however, to finish just Dollars  1/8 off at
Dollars 34 1/4 .
CBS climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 200 on reports that broking house Smith
Barney had raised its rating on the media group to 'buy' from 'hold'.
Rollins Environmental Services put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 11 3/8 in
active trading as investors responded to a buy recommendation from
investment bank Kidder Peabody. The stock had fallen after Hurricane Andrew
hit Florida and Louisiana, causing the company to temporarily close two of
its hazardous waste incineration facilities, but analysts at Kidder believe
the decline creates a good buying opportunity.
On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were all firmer, with Apple adding
Dollars 2 at Dollars 48 1/2 and Amgen Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 65. Canada
TORONTO stocks recovered from what looked like another slow summer session
to turn in a strong performance for the day on the back of Wall Street's
rise.
The TSE 300 index gained 29.1 at 3,436.7 and rises outnumbered falls by 344
to 223 after volume of 34.3m shares.

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hopes of 'Yes' to Maastricht
lift Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUS optimism that the French will back Maastricht lifted late-closing
bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS staged a turnround to end 2.2 per cent higher, boosted by a show of
unity by leading politicians in favour of the Maastricht treaty and some
opinion polls predicting a majority of 'Yes' votes in the referendum. The
CAC-40 index finished 37.18 higher at 1,711.41, off a low of 1,659.84, in
improved turnover of FFr2bn.
Euro Disney jumped FFr5 or 6.9 per cent to FFr77 on talk that the theme park
was about to announce good attendance figures and high occupancy rates at
its hotels. The market responded well to the appointment of Mr Philippe
Bourguignon as president reporting directly to Euro Disney's chairman, Mr
Robert Fitzpatrick.
Total slumped FFr12.20 or 5.9 per cent to FFr195.10, as analysts slashed
their 1992 forecasts following the oil refiner's poor interim results. James
Capel has cut its 1992 net profit estimate to FFr3.8bn from FFr4.5bn.
Investors wanting to keep a weighting in oils switched into the
higher-yielding Elf which rose FFr7 to FFr330.
Oversold financial stocks jumped on hopes that the Maastricht treaty would
be ratified. Suez jumped FFr7.60 to FFr232 while Bancaire added FFr13.50 to
FFr293.
There was unusually high volume of 48,575 shares in Pernod, the drinks
company, which rose FFr11.90 to FFr406.80 on renewed takeover speculation.
MILAN weakened further on renewed foreign selling. The Comit index fell
9.65, or 2.5 per cent to 375.34, its lowest level since September 1985, in
turnover estimated at L100bn after L59.8bn on Tuesday.
Dealers saw no way out of the crisis, which stemmed from a lack of
confidence in the country and in the lira. Not only was there uncertainty
over the outcome of the French referendum on Maastricht, but also the
prospect of further austerity measures by the government.
Fiat fixed L142 lower at L3,800 while Generali shed L730 to L25,020.
Mediobanca was settled at L9,530, down L570.
Italmobiliare, which was temporarily suspended due to a trade imbalance on
the sell side, dropped L3,590 or 10.2 per cent to L31,510.
FRANKFURT dropped again in the official session, the DAX losing 12.03, or
0.8 per cent to 1,506.67. But in spite of the continuing fall in the dollar,
widely blamed for the drops in exporters, there has been a technical aspect
to the recent falls.
The market rose by 1.7 per cent on Monday on panic short-covering by
professionals, said Mr Edgar Benischeck, equity dealing head at Bank Julius

dealers to cover long equity positions, which carried on yesterday.

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls again as
profit-taking continues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo
SHARE prices lost further ground yesterday as profit-taking continued after
the market's two-week rally, agencies report from Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 152.34 easier at 17,587.72, after profit-taking on
one hand and buying by dealers and individuals on the other limited the
day's high and low to 17,688.38 and 17,477.92 respectively.
Volume was estimated at 420m shares, down from 550.8m. Declines led advances
by 824 to 199, with 92 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first
section stocks slipped 21.22 to 1,349.05. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
shed 4.25 to 1,072.31.
Japanese institutional investors stayed on the sidelines. Although Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said late on Tuesday that the economy
should begin to recover before winter, many fund managers doubt that
corporate earnings will pick up until next year.
Furthermore, continued pressure on institutions from the Finance Ministry to
refrain from heavy selling of equities was not inspiring confidence in the
market.
Trading remained dominated by incentive-backed shares, with dealers and
individuals buying Aids-related issues and Isuzu Motors, the latter
following a report that the auto maker had succeeded in developing a highly
efficient ceramic engine.
Isuzu climbed Y80, or 28 per cent, to Y370. Other motor manufacturers were
mostly lower amid signs that Japanese auto sales continued to decline
sharply from year-ago levels.
Nichiboshin, a non-bank financial institution which lends to smaller
companies, was another bright spot following reports that Sanwa Bank was
likely to lower the interest charges on its outstanding loans to the
financially strapped company. Nichiboshin rose Y80, or 23 per cent, to Y423.
Aids-related shares attracted heavy interest. Meiji Milk advanced Y20 to
Y1,130 on 21.87m shares traded, 5.2 per cent of the day's total volume.
Roundup
THE Pacific Basin region was mostly lower yesterday.
HONG KONG was an exception, the Hang Seng index finishing 22.88 higher at
5,734.45. Retail investors maintained some momentum in the afternoon in the
absence of European buying. Volume totalled HKDollars 2.65bn, near Tuesday's
level.
Interest continued to focus on blue chips, with HSBC Holdings leading the
actives list. It closed 50 cents off at HKDollars 56, after touching
HKDollars 57.
AUSTRALIA weakened on concern about earnings and on steady offshore selling.
The All Ordinaries index ended 13.5 down at 1,528.5 in turnover of ADollars
210.1m.
Diversified miner CRA tumbled 40 cents to ADollars 12.24 after posting a 6.8
per cent fall in net profits. Transport group TNT dipped 3 cents to ADollars
1.24 after its ADollars 195.4m loss.
NEW ZEALAND was dragged down by selling pressure on the leaders,
particularly Brierley Investments. The NZSE-40 index fell 13.58 to 1,470.30
in volume of just NZDollars 14.3m. Brierley hit its low for the year, 84
cents, before ending 3 cents off at 85 cents. Carter Holt lost 6 cents to
NZDollars 2.58 on indications that a strike at its four forest products
mills will drag on.
SINGAPORE declined in sluggish trading, the Straits Times Industrial index
shedding 10.32 to 1,365.14 in volume of 24.3m shares, against 28.1m.
Property issues lost some ground as investors reacted to reports that the
government had raised development charges for residential plots by between 8
and 40 per cent. City Development fell 14 cents to SDollars 3.40 and Hotel
Properties 2 cents to SDollars 1.68.
KUALA LUMPUR closed softer after initial steadiness failed to prompt
follow-through buying. The composite index was off 0.58 at 572.92.
SEOUL finished higher as a late-afternoon buying spree in
large-capitalisation shares outweighed earlier profit-taking. The index, off
7.82 in the early afternoon, ended 4.14 ahead at 562.74 in turnover of
Won462.5bn (Won639.6bn).
BANGKOK was lifted by Thai Airways, one of the biggest stocks on the market,
which rose by its 10 per cent limit, Bt5, to Bt58. The SET index put on 8.89
to 762.42 in turnover of Bt8.89bn.
TAIWAN was pulled lower by late profit-taking, the weighted index closing
26.84 down at 3,933.61. Turnover was moderate at TDollars 24.35bn, against
TDollars 25.56bn.
MANILA rebounded on thoughts that the peso's climb was slowing. The
composite index gained 25.43 at 1,392.34 in combined turnover of 181.84m
pesos, after 163.36m. PLDT rose 35 pesos to 940.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET capitalisation of companies listed on the New Zealand Stock
Exchange jumped 66 per cent to NZDollars 28.89bn (Dollars 16.1bn) in the
year to June 30, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash, writes
Terry Hall in Wellington.
In his annual report, Mr David Wale, the stock exchange chairman, said the
rise was fuelled by price movements, new listings and capital raisings worth
NZDollars 4.88bn, compared with NZDollars 1.75bn in 1990-91.
Mr Wale added that declining interest rates, a lower New Zealand dollar and
an improved domestic environment renewed interest in equities, especially in
smaller companies. Larger groups, however, had been affected by their
international involvements.
Listings fell by 10 per cent to 140 - compared with 280 in 1987 - and the
listed overseas companies dropped by 22 per cent to 58.
Two more companies were delisted yesterday: Bridgecorp, a former mining
company that unsuccessfully tried to run a chain of toy shops, and General
Properties, placed in receivership last month after being run by a group of
banks to whom it owes NZDollars 11m.

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay makes tentative recovery from
scandal - Government economic measures could help Indian share prices to
rise further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indian bourses, enjoying their first rally for three months, are awaiting
measures from the PV Narasimha Rao administration which, they hope, will
stimulate the economy and boost equity values that have languished since a
securities scandal broke early in May.
New Delhi plans to make the rupee fully convertible, lower interest rates if
prices continue to drop, relax controls on the pharmaceutical industry, and
announce contracts with international oil companies for oil exploration and
production.
Most of these decisions are expected to be in place before Dr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, reviews India's programmes with the
International Monetary Fund in Washington in three weeks' time.
The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with
two-thirds of national trading, is looking back at a slump which took it as
low as 2,529 in early August, down 1,938 points, or 43 per cent, from a peak
of 4,467 in mid-April, prompted by the seizure of assets of Mr Harshad Mehta
and other brokers implicated in the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.25bn) securities
scandal.
After hitting a six-month low on August 6, share prices have rebounded since
then, partly in response to government decontrol of chemical fertiliser
prices and as bear operators covered their positions. Gujarat State
Fertilisers have gained Rs60 to Rs340 and Zuari Agro Chem are Rs90 better at
Rs390.
Turnover, which had contracted from Rs3bn a day seen in April to less than
Rs400m four months later, recovered to Rs1.72bn by last weekend as
institutions and mutual funds bought at lower levels.
The market appears to have found its level, for now. Share values moved in a
narrow range last week and the 30-share index, at 3,031 last Friday, was
around the same level as a week earlier. Yesterday the index closed at
3,040.57, down 29.92.
Mr MR Mayya, executive director of the BSE, says the market is healthier
now. Selling pressure has eased and the authorities have removed all
restrictions on sales. But individual investors have yet to return in force,
deterred by the forthcoming rush of rights issues, following the scrapping
of capital issues control last month.
Some Rs50bn worth of rights issues are scheduled over the next two months.
Analysts say, however, that strong fundamentals and the government measures
should lift share prices further over the next three weeks. Furthermore, the
monsoon rains have been evenly spread throughout the country, improving crop
prospects.
The question is whether police and income tax authority raids on brokers and
finance companies associated with the securities scandal will hamper the
market's recovery. A parliamentary committee was set up two weeks ago to
inquire into the scandal and the police and income tax authorities may have
to co-ordinate with it in the future.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures squeezed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BEAR trap was sprung in the sterling futures market yesterday. Traders who
had been persistent sellers of futures contracts in the expectation of
higher UK base rates were caught out by glimmers of returning confidence,
triggered by the  1/2 pfennig strengthening of the pound against the D-Mark
to DM2.7875.
Meanwhile, in the cash market the Bank of England's large offer of
assistance was coolly received as easier interbank rates, especially
short-term rates, discouraged the clearing banks.
Sterling futures saw unusually high turnover yesterday, with December
trading more than 30,000 contracts by the official close. The squeeze began
around midday with the publication of opinion polls indicating the
possibility of a 'Yes' vote in the September 20 French referendum on
Maastricht.
There was a rush to buy short sterling, and the December contract leapt from
89.16 to 89.46, an abnormally wide spread of 30 basis points. That indicates
slightly lower expectations that base rates, now 10 per cent, will rise in
the near future. The key three-month interbank rate, a good guide to market
thinking about the direction of base rates, eased from about 10 9/16 per
cent to 10 7/16 per cent. The one-year rate also dipped slightly, from about
10 13/16 per cent to around 10 5/8 per cent.
The September contract, which expires before the French Maastricht vote, was
also heavily traded and moved up 18 basis points to 89.45.
Earlier in the day, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m,
later revised to Pounds 1bn. This was far higher than expected.
However, most banks were unprepared to take up the shortage and only Pounds
585m was provided, much of it in late assistance. Initially, the Bank bought
Pounds 56m in Band 3 bills at 9 3/4 per cent and Pounds 24m of Band 4 bills
at 9 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank purchased Pounds 130m of Band 1
bills at 9 7/8 per cent. Finally it provided late assistance of around
Pounds 375m.
One dealer said the Bank's help on Tuesday had taken the market comfortably
into surplus.
As a result, aggressive trading yesterday morning brought the overnight rate
down and left the rates offered by the Bank of England unattractive.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar reaches new low again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR touched a new low against the D-Mark for the second day running
as dealers were unprepared to support the US currency. However, the trend
was one of disinterest rather than dislike and the foreign exchange markets
were relatively quiet yesterday, writes Peter John.
Meanwhile, the pound firmed slightly against the D-Mark, with some support
being seen as it languished near to its ERM floor.
The US currency opened mildly better, but dealers said there was no reason
to buy it in spite of its relative cheapness and it continued to drift
towards new lows against the D-Mark in early European trade.
Disappointing news from the Commerce Department on new US factory orders,
shipments and unfilled orders in July had little effect. The July data had
already been superseded on Tuesday by the more significant August figures
from the US National Association of Purchasing Managers. These suggested
that the US economy is likely to remain weak in the run-up to the
Presidential election in November.
Mr Michael Feeny, a market analyst at Sumitomo Bank in London, said: 'If
anything, the economic data from the US is weaker yet again this week. Just
because they are cheap there should be no rush to buy dollars.'
Traders said customer business in dollars was very low and one argued that a
market equilibrium had been reached. He added that most serious positions
had been taken and any changes between now and the French referendum on the
Maastricht treaty on September 20 would be prompted by 'window dressing and
scare-mongering'.
The dollar hit a record low of DM1.3870 in Frankfurt. In London it closed at
DM1.3905, off 30 basis points on the day. The US unit ended at Dollars 2.004
in London against the pound (compared with Dollars 2.002 in New York the
previous night) and Y122.90 against the Japanese currency, after Y122.85 the
previous day.
In New York last night the dollar improved to DM1.3942 and the pound ended
at Dollars 1.9993.
Dealers said there were no reports of intervention from the central banks in
the wake of the concerted intervention last week.
Sterling paused for breath, with most dealers taking stock of the
announcement that the Bank of England's reserves fell by around Dollars
1.3bn last month. This indicated stronger official support for the pound
than most had anticipated, raising concern that the level of intervention in
August is unsustainable. The pound firmed  1/2 pfennig to DM2.7875 as buyers
came in at the lower levels.
The Italian lira, which is also struggling near the bottom of the ERM
ladder, saw support and held steady at L764.6 against the German currency.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush's subsidy boost lifts
Chicago wheat market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHICAGO WHEAT futures rose yesterday after President George Bush announced a
Dollars 1bn expansion of US subsidies for wheat exports. In late trading the
December contract was 5 cents ahead at 342 3/4 cents a bushel.
Mr Bush told farmers at an election rally in South Dakota that he would
offer subsidies for 30m tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program
and announced his approval of Dollars 755m of emergency disaster aid for
farmers.
The disaster aid was approved by congress nearly a year ago, and will
benefit not only Florida and Louisiana farmers hit last month by Hurricane
Andrew but those affected by frosts and floods earlier this year. It will
also cover unpaid crop loss claims from 1990 and 1991.
White House officials said the wheat export subsidies would be aimed at
winning markets in 28 countries, with China and the former Soviet republics
at the top of the list. Indeed, Russian officials were in Washington
yesterday to seek an additional Dollars 1bn in loan guarantees to buy grain,
meat, milk and other products.
Other countries targeted include South Africa, India, Yemen, Poland and
Brazil.
The expansion of the US export subsidy programme drew criticism from other
grain-exporting nations. Some officials complained that Mr Bush appeared to
be torpedoing attempts to complete the Uruguay Round of talks on revising
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has sought to eliminate
agricultural export subsidies.
'We deeply regret that domestic political pressures have overridden a US
commitment to the pursuit of a less corrupted international trading
environment for farm products,' said Mr Paul Keating, prime minister of
Australia.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kiwi fruit on menu for starving
NZ sheep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STARVING SHEEP and lambs on the South Island's Canterbury Plains have
something new on the menu: kiwi fruit.
The sheep are the survivors of freak weekend blizzards, the worst for 50
years, which blanketed much of the plains with metres of snow, and is only
now starting to thaw.
Kiwi fruit farmers in the North Island are sending 11,000 tonnes of produce
that is not considered good enough for export to the South Island as extra
feed for the sheep. The farmers have been told that the kiwi fruit will be
good for the survivors, as it contains high levels of sugar to help rebuild
their strength.
'The sheep enjoy kiwi fruit, but farmers will have to be careful to spread
them around their fields. Too many kiwi fruit at once could be harmful for a
sheep,' a government farm advisory officer said.
Hundreds of railway wagons and trucks are taking hay and silage to the South
Island farmers, many of whom face financial ruin because of the blizzards
that struck while the sheep were lambing. A Federated Farmers' official said
yesterday that despite the shipments of hay, silage and kiwi fruit, many of
the remaining stock were starving, and more was needed.
Most South Island farmers rely on sheep for their livelihood; their wool and
meat are among New Zealand's major exports. Farmers' losses from the storms
in Canterbury, the worst for 50 years, have been estimated at Dollars NZ60m
(Pounds 16m).
In the neighbouring provinces of Otago and Southland, which missed the worst
of the snowstorms, farmers also face losses put at NZDollars 50m.
Weeks of cold, wet weather have turned the region's normally lush pastures
into mud, and low temperatures have stunted grass growth.
The huge lamb losses are causing serious concerns at the effect on the
export trade to Britain over the next two seasons as it is expected many
farmers will hold back stock in an effort to rebuild their flocks.
There is also concern that South Island meat processing companies will bid
up prices for stock to keep their factories operating. Fierce competition
among processing companies for sheep last season pushed prices so high that
companies were reported to be making a loss on the stock they purchased.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia waits for Dollars 35m
mining credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Bank is to release a Dollars 35m credit to the Bolivian mining
industry over the next two weeks according to Mr Jorge P. Quiroga, the
Bolivian finance minister.
A mission from the World Bank is in Bolivia to discuss recent changes within
Comibol, the state mining corporation. These include the replacement of the
corporation's president, Mr Alberto Ono Villegas by Dr Marcelo Perez
Monasterios and the announcement of a radical redundancy programme.
Negotiations are likely to continue into next week, according to Comibol
officials.
The World Bank has been withholding the credit, Dollars 22m of which was
earmarked for the restructuring of Comibol, until the corporation speeded up
the joint venture process and slimmed down its bureaucracy. As far as
Comibol's long term prospects are concerned, Bolivian planning minister Mr
Samuel Doria Medina says he believes the country's constitution will be
changed within the next year to allow the corporation's full privatisation.
However, a more immediate stumbling block to the release of the World Bank
credit is the decision by Comibol this week to reject a joint venture deal
with Minera Tiwanacu concerning the Bolivar mine.
The deal was widely expected to be finalised by the end of this month. In
rejecting the deal, Bolivian mining minister Mr Alvaro Rejas said Tiwanacu's
plan to build a concentrate plant at nearby Poopo, rather than on the site
of the Bolivar mine, was 'unsuitable'.
Industry representative say, however, that the Tiwanacu deal was turned down
because of parliamentary pressure on Comibol's board and discrepancies in
Tiwanacu's bid.
In addition, the original contract specifications sent out by Comibol were
widely condemned as too imprecise. Tiwanacu is the third company to have
attempted a joint venture deal for the Bolivar mine. New invitations to
tender for the mine have been issued.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CANADIAN company indirectly controlled by Metallgesellschaft of Germany
has quietly become a leader in the world methanol market.
Methanol demand is expected to grow deeply this decade, especially in north
America, since it is a base material for cleaner transport fuels.
Methanex, based in Calgary and controlled through the German multinational's
US arm, last year bought a new methanol plant in British Columbia from
Ocelot Industries.
Now, in agreements totalling USDollars 222m, it will become one of the
world's top four methanol producers in partnership with Germany's Hoechst
and American Cyanamid, with 1.4m tonnes production capacity and the
marketing of another 1.6 tonnes. All Metallgesellschaft's worldwide methanol
business will come under Methanex in Calgary. The main market will be the US
because of the Clean Air Act's rising standards. Methanol is made from
natural gas and is a key component of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether).
MTBE, when added to petrol, reduces carbon monoxide emissions.
Methanex will contribute USDollars 70m to restart an idle Hoechst methanol
plant in Texas in return for a 49 per cent ownership stake. Production of
600,000 tonnes yearly will be shared by the partners.
Also Methanex puts up USDollars 97m to convert a Cyanamid ammonia plant at
New Orleans to methanol, for a 70 per cent ownership stake.

<TEXT>
Mr GHOLAMREZA Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, promised this week that
Iran would provide routes to the oil market for the newly independent
republics of central Asia and the Caucasus.
He told energy officials and experts gathered in Tehran for a two-day
conference on Energy Co-operation in Central Asia and the Caucasus that Iran
was ready to put its experience and expertise at their disposal.
Iran's strategic position means it can offer these republics a cheap and
direct route for their oil and gas on to the European market. Experts at the
conference predicted, however, that it would be at least ten years before
the necessary infrastructure was in place.
Mr Abbas Maleki, Iran's deputy foreign minister for science and research,
said: 'The republics of central Asia and the Caucasus, despite having vast
energy resources, suffer from a lack of energy. They cannot even meet their
own needs, because they do not have the technology to exploit the large oil,

The oil-rich states of central Asia and the Caucasus - Kazakhstan,

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Light thrown on gold mystery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY Fund statistics just released throw fresh light on
the mystery of how Belgium's central bank earlier this year disposed of 202
tonnes of gold from its reserves - equivalent to 11 per cent of annual
output from all the western world's gold mines.
It appears that the Bank of International Settlements, commonly known as the
'central bankers' banker,' helped Belgium sell the gold through the market
over a period of time.
The Belgian gold sale, revealed in June, raised fears that other central
banks might follow suit, with a potentially devastating impact on the gold
price.
One senior bullion dealer said yesterday of the new evidence provided by the
IMF: 'You could choose to view the sales as bullish, as the market appears
to have absorbed the gold. Or it could be the nudging open of the central
bank flood gates, which would be overwhelmingly bearish'.
An analysis of the latest IMF figures by Reuter appears to support the
theory that central banks are gradually selling down their gold holdings. It
shows that central bank gold reserves have fallen to their lowest level
since at least 1961. At the end of June reserves stood at 35,344 tonnes.
However, some dealers pointed out that the statistics provide only a
'snapshot' of the situation at a particular moment and that the IMF figures
could not be wholly reliable because the fund took reports from its members
on trust. 'The IMF misses a lot,' said one trader.
Nevertheless, the IMF data gives a clear picture of the Belgian gold sale
via the BIS. In the space of one month - between April and May - there was
an unprecedented fall of 133 tonnes in the BIS gold reserves. There was a
smaller, 27-tonne, drop between March and April, a month when the gold price
was 'fixed' in London at a six-year low of Dollars 334.75 an ounce.
BIS gold stocks, which fell to a record low level of only 43 tonnes in May,
rebounded to 220 tonnes in June.
Meanwhile, Belgian gold reserves fell by 202 tonnes between May and June.
There was no corresponding rise in the reserves of other central banks,
indicating that the sales had mostly been absorbed into the market rather
than taken on to another bank's books.
Dealers said all this suggested that Belgium had given the BIS early warning
that it wanted to sell its gold and that the BIS had dribbled the metal
through the market over a period of time which it was still impossible to
estimate. Once the gold had been sold, the BIS topped up its reserves with
the Belgian gold.
As for the implications for the gold price, Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union
Bank of Switzerland, said last night: 'This is cold coffee because the
market reacted to the Belgian announcement in June by going better. There is
nothing in the IMF statistics to produce an immediate price reaction. But
the market will still want to cogitate about the longer-term
considerations.'
Central Bank holdings are still equivalent to about 12.5 years' gold demand.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC fish deficit widens as
demand increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community is becoming less self-sufficient in fish and
shellfish at a time of rising consumption, according to a report from Frost
&amp; Sullivan, the international market research organisation.
Landings of fish for human consumption are forecast to rise from 3.96m
tonnes in 1990 to 4.18m tonnes in 1996 after touching a low of 3.95m tonnes
this year. This compares with consumption of 4.94m tonnes in 1990, rising to
5.32m tonnes in 1996.
The retail value of the EC fish market is expected to reach Dollars 22.4bn
in 1996, compared with Dollars 20.8bn in 1990.
Shellfish landings totalled only 1.33m tonnes in 1990 out of a total world
catch of 98m tonnes. EC landings are expected to rise to 1.52m tonnes in
1996, when consumption is expected to be 2.35m tonnes, up from 1990's 1.92m
tonnes.
Fish farming is expected to be supplying the market with 372,000 tonnes of
fish and 760,000 tonnes of shellfish in 1996, compared with 263,000 tonnes
and 656,000 tonnes respectively in 1990.
Until 1988 the EC was self-sufficient in fish and shellfish. The report
points out that it can still be argued that the EC lands enough fish to
support itself, as only 65 per cent of the total 1990 catch of 10.6m tonnes
in 1990 went for human consumption.
The report suggests that as supplies of common varieties such as cod,
herring and mackerel fail to meet demand, consumers are being forced to eat
less common varieties which would previously have gone for processing into
fish meal and other industrial purposes.
'The EC figures, as a percentage of the world catch, are disturbing,' says
the report. 'This is not just because they are low, but because the trend
has remained negative despite aquaculture progress.'

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wool is selling very well in Australia at firm prices. Clearances are over
90pc and this is in a week when offerings are high. Holidays are now
virtually finished and this could be helping to keep up demand. The currency
situation is of importance all around the world. Wool priced in the US or
the closely associated Australian dollar is firm in price and historically
not very cheap. In terms of sterling and European currencies it has been
easing and is cheap - getting quite close to the low points registered last
season. Apart from currency volatility, and the short-term outlook for it,
recession is keeping the wool trade subdued.

GOLD closed around the day's lows on the London bullion market. The recent
failure of two attempts to breach resistance around Dollars 343 a troy ounce
prompted a test of the downside. The market failed to derive much support
from the continued weakness of the dollar. Comex gold futures were lower at
midday on selling linked to the market's weak technical position and general
lack of investor demand. London COCOA, supported by a firmer New York
market, edged back into the plus column in the afternoon in a mild
correction to Tuesday's sharp fall, while robusta COFFEE also extended gains
as New York's December arabica contract broke through key resistance at
55.70 cents a lb in early trading. The New York gains were on technically
driven fund and commission house buying, but analysts said coffee's
downtrend was still intact. On the LME, most BASE METALS, apart from nickel,
spent the day in narrow trading ranges. Bargain hunting purchases on dips,
particularly due to the weaker dollar, were met by hedge selling on rallies.
But the pace of trading was slow and markets were thin. NICKEL broke below
the bottom end of its recent trading range.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand growth forecast for
copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER DEMAND is almost wholly insensitive to price because nearly all of
the metal's uses are determined by technical rather than economic
considerations, says the Commodities Research Unit consultancy group in a
report today.
Its analysis shows that copper gained markets in the late 1980s when metal's
price was relatively high.
The report concludes that the copper industry can look forward to 'years of
sustained demand growth, capacity constraints and profitable mining'.
Copper's price must remain above 90 cents a lb in the long term as this is
the level that will encourage mining companies to go ahead with projects at
present under consideration, the CRU suggests.
It claims the study breaks new ground by presenting data and analysing
copper consumption by end-use sector in the developing countries, as had
previously been done for the developed world. The report provides guidance
for copper fabricators as well as mining companies preparing their
strategies for the next decade.
Copper's growth prospects are underpinned by the developing countries of
south east Asia, India, China and Latin America, according to the report.
Although these areas account for only 18 per cent of western world copper
consumption at present, more than 60 per cent of the expected increase in
demand will come from them in future.
Refined copper consumption in these areas will grow at nearly 5 per cent a
year in the period to 2005, suggests the CRU, whereas growth will be only 1
per cent in the developed world and 2.1 per cent for the western world as a
whole.

SEAGRAM, one of the top four drinks groups, says its policy of concentrating
on higher-margin premium brands is being reflected in higher profits.
For the second quarter ended July 31 sales of spirits, wines and other
beverages gained 2 per cent to USDollars 1.41bn, more than making up for the
sale of several North American spirits brands in 1991.
Operating income was Dollars 160m, against Dollars 120m. After including
Dollars 72m in dividends from its 25 per cent interest in EI du Pont de
Nemours (Dollars 69m a year earlier), and Dollars 33m equity in unremitted
du Pont earnings, compared with Dollars 61m, Seagram's final net profit was
Dollars 152m, or 41 cents a share, against Dollars 149m, or 23 cents, a year
earlier.
First-half final net profit was Dollars 319m, or 85 cents, down from Dollars
337m, or 89 cents, a year earlier, because of lower equity in du Pont's
earnings. Sales were Dollars 2.65bn, against Dollars 2.78bn.
In June, Seagram increased its 49 per cent interest in a Venezuelan
distiller and a Venezuelan distributor to 100 per cent. This was in line
with its policy of developing premium brands worldwide.
Metall Mining, a fast-growing Canadian resource holding company controlled
by Germany's Metallgesellschaft, earned CDollars 3.87m (USDollars 3.25m), or
8 cents a share, in the first half, against a loss of CDollars 2.5m, or 6
cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 106m against CDollars 84.4m.

<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer company, and Canon, the Japanese office equipment and
camera maker, have joined forces to develop compact personal computers.
The aim of the project is to build portable and small desktop machines that
incorporate a small printer using Canon's bubble-jet technology.
Initially, Canon is to make the computer in Japan for sale under its own
name, and will supply the product to IBM on an original equipment
manufacturer basis. It is to be based on the PS/55 computer made by IBM
Japan and will be available in the 'near future'.
Canon Sales, a subsidiary of Canon, markets IBM computers in Japan. Canon
also supplies bubble-jet printers to IBM on an OEM basis.
The two also plan to develop ties in the field of multi-media devices, which
combine audio, video, computer, or communication functions.
For IBM, the collaboration is the latest in a series of co-operative
arrangements with Japanese companies as part of its new strategy, following
a restructuring last year. IBM is developing flash memory devices -
semiconductor chips which retain memory after power is turned off - jointly
with Toshiba. IBM has also joined forces with Toshiba and Siemens of Germany
to develop technology for the 256 megabit dynamic random access memory chip.
Hitachi and IBM recently agreed to co-operate on printing technology.
IBM is expected to announce today that it is restructuring its personal
computer business, the precursor to a new PC product line to be announced
later this month, analysts said, Reuter reports. A spokesman said IBM would
make an announcement today, but declined to provide details.
The restructuring will turn IBM's PC hardware business into a separate
independent unit responsible for the sales, marketing and distribution of
its products in addition to the development and manufacturing it now
controls.

TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and Asahi Chemical Industry, the
leading synthetic fibre maker, yesterday agreed to establish a joint venture
company to develop, manufacture and market rechargeable batteries for
portable electronic equipment, writes Steven Butler.
The companies are to manufacture lithium ion rechargeable batteries, which,
they claim, are light, small and environmentally friendly.
Power supply for electronic devices is becoming the bottleneck that limits
portability or use time for items such as notebook computers or cellular
telephones. The companies say lithium ion batteries provide twice the
capacity of nickel cadmium batteries.
The venture is to be called A&amp;T Battery. Sample shipment and marketing will
begin next month, while mass production will start in October next year with
a monthly production volume of 500,000 batteries.
Sales of Y30bn (Dollars 244m) are targeted for 1997.

plant in France

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYODA Machine Works, the Toyota Motor affiliate, plans to close a French
machine tool plant once viewed as the company's strategic foothold in the
European market.
The closure, planned for next year, is a sign of the general restructuring
of Japan's manufacturing industry, which is attempting to reduce capacity
and is being forced to review foreign investments made during the 1980s.
Ernault-Toyoda Automation (ETA), based in Cholot, near Nantes, has been
making automatic lathes and machining centres, but Toyoda Machine said
yesterday the manufacturing operations are likely to cease and ETA will
become a sales and service company for imported machine tools.
Toyoda Machine reported a consolidated net loss of Y4.8bn last year, and
blamed its poor performance on the downturn in Japan's domestic economy and
troubled markets in Europe and the US. The company was forced to set aside
Y3.8bn to cover losses at ETA, and has forecast a group loss of Y2.5bn
(Dollars 20m) for the current year to the end of March.
The Japanese machine tool maker has closed a US plant and announced early
last year that ETA's workforce, now at 200, would be halved. Its attempts to
salvage foreign manufacturing bases were undermined by the sharp fall in
capital spending at home, as the industry last fiscal year reported a 24 per
cent fall in new orders.
Several Japanese manufacturers are known to be reviewing overseas
investments that appeared to be wise strategic purchases during the 1980s,
but which have since become a burden to a faltering parent company.
Meanwhile, other manufacturers are trimming product lines and revising
longer-term expansion plans.
Toyoda Machine took a stake in Ernault, a French machine tool maker looking
for an infusion of cash and technology, during the early 1980s.
Ernault-Toyoda Automation became a Toyoda Machine subsidiary and the
Japanese parent has continued to pump fresh funds into the ailing company.

merger with PWA
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CANADA has presented a new merger proposal to PWA, holding company of
Canadian Airlines International, which aims to overcome objections to
earlier plans for the creation of a single national airline.
The proposal is the latest move in a battle for survival between the two
Canadian carriers, both of which are suffering heavy losses.
Air Canada is anxious to thwart moves by Calgary-based PWA to revive plans
for an alliance with American Airlines. At the same time, the Montreal-based
carrier is taking steps to forge its own international links.
Last week, it announced an offer with a group of Texas investors to buy
Continental Airlines of the US, which is operating under bankruptcy
protection. Air Canada's latest proposal to PWA seeks to answer fears that a
new monopoly carrier would be dominated by Air Canada and would result in
massive job losses.
Under the revised version, the two groups would set up a joint holding
company but would continue to be managed separately by chief operating
officers in Calgary and Montreal. Domestic and international routes would be
rationalised to minimise competition.
Shareholders in each airline would receive one share in the new holding
company for each share presently held.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada chief executive, said the offer 'is viewed as a
partnership to build a strong Canadian carrier for the future, and not as an
Air Canada takeover'.
PWA has made no secret of its distaste for any deal with Air Canada. Earlier
this week, it asked a court to declare insolvent the computerised
reservation system which it shares with Air Canada. The move is widely
interpreted as an effort to link Canadian Airlines to the Sabre network
owned by American Airlines.

ADollars 200m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the Australian transport group, has suffered its second consecutive
annual loss of nearly ADollars 200m (USDollars 143m), but claimed that two
years of restructuring had put it in 'a strong position to return to
profitability'.
The results, issued yesterday amid stock market confusion over the timing of
the announcement, showed TNT lost a net ADollars 195m after abnormal items
on an equity accounted basis in 1991-92, against ADollars 199m last time.
The worse-than-expected result, together with the decision to maintain
maximum liquidity by passing the dividend, pushed the shares down three
cents to ADollars 1.24.
Equity accounted net operating losses increased from ADollars 61m to
ADollars 100m, partly because of reorganisation and redundancy costs of
ADollars 33m.
The operating loss increased in spite of a fall in net interest expense from
ADollars 167m to ADollars 110m, reflecting lower interest rates and a
reduction in debt to ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 2.4bn.
TNT said the bottom line loss was struck after net abnormal losses of
ADollars 95m, including ADollars 35m against the start-up costs of GD
Express Worldwide, a joint venture with European and North American post
offices.
However, TNT made a net profit of ADollars 4.5m on a consolidated basis,
which excludes the group's investments in associated companies, compared
with a net loss of ADollars 15m the previous year.
The group's share of losses from Ansett Transport Industries, the Australian
airline business jointly owned with News Corporation, declined to ADollars
66m from ADollars 102m.
Analysts said the result suggested that Ansett was recovering from the
effects of recession and a price war which followed deregulation of domestic
aviation in 1990. However, airline competition is likely to strengthen again
following the launch of a new domestic airline this month.
TNT said losses on its 50 per cent investment in the Eastwest regional
airline group rose from ADollars 21m to ADollars 71m, including an abnormal
loss of ADollars 36m to write off goodwill.
The group said Eastwest was expected to achieve 'a significant improvement'
in earnings in the current year.
Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS), an aircraft leasing group jointly
owned with News Corporation, contributed ADollars 1m to equity accounted
profits, compared to ADollars 2.4m in the previous year.
Revenue declined to ADollars 3.6m from ADollars 4.8m on a consolidated
basis, and from ADollars 6.6m to ADollars 6m on an equity accounted basis.

THE decision by Anglovaal mining house not to develop the Sun gold prospect
has effectively put the seal on the development of any new gold mines in the
country until the investment climate improves dramatically.
The high hopes Anglovaal held out for the mine, near Bothaville in the
Orange Free State, are reflected in the R143m (Dollars 51.60m) it was
prepared to spend over 11 years drilling the area.
Anglovaal said that while the results of the completed drilling programme
were encouraging, 'non-geological factors' - the gold price, exchange rate
and political developments - were 'too uncertain to justify major capital
expenditure on this valuable asset at present'.
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments has still to decide whether to proceed
with its South Deep project.

32m charge

<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining group 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK,
yesterday said equity accounted net profit fell by 6.8 per cent to ADollars
128m (USDollars 91.4m) in the first half to the end of June, on turnover up
9.2 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn.
However, CRA said net profit would have increased by 16.2 per cent but for a
ADollars 32m charge against earnings required to correct a reduction in the
surplus on the staff superannuation fund.
The group also revealed the Australian Securities Commission has queried the
accounting treatment of several asset write-downs included in a ADollars
384m extraordinary loss in the year to the end of December.
The treatment of the write-downs as extraordinary rather than abnormal items
allowed the group to declare a net profit for last year of ADollars 350m,
rather than a net loss of ADollars 34m. The group said it was too soon to
say whether the 1991 accounts would have to be restated.
The board declared a fully franked interim dividend of 15 cents a share,
against 10 cents the previous year. The shares closed 40 cents lower at
ADollars 12.24.

credit card market
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ELECTRIC, the US conglomerate, yesterday unveiled plans to enter the
highly competitive US credit card market.
GE Capital, the group's financial subsidiary, said it was launching a credit
card, linked to the MasterCard system, that would also offer discounts to
consumers through a partnership with a broad range of leading US retailers,
hotels and airlines.
While the card will have all the features of MasterCard, including
acceptance at 10m locations around the world, GE Capital said its
distinction lay in offering annual savings of up to Dollars 1,000.
The GE Rewards MasterCard, as it is being called, offers Dollars 10 of
vouchers for every Dollars 500 of purchases.
In addition, participating retailers will offer savings certificates good
for a Dollars 10 discount every three months.
Cardholders are also to be offered rebates if they use the GE card to sign
up for services, such as the Sprint long-distance telephone network or cable
television services such as HBO and Cinemax.
Discounts will also be available if the card is used to buy GE appliances.
GE, whose activities cover the manufacturing, financial services, media and
technology sectors, may have picked an awkward moment to launch its new
card, which will carry an annual Dollars 25 fee. Consumer spending has been
depressed for many months and credit card delinquencies have been running at
high levels.
Mr Gary Wendt, chairman of GE Capital, said the card was designed to address
the US consumer's shift 'from conspicuous consumption to prudent
purchasing'.
Mr David Nissen, chairman of GE Capital's consumer financial services
division, added that 'this is a huge market and we believe our card is
unique as a value-backed product'.
GE Capital's activities in the credit card market to date involve the
company's handling of marketing, issuing on behalf of third parties,
collections and customer services. The company says it services 65m
cardholder accounts in the US, Canada and Britain.

UK government bond prices gained up to a point yesterday helped by the
relative stability of sterling in the foreign exchange markets.
In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 rose from 100 19/32 at
the opening to 101 7/16 to yield 9.51 per cent.
Dealers said volumes in the futures market were back to normal levels after
the Bank Holiday weekend, with around 25,000 contracts traded. The Liffe
gilt futures contract opened at 94.27 and climbed to 95.17 by late
afternoon.
'The pound's steadiness against the D-Mark has helped the market,' said one
dealer. The pound ended at DM2.7875, up half a pfennig on the day.
RUMOURS that the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty might be
postponed helped to boost the French government bond market.
The rumours followed a newspaper report that the constitutional court might
rule that Parliament's revision to the constitution in June, as part of the
Maastricht ratification process, was illegal.
However, by late afternoon it emerged that France's constitutional council
had rejected an appeal by conservative opponents of the Maastricht treaty,
clearing the way for the planned September 20 referendum to go ahead.
French government bonds had rallied earlier in the day on the grounds that a
postponement of the referendum would allow more time for the government to
whip up support for ratification of the treaty.
Two polls released yesterday showed a slight increase in support for the
treaty with yes votes slightly outnumbering no votes. An IPSOS poll showed
53 per cent in favour of Maastricht, the clearest swing in favour of
European union in recent opinion polls, while a BVA survey showed 51 per
cent inclined to vote yes at the referendum.
The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 opened at 9.20 per cent and
fell to 9.12 per cent by late afternoon.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German government bond market ended slightly weaker
or unchanged.
Traders noted quite heavy selling of bunds but said the market held up well,
with shorter-dated issues boosted by comments from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a
Bundesbank Council member, who said the German economy was showing signs of
diminished economic activity.
The Liffe bund futures contract reached a high of 88.00 but ended at 87.97,
against its opening of 87.96.
US TREASURY prices firmed slightly in thin trading yesterday as many
investors and dealers chose to stay on the sidelines while awaiting
tomorrow's important jobs data.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/32 at 98
19/32 , yielding 7.361 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer,
up  1/32 at 100 9/32 , to yield 4.085 per cent.
The day's main economic news was a 1.1 per cent decline in July factory
orders. The market did not react to the numbers, which were heavily
distorted by a fall in transportation orders. Excluding transportation,
factory orders actually rose by 0.9 per cent in July.
Attention remained focused on the August employment report, which will be
released tomorrow. The consensus among analysts is that the figures will
show that the labour market remains in a poor state, and there was some
renewed speculation yesterday that the Fed could cut interest rates again if
the jobs numbers are very bad - even with a weak dollar.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day mixed with long-dated issues closing
firmer while medium-dated bonds slipped.
The rise in rates on three-month certificates of deposit - from 3.82 per
cent to as high as 3.91 per cent - in the Tokyo trading session pulled bond
prices down, dealers said. However, traders reported good demand for 10-year
bonds later in the day, and the new benchmark - the No 145 - closed higher,
with the yield moving from 5.04 per cent at the opening to 4.975 per cent at
the end of trading.
The constituents of the Government Secs. Index quoted in the Financial Times
changed with effect from September 1. Now included are the Treasury 9 3/4
per cent due 2002, the Treasury 9 per cent due 2008, and the Treasury 8 3/4
per cent due 1997. No longer included are: Exchequer 13 1/2 per cent due
1992, Treasury 10 per cent due 1993, and Funding 6 per cent due 1993.

FT  03 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Dollar bloc finds favour amid French
poll unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED unease over the prospects for European bond markets ahead of the
French referendum on Maastricht later this month again shifted attention
towards the dollar bloc.
Although two polls published yesterday showed a narrow majority of French
voters in favour of ratifying the treaty, expectations of volatility in most
European markets ahead of the vote are expected to deter banks from
underwriting new issues in European currencies (except D-Marks) before the
referendum.
Three deals in US, Canadian and Australian dollars dominated market activity
yesterday, as investors trickled back to the market after the summer lull.
Toyota Credit Canada's CDollars 150m five-and-a-half year deal via Merrill
Lynch International was well received by investors keen for a change of
maturity after the recent spate of 10-year paper, despite the yield pick-up
available at the longer end of the curve.
Ten-year deals for Japan Highway and Japan's Export-Import Bank of Japan
have both widened slightly to a yield spread of 40 basis points over the
comparable Canadian government bond yield.
The Toyota deal, priced to yield 48 basis points above the comparable
government bond yield, tightened by a basis point or two by the end of the
day.
In the floating-rate note sector, Norway's Eksportfinans launched a Dollars
100m issue of 10-year FRNs with a minimum coupon of 5 1/8 per cent and a
maximum coupon of 10 per cent.
The recent deluge of so-called 'collared' paper appears to have subsided,
however. The deal was arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston.
In the Australian dollar market, the State Bank of Australia launched an
ADollars 125m 10-year deal via Hambros Bank.
A spate of new issues last month was followed by a two-week lull, broken by
yesterday's offering. The break had allowed excess paper to be mopped up,
and, with reinvestment flows from maturing bonds at high levels, the State
Bank issue was placed smoothly.
Dealers said the weakness of the Australian dollar against the D-Mark was
encouraging reinvestment by German investors, unwilling to take currency
losses.

FT  03 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: D-Mark CP sector ranks fourth
in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK commercial paper market has overtaken the sterling CP market to
become the fourth largest such market in Europe, after France, Sweden and
Spain, according to a report published this week by Moody's, the
international rating agency. It has achieved this only a year and a half
after its inception.
However, the report warns that the delay in removing restrictions on German
money-market funds is restricting the growth rate of the DM17bn market, by
limiting the potential investor base. The level of issuance tailed off in
the second quarter of the year.
'In other countries, CP markets have been driven by the existence of pure
money market funds, which are not yet authorised in Germany,' said Mr
Michael Buneman, one of the authors of the Moody's report.
In the meantime, the bulk of D-Mark commercial paper has been placed with
domestic or Luxembourg-based mutual funds (which are allowed to hold a
proportion, but not all, of their assets in short-term paper) and domestic
insurance companies.
Moody's estimates that mutual funds hold around 30-40 per cent of current
outstandings while insurance companies have a 25-30 per cent share of the
market.
Other investors include companies, central banks and domestic banks.
Corporates are estimated to account for a 20-25 per cent share, which has
fallen since the early stages of the market, and is likely to decrease
further.
There are still relatively few foreign investors apart from central banks.
However, the liberalisation of Bundesbank rules on D-Mark issuance, which
came into effect on August 1, is expected to boost the proportion of foreign
issuers.
The new rules allow foreign non-bank issuers direct access to the market
rather than using a German subsidiary.

<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF net profits at Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch
banking and insurance company, improved by 7.2 per cent to Fl 758m (Dollars
460m) on turnover up 3.6 per cent to Fl 23.9bn.
In spite of higher personnel costs, ING held the overall increase in
expenditure to 3.4 per cent and pre-tax profit climbed 6.9 per cent to Fl
1.02bn.
On the insurance side, total premium income advanced by 5.5 per cent to Fl
9.9bn, with the strongest increase coming in the life insurance activities,
which generated half the total income. Growth was strong on the North
American and Australian markets and generally stagnant in Holland.
The combined pre-tax result of the insurance operation was Fl 495m, an
increase of 3.7 per cent against the same period in 1991.
Profit fell in the re-insurance business. On Tuesday, ING announced plans to
stop writing new business in its loss-making UK-based Orion subsidiary,
which specialises in marine and aviation on the London market. Profit in
non-life insurance was ahead.
On the banking side, a continued strong growth in international lending
pushed pre-tax banking profit up 10.4 per cent to Fl 550m.
The total loan portfolio climbed 4.6 per cent to Fl 132.3bn. Domestic
corporate and personal lending was stagnant. Overall group income from
lending and investments was up 1.8 per cent to Fl 12.9bn, while commission
and other income rose 7.7 per cent to Fl 1.07bn.
ING has declared an interim dividend of Fl 1.55 per share.

ITALY'S Benetton family, which controls the Italian clothing group of the
same name, is reorganising its sports equipment sector, built up over the
past three years through a series of takeovers.
The acquisitions, which include Prince, the US tennis racquet maker, have
been held by Edizione Holding, the Benetton's private family holding
company.
Under the reorganisation, a new holding company, Benetton Sportsystem, is
being created to control all the family's sports equipment activities.
*****
J. Lauritzen, the Danish shipping and shipbuilding group, announced pre-tax
profits for the first six months of 1992 of DKr157m (Dollars 29m), compared
with DKr118m for the same period last year. Profit after tax and minorities
was DKr111m after the first half of 1991's DKr77m, writes our Copenhagen
correspondent.
The company expected a poorer result for the whole of 1992 than the DKr588m
pre-tax profit it posted in 1991.
The company said its first-half result was acceptable. However, shipbuilding
at its two Danish yards had been disappointing.
Lauritzen reported DKr6.85bn group sales for the first half of 1992,
compared with DKr6.47bn for the same period last year.

Banco Exterior, a state-controlled enterprise and one of Spain's leading
financial institutions, raised its first-half consolidated net profits by 16
per cent to Pta16.2bn (Dollars 178.9m), writes Tom Burns.
The bank, which is an important player in the public sector and has
frequently been cited as a possible candidate for partial privatisation,
raised its consolidated operating profit by 3.3 per cent to Pta39.8bn and
its cash flow by 15 per cent to Pta58.2bn.

<TEXT>
SARRIO, the Spanish cardboard manufacturer controlled by Italy's Saffa
group, has paid Pta8bn (Dollars 88m) to acquire 76 per cent of Papirnica
Kolicevo, the leading producer of stucco cardboard in Slovenia.
The takeover, which marks one of the largest disposals to date by Slovenia's
privatisation agency, lifts Sarrio's annual output of cardboard to more than
800,000 tonnes making it western Europe's second largest manufacturer after
Austria's Meir Menholf and ahead of the Swedish Stora-Fedmulhe group.
Under the terms of the acquisition 24 per cent of Papirnica Kolicevo, which
had a turnover of Pta5.2bn last year, will be held by Slovenia's development
agency and Pta3.4bn of the purchase price will be allocated to improving the
plant's productivity. Sarrio said that in the mid-term Papirnica Kolicevo's
present output of 100,000 tonnes, 50 per cent of which is exported to the
European Community, would be increased to 180,000 tonnes.
The takeover represents the biggest investment to date by a Spanish company
in eastern Europe and is funded by a Pta9.4bn convertible bond issue last
year and by Sarrio's cash flow.
The bond is also financing a Pta3.5bn investment programme in the company's
two plants in Spain.
Sarrio was merged in 1990 with Italy's Cartiere Saffa, a cardboard producer
with three units in Italy owned by the Saffa group, and the business was
headquartered in Spain because, with fund raising for future investments in
mind, the Spanish markets were preferred to the Italian ones.

FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Elkem seeks delay on NKr270m
repayment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, is seeking permission
from the industry ministry to delay repayment of a NKr270m (Dollars 46.8m)
state loan which is due mid-1993.
The loan financed Elkem's acquisition two years ago of a stake in former
state-owned Norsk Jern Holding, which controls steel production and
distribution companies.
The company said yesterday that the request was not prompted by the
deepening crisis for Norway's short-term commercial paper market. Elkem's A
shares closed 16.7 per cent down at NKr30 and free shares plunged 20 per
cent to NKr30 on the news.
The company's other loans are being serviced in accordance with stated
agreements.
Norway's NKr16.5bn short-term commercial paper loan market, called
certificates domestically, is suffering from a liquidity squeeze after UNI
Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer, last week collapsed into the
hands of state administrators when its holding company could not repay an
estimated NKr3.6bn in short-term debt.
This week, Investa A/S, a Bergen-based investment company, won court
protection from creditors after failing to remit on certificate loans of an
estimated NKr2.8bn.
The certificate market is jittery over NKr4.3bn worth of debt due for
payment this month.
The central bank yesterday reiterated that it would provide liquidity to
loans to companies in situations where their funding deteriorates for
reasons not connected directly to them.
'Elkem is not dependent on the certificate market, but has the main bulk of
its financing through the bond market, banks and syndicated loan
facilities,' it said.
The company added that it was not affected by the conditions that caused
problems for UNI Storebrand and Investa. State administrators of Uni said
yesterday that it was investigating whether NKr358m in short-term loans were
illegally secured by the company based on information of its financial
situation the week before it collapsed.
Elkem said that it had total net interest-bearing debt of an estimated
NKr3.9bn.
Elkem added that it was seeking to delay repayment of the loan because Norsk
Jern had not performed up to expectations.
The company is planning further staff reductions at domestic aluminium and
ferrosilicon plants, to be announced at the end of this month. Elkem today
will also announce plans to reduce domestic ferrosilicon production by
10,000 tonnes out of annual capacity of more than 200,000 tonnes.

FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Canadian bank hit by O&amp;Y loans
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, suffered
a 57 per cent plunge in third-quarter income largely due to further
write-downs on its loans to ailing property developer Olympia &amp; York.
RBC has classified its entire CDollars 766m (USDollars 643.6m) exposure to
O&amp;Y as non-performing. The company said yesterday a significant, but not the
entire, amount would be written off as a charge against income.
More than a third of RBC's exposure is in the form of participation in a
jumbo loan secured by O&amp;Y's shares in Abitibi-Price, newsprint maker, and
Gulf Canada Resources, energy producer.
The O&amp;Y losses have been partly instrumental in Royal more than doubling its
estimate of specific loan losses for fiscal 1992 to CDollars 1.45bn, from
CDollars 705m last year.
The company said the rest of the increase was due mainly to difficulties at
Central Capital, a troubled Canadian financial institution, and to other
real estate borrowers in the Toronto area.
Recoveries of earlier provisions for Third World loans would however, reduce
the losses charged against income to CDollars 1.15bn for 1992, versus
CDollars 605m last year.
Net earnings slid to CDollars 112.4m, or 26 cents a share, in the three
months to July 31, from CDollars 261.3m, or 77 cents, a year earlier.
Loan-loss provisions for the quarter soared to CDollars 390m from CDollars
155m, but were partly offset by wider domestic interest rate margins and by
a strong contribution from RBC Dominion Securities, the bank's securities
dealer subsidiary. Dominion Securities earned almost CDollars 25m in the
third quarter.
The return on equity tumbled to 5 per cent from 16.1 per cent, and return on
assets was down to 0.33 per cent from 0.80 per cent. Total assets stood at
CDollars 139.5bn on July 31, up from CDollars 130.2bn a year earlier.
Total non-performing loans, excluding Third World debt, have jumped in the
past year to CDollars 2.85bn from CDollars 1.79bn.
In spite of its loan problems, RBC maintains a strong capital position. Its
ratio of total capital to assets was 9.5 per cent on July 31, or 10.3 per
cent if measured by US regulatory definitions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, Sweden's loss-making state-owned bank, yesterday appointed a new
chairman. Mr Jacob Palmstierna, the current deputy, will take over from Mr
Bjorn Wahlstrom who has is leaving the bank.
Mr Palmstierna will work closely with the bank's chief executive Mr Hans
Dahlborg who remains in his post.
Mr Palmstierna said that the restructuring of Nordbanken should pave the way
for its privatisation. At the beginning of next year around SKr60bn (Dollars
11.2bn) of its risk-related loans and debts will be removed from its balance
sheet and placed in a new state-owned company called Securum. The bank has a
loan portfolio of SKr250bn.
However, the disappearance of the worst credit loss problems from the bank
will enable it to concentrate on becoming more domestically based, to appeal
more strongly to private customers, the public sector and small and
medium-sized companies.
Mr Palmstierna said the bank would not be ripe for privatising in 1993 and
it would need 'five to six quarters of profitable operations' before it
could be considered to have returned to viability.
In the first four months of the year it made an operating loss of SKr1.970bn
following a deficit of SKr5.8bn in 1991.
The bank has received SKr20bn of Swedish taxpayers' money to help it stem
the flow of losses due to bad loans in real estate speculation.
The bank plans to cut its 6,500 staff by 1,400 over the next 18 months. Its
cost-saving measures are designed to ensure it maintains strong capital
ratios.
Mr Palmstierna, when chief executive of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
Sweden's largest commercial bank, where he had spent his banking career, was
charged with tax evasion.
Although cleared of the charge, he was forced to resign from SEB.

<TEXT>
COMMERZBANK said that it had decided to postpone its planned rights issue
from this month because of the weak state of the German stock market.
The bank had planned to raise up to DM600m (Dollars 428m), assuming a price
of around DM200 a share. The shares closed at DM218 compared with a year's
high of DM274.
The bank did not say when it was likely to make the issue - it actually has
shareholder's approval to issue 8m new shares, but is expected to limit the
rights issue to around 3m - which could now occur at the end of this year or
in 1993, depending on the state of the market.
Mr Friedrich von Metzler, a partner in the Metzler private bank, is
resigning as chairman of the Frankfurt stock exchange to pave the way for a
successor from one of the big German banks as part of the restructuring of
the German bourse system.
With the setting up of Deutsche Borse AG to run Germany's eight stock
markets on a more centralised basis, Mr Metzler said the position should be
held by a market participant represented on all of the bourses. He proposed
that Mr Rolf Breuer, a director of Deutsche Bank, be elected next January as
chairman of both the Frankfurt stock exchange and the supervisory board of
Deutsche Borse.
Mr von Metzler said the formation of Deutsche Borse would raise the
financial scene to a new level of quality, with all bourses co-operating to
modernise the German securities market. Frankfurt is by far the largest of
the eight stock markets, with Dusseldorf in second place.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARVEY NICHOLS, the Knightsbridge store now owned by Mr Dickson Poon, the
Hong Kong entrepreneur, lost Pounds 3.5m in the final 13 months of Burton
Group's ownership after taking a big stock write-down.
The escalation of losses from the previous Pounds 1.6m resulted largely from
a Pounds 2.8m write-down on stock as the new owners adopted a more
conservative accounting policy.
The report for the period to October 3 1991 also serves as completion
accounts for the Pounds 60m acquisition.
Mr Simon Gardner, Harvey Nichols' company secretary, said that historically
Burton had aggregated the value of stock held - lower of cost or net
realisable value - but Dickson Concepts had decided to produce a more
detailed breakdown of individual stock items, leading to a heavier reduction
in value.
In the first six months under new ownership, Harvey Nichols nudged into the
black, although this did reflect the half of the year which included
Christmas.
Dickson Concepts is locked in dispute with Burton regarding Harvey Nichols'
depreciation policy and a prior year adjustment contained in the company's
completion balance sheet.
The dispute has been referred to arbitrators and a decision is expected this
month, although the amount claimed is less than 2 per cent of the purchase
price.

JOHNSTON PRESS, the Edinburgh-based publishing group, plans to add to its
stable of newspaper titles south of the border with the acquisition of TR
Beckett, the Sussex-based newspaper group which publishes seven paid-for
local weekly newspapers and three free distribution titles.
Johnston, which also announced a 25 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 3.88m), has agreed to acquire a 91.85 per
cent stake in Beckett for Pounds 11.95m in cash, shares and loan notes. The
remaining Beckett shareholders will be offered the same deal, valuing the

Beckett shareholders include Emap, the UK media group with a 37.1 per cent
stake, and the Hale family with a 15.5 per cent stake. They will receive
1.08m Johnston shares, Pounds 7.75m in cash from the proceeds of a share
placement, and Pounds 1.34m in loan notes. In addition, a special dividend
of Pounds 2.25m net will be paid by Beckett to its shareholders on October
1.
Johnston plans to raise the Pounds 7.75m cash through a placement of 2.5m
shares at 310p each. The shares will be offered on the basis of one for
every 10.7932 ordinary held. The shares closed up 5p at 333p yesterday.
Beckett's main newspaper titles include the Eastbourne Herald and Worthing
Herald. Its 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.16m) on
turnover of Pounds 9.06m (Pounds 9.51m).
The newspaper group has seen both its turnover and profit decline in recent
years, a drop blamed on the recession and consequent decline in newspaper
advertising revenues.
Mr Marco Chiappelli, Johnston's finance director, said that the acquisition
fitted the company's strategy of steadily building up its newspaper and
media interests. The group already owns 61 titles including the West Sussex
County Times which was acquired shortly before the company's stock market
flotation in April 1988.
Johnston's pre-tax profits increase for the six months to end-June was
achieved on turnover up 7.7 per cent to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 31.3m).
The company's cash position continued to improve and at the end of June it
had net cash of Pounds 3.76m after taking account of all borrowings. As a
result the company lifted the interim dividend from 2p to 2.25p. Earnings
per share were 11.6p (9.4p).
Mr Fred Johnston, chairman, said the company's performance had been achieved
'through a vigorous programme of cost cutting and operational improvements.'
COMMENT
The price paid for Beckett may look a little high but Johnston has a good
track record of making newspaper acquisitions and squeezing more profits out
of them. Underpinning the interim profit increase was a 31 per cent profit
rise from its English titles, albeit from a depressed base. Beckett's recent
results have been disappointing, but Johnston is expected to cut costs and
improve margins quickly. In the longer term it may be able to combine the
production facilities for the East and West Sussex titles, generating
significant savings. Full-year pre-tax profits are forecast at about Pounds
9m for a prospective p/e of about 15. The shares are good value if Johnston
can maintain its acquisition record.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: GA strengthens capital base by Pounds 140m
pref issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident, the Perth-based composite insurer yesterday raised Pounds
140m via a placing of a cumulative irredeemable preference share issue. This
will strengthen the company's capital base and boost its solvency margin by
four points.
This marked the largest sterling denominated issue for a UK company,
according to lead managers, Hoare Govett.
GA announced last month that it was seeking permission to raise a total of
Pounds 300m in preference shares, when announcing a sharp improvement in
pre-tax profit for the first half of 1992.
The issue was priced at 2.5 percentage points over the UK government
gilt-edged stock, 9 per cent Treasury 2008.
The net dividend was fixed at 8 7/8 per cent, representing an issue yield of
11.734 per cent. Co-lead managers were Salomon Brothers International and
Henry Schroder Wagg.
Mr David Barker, a director of Hoare Govett Corporate Finance, said the
issue was 'satisfactory despite the current volatility of the markets.'
Mr Barry Holder, general manager finance, said the issue 'allows us to write
more business at a time when the market is becoming more profitable '.
Commercial Union raised Pounds 100m via a preference issue in May.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: CRH up but warns on second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRH, the international building materials group and one of Ireland's biggest
companies, yesterday provided a small ray of light in what is expected to be
a gloomy reporting season for the construction sector.
The announcement that pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 had
risen by 7 per cent from IPounds 21.1m to IPounds 22.6m (Pounds 21.4m) sent
the group's share price up to 200p at one stage before falling back to close
1p up at 197p.
Mr Tony Barry, chief executive, said that market conditions in Ireland, the
UK and parts of continental Europe, remained very difficult.
As a result group profits in the second half were likely to be lower than in
the corresponding period last year.
The UK in particular was 'a disaster area' with sales falling faster than
costs could be reduced. A further 600 jobs had been cut - a workforce of
just over 3,000 has been reduced by 1,200 during the past 18 months. A
further small number of redundancies were likely to be made in the second
half, said Mr Barry.
Turnover fell by 3 per cent to IPounds 554m (IPounds 571m).
Earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead at 6.17p (5.78p) and the interim
dividend is increased from 2.15p to 2.25p.
The company is likely to be one of the few UK-quoted building materials
groups which will be able to announce increases in both interim profits and
dividends.
The first half benefited from a lower finance charge, down almost 16 per
cent from IPounds 11.8m to IPounds 9.98m. Associate companies, mostly in the
US, contributed IPounds 553,000 compared with a loss of IPounds 1.33m last
time. This more than compensated for the reduction in trading profits to
IPounds 32m (IPounds 34.3m).
Lower first half profits from Ireland, UK and continental Europe were offset
partially by an improvement in the US where cost reduction and higher sales
helped push profits higher.
Mr Barry said that a fragile recovery in US construction appeared to have
begun led by increased expenditure on infrastructure by some states -
notably in the north-east where CRH was strong.
Building material volumes held up in Ireland despite lower construction
activity. This was due to harder times for agriculture as a result of
changing EC policies on farm subsidies.
Agriculture accounts for just under a third of all construction investment
in the country.
Sales in Spain had fallen by about 5 per cent as government expenditure had
come under pressure and construction programmes for the Barcelona Olympics
and the Seville Trade Fair had finished.
Markets in Germany, however, remained strong. Sales also held up well in the
Netherlands despite lower investment in commercial building.
COMMENT
CRH's share price, deservedly, has outperformed most UK rivals in a deeply
depressed building materials sector. The company's strengths are its wide
spread of European and US businesses combined with a healthy balance sheet.
Strong cash flow has enabled it to cut debt, which, including convertible
capital bonds, fell to 42 per cent of shareholders' funds in the first half
compared with 60 per cent a year ago. The company has not been slow to take
the axe to costs in the UK and US which should help as US construction
output improves. Recovery in the UK looks a long way off; the Netherlands
and Germany should remain relatively firm markets but Spain and Ireland
appear weak. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 58m for the year, compared with
IPounds 62.6m, put the company on a prospective p/e, fully diluted, of about
11, which would look cheap if sentiment were not flowing so much against the
sector.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind Senior's rise to Pounds
10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS formed the basis for progress at Senior Engineering Group in
the half year to June 30.
Pre-tax profits rose 14 per cent, from Pounds 8.77m to Pounds 10m, on sales
of Pounds 158m (Pounds 142m).
Mr Donald McFarlane, chairman, said: 'We have remained resilient within a
recession engulfing the engineering industry because we have a group of
businesses spread over different countries which can weather different
economic cycles.'
About 40 per cent of pre-tax profits are earned overseas.
Flexonics, a US flexible hose and expansion-joint company acquired earlier
this year and Nordklima, a German air handling manufacturer bought last
year, were mainly responsible for the profit increase. Existing businesses
reported small rises.
Mr McFarlane said construction services companies, which supply ducting and
ventilation systems to large projects, would produce good profits for the
year, although slightly down from its record increase in 1991.
The engineering products division, which makes rigid and flexible tubes, was
hit by reduced demand. Sales in some areas declined by between 15 and 18 per
cent. The group has acquired the trade and assets of Le Bas Tube, a
steel-tube stockholder, for Pounds 350,000.
Control engineering, established last year to refocus the former mining
equipment companies, continued to suffer from the contraction of the UK coal
industry.
Thermal engineering companies produced better results in the US, offsetting
reduced contributions from the UK power industry.
Mr McFarlane said: 'We will continue to expand through selective
acquisitions. Each one is planned with the precision of a rifle shot.'
Borrowings stand at Pounds 8m, representing gearing of 8 per cent.
Earnings per share, adjusted for the effects of the rights issue in
February, were 3.07p (3.02p).
The interim dividend is held at 1.2p.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: ML Holdings appoints new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronic components group,
appointed Mr Howard Grant as chief executive yesterday, more than two months
after the departure of Mr Peter Pollock, his predecessor, on the day before
the company announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.24m.
Mr Grant, 51, is currently chief executive of the rail division of BTR, the
engineering conglomerate.
From 1976 to 1986 he was group managing director of Westinghouse Brake and
Signal (Australia), controlled by Hawker Siddeley since 1979. BTR bought
Hawker last November.
Mr Grant accepted the post at ML in June, but the announcement was delayed
until the closure of a contract he was negotiating for BTR.
The reshuffle came about as the company fell into loss last year, although
Mr Pollock's departure was over 'management style (rather) than bottom line
performance', Mr Sallitt said at the time.
Mr Sallitt became chairman in March with the remit to turn the company round
by strengthening its non-military businesses.
ML Holdings' shares fell 2 1/2 p to 16p.

Templeton Galbraith &amp; Hansberger, the Bermuda-based fund manager which
agreed recently to merge with California's Franklin Resources, saw pre-tax
profits surge from Dollars 33.6m to Dollars 45.2m (Pounds 22.7m) in the
half-year to June 30.
The rise reflected increased funds under management, aided by sharply lower
US interest rates which encouraged American investors to switch out of
low-yielding cash funds into equity-based mutual fund products.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Unipart in manufacturing venture after 42%
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIPART, the manufacturer and distributor of motor vehicle components and
accessories, increased pre-tax profit by 42 per cent from Pounds 6.7m to
Pounds 9.5m in the first half of 1992.
The company is expanding its UK manufacturing operations through a joint
venture with Beans Industries, a former Rover Group engineering subsidiary,
in which it will hold an 80 per cent stake.
Advanced Engineering Systems will supply machined components such as
flywheels, axle housings and shafts to Toyota and Honda, the Japanese car
makers. The venture will create about 100 jobs in the next two to three
years.
Mr John Neill, chief executive, said the group owed much of its 'growing
strength' to its decision to invest in manufacturing in the UK.
Moves by Japanese vehicle makers to establish a growing manufacturing
presence meant that 'Britain was now one of the most attractive places in
Europe for component makers to set up operations.'
Despite 'very difficult and deeply depressed trading in the motor industry'
Unipart increased turnover in the six months to Pounds 335m (Pounds 292m).
Profit before interest rose to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 7.2m).
The company said important improvements had been made in quality and
productivity 'as a result of the new style of working, where trade unions no
longer have any influence over working practices.'
Unipart ended trade union recognition for its 4,000 workers in April. It
said that quality circles, in which employees developed their own
initiatives for improving efficiency, had saved the company more than Pounds
2m in the last 12 months.
The company, formerly part of British Leyland, is 42 per cent owned by
management and employees, 38 per cent by institutional investors and 20 per
cent by Rover.

FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hartwell increases offer for Trimoco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTWELL, the motor group owned by the Jameel family of Saudi Arabia, has
increased its cash offer for Trimoco by just over 14 per cent to Pounds
29.6m.
It also bought 3.8m shares yesterday afternoon, taking its stake to about 42
per cent. At the first closing date on Tuesday for the original Pounds 25.9m
offer, acceptances amounted to only 0.5 per cent.
Hartwell has ceased to say that its bid is only a technical one, triggered
when it converted loan stock and took its ordinary holding to 39.4 per cent.
The original mandatory offer of 17 1/2 p a share matched the target's market
price. The increased offer is 20p.
Mr John Wei, chairman and chief executive of Hartwell, said yesterday: 'This
is our reaction to the hostile defence document put out by Trimoco.'
The document said that Mr Wei and another Hartwell executive had been
invited on to Trimoco's board early this year on the basis that the Jameel
Group would reduce its stake in the company, which then stood at 23.5 per
cent.
Mr Wei said 'because of the acrimony in the response, there is uncertainty
among the staff, the customers must be worried and the manufacturers
concerned'.
Hartwell claimed that the new offer was 29.9 times Trimoco's earnings for
the 12 months to September 30. It added 0.14p for the second half of
Trimoco's last financial year to 0.53p for the first half of this year,
derived from the target's recent Pounds 1.2m profit forecast. Trimoco has
said that last year's performance was depressed by restructuring costs.
Trimoco yesterday noted the increased offers.
In its earlier defence document it pointed to its net asset value of 22p a
share and a pension fund surplus worth 6p a share.
Mr Wei questioned whether site valuations took account of the falling
property market, and added that 'it is dangerous to mix company business
with the pension fund'.
If the bid succeeds, the combined group would have 12 Ford dealerships, four
more than the maximum allowed by the manufacturer. Mr Wei said discussions
would have to continue with Ford, some of whose rules have been called into
question following a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on new car
sales in the UK.
Hartwell's offers, which are final unless another party steps in, include a
raised bid for the outstanding loan stock of Pounds 200 per Pounds 100
nominal, up from Pounds 175.
Trimoco's share price gained 1p to close at 20 1/2 p.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Vestey arm agrees refinancing with banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION INTERNATIONAL, the financially troubled trading arm of the Vestey
Group and one of the UK's largest private companies, has agreed a Pounds
300m refinancing package with its steering committee of nine banks.
The arrangement, which was also approved by an annual and extraordinary
shareholders meeting on Tuesday, has been sent for approval to the group's
other 70 banks from 25 countries.
They have been told that the fall in the value of Union's property and the
rationalisation of the Dewhurst butchers chain is likely to result in a net
write-down of the company's Pounds 176.7m net assets to less than Pounds 42m
in accounts for 1991, which are due to be published in October.
Under the terms of the refinancing package, the bankers will continue to
provide lending facilities to Union, which was in breach of its net banking
covenants, until the end of 1994.
Union has also told its bankers that it will reduce its Pounds 300m debt,
which has already fallen from a peak of Pounds 420m, through a series of
disposals and possible flotations of subsidiaries in the emerging stock
markets in South America.
In the document circulated to shareholders, the refinancing agreements
'include the provision by the Vestey family and related companies . . . of a
financial package worth up to Pounds 35m to the Union Group and its
bankers'.
Union's articles of association have been changed to allow the company to
extend its borrowing limit because of a fall in reserves.
Mr Terry Robinson, who was recruited from Lonrho, the international trading
conglomerate, earlier this year as chief executive, said: 'The group is
evolving into a food processing and distribution company. However, there are
no crown jewels and we will consider offers for most of our businesses.'
The Dewhurst butchers chain, which is being slimmed down from 1,000 retail
outlets to 600, will only become a candidate for sale if the debt reduction
programme takes longer than expected.
The company hopes to have the agreement of all its bankers by the end of
October. However, it is required to publish its accounts by October 10 which
could be qualified if the bankers' agreement remains outstanding.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO Disney, which has been beset by rumours of poor attendance since the
spring opening of its ambitious theme park outside Paris, is reshuffling its
senior management in an attempt to improve the performance of the park and
its merchandising interests.
The news of the management changes came shortly after stock market reports
of an improvement in last month's hotel occupancy rates and in the level of
attendance by French visitors at the Euro Disneyland complex.
The reports fuelled a rise in Euro Disney's shares, which have fallen
heavily over the summer, by FFr5 to FFr77 during the day. The shares were
first traded on November 7, 1989.
Euro Disney is appointing Mr Philippe Bourguignon, 44, as president
reporting to Mr Robert Fitzpatrick, who is promoted from president to
chairman.
Mr Bourguignon, a Frenchman, joined the group in 1988 from Accor, one of
France's largest hotel and leisure companies.
One of the chief criticisms of Euro Disney has been that the company has
been slow in adapting the management and marketing techniques developed by
Disney, its US parent, to the different demands of the European market.
Euro Disney said Mr Bourguignon's appointment reflected its long-term plan
to replace US executives with Europeans.
However, Euro Disney is bringing in Mr Steve Burke, 34, from the US to take
responsibility for its theme parks and merchandising as executive
vice-president.
Mr Burke worked on Disney merchandising in the US where he pioneered the
development of the Disney stores chain.
The group is also appointing Mr Sanjay Varma, 37, as president of its
resorts activities, which include the Euro Disneyland hotels.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Bowater interim profits rise 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the diversified packaging and printing business newly installed in
the FT-SE 100 index, produced a 19 per cent improvement in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 62.4m as it successfully digested recent acquisitions and
improved operating margins.
But the company warned that the outlook for the second half remained
uncertain in Europe although it expected continued improvement from its
operations in North America.
Mr Norman Ireland, chairman, said: 'It could be described as unnecessary
these days for a chairman to say that world economic conditions remain
difficult. However, that is the position that applies to Bowater's
operations.'
Group turnover from continuing businesses rose 23 per cent to Pounds 706m in
the six months to June 30 and operating profits were 31 per cent up at
Pounds 61.1m.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said the packaging market was suffering from
deflationary pricing and rising costs. But these pressures were largely
offset by partnership arrangements with long-term customers.
'If you go for quality, service and quick response then price drops down the
list of priorities. The inventory chain has now shrunk permanently, I
believe, because of technological advances,' he said.
DRG Packaging and Cope Allman Packaging, two companies bought in March for
Pounds 444m, bolstered Bowater's sales and enhanced earnings largely thanks
to cheap acquisition financing. Stripped of their contribution, Bowater's
sales grew just 2 per cent.
Profits by division were: packaging and print Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 32.8m);
coated industrial films Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.4m); building and engineering
Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 4.6m); and tissue Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 600,000).
Mr Lyon said Bowater had invested heavily at the bottom of the economic
cycle and should reap the rewards when conditions improved.
Bowater's fully diluted earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 22.3p
following its one-for-three rights issue in March. The interim dividend was
lifted 9 per cent to 9.7p. The company is proposing a share split.
Mr Lyon said Bowater would consider making 'bolt-on' acquisitions.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Creditors worry about a quick sell: When an insolvent
company's main asset is its staff, receivers are going for a speedy
management buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When creditors of Corporate Communications, the parent of Charles Barker,
the UK's oldest public relations firm, heard that the company had appointed
receivers on Thursday July 30 they were shocked.
When they heard later that same day that the principal divisions of the
company - which owed them Pounds 10m - were to be sold in two buy-outs
headed by existing directors, they were livid. They were also powerless.
Over the last few years, a new trend has accompanied the growth of 'people
businesses' - those companies, in businesses such as advertising and
marketing, in which the most valuable assets are the employees.
Insolvency practitioners called in as receivers have acted with
controversial speed in selling them to the current management.
Last month saw the high-speed transition from receivership to sale of
subsidiaries of Burns-Anderson, the recruitment and financial services
group. Within 48 hours of the receivership, Mr Dorian Marks, the finance
director of its recruitment arm, had bought 16 of the 21 recruitment offices
on behalf of a new company, Premier Employment.
Before that was the case of Babcock Prebon, the financial services company,
which called in receivers one Friday afternoon in September 1991. By the
early hours of the following Sunday a management buy-out headed by Mr Arthur
Hughes, chief executive, was in place. FKB, a large marketing services
group, went into receivership in July 1990. Yellowhammer, an advertising
agency, followed within a month. In both cases, subsidiaries were sold
within a few days.
When subsidiaries are sold to the management - as in some, but not all, of
these cases - creditors are increasingly starting to complain. They often
feel aggrieved that some of the directors running a company at the time -
and responsible, therefore, for incurring debts which cannot now be met -
are able to make a smooth transition to taking charge of its successor.
Mr Jonathan Phillips, an insolvency partner with Price Waterhouse, says:
'What a sale really comes down to is getting the best price available, not
looking at the conduct of the directors.'
He says it is only later that the role of the directors is closely examined,
during the investigations for the compulsory report the receiver must submit
to the Department of Trade and Industry on the circumstances surrounding
every corporate insolvency. He argues that creditors are more concerned with
getting their money back than raking over the directors' involvement in the
company's collapse.
A more practical question for creditors is whether such speedy sales to
existing management close off the possibility of finding alternative buyers
who might offer higher prices.
After the two management buy-outs from Corporate Communications, a number of
other public relations firms said publicly that they would have been
interested in purchasing the company. More generally, creditors and
potential purchasers often complain that sales have not been widely
advertised.
But Mr Ian Bond, a partner with Cork Gully who was joint receiver to
Corporate Communications, Babcock Prebon and Yellowhammer, stresses the
importance of rapid sales which often do not leave time to foster many
offers from third parties. 'People businesses fall apart very quickly after
a receivership,' he says. 'Speed is essential.' Clients, customers and staff
 -anxious not to be tarred by the brush of a bust company or risk losing
money - drift away, leaving the receiver with nothing of value to sell. Any
time wasted advertising for or seeking out external purchasers could only
precipitate this decline, he believes. Very often expressions of interest do
not translate into serious offers.
There will be delays while companies carry out due diligence, he says.
During the summer, with senior executives on holiday, he adds that it is
very difficult to get external potential buyers to commit quickly.
A third point is how long a delay is acceptable between the decision to
appoint receivers and the moment at which creditors are informed. Corporate
Communications, for example, has said that it passed a resolution to appoint
receivers on July 23. This was one week before most of the creditors were
informed.
During that period, the two management buy-outs were prepared, with
financial backing from Bank of Scotland, its banker, and USF&amp;G, the US
insurance group which owned 60.2 per cent of Corporate Communications.
Meanwhile, ignorant of the company's imminent receivership, other creditors
continued to do business with the company. For example, newspapers -
including the Financial Times - continued to accept advertisements from
Charles Barker, adding to their exposure to the receivership.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, says that a
big creditor will always push for a receiver at the time which suits it best
financially. Other creditors inevitably have less power and may suffer as a
consequence.
Finally, there is the question of whether the bank to a company in
receivership should be allowed to support a buy-out - a practice which Mr
Bond says is becoming more common. That allows a large existing creditor
considerable control over the pace of the receivership, the chance to
recover or reschedule substantial debts it is owed and the opportunity to
profit from the emergence of the new company.
Of course, in people businesses like these - where there are typically no
substantial fixed assets - it is likely that only a bank with detailed
knowledge of a collapsed company's finances would be willing to put together
a buy-out quickly enough to meet the receivers' need for speed.
As more and more UK companies generate revenues from intellectual effort
rather than physical products, the issue is likely to become a more presing
one - and insolvency practitioners handling such cases will have to deal
with a steady chorus of grumbling from creditors.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Volvo plans SKr2bn cost cuts at ailing truck division
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, plans further severe
cost cuts in the face of deepening financial problems.
The company yesterday confirmed it intended to implement a SKr2bn (Pounds
196m) rationalisation programme over the next three years in its ailing
truck division.
The group is also believed to be considering the closure of smaller car
production plants in Sweden. The most likely casualty appears to be the
company's former showcase operation at Kalmar on the Baltic Sea, which
employs 800 people producing the luxury 960 model.
This plant was established in 1976 and won international renown for its new
production techniques, involving the abolition of the traditional assembly
line. The Uddevalla plant in south-west Sweden, opened in 1989, could be an
alternative choice for closure.
Volvo said the decision on the closure had not been taken, but last week Mr
Soren Gyll, chief executive, said 'nothing was holy' in the company any
longer.
Any decision to close either Kalmar or Uddevalla would have social and
political consequences as unemployment is climbing in Sweden. It would also
be seen as a personal setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive
president who pioneered the new methods of car production.
After an emergency board meeting last Friday, Volvo told the Swedish trade
unions the company was being forced to restructure its truck operations
because of deteriorating market conditions in Europe and North America.
All truck plant managers have been told to identify potential savings and
rationalisation measures by the end of October. Mr Sten Langenius, head of
Volvo's truck division, said he was convinced the cost savings and other
planned moves would safeguard its future when the economic upturn came.
Volvo told the unions that last year the total market for heavy trucks fell
13 per cent in Europe and in 1992 would decline a further 7 per cent. In the
Nordic region, where Volvo was the market leader, there had been a 29 per
cent drop in the first six months of this year.
Last week Volvo announced an operating loss of SKr835m and deficit (after
financial items) of SKr103m for the first six months.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Cut power bill 'nuclear levy', regulator urges: Nuclear
Electric attacks untimely interference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday
added his voice to calls for a reduction in the 11 per cent 'nuclear levy'
on electricity bills, provoking a clash with Nuclear Electric, the
state-owned generator.
He proposed a 'faster and more certain reduction' of the nuclear levy,
imposed after privatisation of non-nuclear generators in 1990 to subsidise
the higher costs of nuclear electricity.
Prof Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, was addressing the
Energy Intensive Users Group; one of the groups representing large
electricity consumers which have repeatedly warned that the competitiveness
of UK industry may be harmed unless prices are lowered.
The call came only a day after PowerGen, the privatised generator, said it
had been discussing a reduction in the levy with large energy users and the
Department of Trade and Industry for several months. Rival generator
National Power said yesterday it also supported this strategy.
The DTI said Prof Littlechild was free to express his views, but reiterated
that in discussions with large users on electricity prices it had made clear
there could be 'no question of public subsidies'.
Mr Robert Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, wrote to Prof
Littlechild on Tuesday but failed to dissuade him from publishing his
proposals. In a strongly worded protest, Mr Hawley called the move
'unjustifiable and untimely interference'.
Prof Littlechild proposed changing regulations to allow the rate of the levy
to be fixed in advance, enabling customers to plan more effectively. At
present it is revised yearly on the basis of projected electricity demand to
ensure it raises a set amount. He also suggested that the rate should
steadily decrease, to give Nuclear Electric a 'sharper incentive to improve
efficiency'.
'In a fully competitive market, customers would not have to pay the higher
costs of nuclear electricity,' Prof Littlechild said. 'A reduction in the
levy would, therefore, be a most practical and defensible way of responding
to concerns from larger users.'
Mr Hawley said the proposal was unacceptable as it did not recognise that
any levy shortfall would have to be made up out of public expenditure.
He added that Nuclear Electric had a sharp incentive to cut costs by its
public commitment to making an operating profit before the levy by 1995. He
called Prof Littlechild's statement on competition and the costs of nuclear
electricity 'fanciful'.
Mr Andrew Bainbridge, director of the Major Energy Users Council, said he
would prefer any cut in electricity prices to be aimed specifically at
industry.
'Although we sympathise with anyone who is trying to make ends meet in a
recession, we do feel the large user needs special treatment at a time when
industry is sinking fast,' he said.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Sterling steadies as ERM pressure eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING clawed back some of its recent losses against the D-Mark yesterday,
brushing off the dollar's renewed weakness, as pressure in the European
exchange rate mechanism showed tentative signs of easing.
The pound was unaffected by official figures suggesting that the Bank of
England intervened heavily to bolster sterling's position in the ERM last
month. However, the dollar continued to come under pressure, hitting a
record low against the D-Mark for the second day running.
The pound gained half a pfennig to close in London at DM2.7875, still less
than a pfennig above its ERM floor of DM2.778. Against the dollar, sterling
climbed to Dollars 2.004, against a previous close of Dollars 1.997. The
dollar finished at DM1.3905, down less than half a pfennig.
In New York, the pound held steady against the D-Mark, but dropped back
slightly to Dollars 1.9993 against the dollar. There was also little change
in the dollar/D-Mark rate, which closed at DM1.3942.
In Tokyo this morning, the dollar opened at DM1.39725, while sterling was
quoted at DM2.788 and Dollars 1.99575.
The lira, which in recent weeks has come under severe pressure in the ERM,
yesterday was unchanged against the D-Mark. It closed last night in London
at L764.6 to the D-Mark, above its ERM floor of L765.4.
In London, the Treasury announced that Britain's underlying gold and
currency reserves dropped by Dollars 1.28bn (Pounds 639m) in August,
reflecting heavy intervention by the Bank to temper the currency's fall. The
drop, which compares with a fall of only Dollars 86m in July, reduced the
level of reserves at the end of August to Dollars 44.4bn compared with
Dollars 45.7bn in July.
The steadier pound gave some support to UK equities and government bonds.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up 14.6 at 2,313.0, while gilts
gained up to 1 point.
Expectations that Britain may be able to stave off a rise in base rates, now
10 per cent, were reflected on the UK money market. The three-month
interbank rate, which indicates market perceptions about the future level of
base rates, eased from about 10 9/16 per cent to about 10 7/16 per cent.
Reduced currency turbulence also buoyed the Paris bourse where prices rose 2
per cent. But investors elsewhere in Europe indicated their continued
nervousness that the strong D-Mark may require increases in interest rates
in some European countries when growth prospects seem poor. Stock markets in
Frankfurt and Milan fell by 0.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.
The UK Treasury said the drop in reserves demonstrated the government's
'resolve' to protect the pound from sliding below its floor in the ERM. The
pound lost 5 pfennigs in August after coming under heavy selling pressure,
most spectacularly last week, because of the D-Mark's strength.
Last Wednesday, after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, restated the
government's commitment to maintain the pound's parity within the ERM, the
Bank carried out extensive operations to prop up the currency. Estimates of
the amount it bought ranged from Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Bonn's policies undermining business, warns industry chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has lost contact with the German
business community, and current government policies will sooner or later
ruin the economy, a prominent industry leader said yesterday.
The resignation this week of Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of BDI, the
federation of German industry, showed the gravity of this 'disastrous
development', said Mr Dieter Harthe, chief executive of the federation of
medium-sized businesses, BVMW.
Instead of working with industry to develop sound financial and economic
policies, the government produced a 'constant flow of half-baked ideas'.
Mr Kohl thought Germany's Mittelstand of around 300,000 medium-sized
companies was good only for paying taxes and listening to his sermons, Mr
Harthe added.
The collective experience and knowledge of the BVMW's membership was not
being used. 'The government keeps on demanding better performance (from
industry) without creating the necessary policy framework. That in the end
will break the economy's back,' he said.
Mr Harthe's comments reflect widespread nervousness about the economic
downturn and the government's apparent paralysis, and indicates how far Mr
Kohl's stock has fallen in business circles. His popularity among the
electorate, especially in eastern Germany, is also in rapid decline.
The chancellor's lack of interest in business is well-documented, but it has
led, perhaps inevitably, to his being singled out as the main target for
industry's venom as the economy has weakened.
The Bundesbank, the German central bank, is also understood to be concerned
about the lack of co-ordination in Bonn's fiscal and economic policies.
A recent flow of ideas for boosting the economy, including proposals for tax
changes, road tolls and suggestions of forcing non-investing high earners to
buy government bonds to support the east, has compounded the impression that
Bonn is uncertain of how to conduct its economic policy.
Mr Weiss, meanwhile, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the cause
of his resignation was an internal dispute within the BDI federation. During
his 20 months in office, the federation had maintained good contacts with
'ministers important to us', he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The solvency ratio seems to be under growing fire as a reliable guide to an
insurance company's health - and quite right too. It has been clear since
the underpricing of the late 1980s that premium income is an inadequate
proxy for measuring scale of risk. Yesterday's placing of cumulative
irredeemable preference shares by General Accident, though, also highlights
loopholes in the other half of the calculation. Although qualifying as
capital for the purposes of the official solvency ratio calculation,
cumulative prefs hardly offer an insurer the same cushion as pure equity.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 11 per cent increase in interim profits from Invergordon made a
refreshing change to a dull diet of depressed earnings. The management's
strong grip on the business is demonstrated by increasing margins and market
share, in spite of falls in wholesale whisky prices. True, the performance
is flattered by recession, as consumers switch to cheap scotch. Nevertheless
Invergordon's success in this own-label market is impressive.
That said, the spectre at the feast is Whyte &amp; Mackay's 41 per cent stake in
the company. Given the value Whyte clearly places on Invergordon's grain
distillery and whisky stocks, a fresh bid seems likely when it is free to
renew its assault in November. But with Whyte probably having to pay 50p-75p
more than last year's failed 275p offer, there is room for doubt. Whisky
prices are weakening, and at the same time, Invergordon stands at a premium
to the sector. If prices continue to ease, Whyte may just decide that it can
get the shares cheaper if it waits.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the whole investors are probably not too bothered whether or not the
Stock Exchange's company news service turns into a sort of electronic
Exchange and Mart. Mowlem shareholders, though, may wonder whether the
unusual decision to publish its adviser's telephone number on it for the
benefit of 'interested parties' reflects the urgency of signing a London
City airport deal.
The company insists not, and to be fair the financial warning lights are
hardly flashing. Mowlem's balance sheet looks reasonably robust by
contractors' standards - gearing should not be more than 35 to 40 per cent
this year - and 1991's 3 1/2 times interest cover provides a respectable
buffer. The scaffolding side ought to be a cash generator even in depressed
times, and though a cash outflow is expected on the contracting side there
are no obvious horror stories.
That said, the decision to flush out co-investors at this stage remains
puzzling. The City airport project may start to generate cash over the next
12 to 18 months, while the promoters can point to improved road access and
recent successes in developing new services. But an operating loss on the
airport looks inevitable this year - one incidentally which will show up in
the group profit and loss account now the 1990 provision has been exhausted
 -while the required passenger volumes for breaking even still look some way
off. Perhaps Mowlem has simply - and not unwisely - decided to cut its
losses on a Docklands excursion conceived in headier days.

FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK reserves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That UK official reserves fell sharply in August can come as little
surprise. The Bank of England intervened to the tune of getting on for
Dollars 2bn on Wednesday last week alone. But what is not shown up by the
figures is the full extent to which the Bank has been selling the mark, for
example through buying dollars against marks: such action has little net
effect on reserve values in the short term.
From now until at least the French vote on Maastricht the UK authorities are
locked in to a struggle with the foreign exchanges. The Bank's tactics -
keeping its powder dry until the barbarians are at the gate - seem to be
working for the moment. Critics who argue that leaving action to the last
minute means that intervention has to be heavy may be proved wrong.
Speculators shorting sterling get very nervous within sight of the ERM
floor.
This is not to say the Bank will win the psychological battle - further
trouble could come as soon as tomorrow if the US employment report weakens
the dollar further. September's drain on foreign reserves is unlikely to be
less than that in August.

FT  03 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Bowater squeezes by
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the performance of Bowater's shares over the past three years,
the market views the company as a model of how to manage in recession. The
technique, underlined by yesterday's 19 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits, is to squeeze higher margins from some well-defined core
businesses. Sales have barely increased since Mr Norman Ireland arrived from
BTR in 1987, but profits have grown by 230 per cent over the same period.
The acquisitions of DRG and Cope Allman this year have brought more raw
material with which to work: operating margins are significantly lower than
elsewhere in the group. On past experience this alone should leave scope for
earnings growth as efficiency gains feed through to the bottom line.
Yet the acquisitions also leave Bowater more heavily exposed to a European
packaging market which is showing signs of stagnation. Weak pulp and
plastics prices are behind a deflationary cycle which encompasses lower
selling prices and pressure on margins. Discounting acquisitions, Bowater's
first-half profits from Europe were actually down on last year. The strategy
is to defend prices, but margin improvements will be hard to achieve until
conditions improve. A sharp increase in provisions may point to some
formidable challenges for management.
Bowater may be robust enough to pursue its ambitions elsewhere. Gearing of
35 per cent should allow for some smaller acquisitions in less depressed
markets. Capital expenditure has fallen but remains comfortably ahead of
depreciation. From this position the company must stand a fighting chance of
living up to the market's high expectations. A price earnings ratio of 14
times this year's forecast earnings demands no less.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Nothing will come of nothing, think again: The British
government's target of zero inflation within the ERM is undesirable and
unattainable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism at a sterling
parity of DM2.95 looks increasingly threatened. The prime minster's
commitment to a target of zero inflation is supposed to make this policy
more secure. In fact, it makes it look less credible.
Mr John Major has rightly identified Britain's inflationary psychology as a
root cause of the current economic malaise. The government's priority is to
avoid a repeat of the boom-bust cycles that have plagued the UK for decades.
Yet the new policy of pursuing zero inflation to break this cycle through
high interest rates within the ERM will not solve the underlying
inflationary problem. It is merely compounding the damage caused by the
current recession.
The failure of the economy to grow results in large part from a series of
errors in monetary management since the 1960s. As a result, repeated periods
of high inflation have encouraged consumers to borrow excessively to buy
houses and consumer durables. The subsequent collapse in house prices has
left them burdened with debts which they are struggling to service at
current high interest rates.
Even if consumers were not burdened by debt, the case for pursuing zero
inflation through persistently high interest rates would be weak. Even the
most successful low inflation countries such as Germany target an inflation
rate of 2-3 per cent. Those countries which have attempted to achieve that
target, most recently New Zealand and Canada, have paid a high price in lost
output in pursuit of a goal which has remained elusive.
Now is a particularly bad time for the UK to pursue zero inflation. Britain
needs a period of low or even negative real interest rates to ease the
pressure on indebted consumers. But the fall in underlying inflation over
the past year, combined with high nominal interest rates, has already pushed
short-term real interest rates to their highest level at this point in the
economic cycle since the 1930s. The nearer the rate of inflation comes to
zero, the higher real interest rates will become. This can only compound the
pain in the housing market and delay a consumer-led recovery.
Merely sticking to the current exchange rate target within the ERM and
announcing a target of zero inflation is the wrong way to secure the low and
stable inflation that Britain needs. The costs are prohibitively high and
the gains may well prove illusory.
First the pain. The cost of reaching zero inflation in the UK would be
enormous. Despite the government's labour market reforms in the 1980s there
has been no reduction in the amount of unemployment required to reduce
inflation.
Estimates from 1980-81 suggest that every 1 percentage point fall in
inflation required 2.3 percentage points more unemployment over one year,
much higher than in most other OECD countries. Reducing the annual rate of
underlying price inflation from its current 4.4 per cent to zero would,
according to this relationship, require an extra 10 percentage points of
unemployment - either 3m more unemployed in 1993 or an extra 1m more
unemployed a year from now until the middle of 1995.
Yet, unless this inflation rate could be secured once it had been attained,
such sacrifices would have been in vain. The government's last attempt to
conquer inflation in the early 1980s, and the subsequent failure of
employers and workers to control Britain's problem of excessive real wage
growth, bequeathed a manufacturing sector that is leaner and more
competitive, but too small to finance Britain's desire for imported goods.
It also bequeathed a large and growing pool of unskilled, unemployed and
increasingly unemployable people.
Are the mistakes of the 1980s about to be repeated? The structural problems
which underlie inflationary tendencies - inefficiencies in the housing and
labour markets and the flawed way in which UK monetary policy has been made
 -may currently be suppressed. But they still exist. The government's
failure to tackle the underlying causes of the inflation of the past two
decades means that any recovery risks being derailed by inflation once more.
The government says it wants low inflation, but it also wants house prices
to start rising and has been unwilling to eliminate the main tax incentives
that favour housing investment. The labour market also remains as
inflation-prone as 10 years ago. In the late-1980s, despite record
unemployment rates, price inflation was once again fuelled by an
acceleration of wage increases. Earnings inflation has started to fall only
after two years of recession and rising job losses.
Despite the fall in pay settlements, it may take a decade of slow growth and
high unemployment to work off the lost competitiveness of the past 10 years,
at least at the current exchange rate within the ERM. Real wage growth in
the 1980s outstripped that in all of the UK's main competitors, despite the
government's labour market reforms. The signs of an overvalued real exchange
rate are clear: manufacturing profitability, even after the productivity
gains of the past decade, remains low by international standards. Britain is
left with a trade deficit at the bottom of the recession.
Most worrying, politicians remain in control of Britain's monetary policy.
This is still so despite the international evidence that independent central
banks have delivered lower inflation rates over the past 40 years. The link
running from low inflation to higher or more stable economic growth does not
exist, as the chart shows. But if a government is serious about delivering
low inflation, it will cede monetary policy autonomy to an independent
institution.
Yet Mr Major, like his predecessors, has been unwilling to give up the
levers of monetary power to the Bank of England. He has been willing to
allow the independent Bundesbank to set UK interest rates on his behalf. But
the credibility of this policy rests solely on the government's willingness
to remain in the ERM and resist a devaluation.
History suggests that devaluation is the most likely escape route from slow
growth and rising trade and fiscal deficits. There is no good reason why the
markets should trust Mr Major more than any other politician of the postwar
period. Indeed, the costs of attaining zero inflation make the policy even
less credible than in the past.
The markets know that the government will not be able to endure high
interest rates, sluggish growth and rising unemployment for years rather
than months. But that is the implication of the government's current policy.
The markets also know that the result of a devaluation, without deeper
structural reform, is likely to be renewed inflation. The commitment to zero
inflation is either disingenuous or will prove so destabilising as to be
unsustainable.

David James, fast becoming the banks' favourite Mr Fixit, has not wasted any
time strengthening the non-executive members of the board of his latest
client, Lep, the troubled freight forwarder.
H Wynne Denman is an old Cayzer hand, and J Brian Smith, an ex-Rank
Organisation group managing director, has worked on other David James rescue
missions. Both men are in their 60s and James says that 'their skills,
experience and advice will bring added strength' to the board of Lep and its
subsidiaries.
But then one could have said the same about Lep's previous non-executive
directors. Bill Govett, a former chairman of John Govett &amp; Co and a director
of Legal &amp; General, 3i and the National Coal Board pension fund, was a
member of the board for eight years and his fund management firm was
instrumental in bringing in John Read, the previous chairman, who is now
suing the company for Pounds 1.7m for loss of his job.
Peter Grant, chairman of Sun Life and a former deputy chairman of Lazard
Brothers, was a director for four years and Philip Hampton, an ex-Lazards
merchant banker who is now British Steel's finance director, sat on the
board for two years. Lazards was Lep's financial adviser until last year and
both Grant and Hampton had worked on Lep deals and should have known the
company well.
This is not to say that they are not extremely effective at their main jobs.
It is just another reminder that non-executive jobs can test even the most
distinguished executives.

With the appointment yesterday of Jacob Palmstierna as chairman of
Nordbanken, Sweden's state-controlled bank, it looks as though his
rehabilitation in Swedish banking society is complete.
Palmstierna spent 30 years at Sweden's top commercial bank, the prestigious
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. But his spell in the chief executive's seat
was embarrassingly brief - both for him and S-E Banken. Only a few months
after his appointment, he was investigated for tax fraud - a heinous crime
in the eyes of the law-abiding Swedes - and decided to step down while the
investigations were under way. In the end he was cleared of any
irregularities but he did not get his old job back.
Since then, he has been vice-chairman at Nordbanken, number two to Bjorn
Wahlstrom, an industrialist with no banking experience who was brought in to
shake up the bank. Wahlstrom did well turning round SSAB, the formerly
state-controlled steel company, but has not been a great success at
Nordbanken. With the benefit of hindsight it might have been better to have
given Palmstierna the chairman's job in the first place.

Heads of state are worth 10 times as much as journalists. This little nugget
is one of the more interesting statistics to emerge from the Non-Aligned
Movement conference in Jakarta. Apparently, the Indonesian government has
taken out a life and medical insurance policy which provides hacks attending
the conference with maximum cover of Dollars 11,500. For heads of state the
figure is Dollars 114,000.

If only he hadn't hit a German. Werner Niefer, retiring management board
chairman of Mercedes-Benz AG, has been fined DM80,000 for knocking down a
German tourist while driving one of his buses in Rome a couple of years ago.
Stuttgart judge Hubertus Pauli found that Niefer - who took the wheel after
entertaining some of Mercedes's Italian staff at a restaurant outside Rome -
should have stopped before rounding a blind corner where the accident
happened.
A Mercedes spokesman said the wounded German tourist had not filed a civil
suit, but he expected this would follow. Mercedes said that Niefer welcomed
the completion of the two-year investigation and would accept the fine.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Observer: AMP points the way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Britain can hire Aussie Bill McLennan to run its Central Statistical
Office, it is only right that Australia can pinch a top British fund manager
to show it how to invest.
Even so, putting the Postel's Andrew Threadgold in charge of all the
Australian and overseas investment operations of AMP, Australia's equivalent
of the Prudential, is a surprisingly adventurous move. The 48-year-old
Threadgold's sole previous connection with Australia was a four-year stint
in Melbourne while he earned a doctorate.
Admittedly, Threadgold is not a typical life company fund manager. He worked
at the International Wool Secretariat and the Bank of England before joining
Postel, where he's responsible for Pounds 19bn of funds. That said, giving
him charge of AMP's Pounds 25bn must have put quite a few Australian fund
managers' noses out of joint. AMP may have outgrown Australia and be keen to
centralise its international fund management in London, but 60 per cent of
its money is still in Australia, and Threadgold will be in London.
It will be interesting to see whether Threadgold, an outspoken advocate of
shareholder activism, will continue to shake the corporate governance tree.
There are plenty of easy targets in Australia.

Sir, One aspect of quality schemes (Letters, August 25) needs a great deal
of attention - they appear to be spawning their own bureaucracy.
My company achieved BS5750 some years ago and has benefited as part of our
overall approach to customer service. However, a disproportionate amount of
our quality team's time is spent filling in inquiries from other quality
departments requiring copious and often irrelevant information.
Efforts should be intensified to promote BS5750 certification as sufficient
evidence of satisfactory standing for most commercial purposes, leaving only
specific technical inquiries relating to the products involved to be
pursued.

Sir, A historical analysis which goes back further than 1974 ('Saving days
are here again', August 27) suggests a consumer recovery may depend on
understanding public attitudes and beliefs as much as economic prospects.
Over 40 years ago, J Gordon Lippincott said: 'The major problem is one of
stimulating the urge to buy. It must be nurtured even though it is contrary
to one of the oldest inbred laws of humanity - the law of thrift - of
providing for the unknown and oft-feared day of scarcity.' He succeeded.
Whether present day marketers can do so depends on more than real interest
rates.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins ('How freight hopes have finally been derailed',
September 1) can only be congratulated for highlighting the plight of
British Rail and other would-be rail freight operators. As long as rail
freight rates have to cover full commercial costs, ie have to pay for rail
freight infrastructure as well (or are even required to earn a return on
railway assets), while road users are offered unlimited access to their
respective transport system in exchange for a negligible annual licence fee,
an insurmountable barrier to entry remains in place. On top of this comes
the complete disregard for external - ie, social - costs, such as congestion
or pollution costs.
The political unwillingness to level the playing field not only prevents a
commercially viable rail freight industry. By virtually subsidising road
transport the government hinders competition, increases economic
inefficiency and promotes the ecologically most damaging mode of transport.

Sir, 'Escape from the Black Hole' (August 29) gave useful advice to the
newly redundant executive.
The prospect of re-employment within five months and at higher salary levels
held out by Mr Bell is, however, quite incongruous, particularly when
applied to senior executives from the City. I, and others, who have used
outplacement services have a much slower tale of re-employment. I created my
own business 12 months after leaving my former employer and it will be some
time before it affords an assured future.
Outplacement, particularly the use of networking, had a valuable part to
play in my own re-establishment but does its reputation little good if it
holds out quite unrealistic prospects to those that use its services.

Sir, Andrew Adonis notes in 'Busier groves of academe' (August 28) that by
the year 2000 it is anticipated that one in three 18-year-olds will enter
higher education, as against one in seven in the 1980s. Perhaps we might go
back to basics and ask the following questions:
1) What evidence is there that a shortage of graduates does and will exist
in specific areas of the UK labour market?
2) Is the expansion of higher education an appropriate response to the
existing skills problem in British industry, identified by the recent
research carried out at the National Institute?
3) What are the assumptions concerning the necessary alterations in existing
patterns of household savings, investment and consumption that will fund
students through the system in the later 1990s? What will be the eventual
impact of current readjustments in the housing market?

FT  03 SEP 92 / Letter: Nuclear Electric making fossil generators nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ROBERT HAWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex (September 2) was right on power prices and the real costs of
electricity. The nuclear levy question is certainly a diversion from the
larger issues - but it's a diversion which has attracted both PowerGen and
Offer over the last couple of days, with both calling simplistically for a
cut in our levy rate.
Nuclear Electric's response to remarks by Prof Stephen Littlechild,
director-general of Offer, at the Energy Intensive Users' Group is quite
clear. The following is an extract of a letter I have sent to him.
'You state that in a competitive market customers would not have to bear
'the higher costs of nuclear electricity'. This simple statement is
fanciful, and fails to address policy issues relating to the way the
privatisation was structured, the real costs of other fuels and the other
subsidies hidden in the market. You also avoid the issue of who will bear
the costs of nuclear provisions if the customer does not. I find it strange
that you propose to go on record as suggesting that customers should not
meet the full costs of the electricity they consume.'
Offer, of course, was merely responding to pressure brought to bear by
others. Which brings us back to PowerGen. Ed Wallis is very free with advice
 -and Nuclear Electric's money - and may even have reaped some short-term PR
kudos as a result, by claiming to have devised a mechanism which would even
support British coal.
But is this not the same Ed Wallis who is investing almost Pounds 40m on
Merseyside, building a facility to import 5m tonnes of foreign coal a year,
at the kind of prices which would allow him to offer cheap electricity to
the major energy users?
The truth is that Nuclear Electric is now enjoying record output and market
share, with costs consistently coming down, and the fossil generators are
becoming more nervous. Our financial arrangements are transparent to all -
unlike theirs. I'm delighted that we have been singled out for such special
attention - it is a commercial compliment to our success.

FT  03 SEP 92 / People: Central looks outside
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Central Independent Television has brought in Kazia Kantor from Grand
Metropolitan to fill the group finance director slot that has been empty
since Kevin Betts left in February.
Leslie Hill, chief executive, says he was looking for a candidate outside
the industry, and that Kantor's experience at 'interesting companies'
ranging from GrandMet to an advertising agency would provide a useful fresh
perspective.
Closely involved in the license renewal process last year, in which Central
placed its winning bid of just Pounds 2,000, Betts had subsequently wanted
to become more involved in strategy and management, according to Hill. '
That was not something that was available in the next few years. It was no
longer exciting enough for him.'
Kantor, 42, who qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse,
spent 8 years at Inchcape, rising to the position of group financial
controller. Since she left in 1987, she has had a series of jobs in quick
succession; a spell at HMV; finance director of advertising agency Davidson
Pearce around the time it was merged into Boase Massimi Pollitt; and
director of corporate finance at Aegis. In mid-1990 she then moved to Grand
Metropolitan as finance and business development director of the retail and
property sector, and was latterly group business development director.
Kantor, who has said she is particularly pleased to be returning to the
Midlands where she grew up, was not available for comment yesterday.

A significant shake-up at the top of Abbey National is under way nearly two
years ahead of the retirement of John Bayliss, the man who, as managing
director for retail operations, has powered ahead with the main business of
the building society turned bank for the last eight years.
Bayliss, 58, is now stepping up to be deputy chairman with overall
responsibility for retail operations and the group's general insurance
business. Charles Toner, Abbey National's European director, joins the group
board as European director, becomes a member of the bank's executive
committee, and will continue to run the European subsidiaries and
Cornerstone, Abbey National's loss-making estate agents.
Meanwhile, Ian Harley, 41, currently retail operations director, steps
across to become group treasurer, while Gareth Jones, 43, the man who set up
Abbey National's highly profitable treasury, becomes director of retail
operations, reporting directly to Bayliss, in a move that suggests the two
men are being groomed as possible successors to Peter Birch, Abbey National
chief executive. They may have to wait a while, as Birch is not 60 until
December 1997.

Peter Burton, 42, (right) is promoted to general manager, one level below
the main board. He will continue to be in charge of customer administration
 -but with the job upgraded in recognition of its increasing importance,
according to the society.
Huw Alderman, 42, who has been head of corporate planning, is made head of

since the financial service activities are now independent subsidiaries each
run by a managing director.
Michael Jennings, 39, previously estates controller, is appointed head of

fund manager Murray Johnstone.
Chairman Nick McAndrew says he was attracted by the combination of Shea's
'very interesting foreign office background' together with his Hanson
experience. At one point during his diplomatic career - before he went to
the Palace - Shea had been head of chancery in Bucharest. McAndrew says the
fund management company is keen to know more about emerging markets,
particularly Eastern Europe.
Shea, 54, has written about the delights of 'portfolio living', or being

<TEXT>
That company report you need so urgently for this afternoon's meeting is
winging its way from the New York office. It's in the hands of an
international courier company and you expected it an hour ago.
International couriers have realised that customers can no longer be wooed
by claims that 'no mountain is too high' - as DHL's UK advertising campaign
says. 'Couriers now have to offer the reliability customers may not be
getting from their national postal services, as well as speed,' says John
Mullen, chief executive officer of TNT Worldwide Express.
To provide high-quality service, couriers have adopted package tracing
systems. One of the most advanced has been developed by Federal Express,
which supplies its drivers with hand-held computers called Dads (digitally
assisted despatch systems) to deliver between 2m-3m items every day in the
US.
FedEx drivers are told where their next pick-up will be and the easiest way
to get there via the Dads display. The advantage of this system is that
collections can be made on an ad hoc basis throughout the day.
The driver scans the computer barcode label on each package and enters the
details of the final destination into a hand-held computer. The information
is transferred to the mainframe computer in FedEx's Memphis headquarters via
a satellite link and is then accessible to FedEx bases throughout the world.
DHL, with the largest global network of all, employs a similar system which
assists in the delivery of more than 60m consignments annually. DHL has now
upgraded the service to give customers the option of linking into the
network from their own offices.
DHL's package, called EasyShip, will give high-volume users the option of
having a Compaq PC, two printers, an electronic weighing scale, a barcode
scanner and a modem installed on their premises.
Drivers at United Parcel Service are also supplied with a hand-held PC,
known as Diad (delivery information acquisition device), which not only
transfers collection and delivery information into an international
mainframe, but also stores the recipient's signature as proof of delivery.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Technology (R&amp;D): All for one and one for all - How General
Electric has co-ordinated its research labs so they produce more commercial
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILL LORENSEN takes a scalpel, cuts into the face of the deformed teenage
girl, peels away the skin around her eyes to reveal bone, and quickly
proceeds to re-align her features so that her eyes no longer protrude
abnormally from her skull.
The scalpel is only electronic, and the three-dimensional face is merely
portrayed on a television monitor in the computer graphics laboratory at
General Electric's corporate research and development centre in Schenectady,
New York.
But the techniques Lorensen is demonstrating were used in just such an
operation by cranial facial surgeons in a Boston hospital who have been
experimenting with new GE equipment, hot off the laboratory bench, designed
to help very long and complex medical procedures.
Advanced GE body scanning equipment, combined with the laboratory's computer
graphics techniques, allows surgeons to construct three-dimensional images
of patients and then simulate the cuts needed to perform successful
operations on them.
This is just one small example of the way in which GE, one of the largest
and most diversified companies in the US, is addressing two fundamental
issues facing businesses with large R&amp;D staffs:
How do you make your scientists, who may be happier advancing pure human
knowledge, perform work which is relevant to the company's business,
boosting the bottom line?
And, in the case of a diversified business like GE, how do you get
laboratories in different scientific disciplines to co-operate, making the
product as a whole more valuable than the sum of its parts?
Lorensen's work involves close co-operation between the graphics laboratory
and GE's applied physics lab, which has responsibility for maintaining the
company's lead in medical diagnostic imaging, gained through its development
of computed tomography and magnetic resonance scanners.
His job also involves working hand-in-hand with GE Medical Systems, the
division which sells the imaging equipment, and the hospitals which buy
them, like the one in Boston.
The Schenectady centre, one of the largest and most influential R&amp;D bases in
corporate America, dates back to the start of the century and employs just
over 1,000 scientists and technicians. Its long list of successes includes
the invention of the modern medical X-Ray tube, the first method of
manufacturing industrial diamonds and development of the world's leading
computed tomography scanner.
GE's operating divisions also have their own large R&amp;D facilities, but about
30 per cent of all the group's patents and some 50 per cent of its technical
papers are generated at Schenectady.
Its broad sweep of current R&amp;D includes: a computerised design tool that
runs other computerised design programs to find the optimal solution to
problems; the application of fuzzy logic, or smart controls, to consumer
electrical goods; and the use of computer-based analysis to reduce risk in
GE's large financial services business.
However, the centre has gone through a big shift of emphasis in recent
years. Walter Berninger, who heads the engineering physics research centre,
says that 20 years ago there was far more of a focus on pure research. About
10 years ago came a demand for greater relevance to GE's operating
businesses, while the emphasis now is on both revelance and importance -
with the latter measured in terms of profits.
Much of the shift is due to Walter Robb, who has headed the centre since
1986 and before that spent 13 years as head of one of GE's business success
stories - the medical systems division which is now the world's leading
producer of diagnostic imaging equipment.
Robb has made two important structural changes. The first is in the way the
centre is funded. Under the old system, GE's various operating businesses
paid Schenectady a fixed annual assessment, or tithe, based on the size of
the business. This money went into a central pool and it was up to the
centre to decide how to spend the sum.
The system was frustrating for both sides. The businesses saw no connection
between what they had paid and what the laboratories did, while the centre
often complained of businesses sitting on commercially applicable patents it
had developed. Robb sharply cut the tithe paid by the businesses and now
applies this smaller pool to fund more high risk, so-called 'exploratory'
research which may or may not find a practical application one day.
However, any work going beyond the exploratory area now has to be financed
100 per cent by a business out of its own funds. The result is a closer
watch by a business on how its money is spent and a concern on both sides to
ensure the results can be rapidly commercialised.
'It is very rare now that a programme is in the applied development area and
is not tied in on the critical path of a business's product plan,' says
Robb. 'They have limited dollars and they are trying to spend them on things
that are going to be important.'
The second change, linked to the first, was in the way the centre
communicated with the various businesses. It previously had a group of
full-time liaison managers, each of whom looked after several GE businesses.
Robb replaced them by assigning senior Schenectady figures - the managers of
the various laboratories - to spend part of their time being the centre's
rep with a single business. The rep gathers ideas from all the centre's
laboratories for research which might help his client business and each
spring he puts together a funding proposal which he pitches to the business.
'He is to some extent a salesman,' says Robb. 'He comes back from the
business with a commitment to fund a certain number of programmes.'
The result has been much closer links between the two sides, with, for
example, the Schenectady manager invited to the business's planning sessions
and staff meetings.
There are also substantial financial incentives underpinning this
co-operation. The more funds a researcher can attract, the more chance he
has of getting his ideas patented and into products.
The centre gives an extremely modest Dollars 400 (Pounds 200) reward for a
patent, but an individual's salary depends in part on performance.
Schenectady now also grants reseachers GE share options for outstanding
work.
A feature of the annual performance review of senior managers is how many
products their operations have 'transitioned' - an ugly piece of slang,
often heard in the centre, which means transferring an idea from the
laboratory to the market-place.
Michael O'Mara, who runs the chemical research centre, says Schenectady
scientists no longer throw an idea over the wall to a business division, sit
back and say 'my job is done'.
'People see that if you want your baby to be successful in the market place
you have to take on more responsibility.' This attitude has been reinforced
by a more general GE philosophy encouraged by Jack Welch, the group's
chairman, who aims to create a 'boundaryless' organisation to cope with the
business challenges of 1990s. His idea is both to cut out unneccessary
layers of bureacracy and also to foster the free flow of ideas around the
vast organisation.
Robb says Schenectady has always been pretty boundaryless itself, sharing
ideas between labs, but it has now become much more open in exchanging ideas
with GE's businesses. In turn the businesses are now less suspicious of the
centre: 'They are prepared to come here and tell us what they are working
on, and how much money they have to spend on it, and what the price
objective is.'
Robb points out that some 40 per cent of the centre's patents and technical
papers are produced in co-operation with people in the businesses, while
about 75 per cent of the business ideas it puts forward find their way to a
commercial application.
Some 40 to 50 per cent of its patents and papers involve teams combining
more than one Schenectady laboratory and Robb believes that this is the way
of the future, with more and more advances being made by combining two
technologies. However, he also reckons that the biggest breakthrough facing
Schenectady is not going to be in any particular technology but in research
productivity.
Computer capability is on the way, he says, which will allow the centre to
'model, or simulate, practically every laboratory experiment that we will
contemplate doing . . . even making a metal alloy.'
That, in turn, will increase GE's general business productivity by cutting
down the cycle time of new product development. And this, management gurus
aver, is a key factor for business sucess in the 1990s.

ATTITUDES to sexual harassment depend more on age than gender, according to
a Mori poll of nearly 2,000 adults.
Men over the age of 55 were more likely than younger males to blame women
for dressing provocatively. The GMB general union, which commissioned the
poll, said it was surprised by the results. 'We expected men and women to
have different attitudes . . . What we found was that the sexes agreed but
the generations differed.'

FT  03 SEP 92 / Nalgo request on strike refused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NALGO, the local government union, yesterday failed in an effort to suspend
a High Court judge's order to call off a strike involving 1,100 staff at
Newham council in London, Lisa Wood writes.
The Court of Appeal refused the union's plea for a stay pending the hearing
of its appeal against a court order that the strike must end immediately.
The court rejected Nalgo's argument that the industrial action in response
to redundancies in the Labour council's poll-tax collection department
should be allowed to continue because calling it off now would make the
union's appeal pointless. The appeal is due to be heard next week.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Willis says he will retire early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Willis, TUC general secretary, yesterday denied reports that he
was about to retire, but said for the first time that he would not remain in
the job until he is 65. He is now 59.
Mr Willis said he would make no further comment 'in the run up to congress',
which starts in Blackpool on Monday. Clearly angered by newspaper
speculation, he added that when he did make a decision about his future it
would not be provoked by 'pressure from the press'.
Mr Willis's comments will not dampen speculation, which was fuelled by
private remarks by senior union leaders, that he is likely to go -
voluntarily or otherwise - within a year.
The annual New Statesman survey on what trade union leaders think of each
other, published tomorrow, shows Mr Willis second from bottom of a list of
13 headed by Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union. The poll was
compiled from replies by 36 out of a possible 100 union leaders. Only Mr
Tony Dubbins of GPMU, the print union, fared worse than Mr Willis, who came
second from bottom in a similar survey last year.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the public service union Nupe, fell to
second place. He was followed by Mr Bill Morris, leader of the TGWU general
union, and Mr Jimmy Knapp, head of the rail union RMT.
Meanwhile, the TUC is attempting to return full employment to the top of the
political agenda. Yesterday it released results of an opinion poll by NOP
which found that 96 per cent of respondents said the achievement of full
employment was either very important (83 per cent) or fairly important (13
per cent).
Fifty-five per cent believed full employment would never come about with the
government's current policies.
The TUC will unveil its programme to reduce unemployment next Wednesday.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Insurance solvency formula 'absurd'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE industry regulators were criticised yesterday over alleged
inadequacies in the way they assess the solvency of general insurance
companies.
Mr Andrew Paddick, director-general of the Institute of Insurance Brokers,
said the formula used by the Department of Trade and Industry to assess
solvency - net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income - was
'totally absurd'.
The institute, a trade association, was particularly concerned in view of
the deteriorating financial health of many UK insurers.
Mr Paddick explained that increased competition in the industry had rendered
the solvency ratio an increasingly inadequate guide to the ability of
insurance companies to meet claims.
Insurers could trigger falls in their solvency if they increased premiums
while, ironically, cutting premiums to uneconomic levels would be rewarded
with an increase in the solvency margin.
'Years ago, when tariffs kept rates stable and risks were properly
evaluated, it may have made some sense to use such a formula,' he said.
One small insurance company, which became insolvent earlier this year, had a
solvency margin of 71.4 per cent at the end of 1990. Mr Paddick said that
was more than four times the legal minimum.
He said brokers and other insurance buyers needed more detailed information
to assess the viability of companies with which they placed business.
Mr Denzil Curgenven, of Quest Insurance Research, a market research
organisation, said other factors were as important a guide to a company's
economic well-being as the solvency ratio.
These included the strength of the company's financial base, the details of
its reinsurance arrangements, the type of insurance it underwrote and the
size of its management expenses.
A new research service, published by the institute and Quest, provides
analysis on 70 UK insurance companies.
Mr Curgenven said: 'You can't judge a company on one factor, certainly not
in today's market. The fortunes of UK insurers have changed with bewildering
speed.'
Lancashire police yesterday made 16 arrests in connection with an alleged
fraud at the Preston offices of General Accident, the country's third
largest insurer.
The arrests were made after raids on 13 homes in north-west England. General
Accident confirmed that a member of its staff was among those arrested.
Police said that the alleged fraud involved false claims worth several
hundred thousands of pounds on 'third party' insurance policies which had
been made over a number of years.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Mixed marks for home work: Is teleworking is the future, or
merely the fantasy of futurists?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement that managers and professional staff at British
Telecommunications are to be allowed to apply to work from home must have
left many commuters wondering this week how they managed to miss the
revolution that makes 'teleworking' so apparently straightforward.
BT says the agreement it has reached with the managers' union, the Society
of Telecom Executives, could mean up to 8,000 employees becoming eligible
for the homeworking scheme. The company would continue to provide the same
pay and benefits to those who chose to work from home, as well as meeting
extra heating and telephone costs.
From the employee's point of view working from home brings obvious benefits,
such as extra flexibility in hours and the elimination of travelling time.
For the employer there is the prospect of cutting office overheads and
seeing productivity increase.
The teleworking revolution has clearly yet to happen. A handful of
companies, particularly those in the new technology field such as CPS, the
ICL software subsidiary, have a largely home-based workforce. Others have
introduced teleworking on an ad hoc basis to retain particular employees, or
are experimenting with small groups of workers. British Airways has just
finished a six-month trial with a dozen employees in its information
management department.
The Department of Employment says there are no authoritative figures for
teleworking. The first indication of how widespread it is will be available
in about three months.
The latest estimates, now more than 10 years old, showed between 1.6 per
cent and 2.6 per cent of the working population work from home. Those
figures cover every home worker, from the piece-worker who hand-finishes
garments to the management consultant.
If any company is able to operate large-scale teleworking it ought to be BT,
with its access to the latest technology. It is also in BT's interests to
lead by example and stimulate sales of the telecommunications hardware and
services that make teleworking possible. So it is surprising that fewer than
50 managers or professionals out of BT's workforce of more than 200,000 work
principally from home.
There has been a steady stream of BT publications and surveys extolling the
virtues of teleworking. The latest, The Economics of Teleworking, concluded
that productivity per worker increased by about 45 per cent when the switch
was made to working at home. It also argued national savings could be made
through lower commuting bills, fewer road accidents and less pollution.
The question is whether the teleworking revolution will ever take place  -
or remain a fantasy of futurists.
Mr Andrew Wilson, a researcher for Sussex University's Institute of Manpower
Studies, considers it is 'unlikely that there will be a wholesale
substitution of the workplace from the office to the home'.
In a report called Teleworking - Flexibility for a Few, he envisages a
future in which employees divide their time between the two locations. He
says: 'In this way, the distinction between 'home worker' and 'office
worker' will become less relevant as more and more people become accustomed
to carrying out part of their work outside the main office.'
Mr Wilson identifies a number of potential constraints on the wholesale
development of teleworking, among them the unwillingness of organisations to
alter their management techniques radically.
He points out that in the traditional office 'most managers tend to
supervise their staff by direct observation and monitoring'.
He adds: 'Managers are able to set tasks, prescribe objectives, monitor
feedback and assess performance with an immediacy that is not possible with
remote workers.'
Teleworking, on the other hand, demands more formalised management
procedures and may require an increase in the management time devoted to
each employee. The study quotes research into one of the longest-standing
teleworking operations, at FI Group, a software developer. This research
apparently revealed that each manager at the company supervised fewer than
half the number of staff managed by counterparts in other British software
companies.
The lack of visibility also has an effect on employees. The dangers of
individuals becoming lonely, and feeling deprived of the social advantages
of working with other people, are easy to imagine.
According to the Henley Centre for Forecasting only about half of employees
would want to work from home, even if their jobs allowed for it.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Overseas visitors' numbers rise 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of overseas visitors to Britain grew by 12 per cent to 7.8m in
the first six months of this year, according to figures issued by the
British Tourist Authority yesterday. Their total spending also rose by 12
per cent to Pounds 3.2bn.
The picture in June was less encouraging. Tourist numbers, at 1.6m, were 6
per cent higher than in June last year but spending was flat at Pounds 630m.
Tourism last year was affected by the Gulf War, which cut visitor numbers
and spending from 1990.
One of the biggest areas of growth in the first six months of this year was
the US, with 1.5m visitors, up 32 per cent from the same period last year.
The recent weakness of the US dollar means travel has become more expensive
for US citizens, and there are doubts that the first half's growth will be
sustained for the rest of the year.
The number of visits from western Europe reached record levels in the first
six months of the year, up 5 per cent to 4.82m. Travellers from the rest of
the world rose 21 per cent to 1.46m.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Names offered risk-spread plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the largest agencies at Lloyd's of London is to introduce a scheme
allowing Names, the individuals whose assets support underwriting at the
insurance market, to spread their underwriting risks more widely.
The scheme, which is being introduced by Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting
Agents, is similar to the members' agency pooling arrangements or MAPAs, the
introduction of which was recommended by the Rowland task force earlier this
year.
Like an MAPA, the Sedgwick Standard Programme will allow Names to support a
larger number of syndicates, reducing their exposure to syndicates that
perform particularly badly.
Mr Julian Crispin, the chairman of the agency, said the Sedgwick scheme,
which fits within the current regulatory framework at Lloyd's, 'should help
Names avoid peaks and troughs in their underwriting'. It was particularly
suitable for Names wanting to take a 'defensive attitude to their
underwriting'.
Demand from Names for a way to spread risks has increased after recent
losses have been concentrated among a small minority of Names, for example
in the catastrophe reinsurance market.
The authorities at Lloyd's have agreed to introduce MAPAs but are still
discussing the fiscal and regulatory implications with regulators.
Mr Crispin said it could take between two and three years to introduce MAPAs
 -the Rowland task force recommended that they be in place for the 1993
underwriting year.
Mr Crispin said as many as 600 Names whose affairs the agency currently
managed had expressed interest, and 200 Names had already agreed to
underwrite through the scheme in 1993.
On average Names underwriting at Lloyd's through conventional methods would
participate on between 10 and 15 syndicates. Those participating through the
programme will have a share in the 41 syndicates with which Sedgwick places
most of its business.
Each unit of the Sedgwick Standard Programme will comprise 41 syndicates
with a total capacity of Pounds 50,000. most Names would normally subscribe
for more than one unit. Other agencies could make similar initiatives as the
market seeks to persuade the 22,300 Names underwriting in 1992 to continue
their membership of Lloyd's.
Lloyd's said last week that 686 Names had resigned so far this year. The
number of open years at Lloyd's has nearly doubled in the last 12 months.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Receiverships on downward trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies passing into receivership and administration has
declined for the seventh successive month compared with the corresponding
period a year before, according to figures released yesterday.
There were 327 appointments in August compared with 474 in July and 464 in
August last year, an analysis by accountants Touche Ross, based on the
official London and Edinburgh Gazettes, has revealed.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said he remained 'cautiously optimistic' the downward trend would continue.
He stressed that the decline depended on lenders 'not losing their nerve'
about businesses' ability to survive.
The total number of appointments so far this year is 3,519 compared with
3,928 at the same time last year. Mr Morris estimated that with the current
trend there will be about 5,200 by the end of the year compared with 5,734
last year.
There remained many difficulties in the motor trade, hotel and catering, and
wholesale distribution, he explained. Manufacturing appointments declined to
79 for August, compared with an average monthly total of 120 in the year so
far.

<TEXT>
HEAD TEACHERS oppose government plans to introduce performance-related pay
for teachers, the National Association of Head Teachers said yesterday .
It published a survey by the independent Institute of Manpower Studies based
on 3,300 responses from a sample of 5,081 heads in England and Wales. The
survey indicated that heads were almost universally sceptical about
performance pay.
But the survey also found that heads felt the current pay system did not
give them enough scope to reward teachers. While just under half the
teachers in the schools of heads surveyed received an incentive allowance,
80 per cent of the awards were for extra responsibility. Only 3 per cent
were awarded for classroom performance and little use was made of other
flexibilities in the pay system.
The heads generally welcomed greater control over their school budgets but
there was considerable concern over additional workload and stress.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Bank silent on action against loans row man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ASIAN businessman whose 'interest-free loan' dealings are being
investigated by police was the subject two years ago of a Bank of England
injunction restraining him from taking deposits.
Yesterday the Bank could not say whether Mr Mohammed Ramzan's subsequent
business activities had been monitored or why the injunction had been
sought.
An official said: 'We are constrained in talking about our activities in
supervision in relation to any specific individual or institution.' She
confirmed that Mr Ramzan's company Moslem World Finance is not, and never
has been, an authorised institution under the Banking Act.
Moslems in many parts of England fear they have lost substantial sums
invested in the Bradford-based company, whose interest-free loans seemed to
satisfy the Koran's ban on interest-bearing dealings.
Mr Ramzan closed his Bradford office and disappeared about a month ago,
leaving behind many clients who claim he owes them substantial sums of
money.
Moslem World Finance appeared to offer Moslems a solution to their dilemma
of trying to reconcile the practices of western financial institutions with
the Koran.
The company promised that investors depositing an interest-free lump sum for
one year would then receive their money back, plus an interest-free loan of
three times that amount, which could be used to pay off their mortgages.
Some clients remortgaged their homes to raise the lump sum; several now face
repossession. It is unclear how many people invested in the scheme.
Mr Ramzan consented to the terms of the Bank's injunction obtained in the
High Court in August 1990.
West Yorkshire CID have sent an initial report to the Fraud Squad. Police
sources say inquiries are at an early stage but that the total sum involved
is likely to be more than Pounds 1m. Mr Liaqat Hussain, president of
Bradford's Council for Mosques, said he feared the amount invested could be
much higher.
Mr David Musa Pidcock, leader of the Islamic Party of Britain, and of a
committee formed by 34 investors who deposited between Pounds 5,500 and
Pounds 31,000 each, confirmed that Mr Ramzan had received lump sum deposits
in 1991 and this year.
The Central Register of the Securities and Investments Board said yesterday
that MWF's activities came to its notice in 1990. It decided it did not need
SIB registration as it did not appear to be an investment business. SIB
referred the case to the Bank of England, which regulates deposit-taking
business.
The telephone at MWF's office rang unanswered yesterday. Earlier this week
Mr Ramzan rang the Telegraph and Argus, Bradford's evening newspaper, saying
he was in fear of his life, but he declined to be interviewed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE woodland of the Scottish borders is the vista that greets City
investment analyst Tessa Tennant at her desk.
It is worlds away from London's Knightsbridge where, until January last
year, Ms Tennant, 33, was based as head of environmental research at Jupiter
Tyndall Merlin (JTM), the investment management arm of Jupiter Tyndall, the
fund management group.
Today she does the same job but works three out of every four weeks from her
home near Peebles. In her office, once the house library, antique furnishing
rubs shoulders with modern equipment.
Ms Tennant is a telecommuter. She said the trial arrangement, which ends
this month, had benefited both herself and her employer. This year she was
made a director.
Ms Tennant has worked for JTM for more than four years. About three years
ago she began managing Glen, the large estate and conference centre which is
her home. She also needed to spend more time with her nine-year-old son,
Euan.
Ms Tennant said: 'Much of the JTM work I do is research and involves a lot
of writing and reading. It is a job that can be done anywhere provided you
have a personal computer, fax and telephone.
'At the office you are too available - people are always popping in for ad
hoc meetings or chats. Many analysts find it quite difficult to sit down and
do research.'
Ms Tennant's working day starts when she takes her son to school. She then
knuckles down to work either for JTM or the conference centre.
The day ends in the late afternoon. She does not usually need to work until
five. 'I can easily return to my desk late in the evening.'
Mr Michael Heathcoat Amory, managing director of JTM, said: 'The arrangement
has worked perfectly satisfactorily.' He stressed, however, the importance
of Ms Tennant's monthly visits to London because of the need for personal
contact.
Ms Tennant said that the support of colleagues had been important to the
experiment's success. 'I have a very close working relationship with the
team in London. I have discovered that it is possible to function as a team
even if you are not all in the same room. It is a question of not letting
team-mates down.'

<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to issue a stern protest to Iraq after the discovery that Baghdad
has imposed a 10-year jail sentence on Mr Michael Wainwright, a Briton
charged will illegal entry into the country.
The sentence, which the Foreign Office described as 'totally
disproportionate', follows the jailing last week of another Briton, Mr Paul
Ride, 33, for seven years on the same charge.
The detentions come soon after the start of British, US and French air force
operations to police a 'no-fly zone' in southern Iraq and provocatively
recall President Saddam Hussein's policy of keeping westerners as 'hostages'
during the early months of the Gulf crisis in 1990.

embassy in London, will be summoned to the Foreign Office today 'with some
urgency' to receive an official protest at the sentence and a demand that Mr
Wainwright and Mr Ride be released.
Mr Wainwright, 42, was arrested in April near Mosul in northern Iraq after
entering the country from Turkey while on a cycling tour.
However, his detention was confirmed only last month after his family
received a letter from him explaining his plight of being detained in Iraq.
The scale of Mr Wainwright's sentence was learned at the weekend after he
was visited by Red Cross officials.
Mr Ride was arrested last month after having allegedly wandered into Iraq
from Kuwait.
The families of both men have denied they were spies.
Both men were visited in Baghdad's Abu Graib prison last weekend by members
of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who described them as 'in
good health and good spirits'.
A Red Cross spokesman said the pair appeared well treated.
Although the Foreign Office said 'all possible means' would be employed to
win the pair's release, the combination of Iraq's present hostility to the
west and its recent history of provocative intransigence bodes ill for any
swift release for the two men.
President Saddam said yesterday he was arming tribesmen in the southern
marshes to help them fight infiltrators from Iran who were taking advantage
of western air cover over southern Iraq, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
'We are sending a lot of weapons to the tribes,' the president said in a
ceremony honouring members of Iraq's ruling Ba'ath party and marsh tribesmen
who were said to have crushed an Iranian-backed infiltration attempt in
Qurna last week.

IRAQ's nuclear programme has been 'neutralised', the head of the latest
United Nations weapons inspection team said in Baghdad yesterday. 'It stands
at zero now,' said Mr Maurizio Zifferero.
Mr Zifferero, deputy director of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), said the programme had been rendered harmless both through the
efforts of repeated UN inspection teams and by allied bombing during the
Gulf war.
Mr Zifferero, who is heading the 14th visit to Iraq by UN nuclear
inspectors, said: 'We're completing our investigation of the (nuclear)
programme and find no evidence of the programme being continued.'
He added that the UN teams had searched for evidence that the Iraqis had
secret underground nuclear complexes but inspectors found nothing.
But IAEA officials in Vienna emphasised that tough UN inspections of Iraq's
nuclear-related sites and equipment would continue indefinitely.
Officials said some equipment remained to be destroyed under the terms of
the Gulf war ceasefire, while inspectors would also want to ensure that Iraq
did not covertly resume work on developing its nuclear potential.
The IAEA also says it has made no progress in persuading Iraq to reveal
either the procurement network which gave it access to highly sensitive
nuclear technology, or the identities of foreign experts believed to have
advised Iraq on its nuclear programme.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Beijing lifts many price controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has taken an important step towards liberalising the economy with the
announcement that price controls have been lifted on 593 items and
materials, ranging from soda ash to electrical machinery, agencies report
from Beijing.
The move will allow producers, most of which are state-owned, to determine
their own prices according to market conditions. It reduces the number of
commodities directly priced by bureaucrats in Beijing to 89 from the 737 at
the end of 1991.
While the reform falls short of establishing a fully free market, it
reflects how swiftly China has embraced a call in January by Deng Xiaoping,
the paramount leader, for economic reform and faster growth.
China yesterday raised its estimate for economic growth during the first
half of 1992 to a 12 per cent annual rate. Zou Jiahua, vice premier and head
of the State Planning Commission, said the growth rate, up from an earlier
estimate of 10.6 per cent and the original official 1992 target of 6 per
cent, would require further reforms.
Despite fears that the growth will push up inflation and cause a boom-bust
cycle, Zou said: 'Supply on the domestic market is ample and retail prices
are generally stable.' The national price index rose by 4.9 per cent in the
first half of 1992 against the same 1991 period, he said.
A State Price Bureau official, quoted by the official Xinhua news agency,
said the latest liberalisation of prices 'would not have too great an impact
on the prices of consumer goods'.

SOUTH AFRICA'S President F W de Klerk predicted yesterday that stalled
multi-party talks on a new constitution would resume shortly, as the troika
of EC ministers held their first day of meetings in Johannesburg aimed at
breaking the current deadlock.
The team led by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, lunched with
Mr de Klerk and later met Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress. Meanwhile, the ANC national executive continued to debate
the resumption of talks for the third day, in a meeting likely to last until
late last night.
It is expected to announce later today whether it will resume full-scale
constitutional talks, or continue limited bilateral contacts. These have
brought together Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, and Mr Roelf
Meyer, constitutional development minister, to discuss issues such as
release of remaining political prisoners and a general amnesty for apartheid
crimes.
Mr Hurd stressed that South Africans would have to resolve the nation's
political problems. 'It's not for Europeans to come and bang people's heads
together in South Africa.'

PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, his acting secretary of
state, will today complete a round of contacts with Middle East leaders
aimed at accelerating the peace process when negotiations resume in
Washington on September 14. The four Arab delegations yesterday agreed to an
Israeli proposal for a 10-day recess so that the teams could return home for
consultations.
When the sixth round of talks opened on August 24 it had been intended they
would continue without interruption for a month.
Mr Bush has been in contact with King Hussein of Jordan, who is in the US
recovering from surgery, while Mr Eagleburger is seeing the heads of
delegations.
All sides have been pleased by the improvement in the atmosphere at the
talks following the election of a new government in Israel, but there has
been little if any progress on issues of substance. There is concern among
the Arab delegates at what they see as the lack of involvement by the US
administration.
Earlier this week the Palestinian delegation said its talks with Israel were
at an impasse. Jordan complained that the Israelis had reneged on items that
should appear on a joint agenda, while the Syrians said they had not yet
seen an Israeli willingness to discuss 'land for peace'.
Israeli spokesmen have generally been more enthusiastic, especially about
the talks with Syria.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
meanwhile has again shown his disregard for American public opinion,
following his support for Iraq during the Gulf war.
He has appeared at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Jakarta hand-in-hand
with Mr Taha Yassin Ramadan, one of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's closest
colleagues.
Jordan yesterday hailed a message from King Fahd, the Saudi Arabian ruler,
to King Hussein as signalling a breakthrough in the countries' frosty
post-Gulf war relations.
Mr Mahmoud al-Sharif, Jordan's acting foreign minister, said the message had
'created an opening in the otherwise frigid relations in the two countries'.

MR YASSIR ARAFAT, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
yesterday criticised Israel for lack of progress at the Middle East peace
negotiations.
The PLO had expected Israel to 'take tangible, practical steps to push
forward the peace process. Alas, however, repression is still continuing,'
said Mr Arafat, addressing the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in
Jakarta.
The PLO leader said proposals presented last week by Israel included 'a
project for local administration aiming at whitewashing the occupation' of
Palestinian territory.
The role of the US in the Middle East was attacked by President Ali Akbar
Rafsanjani of Iran, while Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister,
criticised the US-led 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq.
Mr Rafsanjani said supporters of Israel 'have gained unprecedented and
shameless presence in the region on the pretext of protecting Kuwait' and
condemned 'the continuous interferences' by the US in the region.
Dr Mahathir said he was perplexed by the the 'no-fly' zone in southern Iraq,
set up to protect the Shia community from attack by Baghdad. 'Maybe there
are a lot of Shias in America,' he quipped.
Commenting on Yugoslavia, Dr Mahathir said the failure of western countries
to intervene is 'in stark contrast to the response to the alleged killings
of Kurds in Iraq . . . even when the evidence (of the killings) is not
clear'.
Some delegates fear Dr Mahathir's approach to north-south relations will
undermine the appeal by Indonesia, chairman of NAM, for a less
confrontational dialogue with industrialised nations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDIAN court ruling yesterday virtually quashed the investigation into
the Rs14.5bn (Pounds 256m) Bofors scandal after government agencies failed
to establish that the Swedish arms company had bribed the Indian government
to secure a big order in 1987.
The Delhi high court, in a 115-page judgment, quashed the complaint filed
against Mr Win Chadha, then Bofors Indian agent, and granted reprieves to 13
others, including Mr Martin Ardbo, former president of Bofors, and Mr G P
Hinduja, a British businessman of Indian origin.
The ruling also quashes requests by a special judge in 1990 to Switzerland
and Sweden seeking co-operation in the investigation.
The judgment noted that the Central Bureau of Investigation had failed to
name a single bureaucrat or politician as an accused in the case, 31 months
into the inquiry.
Allowing a petition filed by Mr Chadha, the court held the investigation
could 'not be allowed to continue' against Mr Chadha 'on the basis of
surmises and conjectures'.
The high court judgment comes at a time when the Geneva cantonal court was
to pronounce its crucial verdict on the Indian government's request for
access to information on Swiss bank accounts, which would reveal the names
of the beneficiaries, if any, of the alleged bribes.
Authorised signatories of the six frozen Swiss accounts have strongly
opposed the Indian government's plea, citing Swiss secrecy laws. The Geneva
court, which was to pronounce its judgment 'any day now' would probably
withhold it, according to the bureau.
The high court's judgment will damage the investigations abroad, bureau
officials feared, but they say they will continue. The bureau will appeal to
the Indian Supreme Court against the lower court's judgment 'as early as
possible'.
The Supreme Court is now legally bound to give the Dubai-based Mr Chadha a
hearing before disposing of the bureau's petition.
Opposition leaders expressed scepticism that the Bofors inquiry would ever
be fruitfully concluded with a Congress government in power. Mr George
Fernandes, former cabinet minister and leader of the Janata Dal, whose party
had promised to punish those involved in the Bofors scandal, said the
judgment was 'a direct challenge to the Supreme Court'.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Bush risks China's wrath with Taiwan jet sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday wooed voters in Texas by announcing his
decision to back the sale of up to 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan.
But although the announcement provides a welcome boost to General Dynamics,
whose Fort Worth plant manufactures the F-16 aircraft, it offers a
perplexing reversal to some key elements in the Bush admin-istration's
established foreign policy.
Since a 1982 agreement negotiated in part by then Vice-President Bush, the
US has scaled down its arms sales to Taiwan. With Mr Bush in the White
House, the administration has followed a policy that favoured closer ties to
mainland China, in defiance of congressional pressure for tougher economic
sanctions in response to repression of political dissent.
Administration officials argued yesterday that the sale of F-16s, which will
substantially upgrade Taiwan's ageing air force consisting mainly of
30-year-old F-5Es and 40-year-old F-5 fighters, is justified by the need to
maintain a balance of power after Russian sales of advanced Su-27 fighters
to mainland China.
'I think this is an area where we have a legitimate interest in assisting
Taiwan in terms of dealing with its security concerns,' said Mr Dick Cheney,
the defence secretary.
Beijing has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan, which has been
home to the Kuomintang Nationalists since they lost the civil war for the
mainland in 1949.
However, one of the principal arguments advanced by the administration for
not breaking with China over its repressive policies is the need to
encourage the Beijing government not to sell its own weapons elsewhere in
the world.
The real reasons for Mr Bush's reversal appear to lie more in the likelihood
that Taiwan, whose plans to develop its own fighter aircraft have made
little progress, would buy Mirage 2000-5s built by France's Dassault, and in
the resulting loss of jobs in Texas, a state which is regarded as crucial to
Mr Bush's chances of re-election.
'Here is George Bush choosing American jobs over his foreign policy
instincts. That's a shift,' said Dr Natalie Goldring, deputy director of the
British American Security Information Council and a specialist in arms
sales.
Some US officials are worried that the sale might so irritate the Beijing
government as to jeopardise even larger contracts in mainland China won by
other US aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
Others argue, however, that China is unlikely to react shortly before
Congress's annual vote on the renewal of its most favoured nation trading
status, and at a time when the US is threatening a wide range of sanctions
in retaliation for perceived trade abuses.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Japan's cabinet power remains in kitchen: Political
reputations are built on past favours and can survive bribery scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TITLES don't necessarily count for much in Japanese politics. The prime
minister may be one of the weaker members of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, while the most powerful politicians are often content to exercise
their influence in the backroom, only occasionally surfacing to take
positions of official authority.
As titles are no certain indicator of influence, resignations are no
accurate measure of a decline in power. Mr Shin Kanemaru resigned last week
as the LDP's vice-chairman, and yet he will remain the 'kingmaker' and the
'godfather', cultivating younger politicians by furnishing the funds they
need for election campaigns.
By title, Mr Kanemaru is the most senior politician to have been implicated
in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, a still unfolding saga of massive
payments, reckoned to be Y520bn (Pounds 2.1bn), to politicians and
government officials by ambitious executives at a parcel delivery company.
On Tuesday Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, the governor of Niigata prefecture north of
Tokyo, also resigned, though he too is likely to remain a politician of
importance, partly because of his strong local links and his personal
friendships with Tokyo's party powerful, including Mr Kanemaru.
The timing of these resignations is convenient for the LDP coming, not
surprisingly, after an upper house election in July in which the party was
particularly successful. The Tokyo prosecutors pursuing the Sagawa case have
a reputation for independence, but they also have a habit of intensifying
their investigations in the wake of an election.
Mr Kanemaru admitted that his office had received Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa,
though he claimed to have rejected an initial overture from the company and
discovered, much to his surprise, that his office workers had accepted the
money. And Mr Kaneko denied receiving funds, but was forced to resign after
his office workers told prosecutors that they saw at least Y100m in Sagawa
donations. Apart from stepping down from the official party post, Mr
Kanemaru promised that he would resign as head of the party's largest
faction. Having since been told by faction members that this move would
'create confusion', Mr Kanemaru, in a characteristically vague and mumbled
explanation, insisted that he would resign but said he dislikes 'confusion'
 -meaning that he may remain at the helm.
The departure of the two office-bearers marks either the real beginning or
the possible end of the Sagawa scandal. Mr Kanemaru's admission that his
office accepted Y500m means a possible breach of the Political Funds Control
Law, which limits companies to donations of Y100m to one party or individual
in a year.
If prosecutors pursue Mr Kanemaru over this payment and attempt to prove a
violation, it will be clear that the Sagawa scandal is far from over. The
maximum penalty for a violation of the funds law is a hardly punitive
Y200,000, but more significant would be the public humiliation of Mr
Kanemaru, and the likelihood that other LDP leaders would be pilloried,
delaying their turns at the top of government.
And if the prosecutors are truly enthusiastic in the pursuit of Sagawa
funds, they may find embarrassing links between the LDP and gangster groups.
Ordinary Japanese take for granted that the party's far right has regularly
done business with gangsters, but the illumination of murky links between
mainstream LDP leaders and the gangs would stir controversy.
Mr Masaya Ito, a political commentator, said Sagawa offers a good
opportunity to expose the gangster links, as employees of the parcel company
appear to have acted as an intermediary between a gang boss and a leading
LDP member: 'This could be the first time we can clearly see this linkage.'
A gangster controversy would not necessarily lead to substantial changes in
Japanese politics, although a gangster scandal provoked upheaval in the
securities industry last year. On becoming prime minister, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa promised that 'political reform' would be a priority, but his
predecessor, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, was dumped because he showed unexpected
reformist zeal and because he forgot that titles do not confer power in the
LDP.
The LDP's success at the upper house election means Mr Miyazawa is likely to
serve out a two-year term, but the latest revelations have failed to inspire
him to renew the call for political reform, which is intended to make
politics less expensive and less prone to the Sagawa-style scandals.
Making politics less expensive means undermining the influence of the likes
of Mr Kanemaru, whose authority comes from their long-term cultivation of
younger, needy politicians.
Unless prosecutors launch a series of high-profile bribery cases, having
established that Sagawa money was swapped for legislative favours, the
scandal is unlikely to threaten the LDP's hold on power. Conveniently, the
leading opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, is also implicated.
Meanwhile, Komeito, the Clean Government Party, has suggested that all
corporate donations to politicians be banned, a change that would certainly
work to its benefit. The right-leaning Komeito receives funds through Soka
Gakkai, a lay Buddhist group whose leader is perceived by his followers to
be not only a 'godfather', but a god.

GENERAL Mohammed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's most powerful warlord, said
yesterday he opposed a United Nations Security Council resolution passed
last Friday ordering the deployment of a further 3,000 blue berets in his
country.
But he stopped short of past threats that he would attack armed UN troops
who entered the territory he controls without his consent.
'This decision has been announced without consultation . . . and without our
consent and we believe it will not be constructive,' he said in Bardere,
300km west of the capital Mogadishu. 'We believe we can solve the security
situation by our own means.'
He urged the international community to feed his gunmen and help rebuild a
police force instead of dispatching foreign troops to Somalia, where Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, is expected tomorrow as head of
a three-hour European Community fact-finding mission.
Gen Aideed conceded that some of his forces had been involved in banditry
and looting of relief food destined for starving civilians, including last
Friday's chaos at Mogadishu airport where gunmen carried off 300 tonnes of
food and 199 barrels of fuel. 'They are hungry,' he said.
Minutes away from the general's headquarters, hundreds of children are
facing imminent death from starvation. Mothers struggled to gain entrance to
the guarded gates of feeding centres where Somali relief workers dished out
gruel.
At a centre at a disused hospital three children and six adults died before
noon yesterday. Their limp bodies, wrapped up in castaway sacks from bags of
food aid, were brought out and paraded before reporters.
The UN World Food Programme has so far flown in four C-130 Hercules flights
to Bardere carrying food. Another German aircraft was due to arrive
yesterday.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Trickle swells to a flood: Japanese carmakers are stepping
up their advance into Europe and threatening the domestic industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first engine is due to roll off the assembly line at Toyota's Pounds
140m engine plant at Deeside, north Wales, next week, heralding the next
wave of a formidable assault by Japanese carmakers on the European car
industry.
The array of Japanese vehicle plants and new models poised to enter
production in the UK, Hungary, Italy and Spain was planned in the late
1980s, when car demand in west Europe was accelerating powerfully, with
record sales every year from 1985.
The extra capacity from Japan is about to hit the market, however, when the
European appetite for buying new cars is succumbing to economic
retrenchment. Sales are weakening in important markets, while some, such as
the UK, remain stubbornly mired in recession.
Now Europe's indigenous carmakers - busy building plants of their own and
already wringing much higher output from existing facilities as part of a
determined drive for greater productivity - are confronting the spectre of
rapidly growing overcapacity.
Japanese vehicle production capacity in Europe is expected to exceed 1.2m a
year by the end of the 1990s. European car production totalled 12.7m last
year with the Volkswagen group accounting for 2.44m and Renault, the
smallest of the big six volume carmakers, for 1.55m. Japanese carmakers
captured 12.3 per cent of west European new car sales of 13.49m last year
and this is forecast to rise to between 16 and 20 per cent by the end of the
decade.
The battle with the Japanese carmakers is about to be joined in earnest by
Honda and Toyota, who start up their first European car plants during the
final three months of the year. Both are located in the UK, which the more
staunchly protectionist European auto industry leaders such as Mr Jacques
Calvet, chief executive of Peugeot, the French carmaker, have likened to 'a
Japanese aircraft carrier just off the coast of Europe'.
Toyota and Honda are developing a total capacity to produce 300,000 cars a
year by the mid-1990s at the UK plants, and the figure could easily double
by the end of the decade.
The UK is not the only Japanese springboard into Europe. At Esztergom, 40km
north of Budapest, the first Suzuki Swifts are also set to leave the line of
Magyar Suzuki's more modest assembly plant this autumn, while in northern
Italy, Daihatsu will begin production by the end of the year of small vans
and pick-ups at its joint venture with Piaggio.
Back in Britain, Nissan, which pioneered the route for the Japanese motor
industry into local car production in Europe during the mid-1980s, is about
to launch its second UK-built car range.
The Toyota, Honda and Suzuki plants may start slowly, but the Nissan example
shows how fast the trickle will become a flood. Japan's second largest
automaker began car production modestly enough in Europe in 1986, but it is
now pulling out all the stops to stay a jump ahead of its Japanese rivals.
Output of 125,000 Primera large family cars in 1991 is planned to rise to
175,000 this year as Nissan adds the new range. Production is planned to
surge to 270,000 in 1993 as the plant rapidly approaches its presently
announced capacity of 300,000 cars a year, and the company has already
indicated its ambition of reaching 400,000 cars a year in the UK by 2000.
While it is Nissan's growing UK operations that claim much of the limelight,
the company is also investing heavily in Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish
commercial vehicle maker, in which it acquired majority control a decade
ago. From 1990 to 1995 it is putting Pounds 600m into Spain. This month it
is starting European production in Barcelona of its new Serena multipurpose
vehicle - rival vehicles planned by Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot are
still a couple of years away from launch - while in the spring the company
will roll out a new-generation four-wheel-drive vehicle.
As a sign of this changing order in Europe, Nissan will supply part of its
Spanish output of the four-wheel-drive vehicle to Ford for sale in Europe
under the Ford badge.
The link between the two in Spain shows how quickly the arrival of Japanese
vehicle makers in Europe is set to move on to a more sophisticated plane, as
the world's automakers further refine their global square dance of competing
in some regions of the world, and linking arms in others.
Rapidly mounting research and development costs are the impetus behind new
alliances, and even the industry giants are being forced to find partners.
Volkswagen of Germany is poised to finalise a deal with Suzuki for the
production of a range of small cars in Spain.
The Japanese carmaker, a leading minicar producer in its domestic market,
will engineer the new cars for production at the Barcelona plant of Seat,
VW's Spanish subsidiary. It will replace the outdated Seat Marbella. Output
is expected to start in 1995, with a target volume of 150,000 cars a year.
While protectionist-minded volume carmakers in Europe might have preferred a
comfortable existence behind the import barriers, life in the global auto
industry is no longer so simple.
The Japanese vehicle makers have set up their own local plants inside the
barriers. At the same time, less protectionist European producers are
scrambling to gain their own Japanese links to win some competitive
advantage, or to help overcome earlier failures.
While VW studies its link with Suzuki, Rover, formerly British Leyland, has
fallen gratefully into the arms of Honda, and Volvo, the ailing Swedish
carmaker, has sought refuge for its medium-sized cars with Mitsubishi Motors
in a joint venture in the Netherlands.
Honda, in addition to its own UK car and engine plant, also holds a 20 per
cent equity stake in Rover's vehicle operations, and Honda technology
essentially underpins all Rover's new cars launched since the mid-1980s.
Volvo has brought Mitsubishi in as a joint-venture partner at its Dutch
plant, where a new range of cars - badged both Volvo and Mitsubishi, but
mainly engineered by the Japanese carmaker - will emerge in the mid-1990s.
The deals may vary, but the driving forces for the Europeans are the same:
the imperative to improve production technology and create more
cost-effective new products.
Waking up to their competitive deficiencies, European carmakers have been
engaged in an intensive campaign of so-called 'benchmarking' to measure
themselves against the world's best standards - and then to try to close the
gap. Five years ago they had to look to Japan for the standards, but
Japanese carmakers' global expansion means that the competition has now
arrived on their own doorstep.
When the Japanese assault on Europe was first planned, the European motor
industry focused on the fear that the Japanese would build a series of
'screwdriver' plants in Europe with minimal local content.
The fear was naive. In the event Japanese plans are proving much more
ambitious and their roots in Europe will go much deeper. They are in the
process of constructing a top-to-bottom manufacturing system, and they are
already meeting UK requirements for 80 per cent local European Community
content.
Even as the concrete is drying at the assembly plants, the leading Japanese
producers are also pressing ahead with the establishment of research and
development facilities in Europe, where they will be able to engineer
locally some future models exclusively for Europe, as well as draw
increasingly on local European component suppliers.
The Japanese share of the west European new car market ranged from 2.7 per
cent in Italy to 14.8 per cent in Germany and 45.2 per cent in Ireland. The
overall share is now set to rise rapidly through the 1990s as:
remaining barriers to direct imports from Japan are eased and then removed,
local Japanese production capacity in Europe is expanded, and
new Japanese supply sources for Europe are developed in North America, Asia
and Australia.
The pattern is complex, but already Honda and Toyota are shipping cars to
Europe from their US plants, while Mitsubishi is about to start exporting
cars from Australia to Europe. Maruti, the Indian carmaker in which Suzuki
holds 40 per cent, is carving out a niche in southern Europe with a car that
is a clone of the Suzuki Alto. Proton, the Malaysian national carmaker, is
already claiming almost 1 per cent of the UK market with cars based on old
Mitsubishi technology.
Japanese carmakers' finances may be weakening, but the assault on Europe can
only be slowed marginally. It will not be reversed.
The model for Europe is already evident in North America. Following
investment of about Dollars 7.5bn in assembly plants in North America in the
1980s - eight in the US and three in Canada - the Japanese transplants'
total car and light truck production capacity is planned to reach some 2.7m
vehicles a year by 1993-94.
According to Professor Dan Jones and Mr Jim Womack, co-authors of the
ground-breaking auto industry study, The Machine that Changed the World,
'nothing like it has ever occurred in industrial history.
'In effect between 1982 and 1992 the Japanese will have built in the US
Mid-West an auto industry larger than that of Britain or Italy or Spain and
almost the size of the French industry. By the late 1990s the Japanese
companies will account for at least a third of North American automobile
production capacity - perhaps much more - and have the ability to design and
manufacture entire vehicles in a wholly foreign culture 7,000 miles from
their origins.'
A similar description could well apply to Europe in the year 2002.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Leading Article: The French referendum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS long and remarkable career, Francois Mitterrand can never have taken
a gamble more important, or more daring, than the referendum on the
Maastricht treaty. If the 'oui' vote wins, and particularly if that victory
is by a large margin, ratification will at least be relaunched, though the
treaty will remain far from safe harbour. If it is to be 'non', the
Maastricht treaty will have been sunk, with incalculable consequences for
the future of Europe.
If the president's ambition was merely to discomfort his conservative
opponents, it was a grievous fault and grievously does he - and France  -
seem likely to answer for it. But the referendum had a higher justification
and a nobler purpose. The Maastricht treaty did, indeed, need to be
reaffirmed by one of Europe's great nations if it was to regain the momentum
lost when the Danes voted against it last June.
Such a reaffirmation may not now be forthcoming. Some might view that
possible outcome as simply a sad result of Mr Mitterrand's hubris and the
periodic French impulse towards regicide. But all of Europe's leaders would
bear more responsibility for a 'non' than that. The case that they needed to
make was that the European Union would underpin prosperity and security in
the new Europe. Unfortunately, perhaps unfairly, failures in the former
Yugoslavia have identified the EC too closely with a lack of security.
Equally, because of the ERM, many Europeans have come to associate the EC
with deflation rather than prosperity.
Errors have been made, both outside the treaty and within the treaty itself.
But the errors are not large enough to justify its downfall. The Maastricht
treaty is the culmination of 40 years of European construction. It is
certainly the culmination of 10 years of successful efforts to relaunch the
EC and of four years of particularly intense discussion of economic and
monetary union. Rejection by France, one of the two central pillars of the
EC, would bring that forward march to an abrupt halt, for years, possibly
forever. It could lead to a relapse into unbridled nationalism and even to
disintegration of the EC.
In the short term, financial markets would be shaken. The ERM would come
under still greater strain. Interest rates, both short and long term, would
diverge and realignments might become inescapable. Those who put their trust
in the prospects for Emu would have to reconsider their plans. Countries
such as Italy and Spain, for example, which have made convergence on Emu the
centre-piece of their macroeconomic policies, would find themselves adrift.
Even the almost completed single market would look more doubtful.
Everything would have to be reconsidered: management of the relations of
other European states with Germany, the EC's monetary regime, the prospects
for enlargement and the EC's relations with the rest of the world. Worse,
all these would have to be re-examined at a time of slow growth and more
than just nascent xenophobia. The Maastricht treaty is flawed. But the
alternative would surely be far worse.
This is why the referendum matters. It is why the FT intends to devote a
special effort to covering it. It is also why this newspaper, in keeping
with its traditional support for the integration of Europe, hopes the French
will vote yes.
But it does so subject to two provisos. First, the EC should not proceed as
if nothing had happened, even if the Maastricht treaty were ratified. The EC
must be particularly cautious if the treaty receives no more than a small
positive affirmation. Subsidiarity must become a living reality, not just a
slogan. The convergence criteria will have to be implemented with tact and
discretion. No timetable for convergence towards Emu must be allowed to
override economic common sense. And, more immediately, if currency
adjustments are required, so be it.
Second, the downfall of the Maastricht treaty, should that occur, must not
be allowed to mark finis to all that Europe has achieved in the postwar era.
The loss of this treaty would be a misfortune. To allow it to lead to the
collapse of the EC or even to an outbreak of mutual recrimination and
disorder would be worse than folly. The French referendum is inescapably
important. But rejection does not have to be a disaster.

<DATELINE>
   THE SCHOOL inspectors' verdict on this year's results for GCSEs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the main examination taken by 16-year-olds in England and Wales - is
damning. Their report has 'little confidence that standards are being
maintained' and detects a decline since the GCSE was introduced in 1988.
Last week's headlines trumpeted record pass rates with more than ever before
at the higher grades. Now pupils, parents and employers are left wondering
about the worth of devalued GCSE certificates.
Some had already warned that five successive years of improved results
seemed too good to be true - especially the rise by more than a quarter in
the numbers of grades A to C, which were supposed to be the equivalent of
the old O-level pass. The inspectors' report therefore confirms what many
teachers privately admit - that standards have slipped with the new exam.
Mr Patten, the education secretary, has announced an inquiry, with a view to
changes for next year's exams. However, some of the problems identified by
the inspectors are already being tackled. Able pupils can now take more
demanding papers, following criticisms that the GCSE was insufficiently
stretching. The top grade is to be split in two to give further incentives
to the most able. And the amount of course work - which is harder to monitor
 -is to be restricted.
The most important objective for Mr Patten's inquiry must be to ensure that
the four examining boards set exacting standards which are uniformly applied
between subjects and between different groups of pupils. Only if it is clear
just what sort of achievement is represented by a particular grade will
employers and others be able to use GCSE results as a worthwhile yardstick.
The minister should, however, ignore those who want to restore the O-level
exam for the brightest. The GCSE provides a single standard by which the
achievements of 90 per cent of pupils can be measured - even if the
measurement process needs improvement. Employers certainly do not want to
return to O-levels, as this week's statement from the CBI makes clear.
Indeed, there is a case for a more broadly-based examination at 18, capable
of testing a much higher proportion of school-leavers than the A-level exam.
Essential to such a change would be confidence that the top grades of the
new exam offered similar levels of achievement to the A-level 'gold
standard'. That confidence will be hard to win unless the standards of the
top GCSE grades are re-established.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Top pay rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWS of a further moderation in the rate of pay increases awarded to -
or taken by - the chairmen and other directors of most of Britain's largest
companies is welcome, if not surprising in view of the effect which the
recession is having on many bonuses. Only a few months ago, after years of
mounting controversy over the rate of salary increases, directors of large
companies were rightly attacked by the British Institute of Management,
among many others, for taking unacceptably big rises.
There is some dispute about the average increase in the total remuneration
of each company's highest paid director for the most recent financial year.
One specialist remuneration consultancy reports it to be around 8 per cent
and falling, while a different survey service calculates it to be only 2 per
cent. What matters is that shareholders and employees should feel there is
more equity between movements in directors' pay and those of the company's
staff as a whole. The 'performance pay' of directors also needs to be seen
to be moving roughly in line with corporate performance - down as well as
up.
The fact that this is now happening in more cases does not mean that the
problem of excessive pay rises has somehow gone away. Nor does it lessen the
need for a much tougher disclosure regime than proposed in the Cadbury
Committee's code.
The regime should be similar to rules recently proposed by the US Securities
and Exchange Commission. These would require the remuneration packages of
the five highest paid directors to be disclosed, and divided into nine
separate components, including stock options.
In the UK only a tenth of companies disclose the overall amount paid to
directors in bonuses, and just 3 per cent show how these are calculated. The
case for official action is obvious.

MADE IN AMERICA: MY STORY
By Sam Walton
Doubleday, Dollars 22.50. 269 pages
Being an American folk hero is a tricky assignment, as Ross Perot found out.
The problem is that the great American public likes its boot-strap
entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright. In a country where business
practices are not overly genteel, this is a tough combination to achieve. A
vast media circus, meanwhile, is quick to expose any flaws.
Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart chain of discount supermarkets who died
of cancer in April, negotiated these pitfalls much better than most. When,
in 1985, Forbes magazine declared him America's richest entrepreneur, the
paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of Arkansas, mainly occupied by
chicken farmers, where Walton made his home. What they found was a happily
married, much-liked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting, breakfasted at
the local Holiday Inn, and drove a battered pick-up truck, minus two
hub-caps. Folksy was an understatement.
Since then, some aspects of Wal-Mart's business - its anti-union policies,
the impact of its Dollars 40bn annual sales on hundreds of Mom-and-Pop shops
 -have been subject to critical scrutiny. So, to an extent, have the less
wholesome adventures of the four Walton children. But no one has ever been
able to make Sam himself look bad. The worst that has been said is that he
was rather dull.
Walton is not about to dash anyone's illusions. Readers will either find his
autobiography lashed with 'good ol'' common-sense and a lot of harmless, if
charming, anecdotes. Or they will find it dreary and downbeat. Walton makes
no excuses: 'I realise this may sound boring to most you,' he writes at one
stage, 'but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
. . .'
A few snippets are more revealing about the character. There cannot be many
billionaires who admit that they 'never learned handwriting too well' - and
have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point.
Meanwhile, the competitive energy which Sam Walton applied to his business
is inescapable. In one of many contributions from friends and family, Don
Soderquist, Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, tells of finding Sam one
Saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local Kmart store, analysing
his rival's stock. And his wife, in a casual aside, notes that when the
couple was on holiday in Italy their luggage vanished while her husband was
off on a similar scouting mission.
But it is David Glass, Wal-Mart's current chief executive, who perhaps
captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best. Explaining the annual
contest in which Wal-Mart executives choose one 'volume producing item' to
promote, he recalls the time Sam (who usually won) selected minnow buckets
for carrying bait. Glass was more happily teamed with apple juice. 'So I
would go down to the stores, and get them to take that minnow bucket . . .
put ice in it, ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow
bucket. I particularly did it in stores I knew (Sam) was going to visit. It
drove him crazy, and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick . . . .'
But the reader can't help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the
truth. Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged
himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern
sweet called Moon Pies.
For the most part, this makes for an engaging, if one-dimensional, portrait.
Occasionally, it just grates. 'I had bought a bank in Bentonville, for about
about Dollars 300,000,' Walton remarks, for example, 'just a little old bank
with only about Dollars 3.5m in deposits. But it helped me learn a lot about
financing things.' Oh, come on Sam, is that the whole story?
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when
Walton admits that 'if I hadn't gotten sick, I doubt I would have written
this book'. Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars
4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he
can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it. But these are unlikely to be
circumstances which make for the most critical self-analysis. At the end of
the day, Sam Walton's heritage is in the shopping malls, not the bookstores.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HERE is something extraordinary
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a work of theatre that seems wild but proves tightly organised, which is
funny and painful at the same time, which operates on three separate planes
at once. The company is the Catalan troupe Els Joglars. Its Edinburgh
performances are also part of the European Arts Festival. Yo Tengo un Tio en
America (I Have an Uncle in America) is deeply humane, bizarre and a triumph
of imagination and craftsmanship.
The scene is a psychiatric institution. Six therapists give their eight
patients drama therapy and have them re-enact the conquest of America by the
Spanish. The therapy and the conquest also include the inculcation of
flamenco dance. Does this sound strange? What makes it stranger is that
everything is presented from the point of view of the patients. They are a
pathetic bunch, and Yo Tengo makes no attempt to give them dignity or
beauty. But each is a vivid individual, strongly characterised from from the
first.
The plain, ugly individuality of the patients (or native Americans) is
contrasted with the glamorous conformism of the therapists (or
conquistadors). Espasa, with his encyclopaedic mind; Paqui, a nymphomaniac
obsessed with pregnancy and giving birth; Manolo the visionary; Conde the
pyromaniac; the autistic Jordi, who communicates only through music.
They make a pretty daft kind of New World, but they lose themselves in it so
entirely that we do too - and when the therapists suddenly order them to
snap out of it or back into it, they and we are stunned. The therapists
participate in the fantasy, and this heightens the derangment.
They dance flamenco - isn't dancing therapeutic? - but flamenco is also a
disciplined, Spanish form, which becomes a symbol of invading
authoritarianism. One patient comments 'The Spanish are folkloric even when
they conquer.' Eventually the patients dance flamenco too - it's a necessary
step towards conformism.
The patients throw themselves into the fantasy, and each brings his or her
own obsessions into visualising Old America. Paqui cries out, of the
Spanish, 'They are coming in their ships] They are coming faster than I can
give birth]' She becomes the mother of the tribe - the Paqui tribe.
Later, deep in the forest, at the end of a long scene when all the patients
are immersed, Conde uses his lighter to help them. In marches a therapist in
a white coat, and confiscates the lighter. Resignedly, he says, 'Now I know
I am mad.' (Speech is in Spanish; there are a few, helpful surtitles.)
One could analyse the meanings of Yo Tengo un Tio en America at length - its
implications about Catalonia and Spain are unmistakable - but what makes it
so exceptional is its detailed inner life.
Els Joglars are wonderful, rare performers. They catch all the absurdity of
the patients, and never tug at your heartstrings. The ironic result is that
we are far more moved by their plight than if they had played for sympathy.
This isn't one of those shows that claims to celebrate the human spirit with
a load of monotonous over-acting. In Yo Tengo you see the human spirit the
way it is - as a living mass of peculiar and interacting details - and you
are amused, pained and enthralled.
At the Royal Lyceum Theatre until September 5

ON Monday night, in an otherwise heavyweight programme (Elgar's Second
Symphony and bleeding chunks from Die Meistersinger), Felicity Lott sang
Hugo Wolf songs. Six of his best, indeed, and particularly enticing because
we were hearing them in their rare orchestral versions: Andrew Davis took
the BBC Symphony through them with scrupulous finesse.
Though the Albert Hall is not the ideal place for appreciating Wolf's
subtleties, the entire set was a pleasure to hear. At least 'Kennst du das
Land?' is on a near-operatic scale, especially with Wolf's dramatic
orchestra; and the vernal thrills in 'Er ist's' were so vivid as to risk
concealing the voice.
The charming 'In dem Schatten meiner Locken' should be operatic, since Wolf
orchestrated it for use in his opera Der Corregidor - but in practice, the
original piano accompaniment can be more teasing and playful than is
possible for a whole band.
In fact the introspective songs gained most from their new guise. There is
nothing fancy in Wolf's orchestrations, but he selected plain timbres to
unerring effect: sonorous horns for the benedictory dawn of 'In der Fruhe'
(not really a soprano song, though), flutes for the wistful thirds-motif in
'Anakreons Grab'.
Morike's little prayer 'Gebet', too, glowed beautifully (just strings,
woodwinds and soft horns). As ever, Miss Lott's clean-lined sympathy and
poise were faultless.
*****
BETWEEN unprepossessing Hamilton (his Concerto for Orchestra) and Dvorak
(the Seventh Symphony), the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra's prom on
Tuesday provided one of the truly memorable experiences of the current
season.
Isabelle Vernet sang Berlioz's Les Nuits d'ete with such unfailing sense of
line and effortlessly burnished, unforced tone she disarmed all criticism.
The accompaniments were handled tactfully by Takuo Yuasa; he recognised
there was no need to gild an already resplendent lily.

International Festival

<TEXT>
WHEN Riccardo Chailly announced a Rossini encore to mark the composer's
bicentenary at the end of Monday's concert, somebody in the row behind me
exclaimed, 'But the Beethoven was just like Rossini already]'. Whether out
of jest or annoyance it was not clear, but there was some truth in his
remark.
The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra's transformation is complete. The days
when it played with deeply-considered sobriety under Bernard Haitink seem a
long way off. With Chailly, the orchestra still gives serious performances,
but it is serious about different things - about clarity and beauty,
lightness of touch and Italian effervescence.
In the two concerts they gave in Edinburgh, nothing suited Chailly and his
players better than the 20th-century works, Webern's Passacaglia and Berio's
Requies. The Berio, an elegy upon the death of the composer's former wife,
moves like an angel in flight. Its quicksilver blendings of wind and strings
float along as though no bass sound can hold them down and finally they
disappear altogether in a flutter-tongued flute solo. The piece could not
have been played with more ravishing delicacy.
Whether the same virtues are as welcome in Haydn and Beethoven is
questionable. There was no jovial rough-and-tumble in Chailly's perfectly
manicured delivery of Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony. For example, it is
difficult to give the surprise ending of the Minuet any punch, when every
twist of the music has been prepared so assiduously in advance.
In Chailly's hands, both Haydn with his earthy humour and the reputedly
uncouth Beethoven became cultured gentlemen. The latter's Fourth Symphony,
the main work in the first concert, was exquisite in every detail, but it
lacked guts and drive.
One wanted to go up on stage, grasp the drumsticks and give the timpani a
jolly good thwack. Only an Italian, though, could make the slow movement
sing so eloquently. And the finale was marvellously lucid, with a twinkle in
the eye.
For the Beethoven work in the second concert, the conductor had chosen his
partner well in Maria Joao Pires. Neither is the type of performer to make
Beethoven sound ponderous when he is not in the mood to be. Their combined
sensitivities resulted in a beguiling performance of the Fourth Piano
Concerto, and Pires, in particular, managed to commune with the soul of the
music without sounding in the least precious.
Then to Tchaikovsky, the festival's omnipresent composer of the year.
Panache, virtuosity and plain force, all had to be brought into play here,
as Chailly can when he wants to, and the Fifth Symphony went with plenty of
excitement, wanting only the remarkable passion that the St Petersburg
Philharmonic had brought to its native Tchaikovsky when visiting the week
before.
These reservations apart, Chailly is a good musician and the Amsterdam
orchestra sounds as impeccably groomed as ever. Their Rossini encore,
incidentally, was a delight.
When the Royal Concertgebouw arrives in London, I recommend that the Proms
audience applaud long and loud to hear it.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: A thriller built on sand - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHITE SANDS, Roger Donaldson
KNIGHT MOVES, Carl Schenkel
THE POWER OF ONE, John Avildsen
STRAIGHT OUT OF BROOKLYN, Matty Rich
COUSIN BOBBY, Jonathan Demme
WHITE SANDS is a thriller that will grip only those keen on deducing how a
veteran director and strong cast could produce such a dud. Willem Dafoe is a
small-town New Mexican sheriff who stumbles on a corpse clutching a
briefcase full of money on his desert beat. He sets out to investigate the
crime on his own - a rash decision that soon brings him into contact with
rogue FBI agents, a lovely con woman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and a
shady arms dealer (Mickey Rourke). Dafoe soon finds himself both a suspect
in the investigation and a target of the assassins.
Though the first few minutes suggest a good if conventional crime story,
director Roger Donaldson and writer Daniel Pyne soon tangle matters in a
forest of tenuous exposition and improbable plot twists. Worse still, gaping
holes in the story are filled with vapid mumblings about CIA conspiracy and
the 'military-industrial complex'. Dafoe's laconic style allows him to keep
his dignity throughout, though Mastrantonio's bemused mugging is out of
place, and Rourke looks as though his bag of tricks is just about empty.
Another thriller that fails dismally to thrill is Knight Moves, a
bloodlessly schematic tale of chess and serial killing. Enigmatic Grand
Master (Christopher Lambert, woefully miscast) is forced to match wits with
a maniac who is carving up young women on the Washington State island where
a chess tournament is in progress. The police suspect Lambert may be
committing the crimes, so they enlist a young psychologist (Diane Lane) to
probe his psyche. Her examinations move from sofa to sauna to bed.
Writer Brad Mirman and director Carl Schenkel are so intent on carrying
through their strained metaphors of criminal gamesmanship that they
sacrifice character to bad dialogue and implausible motivation. People move
through the film with the stiff determinism of chess pieces. Lane's
character is particularly absurd, a supposedly astute psychologist, without
apparent thought or scruple, jumps into bed with a man suspected of
slaughtering young women.
The Power of One is a standard coming-of-age film that strives
unsuccessfully for importance by setting itself in 1940s South Africa. It
tells the story of PK (Stephen Dorff), a young white orphan who is
transformed by events from a bed-wetting schoolboy into a champion boxer and
anti-apartheid activist.
After his father is run over by an elephant, our hero is sent to an
Afrikaner boarding school where his English ancestry makes him the subject
of horrific bullying. He spends most of his time at the local prison, where
he is taught to box by an wily old inmate (Morgan Freeman). Then it's off to
a posh college, where he falls in love with the daughter of a racist
minister. The story ends with him forgoing a place at Oxford in order to
teach English in the townships.
The film could have conceivably worked as a crudely energetic boy's tale,
had its makers not tried to pack it with a political message. But by setting
it in South Africa, director John Avildsen, who brought us Rocky and The
Karate Kid, dissipates whatever power his story may have possessed.
A far more credible depiction of the black experience can be seen in
Straight Out of Brooklyn, the first effort by 19 year old writer/director
Matty Rich. The film portrays a family on New York City's notorious Red Hook
housing estate. The father, Ray (George T. Odom), is an embittered service
station attendant who drinks to drown his sorrows, leading him to batter his
long-suffering wife. Ray's son Dennis (Lawrence Gilliard Jr) is a bright
young man who, fearing a future as bleak as his father's, decides to help
the family move straight out of the ghetto by robbing a local drug dealer.
Although the film is filled with honest energy and some impressive moments,
Rich is too inexperienced to bring these elements together in a compelling
framework. He fails to develop the film's key father-son relationship, so
that we wonder why Dennis would remain devoted to a brutal wife-beater.
Another eyewitness account of New York's desolate ghettos comes in Jonathan
Demme's Cousin Bobby. Demme's last undertaking, The Silence of the Lambs,
was one of the great critical and commercial successes of recent cinematic
history. So what does he do for his next project? - a low-budget 16mm
documentary about his cousin, a crusading priest in Harlem.
Father Robert Castle is a Sixties relic, a man who once gave Black Panthers
sanctuary in his church and cannot speak more than three sentences without
referring to institutional racism or social justice. Nowadays, he's fighting
the good fight in upper Manhattan, trying to stem the tide of drugs and
crime that is destroying whole neighbourhoods, organising everything peace
marches to a campaign to fill holes in the road.
The film seems more a series snapshots of a life than an overall picture.
Demme fails to get to the heart of the man. There is also a nagging sense of
futility and melancholy about the reverend's undertakings - cousin Bobby's
only real accomplishment in the film is to get a pot-hole filled. It proves
a fitting metaphor for a man who once fought to change the world, but now
must content himself with plugging a few gaps.

said to be the world's highest paid academic. He advises companies, even
countries, on how to be more competitive.
The Climbers is a solid and sober yet highly entertaining series about

Nomads is the first of four 60-minute documentaries about desert peoples.
Today's programme shows the life of a family in Mauritania in the western

Guess what Channel 4's Check Out 92 decided was the most pressing subject at
the start of a new series. The great British grocery rip-off? The British

FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Tamburlaine the Great
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTOPHER Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great contains some of the most
wonderful passages of verse in English drama. No one can forget the line 'To
ride in triumph through Persepolis,' nor Tamburlaine's tributes to his
consort Xenocrate. Yet the play is very rarely done professionally. It went
through the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries without a recorded performance.
The Yale University Dramatic Association revived it in an abbreviated
version in 1919, and since then it has remained a favourite with
universities. The only previous performance I have seen was at Oxford.
The Old Vic staged it in 1951 with Donald Wolfit as Tamburlaine under the
direction of Tyrone Guthrie. Peter Hall produced it for the National Theatre
in 1976, when Tamburlaine was played by Albert Finney. The new production at
Stratford directed by Terry Hands is the first time that the Royal
Shakespeare Company has touched it, and one begins to see why performances
are so few and far between.
Tamburlaine is played by Antony Sher, which is part of the problem. Sher has
many qualities, including an ability to hang upside down on a rope while
speaking his lines and a way of stuffing emotion into killing and dying. But
he does not seem particularly interested in speaking verse. This is a
serious lapse, for the quality of some of the verse is the most that can be
said for Tamburlaine. Untune that string and, to quote another play, hark
what discord follows.
Unlike Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, the play has no real plot and very little
subtlety. Tamburlaine, drawn from the historical character Timur Khan
(1336-1405) simply goes on conquering till he dies. The play's attraction is
the way he puts his overwhelming ambition into poetry - 'I hold the Fates
bound fast in iron chains' - and equally his expression of love for
Xenocrate, daughter of the Soldan of Egypt, whose land he also conquers.
To be fair to Sher, it is not entirely his fault for not taking the poetry
as central. Tamburlaine comes in two parts. University productions tend to
concentrate on part one, where the conqueror is on the up and up and has his
best lines. The RSC version, though condensed, gives parts one and two. The
best scenes between Tamburlaine and Xenocrate are spread across both, and it
is only in part two when she is dying that Xenocrate (played by Claire
Benedict) comes into her own. Tamburlaine has a lot of fighting to do in
between and after.
Sher plays him as a demonic Hitler figure, possibly with a touch of Saddam
Hussein. He should not be unduly criticised for that either. Only
undergraduates would romanticise Tamburlaine as a man. Yet they do that for
an understandable reason: he speaks romantic verse, some of it foreshadowing
Keats, as in the lines beginning 'If all the pens that ever poets held'.
There is one point in the production where Sher's performance is admirable.
That is Tamburlaine's desire to return to Samarkand, the place from whence
he came, before he dies. He fails to make it. Here Sher is in his element. I
had not previously seen this as a pivotal part of the play. I also greatly
admired the performance of Darlene Johnson as Zabina, the wife of Bajazeth,
the emperor of Turkey whom Tamburlaine imprisons in a travelling cage. Here
is one piece of dignity in a vicious world.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Accountancy Column: Hopeful travellers should not miss boat
next time - How audit opinions could be backed by other action to prevent
another Land Travel debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORT probing letter arrived earlier this week at the office of a small
firm of chartered accountants in Bath, in the latest investigative salvo
from Mr Nigel Griffiths, the Labour party's international trade and consumer
spokesman.
It highlights the much broader issue of the adequacy of the government's
existing mechanisms for detecting signs of trouble in companies -
particularly those which are of public interest because they have many
employees or a large number of individual customers.
The subject of Mr Griffiths' letter was Land Travel, the tour operator which
went into liquidation in July leaving more than 200 irate customers out of
pocket and without their holidays. The accountancy firm was Shaw &amp; Co, the
auditor to the company.
The question was simple: what steps did the firm take to draw the attention
of the public and the authorities to the financial plight of the company?
Shaw &amp; Co is keeping silent about its response at present, while the partner
most involved in the audit is away on holiday. But it has said it will
provide an answer.
Meanwhile, Mr Griffiths has already had a detailed response from Price
Waterhouse, which was auditor to the company until August last year.
The Land Travel case does not lend itself to the all too frequent charge
levelled against the embattled accountancy profession: where were the
auditors? In this case they appeared to be very much in the forefront.
PW's letter to Mr Griffiths is instructive for two reasons: it is damning,
and it is based on public information. The firm says its audit opinion for
the financial statements for the six months to March 31 1990 was
'extensively qualified'.
It said it could not be satisfied that the company was a going concern
because liabilities exceeded assets by Pounds 2.1m; nor was it certain that
Pounds 1.6m of debts and deferred expenditure were recoverable.
'Our audit opinion is unambiguous and expresses very clearly our concerns
about the viability of the company,' the letter continues.
The information it cites is, as the firm points out, on the public record in
the accounts filed with Companies House, the government's corporate
information agency.
So is the subsequent - and unusually long - audit opinion for the year to
March 31 1991, from Shaw &amp; Co, which concludes that the firm is unable to
state whether the accounts present a true and fair view.
It stresses that the company had made a loss of Pounds 1.8m and had net
liabilities of Pounds 4.1m, offset by long-term loans of Pounds 2.4m and a
statement by Mr Valere Tjolle, the director, that he was confident that the
company's trading position had since improved.
In fact, just one month after this statement was signed, Mr Robert Buller
and Mr Michael Gerrard of Grant Thornton were appointed as liquidators. They
told creditors that there was little chance of receiving any of the more
than Pounds 12m they were owed.
Despite the warnings in the accounts, the news clearly came as a great shock
to most of those members of the public attending the meeting, including one
who poured water over Mr Tjolle and another who threw torn copies of the
company's brochures into his face.
With hindsight, there were a number of warning signs in the accounts which
creditors and potential creditors could have read which might have caused
them to query any exposure to Land Travel.
First, there are the auditors' qualifications and the notes and figures in
the accounts. Second, the fact that Price Waterhouse - one of the largest UK
firms - resigned last year as auditor to be replaced by a local firm. Third,
that the accounts were filed extremely late: the 1989 and 1990 years were
signed off and delivered to Companies House together in July 1991.
There is also a confusing saga in the previous few years of changing
ownership, altered financial year-ends, loans from the holding company, and
a previous period in which Shaw &amp; Co was auditor.
Both the auditors and the Department of Trade and Industry take satisfaction
from the fact that all this information is available to the public. But the
likelihood of ordinary customers of a company being able to find it out or
interpret it is minimal.
The DTI says that it is has certain discretionary powers to investigate
companies, but it must have substantive information before taking action -
and that there were no complaints with regard to Land Travel in advance of
the company's collapse. It argues that it would be impossible to scrutinise
all the 1.1m sets of accounts filed each year. Meanwhile, Companies House
performs an essentially clerical function, ensuring that accounts are filed
but spending very little time scrutinising the information they contain.
The question is whether a more active system of detection and scrutiny is
required. After all, if Land Travel had been a quoted company, it would
probably have been suspended from the stock market and investigated, and
generated wide publicity, because of its net liabilities. Should not a
similar system be in place for non-quoted companies? A start would be for
Companies House to regularly and publicly circulate lists of companies which
have not filed their accounts on time, have changed auditors, moved
year-ends or which show qualified audit reports.
The agency has already considered offering 'triggered' searches which would
alert users as soon information is received from companies. But its recent
decision to cancel its ambitious computerisation project which would have
allowed documents to be electronically scanned and 'read' will make this
difficult in the short-term.
A more practicable option - favoured by Mr Griffiths - is for a change in
guidelines to require auditors to alert regulators to the accounts which
they qualify. Only about 6 per cent of audit opinions were qualified or
contained special comments last year according to a recent survey, meaning a
far smaller pool from which to start work.
There would also clearly need to be a unit - probably within the DTI - to
cope with the extra work involved in dealing with these notifications and
investigating the companies concerned. There would have to be clear
guidelines about exactly what questions they could ask, what action could be
taken. A wider issue is exactly how far the government should be involved in
this process. But a strong case could certainly be made for those companies
with influence over many members of the public, whether employees or
customers.
Mr Robert Buller, the joint liquidator for Land Travel, is sceptical of
these proposals. He believes that the trade creditors to the company were
aware of the financial position, and that the DTI does not have the
resources to cope with all the additional scrutiny which would be required.
In his view, a more pressing case for reform to help the individual
customers affected by the collapse would be compulsory bonding for travel
agents.
However, Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, is
receptive to the idea of drawing attention to qualified accounts, although
he says it would probably require a change of legislation. He suggests that
there might be an 'accounts ombudsman' to which auditors would send copies
of any accounts they qualified for further investigation once the
information was lodged with Companies House. 'It would be a load off
auditors' minds,' he says.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Keeping us sweet in
the long run - NutraSweet's decision to sponsor the London marathon is part
of a broader strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, it seems odd that NutraSweet this week opted to sponsor the
annual London marathon. After all, the company - which makes low-calorie
sweeteners - has only ventured into sponsorship deals twice before, for
tennis in the US and ice-skating in Europe.
NutraSweet's European operation - with its headquarters in Switzerland  - is
a joint venture between the US company of the same name and Ajinomoto, the
Japanese life sciences company. It started marketing its product in the UK
in 1983. Ewan Currie, NutraSweet's marketing director in Europe, says the
marathon sponsorship deal is partly a public relations exercise to mark a
decade's trading in the UK.
But the drive to boost an already successful brand name is fuelled by
increased competition on the horizon; marketing strategy is coming to the
fore.
NutraSweet is the brand name given to a combination of two amino-acids
which, in contact with saliva, taste like sugar. Indeed NutraSweet claims
its formula tastes more like the real thing than saccharin, cyclamate or
other chemical low-calorie sugar substitutes.
First developed in 1965, NutraSweet gained US regulatory approval in 1981,
followed by UK approval in 1983. Since then the company, which in the US is
owned by Monsanto, the agri-chemical giant, has ballooned. Now sold in 90
countries, NutraSweet is poised to take advantage of opening doors in
leading European markets.
Currie bases his expansionary hopes on the experience in the UK; in 1991, 27
per cent of all soft drinks sold in the UK were low-cal, and NutraSweet's
share of that market is about 20 per cent.
In Europe, the average person annually consumes 25-85 litres of soft drinks;
in the US that figure is a huge 180 litres. Moreover, in the US 30 per cent
of all soft drinks are low-cal and NutraSweet supplies almost 100 per cent
of that market. The only other permitted sweetener in the US is saccharin,
but all products using saccharin are required by the Food and Drugs
Authority to carry a health warning.
In Europe, NutraSweet's upward path was blocked until this year; low-cal
soft drinks in Italy and Spain account for no more than 3 per cent of the
market. Regulatory approval - in France in 1988, Germany 1990, and in Italy
and Spain this year - is now opening the way for expansion.
In European markets where NutraSweet is available, it has proved popular,
and to meet growing demand, it intends building a factory at Gravelin in
France.
NutraSweet has become an international brand in just over a decade, with
Dollars 900m (Pounds 452m) annual turnover in 1991, Dollars 85m of that in
Europe. Market leaders in many countries now formulate products with 100 per
cent NutraSweet, including Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi and Schweppes slim-line
tonic.
But that growth has been fuelled not just by a successful product. A variety
of marketing strategies - including placing the NutraSweet logo on products
which use it as an ingredient - has boosted both its brand profile and that
of the main product. NutraSweet as an ingredient currently has its logo on
more than 2,000 products internationally.
Currie gives an example: 'We gave a test group a sample. We poured half a
can of Diet Coke in one glass and half of the same can in another and said
'here are two different versions of Diet Coke to try'. The result was that
56 per cent said they preferred the version with the NutraSweet logo, 39 per
cent chose the other, with no NutraSweet logo. Of course Diet Coke is a
tremendously powerful brand name but even with that we can make a
contribution to perception of the product.'
Thus Currie hopes that the Pounds 4m NutraSweet is spending on sponsoring
the London marathon for the next two years will boost his company's brand
profile and that of manufacturers which use it. NutraSweet spends Dollars
10m a year on pan-European advertising but backs that up with continuous
consumer research and samplings; the first UK television advertising
campaign, in 1985, was supported by samples sent out to 8m homes.
But NutraSweet is facing the prospect of increased competition. The US
patent on NutraSweet expires in December, and four other types of sweeteners
are awaiting US Food and Drug Administration approval - sucralose,
acesulfamine-K, alitame and cyclamate, with the likelihood that sucralose -
(by McNeil Speciality Products, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson) will gain
FDA approval first.
There are two technological means by which NutraSweet could face down the
competition.
One is the technologically tricky problem of finding an effective bulking
agent to use in chocolate and confectionery. Removing sugar from
confectionery removes not just calories but also bulk.
A less intractable area concerns baking. Manufacturers of baked products
looking for low-cal ingredients to replace sugar find that baking separates
NutraSweet's amino-acids, defeating the chemistry which lies behind its
success.
Although NutraSweet is now developing NutraSweet 2000, which Currie promises
will be up to 20,000 times sweeter than sugar (against NutraSweet's 180
times) and will not break down during baking, it needs to capitalise on its
brand name while the competition gathers pace. Marketing initiatives - like
the London marathon - are part of its strategy to stay ahead of the pack.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The creative
department is brought to account - French media agencies are fuming over
efforts to clean them up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is the most ludicrous piece of legislation I've ever seen,' said the
head of one leading Paris advertising agency. 'It's a scandal,' snarled
another. 'If this thing actually becomes law, it'll be a disaster, the
industry will never survive,' said a third.
The object of their scorn is the apparently laudable attempt of the French
government to crack down on business corruption, one of the first
initiatives announced by Pierre Beregovoy when he became prime minister in
the spring. The first fruits of Beregovoy's campaign were unveiled last week
when Michel Sapin, his successor as finance minister, produced la loi Sapin,
his proposals to stamp out dubious practices in a number of industries -
including advertising.
Sapin's aim is to clean up the ad industry by making sure that advertising
agencies and media buyers are thoroughly accountable for the money they
spend on their clients' behalf.
One target of la loi Sapin is 'undisclosed discounting', whereby large
French agencies and media buyers use their power to negotiate bulk buying
discounts - anything from 20 to 50 per cent of the full price - from media
owners and do not pass all, or any, of the money on to their clients.
Another is 'double invoicing', whereby the agencies ask the media owner for
two invoices - one for the client, which does not reveal the discount, and a
second showing the real value of the deal.
The government's solution is to try to eliminate both practices by insisting
that media owners are paid directly by the clients and separating the
functions of the media buyers, who book space for ad campaigns, and media
brokers, who buy space and sell it on to their own clients.
To an objective observer this all seems eminently sensible. The French
advertising industry has, after all, always had a slightly risque
reputation.
Undisclosed discounting and double invoicing have long been common industry
practice. To some extent they are the predictable product of any
self-regulated industry where large sums of money change hands. The big US
and UK agencies are wont to be snooty about business standards in France,
but similar practices are rife in New York and London.
Until recently, the French government was prepared to turn a blind eye. But
the advertising industry has expanded so fast in the past decade and the
scale of media buying deals is now so much bigger, that the authorities have
been forced to act.
France is the world's fifth largest advertising market, worth just under
FFr48bn (Pounds 5bn) last year. The market has been transformed since the
late 1980s, mainly due to the government's television deregulation drive
which has included the privatisation of TF1, the biggest single station, the
creation of three new private channels, as well as the development of a
cable and pay-TV network. The press has also been expanding.
This has made media buying more complex and more competitive, thereby
enhancing the potential to play one media owner off against another through
negotiation. A new breed of specialist media buyers has emerged, notably
Carat, which has built on its original base in France to become Europe's
biggest single buying group. Other large agencies have responded by joining
forces to pool their media buying.
French media buying is now dominated by four players - Carat, the Euro:RSCG
agencies and two agency consortia, PMS and The Media Partnership - with a
collective market share of 70 per cent. The emergence of these big buying
groups has intensified the pressure on smaller agencies, as well as on the
media owners.
The government's first response was to initiate an inquiry into the media
buying system by the Conseil de la Concurrence, the competition authority.
The conseil delivered its preliminary report earlier this summer and is
expected to produce final proposals within the next few months. La loi Sapin
is an unexpected addition to the legislative changes facing the industry.
The large agencies and media buying groups are furious. Delegations of
fuming advertising executives have already complained to the finance
ministry. Publicly the agencies refuse to comment on la loi Sapin. Privately
they accuse the finance ministry's proposals of everything from failing to
understand the mechanics of their business, to being an unwarranted
intrusion into their affairs.
Some of the complaints are justified. The division between media broking and
buying, for instance, may be difficult to implement. It is not clear how the
government proposes to structure the new system - whether broking and buying
would be conducted by completely separate companies, or if they could be
executed by different subsidiaries within the same group. Sapin's proposals
are similarly ambiguous in the details of implementing other measures.
In other respects the advertising industry appears to be attempting to
defend the indefensible.
It remains to be seen whether the government will heed the industry's
objections. La loi Sapin enters its second stage on Wednesday when it will
be discussed by the French cabinet, followed by a full parliamentary debate
next month.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Business Law: EC merger regime defies expectations of
critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL BRANDENBURGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Communities Merger Regulation is almost two years old and the
European Commission has received over 100 applications for clearance under
its provisions. What lessons have been learned so far?
The processes are working well. Before the Regulation came into operation,
the business community and lawyers alike were highly sceptical as to whether
the Commission could transform itself from the slow, bureaucratic body it
was perceived to be into an organisation capable of dealing with the
fast-moving timetable of a takeover or merger.
The Merger Task Force - the newly created unit within the Competition
Directorate (DGIV) dedicated to merger control - has confounded the critics.
It has shown itself capable of adhering to the tight timetables laid down by
the Regulation.
The task force operates an open-door policy, encouraging parties to a
proposed merger and their legal advisers to discuss their proposals with
task force officials 'early and often'. Liaison between the Commission and
the competition authorities of the member states appears to be working well.
The Regulation is proving benevolent to mergers. They are being reviewed
solely against competition criteria rather than wider social policy issues.
Only nine of the clearance applications have gone to the full investigation
stage and, of those, only one - Aerospatiale/De Havilland - has so far been
blocked.
While generalisations are difficult at this early stage, it is interesting
to speculate about whether some of the results would have been the same if
the transactions had been reviewed by the domestic competition authorities
instead of by the Commission.
All in all, few of the difficulties anticipated at the outset have
materialised. While the task force has not been tested to the extent that it
would have been if the Regulation had come into operation a couple of years
earlier - at the height of the late 1980s' takeover boom - it is,
nevertheless, interesting that its achievements are having a spin-off effect
on the rest of the Competition Directorate.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, recently announced that
he was considering the introduction of accelerated procedures for cases,
particularly joint ventures, under Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty,
similar to those under the Merger Regulation.
But there are some difficulties. One relates to determining which types of
joint venture are 'mergers' within the scope of the Regulation (for example,
Thomson/Pilkington) and which are non-mergers coming within Articles 85 and
86 of the EEC Treaty (for example, Apollinaris/Schweppes). Knowing a merger
when you see one may be an inevitable starting point, but revised guidelines
from the Task Force would be helpful.
Another difficulty relates to determining whether the Regulation applies to
a particular transaction. Sir Leon has said that 'the Merger Regulation
provides an excellent example of how subsidiarity can be put into practice .
. . the allocation of jurisdiction between the Commission and the member
states is clearly based on this principle'.
Whatever the theory, answering the practical question of whether a
transaction is above or below the relevant thresholds is often not easy. Sir
Leon's suggestion that there should be one notification form which could be
filed with either the Commission or member state authorities is, perhaps,
recognition that identifying the correct 'shop' in which to 'stop' may never
be entirely easy. Some generally applicable guidelines from the task force
would also be appropriate.
Reflecting the concept of subsidiarity, the thresholds are intended to bring
within the ambit of the Regulation only those mergers which have
Community-wide (or, at least, cross-border) effects, leaving those mergers
which have an impact on only one member state to be scrutinised by the
competition authority of that member state.
Thus, the Office of Fair Trading examined Lloyds Bank's interest in Midland
Bank while the Commission looked at Hong Kong and Shanghai's bid.
The Regulation can also apply in some unexpected situations:
It can apply even though neither of the parties to a transaction has
headquarters in the EC. So long as the aggregate worldwide turnover of the
parties to the merger exceeds Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.62bn) and the aggregate
EC-wide turnover of each of at least two of the parties exceeds Ecu250m, the
Regulation will apply to the transaction (unless each of the parties to the
transaction achieves over two-thirds of its EC-wide turnover in the same
member state).
Thus, the Regulation applied to, for example, Mitsubishi's joint venture
with Union Carbide, Matsushita's acquisition of MCA and AT&amp;T's bid for NCR.
Conversely, the Regulation can apply even where both of the parties to a
transaction are based in the same member state as in, for example,
Steetley's proposed joint venture with Tarmac and Thorn EMI's acquisition of
Virgin Music.
The Steetley/Tarmac decision also illustrated another form of subsidiarity
under the Regulation. If the Commission considers that the merger in
question related to a 'distinct', rather than an EC-wide, market, it can
'refer' the transaction to the relevant member state's competition authority
rather than examine it itself. Thus, there was a reference to the UK Office
of Fair Trading and Monopolies and Mergers Commission in Steetley/Tarmac
(bricks and clay tiles) but not in Thorn EMI/Virgin Music (music).
The Regulation can also apply where only one of the parties to the
transaction has its headquarters in the EC provided the thresholds
summarised above are reached. Thus, the Regulation applied to Du Pont's
acquisition of man-made fibre businesses from ICI and to Nestle's bid for
Perrier (although both purchasers are Swiss companies).
Nestle's bid for Perrier is likely to be remembered, however, for a
different reason - recognition that the Regulation applies to oligopolistic
(or collective) dominance as well as to single firm dominance.
The Regulation does not expressly mention the concept - effectively, a
presumption that competition is inhibited in a market with only a few
players - although the concept is recognised, to varying extents, in German
merger control law (Oligopolmarktbeherrschung) and in UK monopoly control
law (complex monopoly).
In Thorn EMI/Virgin Music, the presumption was rebutted. The Commission
noted that, although the Thorn EMI/Virgin Music market share would be less
than 25 per cent in nearly all member states and in the EC as a whole, the
industry was highly concentrated with the top five companies (including
Thorn EMI post-merger) having an 83 per cent EC market share. But, after an
initial examination, the Commission cleared the transaction on the basis
that the merger could not fundamentally change conditions of competition in
the industry.
In Nestle/Perrier, by contrast, the Commission concluded that the
elimination, as a result of the merger, of Perrier as a competitor in the
mineral water market in France and the resulting duopoly employed by Nestle
and BSN would have significantly impeded competition. The conditions
accepted by Nestle to secure clearance from the Commission are designed to
create an independent third force in the market.
With collective dominance firmly on the Merger Regulation map, there are
likely to be implications for merger activity in a wide range of highly
concentrated industries, not least recently privatised industries in the UK.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Mowlem to seek bids for airport stake: London City expected
to suffer operating loss of Pounds 3m this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM, the UK contractor and housebuilder, plans to sell part of its
90 per cent stake in London City Airport, the loss-making airport in
London's Docklands.
Mowlem said yesterday it had received a number of approaches from potential
UK and foreign investors interested in acquiring a stake in the airport.
The company would not disclose the names of possible new investors. Mr Roger
Sainsbury, a director of Mowlem, said there had been 'pretty detailed
conversations' with one group of investors and expressions of interests from
other parties.
Mowlem, which has appointed Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, to
evaluate the offers, said it would be prepared to sell a controlling
interest or a large minority stake in the airport. But it intended to keep a
sub-stantial stake of its own in the venture.
The decision to consider selling a large stake in the venture coincides with
what Mowlem considers a turning point in the fortunes of the Docklands
airport.
It follows the introduction of jet services at London City in April. The
completion of a Pounds 5m extension of the airport's runway expanded the
range of aircraft able to use it. The airport had earlier been restricted to
small turbo-prop aircraft.
Improvements in road access to the airport have also made London City more
attractive.
The airport is still operating below its break-even point of 400,000
passengers a year.
Mr William Charnock, the airport's managing director, said about 200,000
passengers were expected to use the airport this year, but traffic was
forecast to increase sharply in the last quarter with the introduction of
new jet services.
Mr Charnock said the airport expected to reach its break-even point next
year.
It was expected to make an operating loss of about Pounds 3m this year.
Mowlem has invested about Pounds 37m in the airport, which opened in October
1987. The asset is currently valued at about Pounds 20m in Mowlem's books.
The company estimates the replacement value of the airport at about Pounds
50m.
Mr Sainsbury said the decision to consider selling a stake in the airport
was not driven by balance-sheet needs. A sale would not take place unless a
satisfactory price was agreed, he said.
Mowlem, while not forced to sell, would welcome the cash. The group, like
many construction companies, has been hit hard by the recession in UK
residential and commercial property markets.
Pre-tax profits last year fell from Pounds 34m to Pounds 3m, leading the
group to reduce its total dividend by half from 21p to 10.5p.
Its financial position has improved following a Pounds 46m, one-for-five
rights issue at 265p a share in April last year. Yesterday the group's share
price closed at 66p, up 2p.
At the end of December Mowlem had net debt of just Pounds 60m, representing
28 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 215m.
Gearing, however, is expected to rise this year due to poorer trading
conditions.

FT  03 SEP 92 / BREL renamed ABB Transportation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BREL, the train manufacturing arm of British Rail privatised in 1989, was
yesterday renamed ABB Transportation following the acquisition of a
controlling stake in the business earlier this year by Asea Brown Boveri,
the Swedish-Swiss engineering group.
The company said the new name was intended to reflect a change of image.
However, the loss of Brel's independent identity is likely to reinforce
fears that Britain's biggest trainmaker is destined to become little more
than a local assembly plant for ABB's products.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Pavilion too far vexes the mandarins: A look at the future
of Britain's Expo '92 showpiece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH pavilion at Seville's Expo '92, which has been widely acclaimed
as the event's showpiece, faces an uncertain future.
Government officials and potential investors are apparently unable to make
up their minds about what to do with it once the fair ends in mid-October.
The government has faced increasing lobbying from the British Science and
Technology Trust - a charitable group which counts Lord Forte, Lady Thatcher
and Lord Palumbo, the chairman of the arts council, among its trustees - to
move the pavilion to the grounds of London zoo.
Lord Palumbo has also put forward a proposal to have the pavilion sited
beside the Design Museum near London Bridge.
There have been approaches from Kent County Council - which wants the
pavilion near the Eurotunnel rail terminal at Ashford - and from the
National Energy Trust based in Milton Keynes.
The British Science and Technology Trust project, which would house an
environmental technology centre and a three-dimensional cinema, is
understood to have received the tacit backing of senior management at the
zoo and the Department of the Environment.
But the trust has been unable to raise the necessary financial backing for
its project and has said that it is unwilling to meet any of the costs of
the relocation.
Professor Paul Cook, president of the trust, said the government should be
persuaded that the plan would best serve the national interest by providing
a home showcase for British environmental technology, as well as possibly
helping the zoo out of its financial difficulties.
'We think the scrap value of the building is Pounds 1m,' Prof Cook said. 'We
are not prepared to pay Pounds 1m. We want it given to us. It would become a
fantastic exhibition centre which would stand on its own two feet.'
But the Department of Trade and Industry, which paid Pounds 15m for the
pavilion to be built by Trafalgar House just over a year ago, appears
anxious to strike a hard bargain over its disposal.
In Seville chartered surveyors Healey and Baker are working on the
department's behalf to attract firm offers from around the world for the
pavilion, which boasts a 70-metre water wall as a facade and has an internal
volume as big as St Paul's Cathedral.
Healey and Baker said that Monsanto, the multinational chemicals
organisation, was one of three groups studying a possible acquisition that
would keep the building in its present position as part of a future research
and development park being planned on the site of the Expo by the Spanish
government.
Other national pavilions in Expo were built as temporary structures or, in
the case of those housing the Italian and French exhibits, as permanent ones
that will be maintained after the event by public money.
Denmark managed to sell its stylish pavilion to a Japanese group before it
was even set up on the Expo '92 grounds.
The sale of the British pavilion is proving difficult partly because there
is not a clear price for its transfer to the UK and partly because there is
no clear guidance from the Spanish government on any fiscal incentives which
may be connected with the future R&amp;D park.
Interested parties in the UK are also faced with considerable additional
costs involved in converting the pavilion's air conditioning and cooling
systems, built for the Seville summer, into central heating.
An alternative energy supply for the water wall would have to be devised. At
present it is powered by solar panels, meaning that the British weather
would reduce the familiar sheet of water to something akin to a trickle from
a leaking tap.
Healey and Baker has set a guide price of Pounds 2m to Pounds 3m for the
building and a cost of Pounds 2m for its transfer to the UK. It has received
no firm offers.
Pressure appears to be on to secure a solution that would prevent the
award-winning building, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw, being sold as scrap.
Under regulations agreed to by all the participating countries in Expo '92,
the five-storey building will have to be knocked down if the DTI fails to
dispose of it by the end of March next year.

FT  03 SEP 92 / 'Secrecy' claim over Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLEGATIONS of excessive secrecy were levelled at the government yesterday
over the planned move of Department of the Environment officials to London's
Docklands.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow minister for local government, accused the government
of suppressing reports about the state of the department's Marsham Street
headquarters, and about the full range of other possible sites.
The department is due to leave Marsham Street by the end of next year and
has published a shortlist of four possible new locations, including Canary
Wharf in Docklands.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, Mr Straw
contrasted the behaviour of the government in not publishing information
with the stated policy of 'open government' as expressed by Mr William
Waldegrave, the public service minister.
Mr Straw drew attention to empty office space available in and around
Westminster, both in the private sector and in government buildings soon to
be vacated, such as Alexander Fleming House in south London.
There was, he said, an estimated 6.56m sq ft of empty office space in
Westminster.
Unless the government was more open about the information on which it based
its decisions, there would be doubt about whether the balance of financial
advantage was really as ministers stated.
'There is a nasty whiff around the Docklands move, made much more pungent by
all this secrecy,' he added.
'If the Tories now reckon that taxpayers' money should be used to bail out
overblown Docklands property development, they must do so openly.
'This private, secretive decision making with other people's money - the
public's - is an abuse of power,' he said.
The department said some of the information had not been published because
it was commercially confidential.
Other buildings under consideration for the department's future location are
Thomas More Square, East India Dock and Harbour Exchange.

Mr John Spearman, chief executive of the new station, to be launched on

The new station, which will broadcast on a range of frequencies from 100-102

<TEXT>
SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, director-general of the BBC, insisted yesterday that
he would continue in his job until the end of his contract, contrary to
recent reports, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Sunday newspapers had suggested that Sir Michael would go early to clear the
way for Mr John Birt, director-general designate, and that Radio 2 and Radio
5 faced closure.
Sir Michael said yesterday that he would remain director- general until his
contract ended next February, adding that there was no plan to scrap any BBC
radio channel.
He said the BBC would set out a clear vision of its future shortly after the
government published a planned green paper in the autumn.
Sir Michael said there would be a restatement of the role of BBC governors
and management, implying that the governors would stick to strategy and
appointing top executives.
The reports on Sunday followed a public row between Mr Michael Grade, chief
executive of Channel 4, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman. Mr Grade
attacked BBC management and governors at the Edinburgh Television Festival
last week for a 'pseudo-Leninist style of management'.
Mr Hussey responded by describing Mr Grade as 'a Bourbon in red braces'.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Broader scrutiny of accounts demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is pressing the government to introduce mechanisms to scrutinise
companies in financial difficulties such as Land Travel, the tour operator
which went into liquidation in July.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said yesterday he would
call on the Department of Trade and Industry to examine all company accounts
about which auditors express doubts.
He also wants auditors to be required to notify the DTI directly of their
concerns once accounts have been filed.
UK company legislation requires the accounts of all 1.1m limited liability
companies to be examined by independent auditors each year.
Accounts must be 'qualified' if auditors have doubts about the financial
information provided by the company or the prospects for its survival. About
6 per cent of accounts were qualified last year.
This information is publicly available at Companies House, the government's
corporate information agency responsible for registering and holding
information on limited liability businesses, but there is no mechanism to
detect incoming qualified accounts and no policy of scrutinising them.
Mr Griffiths is concerned that the DTI did not investigate Land Travel
before its collapse, even though its accounts were heavily qualified and
showed net liabilities over the previous two financial years.
The DTI says it has powers to investigate companies which are drawn to its
attention, but that it lacks the resources to examine every set of accounts.
Mr Griffiths' proposals met with a mildly positive response from the
accountancy profession.
Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Standards Board, said: 'There
might be a case for some kind of central accounts ombudsman. It would be a
load off the mind of the auditor.'
Anyone can request, for a fee, a company's accounts from Companies House,
but the agency simply processes the accounts and does not scrutinise their
contents.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Driver is blamed by investigators into train crash at Cannon
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRIVER ERROR was to blame for the Cannon Street rail cash which killed two
people and injured more than 500, according to the official report published
yesterday.
But the explanation for the error may never be known because the driver, Mr
Maurice Graham, declined on legal advice to give evidence to the Health and
Safety Executive's inquiry.
The accident happened in January last year when a crowded morning commuter
train from Sevenoaks, Kent, collided at low speed with the buffers at
London's Cannon Street terminus.
Tests three days after the accident showed Mr Graham to have small traces of
cannabis in his blood, but the HSE's report said no firm conclusions could
be reached as to whether 'use of cannabis' was the cause of the braking
error.
Mr Alan Cooksey, the HSE's deputy chief inspecting officer of railways, said
the use of cannabis distorted judgment and produced a day-dreaming effect,
but there was 'no evidence one way or the other' whether this had been a
factor in the accident.
Last year Sir Allan Green, then director of public prosecutions, said he
would not bring charges over the crash because there was 'insufficient
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction of the driver or
any other person or organisation'.
After the accident there had been speculation that the age of the rolling
stock involved, some of which dated from the 1950s, had contributed to the
large number of casualties.
Mr Cooksey said he did not believe the age of the rolling stock played a
part in causing the accident, but it was a factor in the number and extent
of the injuries.
Mr Cooksey's report makes 15 recommendations, one of which is that British
Rail should replace its Class 415 electric multiple units with new Networker
units 'as soon as possible'.
The TSSA white-collar rail workers' union said: 'It is no use inquiries
coming up with recommendations if the government will not allow BR to spend
money.'
BR said it had acted on many of the recommendations.
Report of the Collision on 8 January 1991 at Cannon Street Station. Health
and Safety Executive. HMSO. Pounds 8.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                     THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Class 415 electric trains should be replaced by Networker units as soon
as possible
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
New trains should have data recorders, and existing trains should be
fitted with them where possible
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BR should examine ways of spreading passengers out through trains
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
A review of training for drivers on entering terminal stations
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The proposed Automatic Train Protection system should be able to
adjust the speed of a train entering a station
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
BR should examine ways of giving drivers practice in emergency braking
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Buffer stops should be redesigned
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Supervision of drivers should ensure they are fit for work
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
It should be illegal for a railway worker with safety responsibilities
to be impaired by alcohol or drugs, and testing after incidents should
be allowed
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems caused by sudden changes in lighting, such as that experienced
between sunlight and illuminated stations, should be investigated
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  03 SEP 92 / Hidden tax on power likely to survive: The Treasury will be
reluctant to transfer the cost of the nuclear levy to the PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE about UK electricity prices homed in on a new target this week:
the fossil fuel levy.
The suggestion yesterday by Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general
of Offer, the electricity regulator, that the levy could be phased out more
quickly than originally planned will be strong ammunition for industrialists
who have been complaining that electricity prices are too high.
His remarks followed suggestions by the two big power generating companies,
National Power and PowerGen, that the levy should be reduced.
Any decision about the future of the levy will have to be made by the
government, which is maintaining a cautious silence. The levy is in effect a
tax on electricity generated by oil, gas and coal, and its proceeds go to
subsidise power projects using non-fossil fuels such as nuclear power, wind
and tides.
This year the levy will amount to Pounds 1.2bn - equivalent to 11 per cent
on the electricity bills of every household and company in England and
Wales. It is supposed to shrink by stages to Pounds 800m in 1997.
Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which owns and operates the 12
nuclear power stations in England and Wales, receives more than 95 per cent
of the levy, and uses it to create provisions to cover the future cost of
decommissioning and rendering these power stations safe when they end their
useful lives.
This financial support is vital to Nuclear Electric's existence. In the
financial year to March 1992, the company made a loss of Pounds 783m, which
the levy transformed into a profit of Pounds 482m.
The company's ability to get its nose above water has prompted the levy's
critics - headed by large groups such as ICI - to argue that the levy should
be reduced.
Prof Littlechild also believes that a faster phasing out of the levy would
increase pressure on Nuclear Electric to cut its costs and make itself fully
commercial.
Nuclear Electric does not deny that the levy makes all the difference. But
Dr Bob Hawley, its new and combative chief executive, stressed yesterday
that he had already set the company the goal of achieving a profit without
levy by 1995. So Prof Littlechild's remarks were superfluous, he said, even
assuming he had the right to tell the company how to run its affairs.
The main question is whether Nuclear Electric should continue to receive the
levy once it was making a profit on its own.
Dr Hawley says the company needs the levy to make provisions for the
reactors it inherited when it was formed in 1990.
The profits, when they come, will be needed to make provisions for reactors
still to be completed, such as Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast.
If the levy is abolished the provisions will still have to come from
somewhere, most probably from public borrowing.
The Treasury may prefer to keep the levy - in effect a hidden tax of which
few people are aware - rather than have Nuclear Electric's costs heaped on
to the public sector borrowing requirement.
This suggests that the government may resist calls to get rid of the levy,
particularly given its opposition in principle to subsidies.
Any decision would also have to take account of other coming events, notably
the planned privatisation of British Coal this year, and a full review of
the nuclear power industry in 1994.
Removal of the levy could be good news for coal because it would lower
electricity prices and boost demand. But it might also put paid to the
nuclear industry's chances of surviving the review.
Even so, electricity industry sources were saying yesterday that Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary - who now handles energy policy -
may be more sympathetic than his predecessors.
Prof Littlechild, it was suggested, may even have made his remarks at
Whitehall's behest to provide Mr Heseltine with a cue - though as an
independent figure, Prof Littlechild is free to say whatever he chooses.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Bush calls on power to dispense largesse: Hurricane's aid to
the president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for the
devastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harm
to the re-election campaign of President George Bush.
After a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster,
both the president and his administration seem finally to be getting
assistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have
been destroyed.
In the process, Mr Bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency,
the one asset denied his presidential rival, Mr Bill Clinton, who is to
visit Florida today. This was brought home graphically by the president's
announcement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major local
employer virtually destroyed by Andrew  - would be rebuilt.
His poignant and brief address to the nation on Tuesday night, committing
the government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on Americans to
contribute to the American Red Cross, also struck the right sort of note. It
was only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself a
testimony to the gravity of the situation.
As if to underline the political benefit to the president, a Harris poll
conducted from August 26 to September 1 yesterday showed Mr Bush with 45 per
cent support - behind Mr Clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer
race than other recent surveys.
With Mr Bush constantly in the headlines, Mr Clinton has been left on the
sidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto voce
criticism of the president's initial stumbling.
First responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in the
performance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up by
President Carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew. FEMA has, under
the Republicans, become the ultimate patronage backwater, with, according to
one congressional study, ten times as many political appointees as the
typical arm of government.
Its current head, Mr Wallace Stickney, is a New Hampshire political
associate of Mr John Sununu, the former state governor and White House chief
of staff. Contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by
a House committee that Mr Stickney was 'uninterested in substantive
programmes', FEMA was caught completely unprepared by Andrew, resulting in
unseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in
bringing relief.
However, the arrival in Florida of the military and the assignment of
special responsibilities to Mr Andrew Card, the young and telegenic
transportation secretary, is making a difference. Also increasingly evident
is the hand of Mr James Baker, now ensconced at the White House.
It was Mr Baker who reshuffled the president's campaign schedule to make
room for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role for
the previously obscure Mr Card. It is also Mr Baker who is making the most
of presidential powers to dispense largesse.
Yesterday, Mr Bush flew to South Dakota to tell farmers of an expansion of
the subsidised grains exports programme and then to the General Dynamics
factory in Texas to announce an F-16 fighter sale to Taiwan. Both are, of
course, intensely political actions. Both involve federal subsidies, as does
relief for Andrew, that run counter to Mr Bush's commitment to reduce the
budget deficit. But both may be presented by a president as being in the
national interest because they guarantee employment, which is what the
election is largely about.
US insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of
damage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American Insurance
Services Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports. This takes the insurance
bill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn, making it the costliest disaster
to hit the US.

THE BUSH administration may decide on health grounds not to go ahead with
the prosecution of Mr Clark Clifford, the 85-year-old former defence
secretary who was indicted in July on criminal charges related to the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).
Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his law partner and protege, were indicted
in New York on charges of accepting bribes, conspiracy to commit fraud and
misleading federal bank regulators.
The Justice Department in Washington brought lesser charges of misleading
regulators about the secret ownership by BCCI of First American Bankshares,
the Washington bank.
Although federal and state prosecutors have agreed that the New York trial
should be held before Washington moves, a heart specialist has said Mr
Clifford might suffer a fatal heart attack were he to stand trial. The
Justice Department has said it might decide not to prosecute Mr Clifford for
this reason.
A senior US investigator noted, however, that the Justice Department's
medical consultant had reviewed Mr Clifford's past medical records rather
than Mr Clifford himself.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Police urge arrests in Collor scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the police inquiry into the corruption scandal currently rocking
Brazil yesterday called for the arrests of some of the key figures.
Mr Paulo Lacerda last night recommended to a federal judge in Brasilia the
preventative imprisonment of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the friend and former
campaign treasurer of President Fernando Collor, and Mr Claudio Vieira, Mr
Collor's former private secretary.
Mr Lacerda said the arrests were necessary because they were obstructing his
inquiries.
Mr Farias was the subject of a three-month congressional investigation,
which concluded last week, accusing him of running a multi-million dollar
kickback scheme.
The report directly implicated Mr Collor, leading to the initiation this
week of the country's first ever impeachment proceedings.
Last night, Mr Farias denied that he was not co-operating with police
inquiries and said that he was 'absolutely tranquil'.
Earlier in the day, the last pillar of support for Mr Collor collapsed with
the decision by the main pro-government party to free their congressmen to
vote in favour of Mr Collor's impeachment.
The announcement by the Liberal Front (PFL) coincided with the publication
of a poll showing that more than half the population thinks Mr Collor should
quit over the corruption charges.
The poll, by Ibope, the official government polling agency, found that 69
per cent of respondents no longer trust Mr Collor and 59 per cent think that
he should resign.
The PFL decision was taken early yesterday after a meeting attended by four
government ministers. Only one minister spoke in Mr Collor's favour, and Mr
Marco Maciel, leader of the government in the Senate, announced that he was
quitting, compounding the president's isolation.
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister, announced he would offer his
resignation immediately after an impeachment vote by the lower house of
congress, whatever its outcome.
But the resignation offer by Mr Moreira and the rest of the cabinet was seen
as a formality.
Mr Collor now seems unlikely to withstand the impeachment process set in
motion on Tuesday.
To survive he will need the support of one-third of Congress, or 168
deputies, in a vote expected to be held later this month.
He has been counting on the 120 votes of the PFL. His own party has only 23
members.
His justice minister was quoted by Brazilian press as saying: 'To resign
would not be a cowardly act.'
The PFL leadership has been under increasing pressure from members to drop
its pro-Collor stance because of fears that its candidates will suffer in
October's municipal elections.
However, the party is a fierce opponent of Mr Itamar Franco, the
vice-president, who would take office in the event of Mr Collor's ousting.
Mr Hugo Napoleao, president of the PFL, said yesterday: 'In the end we
decided we had to allow people to vote according to their conscience.'
Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, the president of Congress, met political leaders
yesterday to create a 30-40 member commission which will sit for 10 days to
discuss whether to approve the impeachment request.
If it does, Mr Collor will then have 20 days to defend himself before a
congressional vote.
However, the president's legal team plans to contest the process,
capitalising on confusion created by the fact that the part of the 1988
constitution referring to impeachment has not yet been ratified.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA'S two-month-long fiscal crisis finally came to an end early
yesterday morning when Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, signed a
Dollars 57bn (Pounds 28.6bn) budget approved by the lower house of the state
assembly.
The last and necessary capitulation by the Democratic-controlled legislature
was its acceptance of an education bill which allows the state's
constitutional obligation to school funding to be suspended if, as may
happen, the courts find illegal a loan for current expenditure from future
allocations.
Mr Wilson claimed victory for his long fight to produce a new balanced
budget without recourse to tax increases in the face of a prolonged and deep
recession. It was achieved by substantial cuts in state grants to health,
education and welfare.
Mr Willie Brown, the veteran speaker of the assembly, described the budget
agreement as 'a compromise, the best decision we can make tonight'. He
conceded that state-wide discontent with the political process might mean
that many legislators, already faced with new limitations on the number of
terms they may serve, would be voted out of office in November.
The most visible consequence of the long stalemate was that the state found
it necessary to issue Dollars 3.2bn in IOUs to meet its payroll and other
contractual obligations, the first time it has had to issue its own scrip
since the depression of the 1930s. In recent days financial institutions had
begun to refuse to honour these IOUs and a major closedown of state offices
was being threatened.
The California battle has been the most dramatic and painful of countless
others fought across the country. They are seen as harbingers of wars to
come at the federal level, regardless of who is the next president.
Mr Wilson may not necessarily be the political beneficiary of the budget
agreement. Mr Mervin Field, the veteran California pollster, reports that
voters blame him and the legislature alike and may vent their anger at his
office as the budget cuts are felt.

ONTARIO'S Human Rights Commission has ruled that homosexuals are entitled to
their live-in partners' pension and insurance benefits in the same way as
spouses in a heterosexual marriage.
The landmark ruling is expected to increase pressure on employers throughout
Canada to give equal treatment to homosexuals for the full range of spousal
benefits.
A Canadian public-sector trade union has launched a complaint against the
federal Income Tax Act which allegedly discriminate against same-sex
partners in the application of tax allowances.
Some experts predict that the extension of employee benefits to homosexual
partners could increase the cost of company-financed pension, insurance and
health plans. The decision stems from a complaint by a Toronto man employed
by the Ontario provincial government. He objected to the government's
refusal in 1988 to include his homosexual partner in its medical insurance
coverage.

JAPANESE carmakers are likely to fulfil their promise to buy US parts
because of the North America free trade agreement (Nafta) between the US,
Mexico and Canada and higher than expected demand at home and abroad, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
In January the carmakers proposed buying Dollars 19bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in US
parts in the fiscal year starting April 1994.
'Out of the proposed target of Dollars 19bn, purchase for use at their US
units will account for the greater part,' said Shinji Moriyuki, of the Daiwa
Institute of Research.
For cars to qualify for tariff-free trade within Nafta they will have to
contain at least 62.5 per cent of parts procured from within the region. Out
of the Dollars 19bn target, only Dollars 4bn is likely to be for US parts
imported into Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US officials yesterday played down talk of progress towards a resolution of
their oilseeds dispute with the European Community.
The two sides appear to have drawn different conclusions on the outcome of
talks between Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, and Mr Frans
Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, in Brussels on Monday and
Tuesday.
Mrs Hills said after the meeting she had not agreed to any new deadline for
resolving the argument. 'I didn't agree to extend anything. We just said our
patience had run its course,' she told the Journal of Commerce.
But officials said the oilseeds issue was only a minor point in Mrs Hills'
meeting with Mr Andriessen, which was largely devoted to the broader aim of
concluding the Uruguay Round of talks to revise the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
US officials said they wanted to assure the EC that the US presidential
election in November should have no bearing on the Gatt talks.
The US and EC appear still to be far apart on the oilseeds question.
Although Brussels is willing to discuss compensation to US farmers for the
sales of oilseeds they say they have lost, they have refused to consider
dismantling their oilseeds programme, which Washington sees as vital to any
settlement.
Although some observers believe the US would be reluctant to impose the
punitive tariffs it has threatened on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) of food and
drink imports from the EC without the approval of a full Gatt meeting
scheduled for September 29, US officials maintain they already have the
right to impose these sanctions.

Eurofer made the dumping charge on behalf of about 75 per cent of European

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: EC and US push for Gatt breakthrough -
Negotiators may be softening their stand on farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC and US trade negotiators are engaged in a 'final push' to achieve a
breakthrough by mid-October in the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation
talks, according to a senior European Commission official.
He said 'the political will is now there' on both sides to chart a way
through the farm subsidies maze, which has held up conclusion of the Round
since the collapse of the Brussels summit under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in December 1990.
Both sides appear to be softening their position on farm subsidies, in the
interest of getting the leading industrial economies moving again.
Although the new negotiations are being conducted in secret - it is not even
clear where they are taking place - the official said agriculture and trade
officials from Washington and Brussels began work yesterday on detailed
formulae to resolve the two biggest differences. These are:
The extent to which payments to EC farmers in compensation for the big price
cuts agreed in May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be exempt
from the subsidy reduction called for in the Uruguay Round 'final act';
The extent to which the EC must cut the volume of its subsidised exports, as
well as the amount of subsidy.
Negotiations are in a higher than expected gear following talks on Monday
and Tuesday in Brussels between Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr
Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
agriculture commissioner.
The main public outcome of those talks was to put on ice until the end of
this month a separate bilateral dispute over oilseeds subsidies. The US has
held off from slapping punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn (Pounds 502m) worth
of EC food exports in the knowledge that, as the Brussels official confirmed
yesterday, 'we would have to consider retaliation'.
If this happened it would put paid to hopes of a Uruguay Round conclusion.
The official said a 'headline agreement' on the Round had to be reached by
about the middle of next month, both to incorporate an agreement on oilseeds
and to have any hope of meeting the March 1993 deadline for expiry of the US
administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority.
On the EC's compensation payments, Mr MacSharry had insisted that since they
are linked to output restraint - farmers must take land out of production
('set-aside') to get them - they should be indefinitely exempt from the
Gatt's prescribed subsidy cut of 20 per cent over six years. The US was only
prepared to grant an exemption for six years if the target of 15 per cent
'set-aside' was fixed in concrete, and if compensation was cut back
thereafter.
But Mr MacSharry is now understood to be willing to settle for a form of
words which ensures that the 'philosophy' that payments linked to production
restraint should be exempt 'is carried through into the next round' of
subsidy negotiations six years hence. 'We want recognition of their
contribution to international trade peace,' the official said, 'just as
there is recognition for subsidy payments for environmental reasons.'
On export volume, where Gatt requires a 24 per cent cut in addition to a 36
per cent reduction in export subsidies, the EC still insists on flexibility
within sectors. Under this formula the EC could export more wheat if it
exported less barley, for example, provided overall cuts in grain sales
reached the target.
The US wants pro-rata reductions, especially since, under the EC's new farm
regime, European wheat will become more competitive.
The official said, however, that this flexibility could be limited and
detailed, and pointed out the EC would still be cutting output. 'It is not
beyond the bounds of possibility that we can get agreement on these lines,'
he concluded, 'but this has to be the final push.'

FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: BA-USAir deal 'could trigger change' - FT
World Aerospace and Air Transport Conference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways' plan to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 376.8m) in a 44 per
cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, was described yesterday
as 'one of the rare defining moments' in aviation history.
The move, if approved by the US government, is expected to accelerate the
trend towards globalisation in the airline industry by intensifying
cross-border mergers and acquisitions between international carriers.
But it has also unleashed a new transatlantic trade controversy which risks
adding civil aviation to the already long catalogue of trade disputes
between the US and Europe - ranging from agricultural subsidies to
government aid for the European Airbus programme.
The growing trade frictions between the US and Europe over civil aviation
featured prominently at a Financial Times conference in London on world
aerospace and air transport.
Frictions have been heightened by the current financial difficulties facing
the airline industry, which is struggling to recover from its worst
recession in 40 years and striving to adapt to an increasingly deregulated
international aviation environment.
At the same time deregulation has made the system of bilateral aviation
agreements between countries, which has governed the industry since 1946,
look increasingly obsolete. There is growing pressure to replace it with a
multilateral system between large trading blocks to promote open skies.
Mr Lawrence Nagin, executive vice-president of United Airlines, said the
BA-USAir deal could be a trigger for change. 'The transaction holds the
prospect of making enormous inroads in the protectionist thinking that still
pervades much of the international aviation regime. Indeed, it could well be
the lever with which to open Europe and the US to a free competitive
environment', he said.
But he warned it could reinforce old trade barriers and trigger new ones as
parties sought to preserve a competitive advantage for flag carriers through
government regulations.
United, along with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the three largest
US carriers, have pressed their government to block the BA-USAir deal unless
they can secure greater access to the UK and European markets by negotiating
a new bilateral aviation agreement with the UK.
Both Mr Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary at the US Department of
Transportation, and the Earl of Caithness, the UK aviation minister,
declined to discuss the current state of negotiations between the two
countries on the BA-USAir deal.
Mr Shane said the US was promoting an open skies policy and wanted to
negotiate new liberal bilateral agreements with European countries. But he
noted some European governments, including France and Germany, were moving
in the opposite direction and warned the US would consider retaliating
against countries erecting barriers for US carriers.
This could include constraints on traffic to the US moved by foreign
carriers from destinations outside their home countries and a tougher stance
on future tariff co-ordination. 'Those who insist on using their sovereignty
to constrain market growth artificially may find they have placed their
carriers at a serious, possibly irreversible, disadvantage in the long run,'
Mr Shane warned.
But European speakers rejected the US position. Lord Caithness said US
airlines continued to dominate their domestic market with large hub and
spoke networks and enjoyed advantages denied to foreign competitors.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, said his
airline's deal with USAir complied with existing US foreign ownership
requirements and aviation policies. The reaction of the big US carriers
'only served to reassure us that the agreement we have negotiated is a good
one,' he added.
If US carriers wanted to table new demands from the UK, they should be ready
to provide commensurate concessions for UK airlines, including the
relaxation of ownership rules.
Sir Colin said two significant obstacles continued to undermine efforts to
create a more liberal and open skies environment. These were continuing
state support enjoyed by government-controlled carriers and the US Chapter
11 rule whereby bankrupt airlines were protected from creditors and thus
able to continue operating.
Mr Frederik Sorensen, head of the EC's air transport policy division, said
that, with the advent of a single European aviation market next year, it was
necessary to formulate a European external aviation policy, including new
external competition rules.
Such a policy should also take into account the potential conflict between
the broad interests of the Community as a whole and the specific national
interests of member states. The competitive position of European carriers
would be enhanced if the Community could speak with one voice instead of
being divided on external aviation policy, he argued.
But Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of Alitalia and chairman of the
Association of European Airlines (AEA), said a common EC approach could only
work if all EC countries were subjected to the same rules, including a
similar fiscal regime.
'National legislation still shows a high degree of disparity, and market
differences are evident in financial, fiscal, social and labour
regulations,' he said. The harmonisation of national legislation was thus of
fundamental importance for implementation of a single market, as fiscal
differences could create just as large distortions as state aid to airlines.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Slovaks fear a costly divorce: A look at the break-up with
the Czechs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'civilised divorce' agreed between Czech and Slovak leaders last week
includes a currency union, tariff-free movement of goods and visa-free
movement of people. But it has not yet tackled other contentious issues such
as the co-ordination of foreign and security policies.
A leaked 'working text' of a draft treaty between the two republics drawn up
by Mr Vladimir Meciar's party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,
before last week's meeting revealed that the Slovaks, who campaigned on a
separatist platform at last June's elections, in reality still hanker after
a broader, confederal 'union' with the Czech lands.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech leader, has made clear he favours a clean
political break but puts priority on preserving an economic relationship
which reflects the economic integration of the two states. While rejecting a
broader, confederal relationship, the Czechs hope that the mutual interest
in close monetary and economic co-operation will ensure that political
independence does not translate into indifference or hostility.
The economic and political implications of divorce were underlined during a
sobering meeting between Slovak economists and IMF and World Bank officials
in Washington last month. They warned that divorce would be costly for
Slovakia, where unemployment is nearly 12 per cent. This compares with under
3 per cent in the Czech lands, which have a more diversified economy and
have attracted the bulk of foreign investment.
After independence next January 1 Slovakia is expected to lose Czech
subsidies of between Dollars 300m (Pounds 150.7m) and Dollars 1bn annually.
Divorce will also leave Bratislava responsible for re-shaping an economy
dominated by energy-intensive arms and other heavy industries.
Slovakia also faces two major international problems inherited from the
communist past. The first leaves Bratislava, the Slovak capital, to settle a
dispute with Hungary over the Danube river hydro-electric complex and the
second saddles it with handling Czechoslovakia's share in the Krivoi Rog
iron ore enrichment project in the Ukraine.
Prague, which decided to pull out of the Ukrainian deal earlier this year,
has been trying unsuccessfully to privatise Czechoslovakia's share in a
project, which will eventually produce iron pellets needed by the Slovak
steel industry.
Czech negotiators say the prospect of divorce has injected a new realism
into Slovak thinking and re-inforced pro-market economists there. Faced with
the phasing out of Czech subsidies, for example, the Slovak authorities have
shelved plans to build a subway in Bratislava.
Instead they plan to invest in a new link-up with Austrian railways. A rapid
rail link via Vienna airport would attract spillover traffic to the
under-used Bratislava airport. It would also suit plans to establish tariff
free manufacturing zones close to the Austrian border, similar to
maquiladora plants along the US-Mexican border. Much however depends on
Slovakia's ability to attract foreign investors, who were alarmed by the new
government's decision to reverse privatisation of the Danubia printing house
and take it back under state control.
The prospect of independence has also led to a new look at the Slovak arms
industry, hit hard by federal policies to curb exports and the end of the
cold war. Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance minister, last month announced
that, instead of converting military plants to civilian use, Slovakia will
step up its search for foreign markets while reducing the industry's
capacity by 10-15 per cent annually over the next few years.
For the leaders of both the Czech lands and Slovakia, however, the most
important appointment before their divorce is their scheduled meeting with
European Community officials on October 5. On the agenda is the future of
the EC Association Agreement signed last year with a federal State which is
due to disappear on December 31.
The Czech side will be satisfied with essentially unchanged terms. But
Slovakia, whose steel exports are particularly vulnerable to anti-dumping
measures demanded by EC steelmakers, and is losing its former financial
subsidies from Prague, is now in greater need of freer access to EC markets.
Bratislava is hoping that Brussels will show, if not sympathy, at least
understanding for the historical factors which pushed it to an economically
disruptive divorce.

THE Italian stock market fell 2.5 per cent yesterday, partly owing to fears

found in increased revenues and spending cuts to hold the public sector
deficit to L148,000bn next year. However, it emerged this week that at least
a L10,000bn extra would have to be found to cover the increased cost of
higher interest rates which are in force to protect the lira.
As the government of Mr Giuliano Amato begins work on the 1993 budget, which
must be presented to parliament by the end of the month, the senate has
resumed its study of the four main structural reforms - in pensions, public
health, regional administration and the civil service - proposed by the
government in July.
It is planned to raise some L32,000bn next year through streamlining the
civil service, delegating the first real powers to regional administrations
to raise taxes, shaking up the inefficient health service and curbing
Italy's exceptionally generous pensions system. Parliament is being asked to
approve the broad principles of the reform and, by the mechanism of special
delegated authority, permit the government to work out details.
Already, some 800 amendments have been tabled, 500 by the breakway communist
grouping, Reconstituted Communism. Thus, if the end of the month deadline is
not met or parliament fails to endorse the reforms, the 1993 budget risks
being undermined.
This possibility unnerved the stock market as did fears about the effect of
austerity measures on an already stagnant economy, combined with the lira's
continued weakness. Fiat shares, also reflecting the drop in European car
sales, fell 3.6 per cent to below L4,000 per share for the first time since
1985.
The stock market appeared to pay little regard to the one piece of positive
news: preliminary inflation figures for August showing consumer prices up
only 0.1 per cent. Inflation is now running at 5.3 per cent on annualised
basis, and if the rate continues its steady fall since May, it could be
below 5 per cent by the end of the year.

FORMER Polish Communist Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz was found tortured
and hanged beside his wife's dead body in their Warsaw home yesterday in a
macabre double murder, Reuter reports from Warsaw.
An Interior Ministry spokesman told local radio that Mr Jaroszewicz, 82, was
tortured and hanged, and his wife Alicja Solska shot dead with a hunting
rifle in their isolated villa in the wealthy suburb of Anin. No motive was
known.
Mr Jaroszewicz, a deeply unpopular prime minister who was ousted in 1980
after 10 years in office, led a solitary life and refused the offer of a
bodyguard.
'It was quite macabre. The perpetrator acted with premeditation - meaning he
wanted to kill them,' said a police spokesman.
The couple's concrete-clad two-storey villa, in woods on the edge of Warsaw,
was sealed off by police and a special commission had begun an
investigation.
The police were seen using a stretcher to carry away at least one corpse in
a black plastic bag. A large rifle was also brought out, wrapped in a white
sheet.
Neighbours said Mr Jaroszewicz and his wife, a former journalist for the
Communist party mouthpiece Trybuna Ludu, rarely received visitors and were
wary of strangers.
Mr Jaroszewicz was last seen walking their dog on Monday.
Mr Jaroszewicz, a former army general and deputy prime minister from 1952 to
1970, was deeply disliked by the public as Poland fell deep into economic
decline under Communist leader Edward Gierek in the 1970s.
He was made a scapegoat for the government's economic failures - the main
cause of Poland's present-day foreign debt problems - and forced to resign
in February 1980.
He was expelled from the Communist party in 1981 and interned along with
several dozen former Communist officials, when Prime Minister Wojciech
Jaruzelski imposed martial law to crush the opposition Solidarity trade
union led by Mr Lech Walesa.
When Solidarity ousted the Communists in 1989, there were no reprisals. Most
of the old leaders retired quietly from public life and none has been
brought to trial.
'I know richer people around here, with better houses, so I don't think it
could have been a robbery,' said a neighbour.

<TEXT>
DEPUTY finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations last week
took no decision on Russia's request for a speedy rescheduling of the former
Soviet Union's foreign debt of Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn), postponing the
issue to a Paris Club meeting which may be held within a few weeks.
In the latest Russian cry of anguish over meeting debt payments, Mr Andrei
Nechayev, economics minister, said Russia would find it difficult to clean
up arrears and return joint venture funds 'frozen' in Vneshekonombank, which
handles most foreign exchange business.
'These funds were not frozen, they were spent a long time before by this
government came to power,' he explained. He promised however that the
government wanted to issue five-year hard currency bonds for the holders of
such funds. It was also serious about turning some debt obligations into
property: yesterday Philip Morris, the US tobacco-based conglomerate, asked
to be given office space in part repayment of outstanding debts owed to it
by Russia.
Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the acting central bank chairman, said
yesterday that Russia had just Dollars 100m to spare for intervening to
defend the ever weakening rouble. He also called for enterprises to be
forced to sell all their hard currency earnings to the state, instead of
just 50 per cent at present. Compulsory sales of all hard currency revenues
are a normal part of internal convertibility schemes used in other countries
but have so far not been introduced in Russia.
Although Russia's export revenues amounted to Dollars 2bn a month, Mr
Gerashchenko said an average of only Dollars 25m is sold every month on
Moscow's fledgling official foreign exchange market.

SLOVAKIA has taken one more step towards independence with the adoption by
local MPs of a separate constitution for the republic, writes Ariane
Genillard. Articles on creating a Slovak central bank and on the border with
the Czech republic will be frozen until next January 1, thus avoiding any
violation of the current federal constitution.
Czech and Slovak leaders recently agreed on constitutional steps to
establish two independent states by the start of next year.
The new Slovak constitution caused considerable controversy in Bratislava,
the capital, and Slovak Hungarian parties walked out of the local
parliament. Leaders of the ethnic Hungarian minority in the republic - 12
per cent of the population - have warned about the discriminatory nature of
Slovakia's new nationalist government.

A RECORD 274,000 people have sought asylum in Germany so far this year, the

figure for the same period last year.
The announcement coincided with attacks by right-wing extremists on refugee

Spremberg in Brandenburg. Several people were arrested, but no one was
injured in the incidents.
However, a Pole was hurt when stones were thrown at his car and that of two
others Poles while they drove through the border city of Frankfurt on the
Oder.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, Social Democrat premier of the Rhineland Palatinate
state, called for the dismissal of Mr Rudolf Seiters, federal interior
minister. He said he must bear responsibility for the backlog of 400,000
asylum applications.

<TEXT>
Serbia's ruling Socialists yesterday abandoned their campaign to oust Mr
Milan Panic, Yugoslavia's prime minister, after they failed to win the
backing of President Dobrica Cosic, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The failure to oust the Belgrade-born US businessman was a defeat for
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and raises the stakes in the bitter
power struggle between Mr Milosevic, on one side, and Mr Panic and Mr Cosic
on the other.
The Socialists said their turnaround was conditional on the federal
government and the prime minister accepting their 'well-intentioned
criticism' as a political warning.'
Key Serb politicians yesterday tried to distance themselves from the
no-confidence motion proposed on Monday by the 68 deputies from the
Socialist party and its satellite, the ultranationalist Serbian Radical
party.
After three days of manoeuvrings, President Cosic, a well-known writer also
seen as the embodiment of Serb unity, yesterday publicly lashed out at the
no-confidence motion as a 'half-baked and irresponsible move'.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Timing critical as Yugoslav peace talks resume: Approach of
winter gives added urgency to need for humanitarian aid operation in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUGOSLAV peace talks, begun in London last week, reopen today in Geneva amid
a growing sense of urgency about the need for a huge humanitarian aid
operation before winter engulfs Bosnia and the Balkan peninsula.
If any of the agreements made in London are to stick, the conference, which
will be co-chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy to
the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator,
will have to implement a timetable quickly.
Mr Ron Redmond, a senior official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,
said yesterday that 'several million dollars' was needed to provide shelter
for the 2m refugees both inside and outside Bosnia.
'Roads and bridges have to be rebuilt in order for aid convoys to reach the
towns and cities in Bosnia. Tons of plastic sheets are needed to provide
shelter in many of the homes which were bombed,' he said.
The aid programme, which will be discussed in Geneva, will not envisage
setting up safe havens, let alone sending the refugees back to villages from
which they were forcibly deported by Bosnia's Serb forces.
'To be realistic, many people will be unable to return. They have no homes.
They are afraid. The territory is controlled by Serb forces. The ethnic
hatred is now too deep. Healing these wounds will be impossible,' said Mr
Redmond.
Western diplomats said yesterday that Bosnia-Hercegovina had been de facto
divided between Croatia and Serbia, despite a commitment from the London
conference that its borders would be respected.
The humanitarian aid effort faces another problem. Even if many more aid
convoys, backed by armed troops under the auspices of the UN, were sent into
Bosnia, a western military expert said, Bosnia's Serbs were likely to
disrupt distribution.
'If intervention is limited to the delivery of humanitarian aid, the Serbs
will see little reason to modify their current methods for seizing and
cleaning the areas they claim,' said Mr Charles Dick from the Royal Military
Academy at Sandhurst.
'They will probably let convoys through and flights land, contenting
themselves with making sure that the operation does not run smoothly.'
The danger to the UN forces is evident. Indeed, after Bosnian government
forces regained control of the eastern city of Gorazde earlier this week,
Serb forces accused the UN aid convoy which reached the city last month of
supplying weapons to the city's defenders.
As for the dispatch of international monitors to Bosnia's borders with
Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro, western military experts said this would
not have the slightest effect on the fighting.
Given these obstacles, there is every likelihood that the refugee problem
will increase, particularly if the war spreads to the Serb controlled
province of Kosovo, or to Macedonia.
'Sending monitors to these two regions does not address the problem,' said a
western military attache. 'How do we know that Serbia will not send the
remnants of the Yugoslav army to Kosovo, while leaving (Radovan) Karadzic
and the Serb irregulars to complete their land grab in Bosnia?
'The point is that the London conference agreements are not backed up by
force. Any force would have entailed a massive military intervention, backed
by air and ground troops. And no western government is ready to go that
far.'
Nato allies yesterday offered troops and other support to the UN for
protecting aid deliveries to Bosnia and agreed that a light force of around
6,000 troops under UN command would be best for the job, Reuter reports from
Brussels.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Ukraine turns its back on racial origins: Ethnic Germans are
being urged to settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dusty village of Chervona Volodymyrka, 100km north-east of Odessa, has
become a test of Ukraine's efforts to create a multi-cultural nation. In
contrast to the 'ethnic cleansing' being conducted in the former Yugoslavia,
the Ukrainian government is encouraging ethnic Germans expelled by Stalin to
return to Chervona Volodymyrka and other villages in southern Ukraine.
In the two-and-a-half months since 34 ethnic German men arrived from
northern Kazakhstan, a new neighbourhood of blue, red and white caravans,
provided by the German government, has sprung up on a hilltop overlooking
Chervona Volodymyrka.
Sitting at a kitchen table in one of these spartan but immaculately clean
caravans, Mr Alexander Grep, leader of the community, said that as soon as
the water and electricity were connected 250 German families now in
Kazakhstan would move in.
The resettlement is a vindication for President Leonid Kravchuk. When he
enlivened a state visit to Germany last February with the announcement that
Ukraine was willing to absorb up to 400,000 of the estimated 1.1m ethnic
Germans in central Asia, the proposal seemed to be little more than a way to
upstage the offer by President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to create an
autonomous republic for ethnic Germans on the Volga river.
But Ukraine has granted citizenship to all residents, regardless of
ancestry. He recently said 'history has shown that ethnically-based nations
are unstable. . . . whereas a state in which all citizens are equal is a
guarantee that we will avoid the sort of ethnic wars being fought in
Yugoslavia.
Thousands of ethnic Germans, worried by mounting antagonism toward
Russian-speakers in central Asia, have taken Mr Kravchuk at his word. They
are making plans to trek across the former USSR to the fertile steppes of
southern Ukraine, where Germans have lived since the 18th century when
Catherine the Great recruited them as colonists. A few thousand descendants
of the original colonists remain in the area, having survived Stalin's
purges.
The Germans in Chervona Volodymyrka said they left Kazakhstan because of
discrimination. Bonn confirmed this when it said this week that religious
fanatics and nationalists were causing difficulties for ethnic Germans in
former Soviet Central Asia.
But ethnic tension there is clearly a two-way street. 'We want to live with
whites,' explained Mr Edward Ginsfator, a 25-year-old strapping long-haired,
blue-eyed settler in Chervona Volodymyrka from Kazakhstan.
His leader, Mr Grep, visited the Volga region of Russia before choosing
Ukraine. 'The Volga republic is no homeland for me,' he said. 'It is a place
where a man tells you to leave if he discovers you are German. I don't want
to fight them.'
By contrast, Ukrainian regions are competing for the privilege of providing
a new home for ethnic Germans. Initially aimed at the three southern
administrative regions where Germans have the deepest historical roots, Mr
Kravchuk was forced to expand the programme to include three other regions
after local government officials protested that they, too, had the right to
play host to the Germans.
Villagers in impoverished Chervona Volodymyrka, where horses are more common
than cars, seemed remarkably willing to accommodate the Germans. Mr Grep
described the local collective farm chairman as 'a golden man' who has
provided the settlers with everything from sheep and blankets to three hot
meals a day.
Conflicts could develop when the time comes to allot the Germans the lands
they have been promised, but for now the local farmers do not seem to resent
the work they are doing to help the Germans move in. One man, seconded by
the collective farm to help connect the water lines to the German caravans,
says that his sympathy had a personal thought; he is a refugee himself,
forced to flee the war-torn Trans Dnestr region and return to his native
village.
Mr Volodymyr Becker, deputy head of the collective farm and coincidentally
an ethnic German, is frank about another motivation of this hospitality. 'We
are planning to move into food processing,' said Mr Becker. 'We hope that
now the German government will come and invest in our village.'
That could be the rub. Mr Ivan Hoffman, head of the German-Ukrainian
Foundation, which is co-ordinating the resettlement from cramped quarters in
a Kiev hotel, would like Germany to lend the foundation DM2bn-DM3bn to
supplement the Rbs500m already contributed by the Ukrainian government.
Although Mr Hoffman's price is a bargain compared with the cost of absorbing
new immigrants in Germany, Bonn has set aside only DM20m for the project in
1993.

<TEXT>
AN INDEFINITE general strike yesterday paralysed Ukrainian airports and
railway stations, just as the country prepared to join the International
Monetary Fund.
The timing provides a vivid illustration of the contradictory pressures on
the government, which is torn between workers' demands for more industrial
subsidies and IMF insistence that Ukraine slash its bloated deficit.
Most Ukrainian air traffic controllers, many rail workers and some of the
powerful coalminers' organisations heeded a call by the Association of
Independent Trade Unions and took to the picket lines in an effort to force
the government to grant the unions official status.
Most of Ukraine's airports were closed, and trains were halted outside many
cities. Coalminers, potentially the biggest political threat to the
government, participated less enthusiastically, however, with only 30-40 per
cent stopping work.
Ukrainian officials said that in Washington today Mr Hryhori Piatachenko,
finance minister, was due to sign the documents which will formally admit
the country to the IMF.
A Fund delegation yesterday concluded a visit to Kiev for negotiations on a
stabilisation programme.
Speaking on television, President Leonid Kravchuk sounded a defiant note
about the IMF. 'We shall act as an independent country and not just agree to
any conditions put to us,' he said.
Last month, in a letter leaked by Mr Vadim Hetman, reformist chairman of the
Ukrainian national bank, the IMF warned that unless Ukraine began to
implement reforms it should not count on an aid package.
A Fund official said yesterday that there was still disagreement between the
national bank, which advocates belt-tightening measures, and the prime
minister and president who are more inclined to yield to populist pressures
for continued subsidies.
Ukraine's government has dragged its feet on fundamental economic reforms
while racking up a huge budget deficit which has driven down the value of
its pseudo-currency, the coupon. It is hoping for an IMF stabilisation fund
of Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn to shelter its long awaited new currency, the
hryvnia, from the coupon's sorry fate.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French industrial establishment yesterday threw its weight behind the
European union as the Patronat, which represents France's biggest companies,
voiced support for ratifying the Maastricht treaty and warned of the dangers
of rejection.
Mr Francois Perigot, president of the CNPF, said that European union offered
a real opportunity for France, and its fellow member states, to strengthen
their political and economic status thereby enabling the European Community
to establish itself as a significant presence in the international market
place.
'Europe has not yet demonstrated its political power to the rest of the
world,' he said. 'It could do so by showing a common political will and by
gaining control of a world currency.'
Mr Perigot criticised the Maastricht treaty's architects for failing to
consult with the business community and for dragging out the path towards
monetary union.
However, the CNPF warned that a negative result in the September 20
referendum could have dire economic consequences for France, triggering an
immediate loss of confidence by inter-national investors, resulting in a
lower franc and higher interest rates.
French industry is already under pressure because of the comparatively high
cost of borrowing Mr Ernst-Antoine Seilliere, economic adviser to the CNPF,
said a collapse of international confidence after a 'No' vote would make it
even more difficult - and expensive - for French companies to raise capital
for investment.
In the medium term, he warned that France could become isolated in a Europe
in which the monetary system would be dominated by the D-Mark. This
isolation, he said, also raised the spectre of international investors
diverting funds originally intended for France to other countries, such as
Spain or Germany.

FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Wrong end of the Maastricht stick -
Campaigners are misinterpreting the treaty for their own ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR all the fateful international consequences of their September 20 verdict
on the Maastricht treaty, most French voters will have uppermost in their
minds domestic considerations - the future of President Mitterrand, recent
scandals involving senior socialists, and worries about job security in a
sluggish economy.
But, formally, the debate over the next two and a half weeks, now at last
reaching fever pitch, is supposed to turn on the pros and cons of European
political and monetary union. Both sides in the referendum battle are having
great difficulty in drawing accurate information from the dry Maastricht
treaty to suit their campaigns.
The 'Yes' and 'No' coalitions are, unwittingly or (more often) wittingly,
misinterpreting Maastricht. Of the two camps the treaty rejectionists appear
to be rather more successful in getting the wrong end of the Maastricht
stick, or making insufficient political use of the correct end of the
Maastricht stick, or simply blaming on a treaty that has yet to come into
force existing irritations with Brussels that have flowed from the 1986
Single European Act and the European Community's internal market programme.
The French are not alone in this. Debates about Maastricht in other European
countries, notably Britain, have been similarly distorted through the prism
of domestic politics.
One theme, stressed by all 'Yes' campaigners ranging from socialist
ministers, to Mr Raymond Barre, the former Giscardien prime minister, to Mr
Edouard Balladur, leading member of the neo-Gaullist RPR, is that Europe and
France now need Maastricht to contain the growing political and monetary
strength of newly enlarged Germany. If diplomatically put, this is a point
which is accepted by many Germans, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who
will speak in favour of Maastricht on French television tonight.
But, in seeking to back up this general point, the 'Yes' campaigners stray
from the real import of the Maastricht treaty. Most of them lay too much
store by Maastricht's vague provisions for common EC foreign policy actions
which can be exploited. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Socialist renegade
and former minister, pointed out quite correctly that this kind of
chain-gang diplomacy allowed Germany to hustle its EC partners into
recognising Croatia in December, leading to an escalation of the Yugoslav
war.
By contrast, few 'Yes' campaigners, with the exceptions of Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister, and Mr Balladur, make sufficient
political capital out of Maastricht's very concrete provisions for economic
and monetary union (Emu), and the way in which France can recover some
control over its monetary policy through Emu.
It is at least highly appropriate that Mr Balladur should make this point,
because it was he, as French finance minister, who in 1987-88 started
lobbying his EC colleagues for a European central bank and an end to German
dominance of Europe's money.
'Without a European currency, Germany will stay free to act as it likes,' Mr
Balladur wrote this week. 'This is the present situation which is the most
damaging to France's sovereignty.'
To considerable political effect, but with little real justification,
warnings about Maastricht bringing France higher unemployment and taxes loom
metres-high on the 'No' campaigners ubiquitous billboards.
The rejectionists are right to claim that the Maastricht criteria for Emu
are generally deflationary. But passage of the treaty is most unlikely to
cause further austerity for France, one of only three EC states which
already meets the Maastricht targets on inflation, public spending and debt,
as it surely will for a country like Italy that has yet to bite the bullet
of financial discipline.
Proposals to tighten the EC's purse strings are at least an easy way of
getting back at the Brussels bureaucracy - one enemy the French electorate
has clearly identified to pollsters. A close reading of Maastricht shows the
treaty does little to increase the power of Mr Delors and his Eurocrats.
Indeed one of the Mr Delors' initial gripes was that Maastricht puts the
making of foreign and internal security policies squarely in the hands of
governments, not of the Commission.
There may, however, be some rough political logic in believing that a defeat
for Maastricht would intimidate the EC bureaucracy, particularly Sir Leon
Brittan's trust-busters and state aid controllers whose activities have
riled French governments.
An equally strong complaint of the 'No' campaigners is that Maastricht would
see a tide of immigrants and criminals washing into France. This fear is
being exploited most obviously by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front
leader, but also by rebels like Mr Philippe de Villiers of the UDF.
Yet the 'frontier control' pass has already been sold, with France's
ratification of the Single European Act and the Schengen free-travel treaty.
Maastricht's proponents in France are exaggerating when they prophesy
Armageddon if the treaty dies on September 20. But the other side is being
even more disingenuous in forecasting business as usual.
A quick and smooth renegotiation is most unlikely. One just has to recall
that Ireland's partners refused this spring to let Dublin excise one
sentence about abortion from the signed treaty text, to see how nervous they
all were and are about tampering with the Maastricht construct.

plea to vote 'Yes'

<TEXT>
MR Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday warned that a French
vote against European union could contribute to instability in central and
eastern Europe.
'This is as important as the years immediately after both world wars,' said
Mr Bildt, in an impassioned plea for a French 'Yes' on September 20, issued
at a youth meeting of the European Movement - a European lobby group - in
southern France.
This is the first such appeal in France's Maastricht referendum campaign
from a head of government of a country applying to join the European
Community.
Mr Bildt was invited precisely to drive home to French voters the wider
impact of their decision, said Mr Jean Francois Poncet, former French
foreign minister and president of the European Movement in France.
Political and monetary union in western Europe would provide a stable model
as an alternative to countries like Yugoslavia riven by 'the forces of
aggressive nationalism,' said Mr Bildt.
'If that alternative is not offered by a European union that works, these
forces could well grow in power to the danger of us all.'
Until now, the European Community had grown up mainly to serve its own
members' needs, from ensuring peace to dismantling trade barriers. External
demands would take increasing prominence, so intensifying the need for
increased security and foreign policy co-ordination, he argued. It was vital
for Sweden to be part of a strong European union, because it did not want to
be a 'footnote country.'
A French 'No' would harden the small majority of Swedish public opinion
currently against EC membership, though Mr Bildt believed opinion would
swing back again by the time Sweden holds its own referendum in 1994.

FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Seguin, French crusader goes into
battle against Mitterrand tonight - Profile of the bulky Gauloise-smoking
opponent of Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PHILIPPE Seguin, the thinking Frenchman's crusader against the Maastricht
treaty on European Union, tonight does battle against a cornered President
Francois Mitterrand.
The bulky, Gauloise-smoking conservative has been chosen by Mr Mitterrand
for a televised verbal duel on the pros and cons of Maastricht. The stakes
are very high.
The president is under pressure from some quarters to resign, in order to
let voters decide in the September 20 treaty referendum unencumbered by
their feelings over his battered personal image.
Mr Mitterrand, alarmed by the recent surprise swing of public opinion
against the treaty, chose to face Mr Seguin because he wanted to settle the
score with possibly the most active and articulate campaigner against the
treaty.
If Mr Seguin pushes hard and cleverly enough, he could force Mr Mitterrand
to clarify his intentions as well as increase the 'No' vote. At the very
least, the quality of their performance could give a much needed steer to
the French public's complex and volatile feelings about Mr Mitterrand and
Europe.
This is the first time Mr Mitterrand has faced down an opposition politician
live on television for more than four years. That was in the 1988
pre-presidential election debate with Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR
Gaullist party, of which Mr Seguin is a rebellious member.
The choice of Mr Seguin surprised some people, for he is not a mainstream
opposition leader; a mere junior minister in the previous conservative
government and maverick upholder of old style Gaullism. However, the two
mainstream opposition leaders are campaigning in favour of Maastricht. Mr
Seguin is also one of the very few anti-Maastricht campaigners to abstain
from dragging Mr Mitterrand's battered image and the socialists' record into
the European union campaign.
The wily Mr Mitterrand might have calculated that paying this compliment to
Mr Seguin might further split the Gaullists. He and Mr Charles Pasqua lead
the two thirds of the RPR who say 'No' to Maastricht and tried three years
ago to oust the moderately pro-treaty Mr Chirac. They might easily try again
and some commentators talk of Mr Seguin as a future RPR leader.
Mr Seguin, 49, an expert on Napoleonic history, is a defender of French
sovereignty to the bottom of his soul. Born and educated in Tunisia before
independence, his deep patriotism is a feature of the so-called 'pieds
noirs.' He is not against the European Community, but argues that the treaty
is dangerously ambiguous and makes possible an uncontrollable transfer of
sovereignty from national governments to Brussels.
A single European currency would signal the end of independent national
economic policies, without providing a better curb on exchange rate
instability than the European Monetary System as it is now, he argues. An
independent European central bank would be dangerously unaccountable. France
should hold out for a renegotiation.
Mr Seguin's vision of Europe is exactly in line with General de Gaulle's
idea of a flexible community of independent states. 'Yes, we want Europe,
but upright,' Mr Seguin told parliament in June, echoing a de Gaulle
pronouncement on France's entry into the EC. The anglophile Mr Seguin's
policies would go down well among many UK conservatives. Indeed, he once
likened himself to the Tory wets.
Mr Seguin has no time for socialist ministers' warnings of economic
armageddon in the event of a 'No' vote. He recalls the time the French
parliament rejected plans for a European defence community in 1954, despite
jittery post-war predictions of armageddon. In the event, Europe grew up
peacefully without a defence community, just as it will without Maastricht,
he says.

FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Bangemann accuses French of
anti-German sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Martin Bangemann, the most senior German politician in the European
Commission, yesterday accused French supporters of the Maastricht treaty of
whipping up anti-German sentiment to secure a 'Yes' vote in this month's
referendum.
Mr Bangemann, the EC commissioner for the internal market, said it was
dangerous and irresponsible for French politicians to argue that the
Maastricht treaty on economic and political union was the best means to
control German power in Europe.
'I hope Maastricht is ratified,' he said, 'but I can only put up with this
(talk) for so long.'
Mr Bangemann, a strong advocate of European political and economic union,
said he was disappointed at the way French politicians were suggesting that
a united Germany might revert to its Nazi past, or that it might wish to
break out of the constraints of the EC. 'It is a cheek,' he said.
Leading French proponents of Maastricht, including Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the
prime minister, Mr Laurent Fabius, chairman of the socialist party, and Mr
Michel Rocard, a potential socialist presidential candidate, have all
responded to growing opposition to Maastricht by invoking fear of a
resurgent Germany.
Mr Fabius recently spoke of the danger of German 'demons' being unleashed if
the Maastricht treaty is rejected on September 20.
German newspapers have begun to register alarm at the revival of the 'ugly
German' being raised in support of the treaty which, they point out, was
intended to reinforce the post-war partnership between France and Germany
within the European Community.
Chancellor Kohl plans to take part in a French television debate today to
support President Mitterrand against his anti-treaty opponents.
Mr Bangemann, without naming the culprits, claimed French politicians were
out of touch with the feelings of the French public which saw Germany as a
friend.
Mr Bangemann said it would be far better for proponents of the treaty to
focus on the domination of the German mark and the power of the Bundesbank
which, by fulfilling its narrow obligation of maintaining price stability,
was doing great harm to the economies of Italy, France and Great Britain.
The Maastricht treaty, which sets out a path for a common European currency
and a European Central Bank, would strip national institutions such as the
Bundesbank of their sovereignty. 'In France, not everybody has understood
that European union will do away with the domination of the Bundesbank,' he
said.
Echoing fears expressed this week by his fellow EC commissioners, Sir Leon
Brittan, the senior British commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, the
Belgian socialist, Mr Bangemann said French rejection would be a
catastrophe. It would allow all 12 member states to re-open agreements and
roll back progress made on the single integrated market.

FT  03 SEP 92 / BA poised to buy stake in French airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is in advanced negotiations to buy a large minority stake in
a French regional airline, Transport Aerien Transregional.
The move is part of BA's strategy of acquiring stakes in smaller carriers in
large European countries in order to take advantage of the single European
air market which starts next year.
The deal would follow BA's acquisition earlier this year of a 49 per cent
stake in Delta Air, a German regional carrier which has since been renamed
Deutsche BA.
European airline industry officials said yesterday the negotiations between
BA and TAT were at a critical point.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, declined to
comment on the TAT negotiations. But he confirmed that at the same time as
negotiating its global alliance with USAir - in which BA is planning to
invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 375m) for a 44 per cent stake - the UK carrier
was seeking regional airline partnerships to strengthen its European
network.
A deal with TAT is expected to spark a fierce reaction from Air France, the
French flag carrier, which was forced to dispose of its 35 per cent stake in
the regional carrier last year.
Air France sold its stake in TAT as part of an agreement with the European
Commission to enable it to take control of Air Inter, the French domestic
carrier, and UTA, the independent French long-distance airline.
Mr Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, has already warned he will make life
difficult for BA if the deal with TAT is concluded. Action could include the
ending of Air France's aircraft leasing arrangements to TAT.
TAT, founded 20 years ago, employs about 3,100 people, has annual sales of
about FFr2.4bn (Pounds 250m) and runs a fleet of 50 aircraft. It operates a
network of domestic routes and is expanding into European regional services,
including flights to the UK.
Mr Michel Marchais, founder and main shareholder of TAT, indicated in
February he would be prepared to sell part of his family's 72 per cent
controlling interest in the airline. He is understood to have approached BA
earlier this year. Sir Colin said at a Financial Times aerospace conference
yesterday that BA's strategy of becoming a global airline was 'well on the
way to becoming a reality' with the proposed USAir investment and the
European joint ventures.
Sir Colin forecast that the airline industry would ultimately be dominated
by 'no more than 10 or 12 global airline combines, perhaps less'.

FT  03 SEP 92 / 'Yes' campaign gaining ground, polls indicate
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO opinion polls yesterday forecast that France would narrowly approve the
Maastricht treaty on European union at a referendum this month, as European
leaders rallied to support President Francois Mitterrand in his campaign for
a 'Yes' vote.
Mr Mitterrand, who will tonight take part in his first television debate in
four years, has been under growing pressure since opinion polls began to
show a majority against the treaty a week ago.
Other European leaders, with their own agendas at stake, have begun adding
their weight to the 'Yes' campaign. Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez
told a rally in Strasbourg last night that Europe must overcome the
nationalist drive that unleashed two world wars. German chancellor Helmut
Kohl is to make a satellite appearance tonight on French television.
The debate between the Socialist president and Mr Philippe Seguin, the most
prominent neo-Gaullist opponent of the treaty, will set the tone in the
final stage of the referendum campaign, which is balanced on a knife-edge
margin between the 'Yes' and 'No' camps.
Two polls published yesterday showed a shift in sentiment indicating a small
majority for 'Yes'. The BVA/Paris Match poll suggested that 51 per cent of
the electorate would support ratification. The same poll last week indicated
that exactly the same proportion would vote 'No'. An IPSOS/Le Point poll
suggested a 53 per cent majority in favour, against last week's poll which
suggested the 'Yes' faction would lose with just 48 per cent.
Yesterday's polls support the general trend of this week's surveys, which
show growing support for the treaty, although still by a slim margin.
Tonight's debate will offer a chance for Mr Mitterrand to salvage his
political credibility at a time when his future has been called into
question. The anti-Maastricht camp has been trying to turn the referendum
into a vote of no confidence in him and the Socialist government.
The BVA/Paris Match poll yesterday showed that the president's approval
rating has fallen from 35 per cent to 33 per cent in the past month. This
means Mr Mitterrand is uncomfortably close to his all-time popularity poll
low of 31 per cent on the eve of this spring's regional elections.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister whose appointment after
the regional elections briefly boosted the president's poll standing, has
seen his approval rating fall from 41 per cent to 35 per cent since July.
The constitutional court yesterday rejected an appeal by conservative
opponents of the treaty, who had been trying to block ratification on
constitutional grounds.
The French stock market, which was depressed last week by the threat of a
negative referendum result, recovered momentum yesterday. The CAC 40 Index
ended the day 1.57 per cent higher at 1,700,50.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Treaty hinges on vote in France: UK will withdraw Maastricht
ratification bill if referendum says 'No'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government will withdraw the bill to ratify the Maastricht
treaty from parliament if France votes 'No' in the referendum later this
month, Downing Street said yesterday, underlining the crucial significance
of the result for Britain and the rest of Europe.
Officials also confirmed that contingency plans were being drawn up to cope
with the political and economic turbulence that would follow an outright
rejection of Maastricht by the French electorate on September 20.
Britain, as the current president of the EC, would expect to take the
initiative in picking up the pieces of the process towards economic and
political union. Contingency plans are being drawn by the Foreign Office.
Plans for co-ordinated action by European finance ministries and central
banks to deal with the probable turbulence in the currency markets that
would follow a 'No' vote will be discussed at this weekend's informal
meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath.
Analysts warn that a 'No' vote could trigger an even stronger flow of funds
into the D-Mark, pushing weaker currencies such as sterling closer to their
floor levels in the exchange rate mechanism, and forcing monetary
authorities either to raise interest rates or to mount expensive currency
support operations.
Britain's decision to scrap the Maastricht ratification bill in the event of
a 'No' vote contrasts sharply with that of other European governments
In Italy, Mr Emilio Colombo, foreign minister, said that Rome should try to
ratify the treaty in at least one house of parliament before September 20 to
show commitment to European integration.
In Bonn, a German foreign ministry spokesman declined to speculate on his
country's ratification process.
'It's downright foolish politically to start speculating now about what
would happen if the referendum in France is negative,' spokesman Mr Hanns
Schumacher told journalists.
'We hope for a positive result. The future of Europe is at stake.'
The British government is facing renewed domestic criticism over its stance
on Maastricht, with some evidence of confusion among MPs about what the UK
is trying to achieve.
Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the all-party foreign affairs committee of
MPs, said he thought British commitment to Maastricht had been shown to be
'lukewarm' by the insistence on 'opt outs' from economic union and the
social chapter.
Any way out of the Maastricht agreement would be 'very bumpy' but the demise
of the treaty after a clear French rejection was probably less troublesome
than trying to support a treaty that had diminishing support, he said.
Officials insist that Mr John Major, the prime minister, is committed to the
Maastricht deal. They point out that a rejection of the agreement would cast
a deep shadow over the UK presidency, detracting from the UK's priorities of
completing the single market and extending links with central and eastern
Europe.
British Euro-enthusiasts have criticised Mr Major's refusal to take part in
tonight's French television debate with President Francois Mitterrand on the
treaty, while Euro-sceptics believe insufficient account has been taken of
the Danish rejection of the agreement.
Mr Major's decision not to take part in the French television debate can be
seen as routine political caution.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Major had a peculiar way
of showing his desire for the UK to be at the heart of Europe, and added
that it would be no surprise if other EC countries received the impression
that 'the British commitment to Maastricht is lukewarm at best'.
The government has made it clear that even the narrowest of rejections by
the French will stop the ratification process, but it continues to emphasise
its keenness for the treaty to be approved by all 12 EC-member countries.

FT  03 SEP 92 / Brussels and UK close to agreement on border controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and the European Commission are close to a compromise on the
long-running dispute over Britain's insistence on retaining border controls
on people beyond the end of this year.
The Commission has conceded Britain's right to maintain general spot-checks
at British ports of entry, while the UK government has pledged to lighten
the controls on European Community nationals, EC and British officials said
yesterday.
The border issue has proved one of the thorniest questions to resolve in the
movement toward a single EC market. Under the Single European Act, all
controls on goods, services and people are to be lifted by January 1 1993.
But Britain has insisted on guarding its frontiers against the threat of
drug-smugglers, terrorists and organised crime.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the German commissioner for the internal market, held
talks this week with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in which
Mr Clarke presented new proposals for breaking the impasse. 'My feeling is
that we can find a pragmatic solution,' Mr Bangemann said in Brussels
yesterday.
The commissioner said that Britain and the Commission shared the general aim
of scrapping controls on the movement of people within the EC. The dilemma
was how EC citizens could be identified by British immigration without
having to subject their passports to scrutiny or other onerous controls.
One solution would be for EC nationals merely to wave their EC passports as
they walked through immigration, he suggested. The British authorities would
be able to retain controls on non-EC nationals, while also maintaining
spot-checks on suspected illegal entrants, he stressed.
Mr Bangemann also hinted that earlier Commission threats to bring Britain
before the European Court of Justice for maintaining its border controls had
been dropped. In effect, both sides had agreed to disagree on their
interpretation of article 8a of the Single European Act requiring an end to
all controls.
Britain has insisted that its vulnerability as an island state is much
greater than that of its continental partners and cited the border issue as
an example of Commission meddling. British officials have also cast doubt on
the effectiveness of immigration controls in southern EC states such as
Greece.
Despite the prospect of compromise with the Commission on border checks,
Britain remains at odds with Spain over the sovereignty of Gilbraltar. This
is holding up the long-awaited convention on strengthening the EC's external
frontiers.
Mr Bangemann, who has just completed a report on progress towards the single
market, painted a rosy picture yesterday. Some 90 per cent of the proposals
originally set out in 1985 had been adopted by the 12 partners.

FT  03 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: London Stock Exchange delays
launch of system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange has postponed the launch of its London Market
Datafeed (LMD) service, a live price and data feed designed to replace its
Computer Readable Services (CRS).
After tests, both in-house and among market practitioners, the Stock
Exchange decided to review the design and development of LMD. The system,
expected to be launched this summer, will not now be available 'for some
considerable time,' according to the exchange.
The exchange has become increasingly sensitive to potential systems failures
since a software problem shut down its Topic news and information service
for almost a whole trading session in June. Many institutional investors
ceased to deal because of the absence of reliable share price information.
One of the marketmakers involved in testing the LMD system said his firm
will be able to manage with the existing CRS feed, until the new system is
launched. 'We can slot in the new feed easily, when it is available,' he
said.

key management changes
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce will unveil a corporate reorganisation
tomorrow in an attempt to improve profitability and avoid a repetition of
its costly exposure to troubled companies such as ailing developer Olympia &amp;
York.
The bank is expected to announce several senior management changes as part
of a plan to reduce head office staff, integrate its investment and
corporate banking divisions, and focus on its business in North America.
CIBC is Canada's second biggest financial institution with assets of
CDollars 128bn (USDollars 107.5bn). It has had the misfortune, however, to
be a prominent lender to several of Canada's most troubled companies over
the past decade, including farm and industrial equipment maker
Massey-Ferguson, energy producer Dome Petroleum and, most recently, Olympia
&amp; York.
Mr Al Flood, who took over as CIBC chairman in June, has indicated to his
senior management team that lending criteria will be tightened, even at the
expense of growth in assets.
The bank will also release its third-quarter earnings tomorrow.
CIBC wrote off the bulk of its CDollars 860m exposure to O&amp;Y in its second
fiscal quarter ended April 30. As a result of these and other loan loss
provisions totalling CDollars 1.2bn, the bank suffered a second-quarter loss
of CDollars 440m, compared with earnings of CDollars 186m a year earlier.
Mr Flood has already made several key management changes. Mr John Hunkin,
former chief executive of Wood Gundy, the bank's securities arm, is now in
charge of investment and corporate banking.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y may seek US bankruptcy
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the troubled Canadian property developer, has concluded it
may have to seek protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law unless it
can satisfy demands from a loan syndicate led by JP Morgan.
Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's chief strategist, and Mr Gerald Greenwald,
president, were in New York yesterday for meetings aimed at avoiding a US
bankruptcy filing. An O&amp;Y official said the company 'may be left with no
option but to file under Chapter 11'. The official said: 'If we can't find
an accommodation with Morgan then we will have to seek protection in the
US.'
The latest conflict between O&amp;Y and JP Morgan comes four months after a
Morgan-led loan syndicate said it would foreclose on part of a Dollars 160m
loan. This announcement was followed by postponements of the foreclosure
auction and by the termination of Morgan's other role as a financial adviser
to O&amp;Y.
Three weeks ago the Morgan-led loan syndicate asked O&amp;Y to place the cash
flow generated by six healthy US buildings into a bank account that would
have Morgan as a trustee. Morgan's aim was to ensure O&amp;Y would have
sufficient funds for interest payments on the Dollars 160m loan, as well as
the cost of maintenance and tax payments on its US buildings.
O&amp;Y countered by asking Morgan to withdraw its request for the trusteeship
accounts, although the Canadian-based group did satisfy the Morgan syndicate
that sufficient funds would be set aside.
Morgan has now told O&amp;Y it would drop other requests if the developer agreed
to set up separate bank accounts to contain US cash flow. Morgan set a
deadline of September 3 for O&amp;Y to accept the compromise proposal, but one
banker said the Morgan-led group would not necessarily act to seize assets
if O&amp;Y did not comply with the deadline.

CHINESE police yesterday detained a former student activist who fled the
country after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1989, writes
Yvonne Preston in Beijing.
Shen Tong, aged 24, returned to China four weeks ago, the first student
protester to do so. He planned a news conference today to announce his
intention to establish a Beijing branch of the Democracy for China Fund, an
organisation he co-founded after fleeing to the US.
Its aim is to give political and material support to those seeking to build,
non-violently, a democratic China.
Shen's arrest will not encourage Chinese students abroad to respond to
Beijing's appeal to return or to believe its promise of no recriminations,
though the appeal specifies they must withdraw from organisations opposed to
the government and damaging to state security.

<TEXT>
THE growing problems of the Australian Labor party were underlined yesterday
when Mr John Bannon, premier of South Australia, resigned in the wake of
ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) losses incurred by a state-owned bank.
Mr Bannon has been under pressure since it emerged last year that property
lending by State Bank of South Australia would cost taxpayers ADollars
2.5bn, later increased to ADollars 3.15bn.
His departure after 10 years as premier may also mark the end of a decade
when Labor enjoyed uninterrupted control of the federal government and
dominated the six state governments. Mr Bannon was one of a group of Labor
leaders who rescued the party after Mr Gough Whitlam's federal Labor
government was defeated in a constitutional crisis in 1975.
The group included Mr Bob Hawke, prime minister from 1983 to 1991, and Mr
Neville Wran, Mr John Cain and Mr Brian Burke, respectively premiers of New
South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. All have left office in the
wake of declining popularity.

AS MUCH as SKr22.1bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden last
week in the crisis of financial confidence that forced the central bank last
Wednesday to raise its interest rate by 3 percentage points to 16 per cent,
writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
The outflow - much larger than expected - is the biggest since last November
after Finland's devaluation of the markka forced Sweden's central bank to
raise its interest rates by 6 per cent. Capital reserves have now fallen to
SKr95.2bn.
During the past two days the money markets and the bourse in Sweden have
remained nervous about the immediate economic outlook.
Short-term interest rates have continued to rise since the middle of last
week. Yesterday the bourse general share index fell by 2.6 per cent. This
followed a 0.9 per cent decline on Monday.
Sweden's centre-right coalition government continues to insist no new
economic measures are needed to deal with the financial crisis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRUGGLE erupted yesterday within the Ukrainian government over grain,
Ukraine's most precious commodity.
A deputy minister announced that Ukraine would buy 5m tonnes of grain from
abroad. But the republic's agriculture minister almost immediately
contradicted him, saying Ukraine would export grain and accusing corrupt
groups in the government of trying to profit through foreign contracts.
At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr Valentyn Lytvyn, deputy minister
of bread products, whose ministry is responsible for ensuring the government
has enough grain, announced a plan to buy 5m tonnes of foreign grain,
despite an above average harvest.
Later, however, Mr Vasyl Tkachuk, agriculture minister, claimed the republic
had enough to export. Mr Tkachuk, a recently appointed reformist minister,
believes pressure to buy grain abroad is inspired by corrupt groups in the
government.
Experts are forecasting an excellent harvest of more than 45m tonnes.
However, the government has had problems meeting its grain quotas because
farmers are either selling their grain on commodities markets or keeping it
for their own livestock rather than offering it to the government at low
state prices. Thus, the government has managed to purchase only 10m tonnes
of the 17m it considers necessary.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Ulster talks to resume at crucial stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROUND-TABLE talks on the political future of Northern Ireland resume in
Belfast today after a 40-day recess, entering what the participants believe
to be the most crucial stage of the three-strand talks process which started
last April.
The aim of the process is an agreed formula for self-rule in Northern
Ireland, to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
A month has been set aside for the current round of talks, which will
include representatives from the four main political parties in the province
as well as the British and Irish governments. Sir Ninian Stephen, the former
governor-general of Australia, will chair the meetings.
Preliminary discussions took place yesterday to agree an agenda, establish
ground rules and organise a manageable negotiating structure.
The discussions will involve three days of meetings each week, initially at
Stormont Castle in Belfast, then moving to Dublin, probably in the last week
of September. It will be the first time since partition in 1922 that
Unionist political leaders have travelled on official business to Dublin.
The talks are part of 'strand two' of the three-strand process. Talks in
July were seen as a preliminary phase, during which the six groups laid out
their positions and faced questioning by others.
The real negotiations are now expected to get under way. Signs of
flexibility will be sought - for example, whether the Irish government is
prepared to relax or amend its constitutional territorial claim to Northern
Ireland, and whether the unionist parties are prepared to concede some role
for Dublin in a future Ulster administration.
Strict confidentiality and a news blackout have been imposed on the
discussions, as it is feared that any leaks before a final agreement is
reached could endanger the talks.
In spite of some breaches of confidentiality, there is a sense that progress
has been made, if only to bring the main Ulster political parties together
with the two governments.
The three-strand political talks are based on a complex programme agreed by
the participants in April last year. In 'strand one' local politicians
discussed devolution in Northern Ireland with the UK government. In 'strand
two' the Dublin government has entered the discussions on the relations
between north and south Ireland.
This round of talks is scheduled to finish by September 28, after which a
new meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, set up under the 1985
Hillsborough agreement, is due to be held.
Unionist leaders refused to participate in the current talks unless the
Anglo-Irish conference was suspended, which it has been since April.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Former Manx bank executive sentenced in land deals case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER senior executives of the Savings and Investment Bank, the Manx
bank which collapsed in 1982 owing Pounds 42m, were among five men who
appeared for sentencing yesterday for conspiracy to defraud shareholders and
creditors of a company in fraudulent land deals.
Mr Robert Killin, the former managing director of the SIB, was one of those
who benefited from one of the deals, Manchester Crown Court heard during a
nine-week trial.
The court was told that plots in Baxenden, Lancashire, and Rastrick, West
Yorkshire, were each bought for Pounds 80,000 by three of the men. But
Pennine Commercial Holdings paid Pounds 635,000 and Pounds 180,000 for them,
said Mr Roderick Carus, QC, prosecuting. Mr David Knott, Pennine's managing
director, directly benefited from the illicit profit of the Pounds 550,000
Baxenden deal, the court heard. So did Mr Killin, of Southport, and his
general manager Mr John Cunningham, of Newton Mearns, Glasgow.
In the Baxenden deal Mr Killin and Mr Cunningham set up a dummy company in
the Isle of Man and bought the land with the SIB's money. On the same day,
with the consent of other defendants, they arranged its sale to Pennine for
Pounds 85,000 cash and 5.5m 10p Pennine shares.
Mr Killin and Mr Cunningham sold their shares for more than Pounds 50,000.
Mr Carus said the Rastrick land was bought by Mr Geoffrey Tankard, a
Bradford solicitor of Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He was Pennine's chairman and
benefited from the inflated value when he sold it on to the company. He also
agreed to the other fraudulent deal, the court heard.
Mr Carus said that legal executive Mr Ronald Brockenbrow, who was the
secretary and a director of Pennine, of Chorlton, Manchester, knew of the
improper trading, while surveyor Mr Roderick Heaton, of Chelmsford, provided
a false valuation to justify the price Pennine paid for one plot.
Mr Carus said Pennine ceased trading after the bank's spectacular collapse
in 1982. The land deals were made in the previous two years.
Mr Knott admitted conspiracy in August 1989. He was jailed for six months
with the balance of a two-year term suspended. Judge Robert Hardy said
yesterday Mr Knott was 'the principal in this wholly unhappy affair'.
Mr Cunningham and Mr Tankard were given 12-month jail sentences and Mr
Brockenbrow and Mr Heaton six months, all fully suspended. Mr Killin will be
sentenced at a later date.
The judge said only Mr Tankard was in a position to meet a financial penalty
and although he had paid for his defence should contribute Pounds 5,000
towards the cost of the Crown.
The end of the trial means a Manx government probe into the bank's collapse
 -the Chadwick Report - can now be published.
Two years ago the Manx attorney-general and police were criticised for
failing to take appropriate action after the bank collapsed.
Mr Anthony May, QC, said in his report on the public inquiry into the Manx
government's conduct in the affair there was 'a lack of controlling strategy
by the attorney-general and a lack of action by the police'.
He said activity generated in June 1983 by the report from inspectors
appointed by the Manx High Court had petered out, with no decision either to
curtail or pursue police investigations.
Criminal proceedings against eight former directors, officials and agents of
the bank were not brought until March two years ago. The trial was abandoned
when the judge ruled that there had been unreasonable delay in bringing
charges, which had resulted in prejudice to the defendants.
The Manx government commissioned Mr May to conduct an inquiry to establish
whether steps taken after the bank's collapse were 'adequate and timely'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG tries to calm fears over
mine deals

<TEXT>
PAPUA NEW Guinea yesterday moved to ease concern that mining agreements
might be renegotiated following the recent election defeat of the former
government headed by Mr Rabbie Namaliu.
Sir Julius Chan, deputy prime minister and finance minister in the new
government headed by Mr Paias Wingti, said that comments made during the
election campaign had been 'misinterpreted'.
'We are quite happy. There is no need for a re-negotiation of existing
agreements between government and mining companies,' Sir Julius said during
a visit to Sydney.
However, he said Australian mining groups, which have made substantial
investments in PNG, must become 'better corporate citizens' if they wished
to share in PNG's rapid development.
Disputes over land and royalty payments have disrupted several resource
projects, including the Panguna copper mine on Bougainville and an alluvial
gold mine at Mount Kare.
Both mines were formerly operated by CRA, the Australian mining group.
Panguna has been closed ever since it was attacked in 1990 by the
secessionist Bougainville Revolutionary Army. However, Mount Kare is
expected to reopen soon following an agreement with Placer Pacific, which
operates the nearby Porgera gold mine.
Sir Julius also said the government was considering increasing its stake in
the Kutubu oil project from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent, in line with its
agreement with a group of overseas oil companies.
Pasminco, the Australian lead and zinc group, has announced that it has
offered voluntary redundancy to 1,370 workers at its Broken Hill mines in an
effort to boost productivity by a third.
The company, which recently announced a net loss of ADollars 58.6m (Pounds
21m) for the year to the end of June, said there was no ceiling on the
number of redundancies that would be accepted.
Pasminco said that it wanted to increase production at Broken Hill by about
100,000 tonnes a year to 2.65m tonnes by June 1993. The redundancy offer is
part of a programme aimed at increasing productivity to from 1,900 tonnes to
3,000 tonnes a year per employee.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US and Russia allay uranium
glut worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT a vast additional supply of uranium would be released from
military stockpiles following the sudden ending the cold war and collapse of
the former Soviet Union have been allayed by the US and Russian governments.
They have initialled an agreement for the conversion of highly-enriched
uranium (HEU) from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons to low-enriched uranium
(LEU) for use as commercial nuclear fuel. The agreement specifically
mentions that this 'will have no adverse impact on US consumers or the
mining and processing industries'.
The deal will be greeted with relief by western uranium producers, who are
suffering severely from weak demand and prices depressed by imports from
Russia.
The US and Russia have given themselves 12 months to complete an
implementing contract which will provide for, among other things, the
conversion of at least 10 tonnes of HEU a year in the first five years and
no less than 30 tonnes a year subsequently.
The HEU will be bought by the US Department of Energy for conversion in the
US and sale for commercial purposes. Uranium has only one application - for
nuclear energy. Demand depends entirely on nuclear generating capacity in
the 25 countries using that form of power.
The US Department will also buy for resale any LEU produced from HEU
converted in Russia.
Observers suggested that the deal might escape attack by environmentalists
because of its 'swords into plough shares' flavour. But the method by which
the HEU will be transported to the US might be a sticking point, they said.
It is understood that the US Energy Department would substitute the Russian
material for higher-cost uranium produced for it in the US. This would lower
the department's cost of production.
Mr David Kay, director-general of the Uranium Institute in London, pointed
out yesterday that the US-Russian agreement 'ensures that not all the HEU
will be entering the market at once but it will be released over many years.
This arrangement seems guaranteed to have a zero impact on the market by
ensuring there is no vast new capacity'.
He said early estimates that dismantling nuclear weapons would provide about
100,000 tonnes of uranium - or about two and a half times last year's
western world sales of 38,000 tonnes - were proving wide of the mark. It was
now suggested that the US and Russia would each release about 500 tonnes in
this way.
Funds generated by the US-Russian deal will be used by the Russians partly
to upgrade the safety of their nuclear reactors and partly to build
facilities in Russia to convert HEU to LEU.
Spot prices of uranium oxide are now well below the production costs of most
mines at USDollars 7.75 a lb. Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a lb in 1978.
The market changed dramatically in the 1980s when brokers and other
intermediaries began to act for their own accounts. By selling material from
the huge stocks available in the west and latterly from Russia they have
become important alternative suppliers.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Traders assess rapeseed damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WINNIPEG TRADERS were yesterday assessing the extent of the crop damage from
early snow and frost in key Canadian producing areas that caused rapeseed
futures to jump sharply at the city's commodity exchange on Monday.
During the morning the November position eased to CDollars 304 (Pounds 128)
a tonne from the CDollars 305.40 reached on Monday. That day had seen a rise
of Dollars 9, almost reaching the daily limit on price movements, which
extended the advance over the past month to about 7 per cent. Flax seed
futures had jumped the full CDollars 10 limit on Monday. Other oil seeds
prices were up more modestly.
Mr Jim Hamilton, grains co-ordinator at James Richardson &amp; Sons, Winnipeg,
said the extent of the damage to crops under snow and the potential for
harvest could not be known for a week or so. Cool, damp weather is forecast
to continue until at least September 10.
'The rapeseed crop is two weeks late because of the weather, but it will be
several weeks before harvesting can begin,' said Mr Hamilton. 'Farmers could
face problems in delivering against September contracts, but nothing is sure
yet.'
European Community July-September soyabean crushings may be 16 per cent
higher than in the same quarter last year as crushers seek alternatives to
this year's much-reduced rapeseed crop, according to the Oil World
newsletter, reports Reuter from Hamburg.
'With rapeseed and products pricing themselves out of the market, consumers
are shifting particularly to soyoil and meal,' the weekly publication says.
It forecasts EC soyabean crushings at 3.35m tonnes in July-September from
2.88m tonnes last year and 2.81m in 1990.
The accelerating demand for soya products in Europe has provided a fillip to
crushing margins. Oil World calculates that gross soyabean crushing margins
averaged DM28 (Pounds 10) a tonne in August up from DM26 in July and only
DM12 in May. Last August the average was DM16 and two years ago it was minus
DM6.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COCONUT production will decline this year and next leading to sharp
falls in exports of coconut products, according to the Asian and Pacific
Coconut Community.
Coconut production will reach 8.524m tonnes, copra equivalent, this year,
down 3.2 per cent on 1991, and will drop to 8.452m tonnes in 1993. However,
the decline in exportable supplies of coconut products will be larger
because of a prolonged drought in the Philippines, the world's leading
exporter.
The drought has 'thwarted the prospects of a recovery in the Philippines
coconut production later this year and early 1993', the association says in
the latest edition of Cocomunity, its official publication.
The APCC forecast 1993 production in the Philippines' at 1.7m tonnes copra
equivalent, continuing a steady decline from a high of 2.8m tonnes in 1990.
The Philippines' exports of coconut oil are likely to fall 30 per cent this
year to 620,000 tonnes, with world exports down 19 per cent to 1.1m tonnes.
World exports of copra meal are forecast to fall by 9 per cent in 1992 to
980,000 tonnes and further to 949,500 next year. The APCC expects world
exports of desiccated coconut to reach 185,500 tonnes this year, down 3.6
per cent on 1991, and to drop slightly to 181,500 in 1993.

London COCOA prices dived, weighed down by fund liquidation in New York,
with traders struggling to find any fundamental reason for the drop. Traders
said there were no fresh figures on crop sizes and if anything, the recent
weather reports of limited rain in West Africa were supportive to prices.
'It looks like stale liquidation - there do not necessarily seem to be any
origins around. We certainly seemed to be limited on the upside, but I think
the downside potential is limited as well,' one trader said. Some traders
were also talking of supply and demand being evenly balanced in the coming
season rather than in outright deficit. The weakness of the dollar helped to
underpin GOLD on the London bullion market and COPPER on the LME. Copper's
cheapness in local currencies could stimulate some consumer interest in
European and Asian markets, traders said. This should also be true for other
metals but they continue to respond sluggishly to the currency factor,
probably because of their relatively high stock levels. New York COTTON was
lower at midday, scoring lifetime lows for the fifth straight session,
mainly on technically driven selling.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unsettled UK summer yields
bitter fruit - Apples and potatoes have fared better than grain, but prices
are disappointingly low / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNSETTLED summer of 1992 may not be proving ideal for cereals but it
looks like turning out rather well for some other crops like potatoes and
apples. I should stress, however, that I am referring to supply rather than
prices or profitability. For, as ever, a modest excess of perishable
commodities is leading to market collapse.
In theory, cereals are not all that perishable. They should be gathered into
barns, dried if necessary and stored safely until required for human or
animal food. For the last few years that is what has happened.
This year, however, after one of the earliest-ever starts to the UK cereal
harvest, in ideal conditions, it suddenly all went dreadfully wrong. In
mid-August, the main harvest month, the weather deteriorated. A series of
long downpours, interspersed with heavy showers, knocked crops of wheat
which had previously looked potentially reasonable, for both yield and
quality, flat to the ground.
Many of those crops are still out in the fields, especially in the northern
half of England and in Scotland. It is simply not possible to work a combine
harvester in crops that are flat and saturated, however efficient your
dryer. And now the grains are growing in the ears. Farmers will, of course,
press on with the harvest whenever the weather allows, but they know already
that much of what they will bring into their barns will not even be good pig
feed and will therefore be worth very little.
But weather conditions have been excellent for other crops; confirmation, if
it were needed, that farmers are wise if they adopt diverse cropping
systems.
Apples, for instance, have looked promising since blossom time. There was
little frost to damage the fruit set and the warm summer followed by the
recent rain has matured the fruit two to three weeks earlier than usual.
Even the strong winds over the bank holiday weekend will have done little
damage to a crop which these days is mainly grown behind high wind-breaking
hedges and on trees trained, for ease of picking, to grow to no more than
head height.
So, this week fruit growers across the country expect to start picking their
main variety - traditional Coxes. Reports suggest that it will be an
excellent crop for quantity and quality almost everywhere. But prices seem
set to be disappointing.
The estimated size of the UK crop is, in fact, only a little above average.
But there are other factors that will help keep wholesale prices low. The
first is a large quantity of southern hemisphere fruit, picked last winter,
shipped to this country and since held in UK cold stores. Fruit traders
describe the apples as 'tired' but the fact remains that they have to be
disposed of at almost any price and in the meantime overhang the market for
freshly picked home grown apples.
The second reason for UK growers concern is the massive apple crops grown in
Europe. Conditions have been ideal across the continent and current
estimates that the total EC metric tonnage for picking this year is around
10m tonnes. Last year Europe's apple growers produced a mere 5.7m tonnes and
the long term average is nearer 8m tonnes. All of which adds up to a
depressed English apple market with best fruit wholesaling at present at not
much more than 20p a lb, packed and graded. When the cost of packing,
transport and market commission can come to 15p a lb it is clear that there
is an inadequate margin left to cover all the costs of growing and picking,
let alone leave a profit for the orchard owner.
Incidentally, by way of research for this article, at the weekend I bought a
fraction over a lb of fresh English gala apples in a well known multiple
store. . . they cost me 99p. Not a bad mark-up] It is nice to know the
supermarkets are not suffering like their suppliers.
In any event it seems probable that the European Community's scheme to
stabilise the apple market in times of glut will be activated again this
year. It is triggered at the request of marketing co-operatives when prices
fall to unprofitable levels. The EC authorities then intervene in the market
to take some of the surplus off the market. The fruit they buy is either
buried or fed to livestock.
Use of the scheme in the UK is usually limited to taking a tiny percentage
of surplus Bramley cooking apples off the market. But in France and Italy,
where much bigger tonnages of varieties such as golden delicious can be
grown, the intervention price itself can be profitable. And there is a great
deal of suspicion in the UK that some of the 'destroyed' fruit ends up in
apple pies.
The UK Potato Marketing Board announced its intervention buying programme
for maincrop produce last week. This too follows forecast of a massive
surplus and the collapse of the market price to Pounds 38 a tonne. The
board's buying-in price is Pounds 33 a tonne and the purchased tonnages will
be offered to livestock farmers for feed. As with apples, prices have
collapsed because of a perceived surplus. Some so-called experts have
estimated that the UK may have grown up to a 1m-tonne surplus this year
(against average production of about 6m tonnes). But others point to the
high incidence of diseases such as blight, black leg and powdery scab, which
may mean that the tubers will rot in store. It is also possible, say the
moderates, that these estimates of very big crops have failed to account for
the fact that irrigation as had little effect this year.
Meanwhile potato growers are angry that while they are receiving as little
as 2p for a lb for potatoes, supermarkets are still charging consumers up to
20p a lb.
Doubtless the buyers for the multiples feel they are quite safe in screwing
down prices paid to UK farmers as they know there are plenty of alternative
supplies just across the English Channel. There are big potato crops in The
Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany and between them these countries
have planted an extra 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) this year.
Moreover the price of potatoes in Belgium, for instance, where there is the
largest surplus, has fallen to only about Pounds 20 per tonne. No European
farmer can grow potatoes profitably at that sort of price. Indeed, it seems
probable that many UK growers who have to rely on the PMB's fall-back price
will also lose a lot of money this year.
After all it costs between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 3,000 a hectare (Pounds
800-1,200 an acre), depending on the system used, to grow potatoes, and it
takes an incredibly good crop to yield more than 62.5 tonnes a hectare (25
tonnes an acre).
But the UK does, at least, control the acreage of potatoes grown through a
quota scheme operated by the PMB and this limits any surplus, even in a good
year. Furthermore, buying programmes to support and stabilise markets, like
that announced last week, are funded by growers themselves. For all its
faults, the system does work and is the envy of some continental growers.
It is reported, however, that Mr John Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture,
is seeking to abolish these statutory powers. Moreover, he is planning this
just months after he agreed with the other agricultural ministers of the EC
to introduce volume control for other farm commodities.
Does he seek to bring about the same kind of chaos in UK potato markets as
exists on the continent? Could this possibly be in the best interests of
either producers or consumers of potatoes? How can it possibly be consistent
to try to control the production of one batch of food crops while
deliberately encouraging over-production of another? I think we should be
told.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Substantial turnround at Litton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTON INDUSTRIES, the diversified electronics, defence, marine engineering
and resource exploration services group, achieved a substantial turnround in
the fourth quarter of its 1991-92 fiscal year.
The California-based company recorded net income of Dollars 44.95m in the
three months to end-July, compared with a loss of Dollars 58.4m in the same
period of 1991.
The loss last year did, however, include Dollars 100.1m of charges taken
because of the phasing out of a part of the group's integrated automation
division.
Sales in the fourth quarter were Dollars 1.44bn, up from Dollars 1.37bn.
Earnings per share in the quarter were Dollars 1.08, against a loss of
Dollars 1.43 per share a year ago.
For the whole of the 1991-92 fiscal year Litton made Dollars 174.4m of net
profit, compared with Dollars 63.5m in the 1990-91 year. Sales for the year
ended July 31 1992 were Dollars 5.69bn, against Dollars 5.22bn.
Mr Orion Hoch, chairman, said fiscal 1992 operating profits from Litton's
on-going businesses were 11 per cent higher.
Operating profit in the resource exploration services division improved by
29 per cent to Dollars 133.6m, thanks to a shift from North American to more
international areas of energy exploration.
Defence budget cuts continued to reduce sales and operating profits from the
group's advanced electronics division, Mr Hoch said.
This division suffered a Dollars 10m drop in operating profits for the year
to Dollars 138.1m. He added, however, that internal consolidation efforts
should lead to firmer profit margins.
On Wall Street, Litton's share price was marked Dollars  3/4 higher to
Dollars 46 1/8 at close of trading.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bond reconstruction on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLEX reconstruction of Bond Corporation Holdings, once the quoted
flagship of Mr Alan Bond, appears to be back on course after the group
settled a dispute with Australian Consolidated Investments (Acil).
Acil, formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, also announced a
net loss of ADollars 46m (USDollars 35.3m) after abnormal items for the year
to end-June, against a loss of ADollars 108.2m the previous year.
Bond Corp's reconstruction was endangered in June when Acil withdrew from a
management committee overseeing implementation of a debt-for-equity swap
which would give Acil 25 per cent of Bond shares.
Acil had earlier stopped making working capital payments of up to ADollars
1m a month to Bond Corp, which were provided for under a deal reached last
year between Bond and its creditors.
The dispute was complicated by the acquisition of Acil earlier this year by
Rossington Holdings, a bidding vehicle jointly owned by Brierley Investments
of New Zealand and GPG, Sir Ron Brierley's UK investment company.
However, Mr Colin Henson, Acil's executive director, said the group had
suspended a claim over several of Bond Corp's remaining assets in return for
ADollars 16.75m in cash and assets.
Mr Henson said Acil would resume working capital payments and help finance
the cost of a legal action brought by Bond against the Western Australian
state government over the failed Kwinana petrochemicals project.

<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, yesterday announced a 75 per cent
increase in net profit to ADollars 132.8m (USDollars 95.4m) for the year to
the end of June, on revenue down 11 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn. However, net
profit was unchanged at ADollars 87m after excluding an abnormal profit of
ADollars 45.8m on the sale of the group's interest in Teck Corporation of
Canada.
At the bottom line, profit was ADollars 106.3m after exchange differences
and minority interests, compared with ADollars 6.9m the previous year, when
MIM wrote off its investment in the troubled Newlands, Collinsville and
Abbott Point (NCA) coal project.
MIM said the revenue fall was partly caused by the exclusion from the
results of the NCA operations, which are operating at capacity but
generating insufficient cash to meet interest payments. The group is
discussing refinancing proposals with the banks.
Revenue was also reduced by lower prices for copper, lead and gold, and
copper production difficulties caused by adverse weather conditions.
However, MIM said reduced revenue from lower sales and prices was more than
offset by a strong performance from the Porgera gold mine in Papua New
Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM subsidiary.
The group cut costs by nearly 12 per cent to ADollars 1.7bn.
At the operating level, profits fell to ADollars 145m from ADollars 155m the
previous year, but increased to ADollars 62m in the fourth quarter from
ADollars 47m, reflecting cost savings.

The group raised the final dividend to 7.75 cents from 7.5 cents, making a
total of 15.5 cents, fully franked, against 15.25 the previous year.
SA Brewing said the improvement in sales revenue was largely due to a 22 per
cent improvement in the beverage and food division.
Mr Ross Wilson, managing director, said the result was 'excellent' given
difficult trading conditions. But he warned the current year would be
difficult because there were no signs of recovery in the domestic economy.
He said SA Brewing's wine and water heater businesses, both of which have
international markets, would provide the group's 'primary growth' over the
next 12 to 18 months.

TOTAL, one of France's largest oil groups, saw its net profits fall by 47
per cent to FFr1.91bn (Dollars 406.3m) from FFr3.61bn in the first half of
the year. This was mainly due to depressed refinery prices, squeezed margins
and the impact of the dollar's decline against the European currencies.
The interim results were well below the expectations of the Paris oil
analysts, who had been forecasting first-half profits of between FFr2.2bn
and FFr2.4bn.
The disappointing figures from Total reflect the general trend among large
French companies, which have recently released a series of lacklustre sales
and profit figures for the first half.
Total's shares have fallen sharply on the Paris stock market in recent weeks
on concern about the implications of the continuing decline of the dollar.
They slipped again yesterday, falling FFr1.5 to FFr207.3, compared with
FFr230, the price at which the French government sold a FFr9.5bn stake in
the group in June. The shares were unaffected by the first-half figures
which were published after the stock market closed.
Group sales fell to FFr68.76bn from FFr69.58bn during the first six months
of the year.
Operating income slipped to FFr3.4bn from FFr5.77bn and cashflow to
FFr5.29bn from FFr7.61bn. Earnings per share were reduced by more than half
to FFr9.0 from FFr18.8.
The worst affected area of Total's activities was refining where operating
income declined dramatically to FFr932m from FFr3.08bn. This was partly due
to a 'significant decrease' in European refining margins, which more than
halved from an average of Dollars 5.2 a barrel in the first half of 1991, to
an average of Dollars 2.1 in the corresponding period this year because of
weak demand and high stocks.
Exploration and production sustained a slight decline in operating income to
FFr1.31bn from FFr1.42bn.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Westar Mining goes into
bankruptcy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTAR Mining, Canada's biggest coal exporter, has slid into bankruptcy
after failing to overcome a range of financial and labour problems.
A Vancouver judge has named a partner at auditors Arthur Andersen as
bankruptcy trustee. Westar has total debts of about CDollars 400m (USDollars
334.3m). Its biggest creditor is Bank of Montreal.
But Mr Justice Bruce Macdonald has allowed Westar's two mines in south-east
British Columbia to remain temporarily under court protection while efforts
continue to secure their future.
Workers at the Greenhills mine, which produced 2.4m tonnes of coal last
year, are negotiating with a prospective buyer of Westar's 80 per cent
stake. The remaining 20 per cent is owned by Pohang Iron and Steel of South
Korea.
Judge Macdonald has extend-ed Greenhills' protection from creditors for at
least another 60 days and has authorised the trustee to borrow whatever
funds are needed to keep Greenhills in operation. The outlook is gloomier
for the larger Balmer mine, which has been closed since early May by a
labour dispute. Court protection for Balmer has been extended only to
September 24.
Balmer, which shipped 5.3m tonnes of coal last year, re-quires substantial
new investment to extend its life. However, Westar has failed to finalise a
financial restructuring.
In addition, the union at Balmer, whose leadership has a reputation for
being among the most intransigent in the North American mining industry, has
rejected all efforts by management to introduce more flexible work
practices.
Westar's problems are part of a much wider restructuring forced on the
high-cost Canadian coal mining industry by sagging Japanese demand for
coking coal and sliding prices. Another large British Columbia mine,
Quintette, emerged from court protection earlier this year after a financial
restructuring which left its creditors as substantial minority shareholders.

<TEXT>
ASCII, the Japanese software and publishing company, has reached final
agreement with its banks that will lead to Y16.4bn (Dollars 133m) in fresh
loans to the company.
Yesterday's announcement removes a cloud from the company's future. Ascii
has been negotiating with its banks since late last year to raise funds to
repay Y12bn in convertible bonds due at the end of the financial year.
In addition to funds to repay the bonds, Ascii has raised Y4.4bn in working
and investment capital, of which Y3.5bn has been paid to the company.
Its bankers, which include the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank, Sakura
Bank, Yasuda Trust Bank, Kyowa Saitama Bank and Mitsubishi Bank, have,
however, evidently extracted promises from the company to cut costs and trim
loss-making operations. The company said yesterday this would not affect its
film-making subsidiary.
Ascii was founded by three university students in 1978 and has grown quickly
into Japan's largest independent software house, but its financial troubles
appear to have stemmed diversification out of its core businesses.
The downward revision in earnings estimates for Matsushita Electric
Industrial reported in last Wednesday's paper covered the half year ending
next month, not the full fiscal year as reported.

<TEXT>
AN OFFICIAL investigation has been launched into the activities of Hong
Kong's Tomson Pacific Group, which is headed by Macao casino entrepreneur Mr
Stanley Ho.
The financial secretary appointed an inspector yesterday and trading in the
three group listings was suspended. The announcement comes three weeks after
the Securities and Futures Commission instigated an investigation into share
dealings in Mr Lee Ming Tee's Allied group.
The SFC recommended the latest investigation into 'a number of specific
transactions' carried out by Tomson Pacific and its 33.4 per cent owned
associate World Trade Centre (WTC), since 1990.
WTC was formerly Mr Alan Bond's Hong Kong investment company Bond
Corporation International (BCIL), which was sold in June 1990. His 66 per
cent stake was split between Tomson and independent parties.
The regulators required proof of the identity of the independent buyers, due
to concerns that some might be acting in concert with Tomson, thereby
breaching the 35 per cent trigger under the takeover code.
Tomson Pacific is 26 per cent owned by Rivera Holdings, whose shares were
also suspended, but which is not caught up in the investigation.

interim stage

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL BUT one of Israel's four main banks have reported sharply improved net
profits in the first half of 1992.
The exception was Bank Mizrahi which the government earlier this month
agreed to sell to an Israeli businessman in a deal intended to begin the
long-delayed process of divesting the state's majority states in all four
big banks.
The agreement to sell Bank Mizrahi to Mr Gad Ze'evi, who owns the small
Maritime Bank and other private businesses, requires the approval of the
Knesset finance committee which this week delayed a decision while it
reviewed the price of the deal.
Mr Ze'evi agreed to pay Dollars 100m for a 26 per cent stake in Bank
Mizrahi, the smallest of the four leading banks. He has an option to
purchase another 25 per cent for a further Dollars 85m and, meanwhile, will
be able to exercise the votes of government shares sufficient to give him
majority control.
If the deal goes through, it will mark a breakthrough in the government's
efforts to sell off the bank holdings it acquired for Dollars 7bn to rescue
the banks from a share price collapse in 1983. Under a share preference
arrangement, control of the banks was left in the hands of the original
owners. But government shares will have full voting rights as soon as they
are sold back to the private sector.
The bank sale process is seen as a test of the government's commitment to
reducing the state's role in the economy and as an important fund-raising
project, but it has been dogged by delays and setbacks for the past three
years.
Bank Mizrahi, to date controlled by the Mizrahi world religious Jewish
organisation, lagged behind its larger competitors in performance over the
first half.
Net profits were Shk26.6m (Dollars 11m) compared with Shk24.9m last year.
Israel Discount Bank, previously owned by the Recanati family of Tel Aviv,
did best, posting a 57.6 per cent rise in net profits to Shk49.7m, thanks to
improved revenue from financing activity at home and profits of Dollars 8.5m
from Israel Discount Bank of New York.
Continued losses in its New York subsidiary dragged down profits at Bank
Leumi, controlled by the Jewish Colonial Trust, but it still posted a 35 per
cent increase to Shk81.7m. The biggest of the four, trade union-controlled
Bank Hap-oalim, reported a 29 per cent rise in net profits to Shk111m.

GENERAL MOTORS is to invest more than Dollars 20m in a new plant in
Argentina, 13 years after it withdrew from the country.
It will invest about Dollars 20m in cash and an unspecified am-ount in
industrial equipment for the new facility which is to be set up with an
Argentine group. The factory will build commercial vehicles for the local
market and for export to Brazil to compensate for rising imports from Brazil
where GM has a major presence.
GM is joining forces with the local owners of Iveco, the Italian truck
company. In Argentina, Fiat holds only 30 per cent of Iveco. GM will set up
a joint venture with the wealthy Garfunkel family, which holds the other 70
per cent. Fiat is not expected to put more money into the venture, thus
reducing its holding in Iveco.
GM's decision follows the announcement last month by Renault, the French
state-owned car maker, to withdraw from Argentina by selling a majority
stake in its local subsidiary to a group of Argentine and Brazilian
investors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York Stock Exchange reported that its member firms made an after-tax
profit of Dollars 1.14bn in the second quarter. This is the second-best
performance and further proof that the US securities industry is enjoying
unprecedented prosperity.
The second-quarter earnings comfortably beat the Dollars 859m earned at the
same stage a year ago, but did not quite match the Dollars 1.36bn made in
the first three months of this year.
The combined profits of the first two quarters was Dollars 2.51bn, smashing
the previous best first-half performance, which was the Dollars 1.82bn
achieved in 1991 and 1983.
The NYSE's 315 member firms have enjoyed record profits this year because of
low US interest rates which have stimulated record issues of underwritten
securities by US corporations, and attracted a flood of investors into the
equities and bond markets.
Low interest rates have also sharply reduced the cost of securities firms'
capital. This has been put to profitable use in domestic and international
securities markets, and provided many broking houses with the opportunity to
earn big profits from their proprietary trading businesses.
The NYSE said its members' strong profits in the April to June period
represented an 11.3 per cent annual return on their average net worth of
Dollars 40.4bn.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Europe focuses on currency tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
provided the main focus of attention for Europe's government bond markets
yesterday with the weakness of the lira, sterling and French franc
depressing sentiment in the respective bond markets.
The Italian government bond market fell back sharply due to the combination
of a poor bond auction and the weak currency.
The treasury's L1,500bn issue of 10-year, 12 per cent fixed-rate notes was
fully subscribed, but dealers said the price at which the stock was
allocated was well below previous auction levels.
The bonds were sold at 92.10, resulting in a gross yield of 13.91 per cent,
compared with 13.22 per cent at the previous auction of 10-year notes. The
futures contract, which opened at 92.40, fell to a low of 91.48 before
ending the day at around 91.52.
French government bonds drifted lower on currency and opinion poll worries
ahead of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The yield on the 8
1/2 per cent bond due 2002 opened at 9.17 per cent and ended at 9.18 per
cent. The latest opinion poll from France forecast an equal split between
yes and no votes in the referendum.
The French treasury announced that it will offer FFr10bn-Fr12bn of OAT tap
stocks at Thursday's auction.
US TREASURY prices firmed across the board after the Federal Reserve
injected reserves into the banking system by purchasing coupon-bearing
securities from dealers.
At the close the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  11/32 at 98
13/32 , yielding 7.377 per cent. There was less movement at the short end of
the market, where the two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.102
per cent.
Although the dollar weakened yesterday, its first serious decline in three
trading days, it had little impact on bond market sentiment. Investors paid
more attention to the day's main economic news, which was a drop in the
National Association of Purchasing Management's index from 54.2 in July to
53.7 in August. The figures suggested that the pace of activity in the
manufacturing sector remains extremely sluggish for the current stage in the
economic cycle.
Prices did not take off, however, until the afternoon when the Fed made its
'coupon pass' by buying coupons maturing in April 1993 or later for delivery
tomorrow. The pass had been expected but not until later in the week, and
had the greatest effect on intermediate prices.
IN THE UK government bond market, gilts drifted lower with the Liffe gilt
futures contract falling from 94.29 to 94.25 by late afternoon. In the cash
market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 slipped  1/32 to 100 19/32 .
JAPANESE government bonds continued to fall back yesterday as hopes of an
imminent cut in interest rates faded in the wake the government's emergency
spending package.
The markets had hoped that the Y10,700bn fiscal package, which was announced
last Friday and which is aimed at boosting economic growth, would be
accompanied by a cut in the official discount rate.
However, in the absence of such a cut, the bond cash and futures markets
have fallen back from last week's high levels. The key December futures
contract ended at 104.69 against 104.78 at Monday's close, and compared with
last week's high of 106.65.
In the cash market, the yield on the new 10-year benchmark - the No 145 JGB
 -opened at 4.99 per cent and traded in a range of 4.955 per cent to 5.055
per cent, before moving to 5.06 per cent in London trading.
Short-term interest rates rose with the rate on three-month certificates of
deposit climbing to 3.82 per cent from 3.76 per cent on Monday.
Dealers said that the bond market remains 'slightly concerned' about the
possibility of new bond issuance even though the government said it would
not issue additional bonds in order to pay for its spending package.

SALOMON, the parent group of Wall Street securities house Salomon Brothers
and oil trading and refining firm Phibro Energy, yesterday appointed Mr
Robert Mundheim as its new general counsel. He succeeds Mr Robert Denham,
who became chairman of Salomon in June.
Mr Mundheim, 59, is co-chairman of the New York law firm Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, and has extensive legal experience in the world
of finance and securities markets.
During the 1960s he was special counsel to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, between 1977 and 1980 he was general counsel to the US Treasury
department, and he is currently chairman of the international committee of
the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The appointment of Mr Mundheim marks the end of a turbulent period for
Salomon's legal and compliance department. Last year government regulators
discovered that Salomon Brothers' bond trading desk had submitted false bids
in US Treasury auctions. The scandal led to the resignation of the then
chief counsel, Mr Donald Feuerstein, along with three senior executives.

FT  02 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy turns in top
performance for August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY was the top-performing government bond market last month with a 1.67
per cent return in local currency terms, according to JP Morgan's bond
index.
The Italian bond market has been one of the more volatile government markets
since June 2, when Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty and threw the
future of European economic and monetary union into a state of confusion.
The Bank of Italy's decision to cut its official discount rate by half a
percentage point to 13.25 per cent on August 4 provided a boost for the bond
market.
However, the return on the Italian government bond market so far this year
is only 2.8 per cent, placing Italy well behind most of the other European
and the dollar bloc bond markets in local currency terms.
Germany and the Netherlands were the next best-performingmarkets after
Italy, with returns of 1.21 per cent and 1.03 per cent respectively in
August: the gains reflect the decision by investors to shift assets into the
D-Mark bloc due to concern over the future of European economic and monetary
union, and fears that there might be a realignment of the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Last month's worst-performing markets were Australia (-3.59 per cent),
Sweden (-2.67 per cent), Spain (-1.09 per cent) and the UK (-1.01 per cent).
Australian government bond prices suffered losses of nearly 4.5 per cent in
August, mainly due to foreigners' lack of confidence in the Australian
dollar and uncertainty over the timing of the next cut in interest rates.
Sweden's government bond market tumbled after the central bank jacked up
interest rates to stem heavy outflows of currency.
US dollar-based investors enjoyed 'outstanding returns . . . in foreign
bonds' according to JP Morgan, due to the US currency's recent decline
against the ERM currencies. The German bond market showed a gain of 6.84 per
cent in dollar terms over the month and of 14.31 per cent since the start of
the year.

350m offering
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Export-Import Bank of Japan yesterday launched a CDollars 350m 10-year
offering, leading an expected surge of new issues, as the Eurobond market
revives after its traditional summer break.
Although many borrowers are well advanced in their 1992 funding programmes,
they are likely to press ahead with further financings planned for this year
sooner, rather than later.
'A lot of borrowers are well ahead of schedule, but there is the French
referendum later this month and the US election in November,' said one
trader. Borrowers are unlikely to wait until December to complete this
year's financings, in case markets prove unfavourable.
The malaise of the European bond markets ahead of the French referendum is
likely to channel funding to the dollar and Canadian dollar sector. Heavy
redemption flows in these markets are helping to sustain investor appetite.
A handful of Euroyen offerings yesterday for Sapporo Breweries, Japan
Airlines, Sumitomo Chemical and Hankyu Corporation were targeted at Japanese
investors.
However, a number of other borrowers are eyeing the Euroyen market,
including the Japan Development Bank, which is said to be preparing a Y100bn
seven-year deal.
Other borrowers considering the Euroyen sector include the European
Investment Bank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, according
to dealers. However, they added that the market could easily become
overloaded.
'The Euroyen market is quite thin,' said one trader. 'Some borrowers may
decide to switch to the dollar sector, where they can lock in historically
low rates.'
Among yesterday's new issues, the Export-Import Bank of Japan's CDollars
350m deal via Swiss Bank Corporation, priced to yield 37 basis points over
the 10-year Canadian government bond yield, met firm demand from Japanese
investors. The deal was bid at 99.55 at the end of trading, unchanged from
the fixed reoffer price.
In the sterling sector, National Provincial Building issued Pounds 150m of
floating rate notes, due 1997, via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which was targeted
at UK-based investors.

Finland an expected bulk order for the JAS 39 Gripen multi-purpose fighter
aircraft.
The Finnish government's decision to purchase 57 new F18s from the American
company McDonnell Douglas instead of the JAS came as a severe shock to
Sweden's aircraft makers who had convinced themselves that the Finns were
bound to choose their fighter for commercial as well as political reasons.
The importance of the JAS for Swedish aerospace was underlined only two days
after the Finnish deal with McDonnell Douglas when the Swedish government
announced it had decided to take out a second order for 110 JAS aircraft for
the Swedish air force, with the first deliveries in 1996. The announcement's
timing was significant because it signalled to the outside world the
firmness of the Swedish state's commitment to the successful completion of
the JAS project.
But the government's decision to go ahead came after four years of dither,
investigation and argument over whether it made any real sense to continue
with JAS in view of the strong opposition to the fighter aircraft project
from Sweden's peace movement.
However, there remains a clear danger that the aircraft will prove a
commercial failure unless it makes a breakthrough into overseas markets. The
total cost of the JAS programme to the year 2000 has now reached an
estimated SKr63bn, well above its original budget target of SKr24.9bn at
1981 price levels (around SKr54bn). So far, no foreign country has ordered
one of the new aircraft.
The Swedish consortium manufacturing JAS - made up of Saab-Scania,
Volvo-Flygmotor, Ericsson Motor System and the government-owned FFV
Aerotech, part of the Celsius industrial group - hopes to find potential
buyers among the countries of central and eastern Europe. This spring, the
Hungarian government showed interest.
There is even a belief in Stockholm that the German government might
consider acquiring the JAS fighter for its own air force after recently
pulling out of the European Fighter Aircraft project. But for all the
optimistic talk, nothing has so far materialised in the form of tangible
orders.
The JAS is highly regarded by its manufacturers. Its aim is to perform
fighter, ground attack and reconnaissance missions. The first of the new
generation of light combat aircraft, JAS has a take-off weight of only eight
tonnes. It will be able to carry short as well as medium-range air-to-air
missiles and the Mauser 27mm cannon.
Requiring minimal base facilities, JAS has a flexible versatility that ought
to make it look attractive to air forces in the post-Cold War era. It brings
together the best technological advances made by the Swedish defence
industry.
But ever since the Swedish government gave the go-ahead as long ago as 1982
the JAS project has been plagued with difficulties.
As a result of technical troubles, particularly with the computer software
that controls the aircraft's fly-by-wire flight system, it has fallen two
years behind schedule which has added substantially to the development costs
and placed a question mark over its ability to generate profits for the
consortium.
The original contract for the first 30 units between the consortium and the
Swedish state was a fixed cost one - much to the chagrin of the aerospace
industry.
The soaring costs had an adverse impact on Saab-Scania's profitability in
its aerospace business.
For all its past doubts and complaints, the Swedish government is keen to
see the JAS succeed. It is estimated that about 28,000 jobs are dependent on
the project and, at a time when registered unemployment is climbing to the 5
per cent mark, any threat to the fighter aircraft would have bleak
consequences for the labour market.
Moreover, as the MInistry of Defence admitted in its spring policy document
on the future of Sweden's armed forces: 'If the JAS project should collapse
it would have serious consequences not only for the credibility of our
defence policy but also for high technology research and development.'
By contrast, Sweden's civil aviation industry looks far more viable with big
demand for its products on world markets.
The Saab 340 has been a great success with a dominant position among
regional airlines. At the end of last year, the order book backlog for them
numbered 92.
The Saab 2000 regional turboprop 50- to 58-seater airliner was unveiled for
the first time last December, and made its successful maiden flight on March
26.
Certification of the aircraft is scheduled for the middle of 1993 with first
deliveries due by the autumn of that year. The first customer to receive the
new aircraft will be Crossair, the Swiss airline. Firm orders now total
around 50, while there are options to buy about 150 more. In the US, Express
Airlines I (Northwest Airlink) will be the launch customer for the Saab
2000.
This spring Saab-Scania streamlined its aircraft operations into three
separate business areas in a move designed to increase efficiency and
strengthen competitiveness. But until the JAS 39 Gripen begins to win orders
outside Sweden, uncertainty will persist about the shape of the country's
aerospace industry.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (24): Waiting for 'big brother' Boeing -
Japanese fear they may be frozen out of large new US and European projects
</HEADLINE>

JAPAN'S three leading aircraft producers are going flat out as partners
responsible for about 21 per cent of Boeing's 777 programme and in
co-developing the F-16-based FSX fighter with General Dynamics.
But the executives at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries
and Fuji Heavy Industries face big questions:
what will their research and engineering staffs focus on once these
development programmes wind down in 1995-96?
how will they prepare for future partnerships with Boeing or European
aircraft makers?
The answers largely depend on the path Boeing takes. If Boeing seeks to
develop a 600-plus seat super jumbojet, the Japanese will probably be
pursued as key partners. However, should Boeing and Airbus pool their
efforts after deciding athat two separate groups could not profitably build
super jumbojets, Japan could be left without a suitor. Because any super
jumbo will cost at least Dollars 10bn to develop, even Boeing-Airbus
collaboration is not impossible.
A 'fall back' plan for Japan is the 'YSX'. The proposed 50-100 seat jet has
been discussed for a few years. So too has the so-called 'YXX', also known
as the 7J7, a proposed 150-seater that Boeing decided not to develop few
years ago due to marketing headaches.
While the Boeing-led YXX-7J7 may still be built in some form, Japan's YSX
appears to have more momentum, at least in Tokyo. If it is built, actual
development will not begin before 1994-95, for an initial flight by 1999 or
2000.
Already Japan Aircraft Development Corp. (JADC) has finished a first-phase
feasibility study on the YSX, under funding from the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), says Hideo Suzuki, deputy director
of MITI's aircraft and ordnance division. JADC, which coordinates Japan's
partnership with Boeing in the 777, is now conducting a follow-up study that
examines detailed aspects of the YSX proposal.
Officials at JADC suggest the aircraft could have relatively
high-performance and contain up to about 130 seats. Or it could be a
smaller, low-cost aircraft with economical operating costs that would be
highly attractive to airlines.
Of the two main possible configurations, the lower-cost model appears more
in line with reality. Preliminary discussions with air lines - including
Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways - have forced JADC to focus on the
lower-cost version. Its main target markets are Japan, Asia and North
America.
Design is not the only variable. The YSX also involves partnership choices.
Nobuyuki Fujita, senior YSX manager at JADC, says 'one of the fundamental
policies of the YSX programme is international collaboration'. Japan could
either develop the YSX with advanced European or American partners, or with
Asian partners such as those from China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore or
South Korea.
Perhaps the most pragmatic reason for cooperating with Asian partners would
be to keep down the price tag. Building it entirely at home would reflect
Japan's astronomical labour costs. Japan could play the quasi-political role
of benevolent programme coordinator, under a scheme that would enable Asian
nations to sell more value-added aircraft components to Japan. But building
the aircraft with Asian partners would result in more difficulties in
getting US FAA type certification, Japanese aerospace specialists admit.
They would also prefer to work with experienced European or US aerospace
companies as they are not quite confident enough to lead a group of Asian
aircraft makers. British Aerospace has already informally approached the
Japanese on the idea of developing an aircraft about the same size as the
YSX.
As for the engine to power the YSX, studies are under way at Japan Aero
Engines Corp. to examine choices. Japan Aero Engines is a consortium that
coordinates the nation's work share for International Aero Engines' V2500
jet engine, led by Rolls Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The Japanese consortium comprises Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. A de-rated V2500 turbofan engine is
one major possibility for the YSX. Additionally, Snecma of France made
recent inquires about Japanese participation in a programme to build an
engine for a 75-100 seat plane.
What might come after the YSX? It could conceivably later lead to bigger and
better Japanese aircraft, supported in part by the Japan Development Bank
and other MITI affiliates. However, according to a MITI official, Japan has
no intention to develop its own midsized and larger commercial aircraft,
because it prefers partnerships with proven leaders.
One thing is certain about the proposed YSX. Japan possesses the
capabilities, both technical and financial, to develop it. Still, it would
be a challenge to cultivate the required marketing expertise to sell it
overseas. It may not be a profitable venture, but the YSX is technically
feasible.
Nevertheless, a ghost from the past haunts Japan's aircraft industry. It is
the YS-11. Nihon Airplane Manufacturing Co., a special consortium, that
produced the 64-seat YS-11 from the early 1960s through 1974.
A total of 182 twin-turboprop YS-11s were made. But the programme lost
money. Even MITI calls the YS-11 a failure. However, it did enable Japan's
aircraft industry to nurture sufficient know-how to get an invitation as a
major supplier for the Boeing 767 twinjet. Dozens of workhorse YS-11s are
still flying in Japan, and they will soon need to be replaced. The YSX fits
the bill.
Japanese aircraft specialists realise they cannot just conduct studies on
aircraft. Some type of commitment will have to be made soon. This is
necessary because the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies (SJAC)
estimates that aircraft production (including repairs) will decline 9.3 per
cent to Yen 783bn in fiscal 1992, which started in April 1992.
This projected decline is largely due to falling orders from the Japan
Defence Agency, which account for about 75 per cent of the nation's aircraft
business.
Beyond the YSX proposal, SJAC is even investigating the idea of a supersonic
transport. Much of this work centres on positioning Japan for an invitation
to join an American or European supersonic aircraft programme a few years
down the runway. Japan is setting its sights high. But those sights are not
one notch higher than those of Boeing, its 'big brother'.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (21): Airbus takes the strain - France
fights against falling orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French aircraft industry was given a much needed shot in the arm in
July, when United Airlines, one of Boeing's main customers, ordered up to
Dollars 5bn worth of Airbus A320 airliners.
The sales coup comes as French state-owned Aerospatiale, a 37.9 per cent
shareholder in the European Airbus consortium, is struggling with a decline
in orders in both civil and defence markets. It needs the breathing space.
Aerospatiale saw its orders fall by 50 per cent last year, worse than the
overall 30 per cent decline recorded by the French aerospace industry
generally in 1991, according to Gifas, the industry federation. Snecma, the
state-controlled engine maker, saw its orders go down by 30 per cent, and
Dassault, the maker of fighter jets which has not had a military export
order for four years, saw its orders fall by a quarter.
They all know that United Airlines type bonanzas will be very rare, so they
cannot depend on a sudden upturn in civil business to bail them out. The
same is true of defence markets, where the French military, French aerospace
companies' main defence customer, has been told to freeze its budget in real
terms for the next three years.
French aerospace companies' response, therefore, has been to step up the
search for foreign alliances, to pool their heavy research budgets, exchange
costly technology and seek economies of scale.
In the past year, Aerospatiale led the first real rationalisation of the
hard-pressed western helicopter industry through a merger of its helicopter
business with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to form Eurocopter. The new group,
formed in January and controlled by Aerospatiale, becomes the world's second
largest supplier after Sikorski of the US. Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, its
French chairman, believes this is the first step towards cutting the number
of leading western helicopter makers from eight to three or four by the end
of the decade.
In defence, Dassault recently revealed that it is discussing collaboration
on a future generation of fighter aircraft with British Aerospace.
This would come into production in at least 30 years' time. It is separate
from the troubled four-nation European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) and France's
Rafale, the two new fighter projects in which both companies are separately
involved. Sadly for Dassault, the Rafale cannot replace the EFA because it
is designed for ground attack, rather than the air to air combat for which
the heavier EFA is needed.
France is sticking to the Rafale, on which Dassault's future largely
depends, but has been forced by the pressure on its defence budget to delay
the first deliveries by two years to 1998.
Seeking strength through co-operation is also behind the plans by
Aerospatiale, with Dasa and Alenia of Italy to acquire joint control of
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft producer. The trio teamed up last year to form a
regional aircraft consortium called Regioliner, controlled by Dasa,
resembling a mini-Airbus Industrie.
Airbus has been thinking about making smaller aircraft itself, but has not
objected loudly to Regioliner's ambitions because it is putting most of its
effort into planning for a giant long-haul carrier for 600 to 1,000 people.
Snecma, the main engine supplier to Dassault and Airbus, is also looking for
a foreign partner. It is discussing possible collaboration on future
military jet engines with Rolls-Royce of the UK. Currently, Snecma is the
only European company to develop a fighter jet engine - the M88 for the
Rafale - on its own.
By contrast, Snecma decided long ago not to go it alone in civil engines,
where it has for the past 23 years had a successful partnership with General
Electric of the US. Their joint subsidiary, CFM International, had a 27 per
cent share of the world market at the end of last year.
France's largely state-controlled aerospace industry has just seen a
reshuffle at the top, as part of the three-yearly review of mandates of
public sector chairmen.
Mr Henri Martre stepped down at the end of June after nine years as chairman
of Aerospatiale, to be replaced by Mr Louis Gallois, who was head of Snecma,
the jet engine maker, for the past three years. Mr Martre is due to reach
the mandatory retirement age of 65 next year.
Mr Gallois, 48, who has been an Aerospatiale board member for the past two
years, was front runner for the job and is expected to continue his
predecessor's strategy of seeking international partners.
Mr Gallois' empty chair at Snecma has been filled by 51-year-old Mr Gerard
Renon, a former junior defence minister from 1989 to 1991 and technical
adviser to President Mitterrand for the two years after Mitterrand came to
power in 1981.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (22): Children of Aeroflot lack the
freshness of youth - Leyla Boulton studies the emergent airlines of the
former USSR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RUSSIA and the other former Soviet states try to switch from Communism to
capitalism, the air-related industries are going through turbulent times in
taking off for a market economy.
Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier which is being broken into separate airlines by
the 15 former Soviet republics and other sub-entities, remains the logo on
most civil aircraft in the former Soviet Union. Even though the stewardesses
will welcome you to different names - say Uzbek Hava Yollaru or Lithuanian
Airlines - the service, the aircraft, and the terminals remain depressingly
inferior to world standards.
Nonetheless, change is taking place, even if the signs are only visible on
the surface. Within Russia, Aeroflot is creating a series of subsidiaries,
again with different names - such as Moscow Airlines and Russian
International Airlines. The latter has been set up specifically to operate
five Airbus A310s which Aeroflot ordered before the Soviet Union collapsed.
After financing for the aircraft had to be renegotiated when Russia
succeeded the Soviet Union in December, the first of them arrived in Moscow
in July.
As for infrastructure, here too progress is being made in small steps. A
joint venture with Accor has completed a Novotel at Sheremetievo airport,
and the Irish who run duty-free shops at the airport have been training
Russian staff in the art of selling duty-free goods in the air.
Brand new airlines, such as ASDA, a project involving a group of Aeroflot
pilots, are still scarce on the ground, however. Mr Yuri Mansurov, the
chairman of ASDA, says the aim is to begin flights to the US next spring,
with the novel idea of flying via the North Pole to cut down on flying time.
He does not elaborate on how the project will be financed, except to say
that plans to acquire Boeing-747s and 767s are being 'resolved'.
With an eye on the future, British Airways is trying to put together a
Dollars 900m package to set up a joint airline called Air Russia with the
subdivision of Aeroflot which is based at the domestic terminal of
Domodedovo.
The other subdivision of Aeroflot which used to handle all international
flights, based at Sheremetievo, is talking to Lufthansa, with which it
already has a joint venture to modernise the airport, about possibly
reviving an airline set up by Russia and Germany in the 1920s.
Just as securing finance is the key question for airline projects, so it is
an ever bigger headache for the Soviet Union's aviation industry. Although
the West's aircraft makers are pushed to almost giving away aircraft so they
can find buyers, Russia is hoping to capitalise on its relatively low costs
to team up with western capital and know-how to manufacture aircraft which
can compete in both quality and price on world markets.
So far, the industry, starved of investment from its owner, the state, is
finding it difficult to even meet internal demand. Aircraft long-promised to
Aeroflot, such as the long distance Ilyushin-96, have not materialised on
any significant scale. Aeroflot has taken delivery of just one Il-96 so far.
And even those state enterprises which have succeeded in finding foreign
investors, such as Aviastar, the manufacturer of the Antonov-124 transport
machine which wants to switch to mass-production of the TU-204 passenger
aircraft, is being hurt by the general crisis afflicting Russian industry.
As the government cuts back orders and subsidies in an attempt to restore
the country to some financial health, inflation and a physical shortage of
banknotes to pay workers are hitting Aviastar like everybody else.
Earlier this year, Aviastar set up a pioneering joint stock company with
Robert Fleming, the investment management company taking a 50 per cent
stake, to manufacture an upgraded version of the TU-204 for sale on foreign
markets or for domestic buyers with hard currency. Plans are still on track
to show a prototype fitted with Rolls-Royce engines at this year's
Farnborough airshow. The price tag is to established somewhere beneath the
cost of a Boeing-757 even though it is not yet clear just how far below that
is going to be.
Mr Dick Ciochetti, Rolls Royce's representative in Moscow, says that foreign
companies wishing to do business in the former Soviet Union are finding the
main problem is that nobody has any money to buy anything. 'Not only do they
have no currency, they have no roubles now either,' he said.
It is on a wing and a prayer that Russia is continuing its turbulent journey
to a market economy.

FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (23): A case of too many companies -
Italians prepare for a shift from military to civilian work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN aerospace industry will be dominated by two issues in the coming
months: the changing nature of defence needs in Europe, and the
reorganisation of domestic defence production.
The former has been highlighted by the plight of the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) project, in which Italy has a 21 per cent stake.
Not only are jobs at risk in any cut to the project, but there is also a
risk of companies ceasing to be involved in state of the art technology -
principally Alenia, the aerospace subsidiary of Finmeccanica, the state
industrial/financial holding. Irrespective of developments over the EFA, the
aerospace industry is set for a much needed process of rationalisation as
international competition increases and the emphasis shifts from military to
civilian aircraft.
At present, 60 per cent of the industry's annual L7,800bn (Pounds 3.6bn)
turnover is military; while 35 per cent of the total is accounted for by
export orders. Declining order books have forced employment down - the
workforce fell by nearly 5,000 to 47,000 last year and is set to contract
further. A financial squeeze has held investment back to 1990 levels at
L1,300bn, 62 per cent of which goes to research and development.
The industry is also too fragmented, with the private sector dominated by
Fiat and the public sector split essentially between the companies belonging
to Finmeccanica, in turn part of IRI, the state holding, and those under the
wing of Efim, the state industrial holding.
Change is inevitable, at least in the public sector whose current structure
has no logic. Furthermore, the new Amato government this month turned IRI
into a joint stock company, with a view to privatising part of its holdings.
At the same time, the debt-burdened loss-making Efim is set to be wound up,
its activities hived off. In the case of aerospace, this would proably go to
Finmeccanica.
The first step in this direction was taken in March, when Finmeccanica and
Efim agreed to pool their resources in defence avionics and aircraft
protection systems. They also agreed to work on a plan of joint industrial
development through Efim's stake (via Agusta) in the jet trainer
manufacturer, Sai Marchetti, and through Finmeccanica's minority holding in
Macchi, which also specialises in jet trainers.
However, these moves have yet to be implemented; and they ignored the
financial plight of Efim's main aerospace activity, helicopter manufacture,
concentrated in Agusta, which now has to be faced. Agusta produces the A109,
which won 5 per cent of the international military and 7 per cent of the
civil market for light helicopters in the period 1985-90. It is also a
partner with Westland of the UK in the EH 101 anti-submarine and transport
helicopter.
But the company is weighed down by over L2,000bn of debt, lost L178bn last
year and carries a high inventory. It suffers from high production costs and
too many production centres( 11 dotted round Italy). Plans are in hand for a
20 per cent cut in the 8,150 workforce, but new capital is urgently needed
and it also has to find a long-term overseas partner.
As far as the EFA is concerned, Fiat is involved in developing the engine,
but its diversified activities make it less vulnerable than Alenia which has
the bulk of the 14,000 jobs at risk in the venture. Whatever happens, Alenia
is likely to focus more on the civil side of its business, in particular
commuter aircraft. The EC Commission recently ruled against its bid, with
French partners Aerospatiale, for de Havilland of Canada, because it would
have given their ATR consortium a dominant position in the European 45-66
seater commuter market.
Nevertheless, Alenia has sought to expand its international links, which
could now see it joining the new European regional aircraft partnership
being set up by Deutsche Aerospace with Fokker of the Netherlands. But its
bread-and-butter remains sub-contracting work with Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas, and latterly with Airbus - a consortium that Alenia would like to
participate in directly.

FT  02 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities wilt under further pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRADING session that threatened to record one of the lowest daily
turnovers of the year so far on the London Stock Exchange was rescued by a
chunky programme trade in mid-afternoon.
However, even some big trades triggered by the programme failed to prevent
the equity market from slipping back below the Footsie 2,300 level. Fund
managers remained preoccupied with trends in international currencies, which
prompted worries about the possibility of a rise in UK interest rates and
also the Maastricht referendum in France, scheduled for September 20, which
is seen as threatening the fabric of the ERM.
And sentiment in a market desperately searching for any sort of good news
was given another dent by more bad news from a building sector expected to
produce some dire results in the next few weeks.
The return to work after the bank holiday extended weekend saw the market
open marginally firmer, helped by a weekend press indicating that the
immediate pressure for a rise in UK rates had largely passed. However, a
build-up of selling in the Footsie future and signs of more pressure on the
dollar led to a slide in the cash market. The FT-SE Index saw a small
opening rise turned into a loss of some seven points by mid-morning.
With sterling said to have been caught in the crossfire between the dollar
and the D-Mark, the equity market suffered a further setback after lunch
when hints of a trading programme were put forward as another reason behind
the selling in leading stocks.
Conclusive evidence of programme trade activity came as a series of large
deals flashed across the market's Seaq trading screens. One of the UK's big
integrated securities houses was reported to have carried out the programme,
said to have been weighted to the sell side.
The FT-SE 100 Index reached the day's lowest level, a fall of 16.1 at
2,296.5, as the large trades were in the process of being unwound by
marketmakers, but thereafter showed signs of stabilising to close 14.2 down
at 2,298.4.
Turnover, in spite of being boosted by the programme trade, could only reach
312.9m shares. Customer business in the equity market has reached Pounds 1bn
on only one occasion during the past two weeks.
Analysts and traders expect the market to trade in a narrow range ahead of
the French referendum and pointed out that under French law no new opinion
polls are allowed. But one senior trader said that as soon as the Maastricht
referendum is over, fund managers will have to come to terms with an even
bigger affair in the form of the US Presidential election in November.
The electricity distribution stocks ('recs') were aggressively sold ahead of
the cessation of trading in the Electricity Package tomorrow; dealers are
reluctant to take on stock in the more illiquid 'recs' as institutions
unbundle their remaining Package stocks.
The housebuilding sector provided the market's three weakest performers
yesterday in percentage terms after Persimmon, the highly rated construction
group, announced disappointing figures.

ACTIVITY IN the derivatives markets was said by dealers to have been the
quietest for many months, with many trading houses running on half their
normal staffing levels after the long August bank holiday weekend, writes
Steve Thompson.
The Footsie future opened at 2,311 but saw no business at that level and
soon moved up to touch 2,316 before sliding back to the day's low point of
2,293 just after lunch. It rallied to end the session at 2,303. Turnover in
the future was a miserable 5,429 lots.
In the traded options market, total volume reached 15,060 contracts. The
FT-SE 100 option attracted 6,424 deals, with one leading agency broker said
to have sold 500 September 2,300 puts. One of the independent traders
crossed 1,750 June 2,500 calls.
James Capel was said to have carried out two exceptionally large trades in
British Aerospace options just before the close of trading, with the
majority of the business in the November 200 puts and 220 calls.
The final turnover in Aerospace options came to 2,465 contracts, making it
the most heavily traded stock option. GEC was featured by a seller of 900
November 240 contracts at 210p.

FT  02 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons up on drug stories

THE RUMOUR factory got to work on Fisons ahead of the pharmaceutical group's
interim results, scheduled for release next week. Old speculation that a bid
for the group was imminent resurfaced, as did the recurring story that
Fisons' Opticrom drug is to be reinstated in the US. The shares jumped 12 in
early trade and then drifted with the market to close a net 5 ahead at 173p.
Hoare Govett, which was recommending the shares last week, was blamed for
the rumours. However, Hoare's Mr James Culverwell was keen to disassociate
himself. 'I think there is no prospect of a bid in the near term,' said Mr
Culverwell.
He was also sceptical about the imminent return of Opticrom and argued that
the shares were merely recovering after being oversold. ICI, which was
pinpointed as the potential bidder for Fisons, dipped 2 to 1063p. Courtaulds
weak
Chemicals group Courtaulds fell sharply in early trading as an agency broker
lowered its forecasts for the company. The shares were down 20 at one stage
and closed 17 off at 412p.
James Capel cut its forecast for the year ending March 1993 by Pounds 15m to
Pounds 200m and for the following year by the same amount to Pounds 220m.
Capel analyst Mr David Ingles said the reduction reflected pressures in
various businesses throughout the world and the weakness of the Australian
and US dollar.
The new current year prediction compares with an existing range of between
Pounds 210m and Pounds 215m but it was felt that estimates are about to be
adjusted. Capel said the prospect of a general review had prompted it to
remain cautious on the stock in spite of believing that the shares are
almost at a support level.
Shares in leisure group Rank Organisation were friendless and retreated
sharply after securities house Kleinwort Benson weighed in with a profits
downgrading.
With an eye on last week's profits warnings and downgrades in the brewing
sector, Kleinwort reduced its current year estimate for Rank by Pounds 17m
to Pounds 228m, and the following year's by a more severe Pounds 34m to
Pounds 287m. The securities house cited concern about the company's level of
business at Butlin's holiday worlds, and at Rank's holiday centre operator
Haven and Warner, as well as in its casinos, discos and North American
leisure interests. Rank closed 14 weaker at 490p after thin trading for the
stock.
Automotive and aerospace group Lucas Industries came under further pressure
as worries over the dividend intensified, sending the shares tumbling to a 7
1/2 -year low. Sentiment was also depressed by news that members of the
company's staff pension fund are suing the fund's trustees over the transfer
of money to Lucas towards the end of last year.
The stock finished 5 down at 78p, its lowest level since January 1985, after
brisk turnover of 2.5m shares.
Mr John Goldschmidt at broker Charterhouse Tilney, however, remained
unconvinced about the likelihood of a dividend cut, and said the continued
decline of the share price made the company a bid target. He added: 'If the
Lucas share price stays at current levels over the next six months, a bid is
a racing certainty because there is value in the company.'
Unravelling of the Electricity Package ahead of its demise tomorrow put it,
and most of the related utilities, under pressure. The package fell Pounds
85 to Pounds 3155.
Builders were under continuing pressure following gloomy statistics last
week and worries about a possible rise in interest rates. George Wimpey, the
UK's second biggest housebuilder, dropped 12 to 85p on growing concern over
the safety of the dividend, and Barratt Developments slid 8 to 41p.
North of England housebuilder Persimmon plunged 25 to 148p as first-half
profits of Pounds 7.25m, at the bottom of the range of expectations,
prompted forecast cuts. BZW came down to Pounds 15m from Pounds 19m for the
current year, and by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 17.5m for 1993.
Electrical and engineering group GEC bucked the market trend and picked up 3
1/2 to 237p, with Hoare Govett reiterating its buy stance after press
reports that the group's defence division had won a Pounds 50m order for
in-flight entertainment. Hoare said GEC has set a target of half of its
defence sales coming from the civil market by the end of the century.
British Gas continued to slide after disappointing interims last week. SG
Warburg reiterated its sell recommendation and published a note confirming
its reduced profits forecast - down to Pounds 890m from Pounds 1.164bn and
around the bottom of the range. Gas finished 3 1/2 lower at 238p.
Pharmaceuticals were undermined by dollar weakness over the long weekend.
SmithKline Beecham, which announced job cuts and withdrawal from some areas
of long-term research, was down 11 at 443p, and Glaxo fell 16 to 706p.
Conglomerate Tomkins was reported to have been a weak market on vague talk
that the company may be looking to make an acquisition in the near future.
The shares closed at 205p after a two-for-one share split came into effect.
Business services group BET fell 10 to 104p, making it one of the day's
biggest falls in the FT-SE Index. Securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was
reported to have downgraded profit expectations.
Publisher Reed International held up well in spite of an announcement that
Moody's Investors Service said it might downgrade Reed subsidiary Reed
Publishing. The unit's senior unsecured debt is currently rated AA3 and
about Dollars 725m (Pounds 364.3m) of long-term debt is affected. One
analyst said the Moody's announcement was surprising because 'Reed's
interest cover is over six times, gearing is not particularly high and
margins are not under pressure'. Reed eased 2 to 468p.
Speculation that British Aerospace was about to clinch the long predicted
order for Tornado and Hawk aircraft from Saudi Arabia boosted the shares by
7 to 205p.
