FT  28 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally helps share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALMER session in the foreign exchange markets provided the opportunity
for a greatly welcomed technical rally in UK shares yesterday. Although
gains were trimmed at the close when sterling began to soften against the
D-Mark, the London market shared fully in the recovery in stock markets
across Europe.
Fund managers bought back a little of the stock sold on Tuesday and the
session was enlivened by some basket trading - selling of stock index
futures and purchasing of blue chip stocks - after traders sensed that a big
US investment bank was buying the Footsie future contract.
The day's gain of 26.6 left the FT-SE at 2,311.6, six points below the day's
best level. Earlier, the index bounced satisfactorily off 2,300.5, after a
firm opening, helped by an easier trend in London money rates, had brought
out a few profit-takers. The cautious revival of confidence was encouraged
by the jump of more than 1,000 points in the Nikkei Average and by a sounder
performance from Wall Street.
Traders were wary of placing too much significance on yesterday's rally.
Tonight sees the London stock market moving into the three-day summer bank
holiday weekend break, and dealers have been told to balance trading books
by midsession today. Bear positions were being trimmed yesterday afternoon
as securities houses bought shares to meet selling commitments.
The outlook remained very uncertain, especially on the currency front, where
equity strategists expect little permanent respite until the French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty is out of the way near the end of
September. There was little response to comments yesterday by the German
finance minister on the general need for lower interest rates 'in the medium
term'.
Unsettling factors on the domestic scene also restrained the investment
mood. Another dividend reduction, this time from Slough Estates in the
property sector, brought attention back to the dangers still lurking on the
corporate front.
Hopes for a consumer-led recovery in the British economy received a fresh
jolt from a bearish statement from Scot-tish &amp; Newcastle, which has trading
interests across the range of brewing and leisure activities.
The combination of modest bargain hunting by the institutions and basket
trading by market firms boosted the day's Seaq volume total to 474.1m
shares, against only 374.9m in the previous session. Retail, or customer,
business was worth just Pounds 628.2m on Wednesday, a continuation of the
effectively unprofitable trading levels which have bedevilled the London
market in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, however, when the Footsie fell by around 1.3 per cent, retail
business totalled Pounds 1.1bn as large investment funds trimmed portfolios
in the face of growing apprehension over the outlook for sterling and UK
base rates.
The fragility of the market's confidence yesterday was indicated by a move
to take profits in utility stocks, which had stood up well against the
general onslaught on equity prices because of their perceived defensive
qualities.

FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs erode early Dow
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
SHARPLY higher overseas equities and the improvement in the dollar provided
an early boost for US stock markets yesterday, but a series of late sell
programs brought share prices back in their tracks, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was only 7.83 up at 3,254.64,
well below the day's high of more than 3,270. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended a mere 0.03 firmer at 413.54, although the Nasdaq composite finished
4.47 ahead at 563.27. New York SE turnover totalled 178.6m shares.
Good rallies in foreign markets, especially in Tokyo, where the Nikkei
Average jumped 6.1 per cent, buoyed sentiment when trading in New York
opened. The performance of the dollar also provided support for stocks,
which have been troubled lately by the currency's decline and its effect on
bond prices.
The good news from overseas and the currency markets helped equity investors
shrug off some mixed economic reports.
Although the latest weekly jobless claims fell sharply, the figures were
distorted by one-off factors. The news that gross domestic product rose by
1.4 per cent in the second quarter, as had been originally estimated, had no
effect on stocks, although a downward revision in the quarterly sales
component was slightly worrying.
HJ Heinz firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 in active trading after the
food group announced a joint venture with Hillsdown Holdings, of the UK, to
buy a Hungarian state-owned canning company.
GTE declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 after broking house Smith Barney
cut its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold', saying that the share
price had come close to reaching the analyst's target of Dollars 40.
News of a strike at one of General Motors' plants in Ohio - which will force
the company to cancel production early next week at its Saturn factory -
failed to upset the stock, but it suffered from program selling and ended
Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 33 3/4 . The other two big motor stocks were
also initially firmer but ran into late selling. Ford ended Dollars  1/8 off
at Dollars 40 3/8 and Chrysler unchanged at Dollars 19 1/2 .
Du Pont lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 49 5/8 after broking house PaineWebber
reduced its 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the company because of an
expected fall in carpet fibre sales and a tightening in refining margins at
its Conoco oil subsidiary, which accounts for 20 per cent of Du Pont's
operating profits.
Canada
TORONTO followed Wall Street to close just mildly firmer after retreating
from early gains. The TSE 300 index was finally 9.6 up at 3,392.6 and rises
led falls by 285 to 207 after volume of 22.9m shares.
Deprenyl ended CDollars  1/2 lower at CDollars 7 1/2 . Unfavourable press
coverage over the last few days has hammered the stock. The firm issued a
statement reassuring investors of the strength of the company. Air Canada,
steady at CDollars 4.30, submitted a bid to invest CDollars 400m in
Continental Airlines.

FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: De Beers reflects Johannesburg's woes -
The fall in its share price has dragged the whole market lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a long period of gravity-defying upward movement, the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange (JSE) has, over the past two months, finally experienced the
correction analysts have been predicting for more than a year.
A combination of political gloom and economic stagnation has seen the
overall index fall by 17 per cent from its 1992 peak of 3,749 set in June to
close yesterday at 3,126. The industrial index has retreated 14 per cent
from a high of 4,694, also reached in June, to stand yesterday at 4,058.
The JSE rose by nearly 40 per cent in 1991, fuelled by optimism about a
political settlement, and the familiar hothouse effect of large
institutional cash-flows, trapped by exchange control, chasing a limited
number of quality stocks. Optimists believed that the improved political
outlook justified the upward rerating, especially of industrial shares.
The consensus, however, was that the JSE was waiting for an excuse for a
downward correction. Mr Anthony Gibson, portfolio manager at investment
house Syfrets, notes that on the five occasions in the past 30 years when
the price/earnings ratio of the JSE has reached 12.5 (it is now 12) the
rating has unwound within 12 months, either through stronger earnings growth
or lower share prices.
The past few months have given no reason for confidence on the former, but
ample on the latter. Political gloom was undoubtedly the catalyst, with the
collapse in May of constitutional talks, the Boipatong massacre in mid-June,
and the subsequent mass action campaign organised by the African National
Congress, driving the country into its worst political crisis since the
release of ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela in February 1990. Belief that the
country was moving towards a speedy negotiated settlement was replaced by
the realisation of a difficult and potentially protracted transition.
Economic news was also depressing. By June, economists had realised that far
from the recession bottoming out, it had been aggravated by the worst
drought this century, putting the country on course for its third
consecutive year of negative growth.
Recent corporate news has only served to confirm what the economists had
been forecasting.
In a category of its own, in terms of impact, was the announcement earlier
this month by De Beers, which controls the world diamond market, that a
'substantial reduction' in the final dividend was likely owing to a sudden
deterioration in the market outlook.
The unexpected news had a devastating effect on the price of the dominant
share on the JSE - it accounts for approximately 10 per cent of all trade
and has a similar weighting in the overall index. From R73 per share on the
day the results were released - and having stood at R94 as recently as May
14 - the price for De Beers has plunged 24 per cent to close at R55.50
yesterday, dragging the overall index down by 7 per cent over the same
period.
Although the market was on the way down, the De Beers announcement
undoubtedly crystallised perceptions, emphasising that the world economy was
weaker than many realised.
De Beers itself may not yet have bottomed out: citing the prospect of a
large dividend cut and weak earnings, analysts believe the share price is
likely to hit R45 before it reaches R60 again.
Although there is agreement that the JSE is by now discounting most of the
bad economic and political news, analysts agree that it is more likely to go
down than up. In particular, it remains vulnerable to weaker world markets,
especially the Dow Jones Industrial indicator for Wall Street, which the the
JSE tracks closely.
Investors should probably be happy if the market finishes the year at
current levels, though present indicators suggest they may not be so
fortunate.
With growth in company earnings now being put out to the second half of next
year, an upturn for the JSE is probably unlikely before the first quarter of
1993.

FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firmer dollar helps bourses to
rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRMER dollar lifted most bourses yesterday but dealers cautioned that the
rise was mostly technical, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's biggest one day rise for over a year was mainly driven by a
rally in futures and short-covering as another batch of good corporate
results prompted fund managers to return to the equity market.
The DAX index gained 40.14 to 1,513.42 after the FAZ index had seen a rise
of 13.88 to 596.22 at midsession. Turnover rose to DM5.7bn from DM5.1bn.
Strong interim results from Daimler and Volkswagen set the mood for the day
with the former advancing DM20 or 3.4 per cent to DM610.80 and the latter
DM10.50 to DM324.50. The Daimler figures were particularly encouraging and
above most analysts expectations.
BASF was the last of the major chemical groups to report its half-year
figures this week and came in at the lower end of expectations. While its
shares gained DM4.30 to DM211.40, in line with the market, most analysts
recommended a switch out of the stock into either Bayer, up DM7.30 to
DM264.80 or Hoechst, DM9.90 firmer at DM237.90.
Retailer Kaufhof, which reported a 13 per cent increase in first half sales,
advanced DM20 to DM436.50.
PARIS rose 1.2 per cent on arbitrage-related buying but turnover was thin at
FFr1.52bn. The CAC-40 index closed 19.76 higher at 1,687.56.
Elf was one of the day's more prominent gainers, adding FFr8.50 to FFr315.80
as several brokers issued buy notes following its better-than-expected
interim results.
Eurotunnel, up FFr1.45 to FFr36.05, was also in demand on hopes that the
company was close to an agreement with TML.
Paribas fell FFr6 to FFr284 on rumours that it was going to bid for the
building group Fougerolle and its unit SAE. Trading in the latter two stocks
had been suspended earlier in the day. After the close, Fougerolle said it
was offering one of its own shares for one SAE share to buy out the
remainder of SAE.
MILAN finished above the day's low as late buying lifted prices towards the
close. But dealers said the market remained vulnerable and trading was thin.
The Comit index fell 0.81 to 393.29, a new low for the year, in turnover
estimated at L50bn after Wednesday's L53.6bn.
Fiat closed at L4,028, down L12, but than recovered to L4,070 after hours.
Pirelli continued to firm, as the stock rose L22 or 1.9 per cent to L1,207.
OSLO soared 9.4 per cent for its biggest one day rise since 1987. The
all-share index rallied 28.67 to 335.44 in turnover of NKr348m. Among active
issues, Norsk Hydro gained NKr14.50 to NKr139 while Kvaerner free shares
gained NKr12 to NKr141 and Hafslund free shares rose NKr15.50 to NKr156.
ZURICH enjoyed a positive day helped by rises in chemical stocks and demand
for BBC Asea Brown Boveri. The SMI index 35.6 or 2 per cent to 1,740.6.
BBC Brown Boveri bearers advanced SFr190 to SFr3,560 while its certificates
improved SFr42 to SFr707. Among chemicals Roche certificates added SFr50 to
SFr3,310.
AMSTERDAM advanced strongly with DAF putting in one of the best performances
of the day. The CBS Tendency Index closed 2 higher at 110.1. The truck group
saw its shares leap Fl 2.30 or nearly 14 per cent to Fl 18.80 after
reporting strong first half figures and announcing that it was in talks with
an unnamed group over forming a strategic alliance.
BRUSSELS was less impressive than neighbouring markets as the Bel-20 index
put on 2.97 to 1,059.04. Petrofina went against the trend, down BFr190 or
2.1 per cent at BFr8,760 but off an intraday low of BFr8,560. It shares have
been losing ground after the group announced a 55 per cent drop in first
half earnings earlier this month.
Banks were generally firmer with BBL advancing BFr105 to BFr3,155 while
Tractebel climbed BFr150 to BFr7,340.
STOCKHOLM recouped a further 4.7 per cent on the back of declining domestic
interest rates and positive impulses from abroad. The Affarsvarlden General
index rose 35.6 to 786.9 in heavy turnover of SKr815m.
Astra gained further after its pleasing interims, with the A share adding
SKr26 to SKr538 and the B share adding SKr26 to SKr523.
COPENHAGEN closed higher in active trading, but East Asiatic Company (EAC)
posted a substantial decline after reporting a six-month loss. The KFX
top-20 index closed 1.89 higher at 77.66 but EAC fell DKr12 to DKr77.
HELSINKI heard that the government proposed lifting foreign ownership
restrictions on shares from January. The HEX index rose 1.5 per cent to
567.7. MADRID's general index gained 1.7 to 205.46 in turnover of Pta4.7bn.

FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo surges 6 per cent
to settle above 17,500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE buying ahead of the government's announcement of economic support
measures sharply boosted share prices, and the Nikkei average surged 6.1 per
cent to close above 17,000 for the first time since July 15, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 1,103.35 to 17,555.00, after opening at the
day's low of 16,617.32 and setting a high for the session of 17,596.45 in
the afternoon.
Volume jumped to 620m shares from 327m on active buying by dealers and
investment trusts. Individuals were seen placing small-lot orders, along
with foreigners. Rises overwhelmed declines by 1,028 to 41, with 47 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks forged ahead 63.07 to
1,340.45, although in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.11 firmer
at 1,098.35.
Investors were encouraged by reports that up to Y1,000bn of public funds
would be invested in the stock market as part of the government's support
package. Traders said hopes of an easing in monetary policy by the Bank of
Japan were also being discounted into share prices.
Some investors are worried about the effects of a political scandal,
involving one of the country's most powerful pol-iticians. After the market
closed, Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party,
resigned after admitting that he had received political funds from Sagawa
Kyubin, a parcel delivery company.
Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, said: 'The
market could fall some 500 to 700 points, but investors who have not been
able to buy will be ready to jump in.'
Stocks gained across the board. Activity was led by Ricoh, the office
equipment maker, which advanced Y92 to Y682. Activity was prompted by
reports that the company would post a double-digit rise in pre-tax profits
for this fiscal year in spite of its previous forecast of a decline.
Other heavily traded stocks included speculative, Aids-related issues. Green
Cross rose Y50 to Y1,390 and Ube Industries, a chemical maker, put on Y63 to
Y443.
High-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting. Fujitsu gained Y40 to
Y610 and Sony Y280 to Y4,290.
In Osaka, the OSE average leapt 1,045.39 to 19,145.34 in volume of 30.5m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, added Y700 at Y11,200.
Roundup
TOKYO'S rise failed to prompt similar action in the Pacific Basin.
HONG KONG ended weaker in dull trading after an early rally expired and
jittery local investors rushed to take profits. The Hang Seng index finished
18.09 down at 5,460.72, after reaching 5,566.81. Turnover contracted to
HKDollars 2.40bn from HKDollars 3.03bn.
SINGAPORE was lower in light trading, with SIA Foreign and NatSteel
particularly weak. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 9.69 to 1,360.84
in volume of 47.54m shares.
NatSteel, which announced poor interim results, fell 23 cents to SDollars
2.71 and led the actives on a volume of 9.34m shares, more than a quarter of
total turnover. SIA Foreign dropped 50 cents to SDollars 15.40 on
profit-taking.
SEOUL closed higher for the fifth consecutive session, although late
profit-taking pared gains. The composite index added 6.74 at 520.61.
TAIWAN opened higher on bargain hunting in the construction sector, but
closed well off the day's best on profit-taking. The weighted index was
finally 7.94 up at 3,800.97. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 19.38bn.
MANILA fell on fears that the weaker dollar will affect the profits of
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which relies heavily on foreign exchange
earnings. The composite index lost 28.18 to 1,426.31 in combined volume of
370m pesos.
AUSTRALIA continued to advance but some analysts warned that it was too
early to speak of a recovery. The All Ordinaries index put on 8.8 to 1,543.3
in turnover of ADollars 196.3m.
News Corp receded 50 cents to ADollars 22.86 as investors took profits
following Wednesday's encouraging results. TNT firmed 3 cents to ADollars
1.42 after News Corp said it may sell its 50 per cent stake.
NEW ZEALAND was boosted by overseas markets and the NZSE-40 index rose 18.82
to 1,478.34 in turnover of NZDollars 20m.
BANGKOK eased after the authorities announced that from today brokers will
be barred from trading in 'designated securities'. The SET index dipped 3.81
to 749.04 in low turnover of Bt4.27bn.
KUALA LUMPUR gained ground on bargain hunting. The composite index improved
8.05, or 1.4 per cent, to 567.56.

decline into red

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST ASIATIC Company (EAC), the Danish shipping, graphics and consumer
products group, reported a first-half 1992 net loss of DKr181m (Dollars 32m)
and forecast a full-year net loss of DKr275m. EAC's net first-half profit
for 1991 was DKr82m, with net profit for the full year at DKr245m.
The company announced a management reshuffle and a major DKr150m
restructuring programme to help it to cope with the difficult trading
conditions.
Mr Henning Sparsoe, EAC's chairman and chief executive, will hold the post
of chairman, with deputy managing director Carsten Dencker Nielsen becoming
chief executive.
EAC's restructuring programme includes cutting 153 staff at the group's
Copenhagen headquarters and decentralising the main consumer products,
graphics and transport divisions as well as ending the energy and property
division and reorganising the trading division into two new wholly owned
units, EAC Timber and EAC Wool.
Hafnia, the Danish insurer, which suspended payments last week, said it had
completed plans to reduce domestic staff by 21 per cent, Reuter reports from
Copenhagen.
The 527 job cuts, which will save DKr300m annually, have been planned since
last June.
The group's bank and insurance units are operating as usual under a new
company, Hafnia Holding of 1992, to which assets of DKr5.9bn have been
transferred.
Debts of around DKr6bn, mainly due to massive losses in share portfolio
value, remain in the old holding company which suspended payments.

FT  28 AUG 92 / Armenia's troubled leader puts on a brave face:
Ter-Petrosian is beset by growing opposition, economic crisis and an
undeclared war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST ONE day after repelling an opposition attempt to sack him last week,
Armenia's president, Mr Levon Ter-Petrosian, seemed unfazed by his growing
problems as he nonchalantly put another cigarette in his gold-tipped holder.
In an interview the 47-year-old former academic appeared unmoved by the
bitter undeclared war with neighbouring ex-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, an
economic blockade that has shut down half of the country's industry, and the
increasingly restive opposition.
'Of course I am being condemned and accused,' said Mr Ter-Petrosian,
speaking softly in Armenian, one of 13 languages in which he is conversant.
'But it would be interesting to hear what solutions they would suggest
instead.'
Things are bad in Armenia. Mr Ter-Petrosian claims his nation is not at war,
but merely provides humanitarian assistance to ethnic Armenians in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed enclave that lies entirely within Azerbaijan.
The reality is different. The land-locked nation of 3.3m people is committed
to securing a favourable outcome in the four-year-old war, which has killed
more than 2,000 people and crippled the economy. Many fear the latest
ceasefire may turn out to be another in a long line of failed efforts to
secure peace.
In the capital, Mr Ter-Petrosian admitted, a certain degree of corruption
and lawlessness prevails. In addition to bureaucrats demanding bribes,
merchants complain of organised criminal gangs demanding protection money.
One gang recently blew up a city centre cafe, whose owners wouldn't pay up.
'In a transition period there is a certain anarchy and uncontrollability,'
he said.
Azerbaijan, through which 80 per cent of Armenia's fuel and goods were
previously transported, has blockaded its neighbour because of the war. This
has sent Armenia's fuel prices up 70-fold since last January, according to
Mr Steve Tashjian, the energy minister. The instability in neighbouring
Georgia, Armenia's only other source of fuel, cut off supplies for the
entire month of June, Mr Tashjian said. Since then supplies have arrived at
only half the needed volume.
Last winter, Armenia's light industry - which makes up more than half its
economy - came to a standstill, and now is up to just 50 per cent of
previous production, Mr Tashjian said. The economy contracted by at least 12
per cent last year, according to an International Monetary Fund report. The
figure excluded the worst months of last winter, January through March, when
there was no natural gas and virtually the entire nation stopped working.
Outside Yerevan, there is almost no electricity, and power is available in
the capital itself for only 12 hours a day. Worried Armenians have been
chopping down trees from their sparse forests, and in the capital stacks of
firewood can be seen on flat balconies.
Mr Tashjian, an American on leave from the US electricity supply company
Southern California Edison, said that if natural gas supplies continue from
Georgia, Armenian industry will be able to operate at current levels for 60
days of the winter.
If Armenia wants to get its economy going Mr Tashjian said, it must
eventually restart its two nuclear units at Medzamor, 30 km south-west of
Yerevan. The units generate 830 mw of power annually, or one-fourth of the
nation's needs, before they were shut down following Armenia's devastating
1988 earthquake. The public continues to strongly oppose their reactivation.
Mr Tashjian said it would cost Dollars 200m and take two years to get just
one of the units going again. 'We either must reactivate the plant or find a
substitute,' he said.
The war was the primary complaint voiced by opponents who held three days of
protests in Yerevan against Mr Ter-Petrosian last week. A day later he
survived a no-confidence move by insisting that, should a public referendum
support his leadership, the opposition-majority parliament would be
dissolved. The taunt caused his critics to back down.
Mr Ter-Petrosian is trying to give the appearance of marching gamely ahead.
He doesn't mind too much having traded his former career at Yerevan
University for his current job. 'I will only have regrets if I am convinced
that my current drive is a failure.' Mr Ter-Petrosian made it clear that, in
his opinion, no-one can yet claim justifiably that it is.

FT  28 AUG 92 / Armenia and Azerbaijan agree to ceasefire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARMENIA and Azerbaijan yesterday agreed to a ceasefire from September 1 in
the latest attempt to end four years of fighting in the Caucasus, Reuter
reports from Moscow, quoting Russian news agencies. Itar-Tass and Nega
reported that the two former Soviet republics had reached agreement in talks
in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan.
According to Nega, the two warring sides signed a document stating their
readiness to halt military operations from next Tuesday. The timing had been
agreed between the Armenian and Azeri leaders and Kazakhstan's President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, who had invited them to negotiate in Alma-Ata after
earlier peace initiatives collapsed.
Tass said the foreign ministers of Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan
had agreed that further conflict was pointless and would only lead to
'irreparable losses' on both sides. A three-sided working group with Kazakh
experts would be set up to work out ways to implement and monitor the
ceasefire. More than 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting
between the Caucasian neighbours - the deadliest conflict of the post-Soviet
era.
The unexpected accord, a diplomatic victory for Mr Nazarbayev, coincided
with reports of fresh fighting in the region. Tass said six people had been
killed and 20 wounded when an Azeri aircraft dropped anti-personnel and
cluster bombs on Stepanakert, capital of the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh. Scores of people have been killed in Azeri air raids in
the past week. The Armenians say the aircraft are former Soviet planes which
Moscow recently handed to Azerbaijan.
It was unclear how the two sides planned to make the ceasefire stick, given
the breakdown of numerous earlier truces, including several mediated by
Russia and Iran.

FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN the futures market was again dominated by worries over sterling
and the possibility of an increase in UK interest rates, writes Christopher
Price.
The September FT-SE 100 contract opened steadier at 2,293 as dealers and
investors reflected on the chancellors' early morning speech. A small
squeeze sent the contract forward and it reached a high for the day of 2,305
by 9am. It continued to hold up as sterling steadied, but a story that one
German city had reported a rise in its monthly inflation sent September
retreating to 2,280 by midday.
Pressure on sterling, weak gilts and renewed gloom over the UK economy
combined to weaken September throughout the afternoon session, the contract
crumbling to 2,275, its low of the day, by 3pm. However, a firmer Wall
Street helped inspire a rally towards the end. September finished at 2,292,
up 7 from the previous close and around a four-point premium to its fair
value of 5.5. Volume came to 11,580 contracts.
There was again hefty trading in the options market, with the FT-SE 100
option having 10,146 lots dealt out of a total of 34,378. Asda was the
busiest stock option on 7,506 contracts transacted.

FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices steady in nervous trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONGLY worded comm-ittal to the pound's place in the European Monetary
System from the UK chancellor of the exchequer, followed by heavy support
for sterling from the Bank of England, checked the slide in UK equity
markets yesterday but did little to restore confidence in the near-term
outlook. Market strategists were not convinced that the UK government will
succeed in riding out the crisis in sterling without raising domestic
interest rates.
The FT-SE Index closed four points up at 2,285, unable to recapture the
early gain of 11.8 which had greeted the Bank's foreign exchange support
operations. Equities turned down smartly at mid-morning after a member of
the Bundesbank policy council rejected hints of an ERM realignment and
appeared to put the pound in the spotlight again. A further blow came later
when the latest Maastricht opinion poll in France indicated a 52 per cent
'no' vote.
The stock market was much quieter yesterday following the blood-letting of
the previous session. Seaq volume dropped back again to a total of 374.8m
shares, compared with 537.7m the previous day. The value of retail, or
customer, business on Tuesday jumped to Pounds 1.1bn, confirming that the
institutions had been active sellers of stock in the big blue chip issues.
Some traders claimed to indentify a more positive mood in the market towards
the close yesterday and hoped that the Bank's massive support for the pound
might be the first step in a concerted plan to avoid any increase in UK base
rates.
However, most strategists felt that the chancellor's announcement had been
'very badly handled' and that the London financial markets are in for a
'very uncertain period'.
Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said a rise of  3/4 percentage point in
UK base rates is already priced into London money rates, and that if the
authorities are forced to lift base rates, then a full percentage point
increase might not now be enough to restore stability to the currency.
Share prices made an uncertain pattern. There were strong recoveries in some
 - but not all  - of the retail and consumer stocks, which have been
particularly threatened by interest rate worries. Dollar stocks also turned
in a better performance.
Dealers warned, however, that equities were fuelled yesterday by the
tightness of marketmakers' positions after two sessions of heavily falling
share prices. A few buyers, usually from rival marketmakers, was enough to
send prices ahead. Whether yesterday's recovery will stand up to any
attempted renewal of the sales pressure seen on Tuesday must remain open to
question. At best, the stock market's condition remained fragile.
Securities analysts at the London-based securities firms were beginning to
reconsider year-end forecasts for the Footsie in the light of the gloomier
investment picture which has emerged this week. Increases in base rates
would inevitably undermine corporate recovery prospects and cast fresh
clouds over the outlook for company profits and dividend payments.

FT  27 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Zofran hint for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCLOSURE that US officials are to discuss improved prospects for Glaxo's
Zofran drug filtered through too late to have much effect on the shares in
London yesterday. Nevertheless, the stock closed firmer, with US house
Wertheim Schroder preparing an enthusiastic internal note.
Mr Jonathan Gelles, Wertheim's pharmaceuticals specialist, will point out
that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves drug use in
the US, will discuss increased use of Zofran, Glaxo's anti-emetic drug.
The FDA confirmed that its advisory committee will meet next Thursday to
discuss the use of the drug for post-operative nausea and vomiting. Mr
Gelles said Zofran was expected to generate around Pounds 260m (Dollars
517.4m) this year and approval for extended US use could add a further
Pounds 100m. Glaxo ended 2 firmer at 691p.
WH Smith pleases
Solid final results from WH Smith sent the shares forward 15 to 376p. A
lower tax charge was the only real surprise, as news that the core retail
businesses were holding up well and the DIY division was continuing to
struggle were as expected.
Ms Kimlan Cook at County NatWest commented: 'The chunky dividend and modest
premium to the market mean the shares represent good value in the short
term. But we remain neutral past then, mainly because of the uncertainties
posed by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries into newspaper
wholesaling and compact discs, and the concern over the net book agreement.'
Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort Benson was more positive, arguing that the
stock's defensive qualities and recovery potential represented good value at
both levels.
Wellcome hurt
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome fell ahead of publication of an article in a
highly regarded US trade publication. The New England Journal of Medicine,
out today, contains a 10-page article on the group's Aids drug, Retrovir.
The article describes a trial by an independent US group which concludes
that 'changing treatment from zidovudine (the generic name for Retrovir) to
500mg per day of didanosine (the generic name for the drug marketed by US
competitor Bristol Myers Squibb) appears to slow the progression of HIV
disease'.
Nevertheless, analysts said the trial results had already been aired at the
Amsterdam Aids conference last month and that Retrovir was likely to remain
the main anti-Aids drug. The stock declined 15 before ending 10 off at 782p.
Reuters firm
An improved recommendation for Reuters helped the news and financial
information service group to recover some recently lost ground. The shares
were among the best performers in the FT-SE 100 Index and gained 13 to
1025p.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd put the company back on its buy list after having a
hold stance on the stock from March. Analyst Mr Paul Norris says the group's
electronic trading system, Dealing 2002, is showing a pick-up following a
slow start in June. He adds that Reuters will benefit from a 40 per cent
exposure to the D-Mark against only a 20 per cent exposure to the dollar.
Already weakened by worries about UK interest rates, the building sectors
came under even more pressure as County NatWest published a bearish research
note adopting a short-term sell stance on every contracting and building
materials stock covered by the firm. Official figures showing a 19 per cent
slump in construction orders in the June quarter added to the gloom.
Emphasising that its use of the term 'sell' meant that it viewed the
relevant share prices as likely to underperform the market by more than 10
per cent in the next three months, County's building team said it
anticipated that at least 18 of the 31 companies covered will cut dividends.
County said a rise in interest rates would 'push the housing market over the
brink and turn catastrophe into disaster'.
Redland, already depressed by a prediction from stockbroker Panmure Gordon
of a 20 per cent reduction in annual dividend, dropped 20 more to 354p.
Housebuilder Persimmon fell 8 to 181p.
Interim figures from Guardian Royal Exchange were well received by the
market and the shares ran up to 132p before slipping back to close
fractionally ahead at 127p.
Renewed institutional support and suggestions that sentiment towards
composite insurers may be changing lifted Sun Alliance 1 1/2 to 219p.
Sedgwick put on 7 to 108p and Willis Corroon 2 to 146p on hopes that US
rates may rise sharply following Hurricane Andrew.
Oil shares mostly continued to hold up well, although Lasmo attracted
selling pressure and finished 5 cheaper at 129p on keen turnover of 3.2m
shares. Specialists said there were no new stories behind the latest fall
and that a technical bounce was now due.
BP drew strength from news that US investors have increased their holdings
of the stock by some 100m shares to 14.2 per cent since the halving of the
dividend on August 6. County NatWest said US investors had carried on buying
BP because the shares look cheap on a valuation basis compared to US stocks.
Good two-way business in Ladbroke was attributed to the group's results due
next week where the dividend is considered safe. The shares closed 3 off at
130p in turnover of 8.4m.
Bullish noises from Marks and Spencer were said to have helped the shares,
which climbed 6 to 287p. The company is said to have been indicating to
analysts that interim profits are likely to be better than expected.
Tightly traded publisher News International jumped 23 to 448p as the group
announced a full-year profit of Pounds 48.1m, against a loss last year of
Pounds 335.8m.
British Steel was heavily traded again as a block of 8.1m shares dealt at
43p boosted turnover to 17m. The block was the second half of a tax-related
'bed-and-breakfast' deal. Steel eased  1/2 to 48 1/2 p.

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow improves in wake of a
steadier dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER A hesitant start, US stock markets showed some improvement yesterday
in the wake of higher bond prices and a stable, although still vulnerable,
dollar, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 14.59 up at 3,246.81, slightly below
the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.90 ahead at 413.51. The
American SE composite edged up 0.13 to 379.65, while the best performance
came from the Nasdaq composite, which gained 4.58 at 558.80. New York SE
turnover amounted to 172m shares, while rises outpaced declines by 997 to
716.
A slight firming in the dollar as overseas investors took profits in the
D-Mark provided the foundation for a positive day of equity trading.
Investors concentrated their attention on the currency market positives, and
the day's only major economic news, an unexpected 3.4 per cent decline in
July durable goods orders, was mostly ignored.
Although the durable goods orders are notoriously unreliable, and the bulk
of last month's decline was due to a big fall in transportation orders, the
overall picture of manufacturing industry's past and future orders book was
one of continued weakness.
Motor manufacturers were mostly firmer in active trading, boosted by Ford's
strong mid-August car sales figures. Ford rose a further Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 40 1/2 , while General Motors put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 34 1/8
in turnover of 2.4m shares. Chrysler held at Dollars 19 1/2 .
PPG Industries eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 after an order imbalance
had delayed trading. The company said there was no reason for the decline,
arguing that investors may have misinterpreted some recent remarks by the
company's chief executive on the outlook for earnings. PPG also said its
chemical plant at Lake Charles in Louisiana had not been damaged by
Hurricane Andrew.
As the hurricane's force dissipated after reaching the Gulf coast, insurance
stocks were in mixed form, with Cigna rising Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 1/8
, Aetna firming Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 39 1/8 , Travelers steady at Dollars
20 3/4 and Geico Dollars 1 1/4 off at Dollars 56.
Abbott Laboratories climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 31 1/4 . Broking house Dean
Witter Reynolds added the stock to its recommended list after its health
care analyst upgraded his rating on Abbott to 'buy' from 'neutral'.
On the American Stock Exchange, New York Times softened Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 26 7/8 after Salomon Brothers, the broking house, raised its 1992
and 1993 earnings estimates for the newspaper group but kept its rating on
the stock unchanged at 'hold'.
Canada
TORONTO finished slightly firmer following light trading. The TSE 300 index
was up 7.2 at 3,383.0 and rising issues led declines by 274 to 234. Volume
came to 20.4m shares.
Bank, pipeline and utility shares, which many investors buy for their stable
yields, dominated the most active list. Nova Scotia Power, CDollars 10 7/8 ,
Toronto Dominion Bank, CDollars 18 3/4 , and Bank of Nova Scotia, CDollars
23 3/4 , put on CDollars  1/8 apiece.
Varity gained CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 23 1/4 on posting a second-quarter
profit of 37 US cents a share, against a loss of 49 cents a year earlier.
Unicorp Energy, off 10 cents at CDollars 1.50, reported a slight decline in
six-month net.

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent stages a cautious
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL bourses staged a cautious recovery after its falls earlier in
the week, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose but sentiment remained nervous in spite of a batch of good
company results and analysts said it was too early to speak of a recovery.
'The market has recently seen a strong decline, an adjustment of price
levels and it looks oversold,' said one. 'But there isn't much buying
interest around and any technical rebound appears to be short-lived.'
Disappointing monthly inflation figures from Hesse were enough to upset the
market and restrained the rise in the DAX to 4.37 to 1,473.28. At midsession
the FAZ index was up 0.67 at 582.34, while turnover rose to DM5.1bn from
DM4.1bn.
MAN, the engineering and truck manufacturer, gained DM12.50 to DM279.50, but
off an intraday high of DM281, on a 3 per cent rise in net profit for fiscal
1992. Continental put on DM4 to DM228.50 after forecasting good full-year
earnings.
Hoechst surprised analysts with its results but its shares closed unchanged
at DM228. BASF, expected to report today, lost DM4.10 to DM207.10 while
Bayer gained DM1.80 to DM257.50. After the close Henkel, down DM1 at DM566,
reported a 2.9 per cent increase in its first-half profit.
Volkswagen, which also reports today, strengthened DM2.20 to DM314 on news
of a 10 per cent rise in sales.
PARIS brushed off a second poll giving a majority of 'No's' in the
Maastricht referendum and rebounded from the day's low on firmer bond
futures. The CAC-40 index ended 0.08 better at 1,667.80, off its worst level
of 1,648.32, in meagre turnover of FFr1.4bn.
A year-on-year drop of 22.7 per cent in housing starts in the three months
to end-July weighed on the construction sector. Lafarge fell FFr9.10 to
FFr272.50 while Saint-Gobain eased FFr6 to FFr502.
Talk of an ERM realignment, which would reduce the need for a further rise
in interest rates, pushed the banking sector higher. Societe Generale rose
FFr5.60 or 1.2 per cent to FFr469.50. Euro Disney rebounded from its recent
weakness, closing up FFr2.65 or 3.9 per cent at FFr70.60.
MILAN saw selling wipe out a slightly stronger start. Rumours concerning Mr
Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca, were blamed for the fall.
They were denied after the close. The Comit index fell 0.83 to 394.10 in
turnover estimated at more than Tuesday's L49.1bn.
Mediobanca fell L120 to L10,870 and then slipped to L10,550 after hours.
Fiat closed at L4,040, up L40, but then fell to L3,995 later.
Pirelli rose L16.50 to L1,184 on news that the British conglomerate BTR was
buying Pirelli's Brazilian rubber production business.
AMSTERDAM was lifted by some encouraging company results. The CBS Tendency
index closed up 1.2 at 108.1.
IHC Caland, the dredging group rose FL 3.20 to Fl 81 following a positive
analysts meeting on Tuesday. Wolters Kluwer improved Fl 2.40 to Fl 77 on
good half-year results, which also helped Elsevier rise 30 cents to Fl
104.30.
KNP's interim results seemed to impress, as its shares put on Fl 2.50 or 6.7
per cent to Fl 39.50.
ZURICH retreated in late trading with the SMI index down 4.7 at 1,705. BBC
Brown Boveri certificates went against the market, gaining SFr35 to SFr665
on a proposal to swap non-voting participation certificates for voting
bearer shares. The bearers closed unchanged at SFr3,370.
STOCKHOLM rebounded from its recent slump, gaining 2.6 per cent despite a 3
percentage point rise in the Riksbank's key lending rate. The Affarsvarlden
General Index rose 19 to 751.3 in heavy turnover of SKr711m, of which Astra
accounted for SKr270m.
Astra led the rally after its stronger-than-expected results for the half
year, released after the close on Tuesday. The A shares ended at SKr512, up
SKr15 and the B share rose SKr13 to SKr497.
OSLO jumped more than 2 per cent in spite of sharply higher interest rates,
partly on relief over a government decision to take over the running of the
insurer Uni Storebrand. The all-share index gained 6.73 to 306.77 in
turnover worth NKr224m.
HELSINKI's fall continued after the central bank raised its tender rate. The
HEX index slipping 20.4 or 3.5 per cent to 559.3 but turnover remained low
at FM15m. Nokia free shares fell FM3.5 to FM46.
COPENHAGEN stabilised after heavy losses this week, with the KFX index
closing 0.25 down at 75.77 in thin turnover of DKr112m. FLS Industries fell
DKr10 to DKr430 after announcing a fall in mid-year profit.
MADRID closed at another year's low, the general index off 1.90 at 203.76 in
turnover of some Pta6bn.

SHARE prices firmed as index-linked buying and bargain hunting absorbed
profit-taking and arbitrage-linked selling, and the Nikkei average ended a
volatile day with a moderate gain, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average put on 160.88 to 16,541.65. It reached the day's high
of 16,663.19 in the morning session before slipping into negative territory
several times in the afternoon, registering a low of 16,332.40.
Volume fell to 320m shares from 397m, due to a lack of dealer participation.
However, foreigners and individual investors were active buyers, while some
domestic institutions took profits on holdings recently bought at lower
levels.
Advances led declines by 507 to 474, with 143 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks was just 0.54 ahead on the day at
1,277.38, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 1.60 to 1,045.56.
Investors tried to adjust positions ahead of the government's announcement
of its economic support package tomorrow. 'Since there probably will not be
anything surprising in the package, institutions are trying to take profits
now,' said Mr Shin Tokoi at Kidder Peabody International.
Meanwhile, short-term traders focused on drug and Aids-related issues. Green
Cross, the most active issue of the day, rose Y60 to Y1,340, while Ishihara
Sangyo, an agro-chemical maker, advanced Y80 to Y438 on speculative buying.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y5,000 to Y610,000. On Tuesday Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, announced the postponement of the sale
of the additional tranche of shares for fiscal 1992 and 1993. Traders said
the news had already been discounted and attributed the decline to light
profit-taking after the stock's recent 35 per cent rebound.
Banks lost ground, with Sumitomo Bank retreating Y40 to Y1,700 on sell
orders by foreign institutions. Industrial Bank of Japan was down Y10 to
Y2,150.
High-technology blue chips declined on worries over profits, Hitachi
slipping Y11 to Y792 and Fujitsu Y13 to Y570. Matsushita Electric
Industrial, which reported a 62 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax
profits for the first quarter to June, shed Y30 to Y1,210. Victor Company of
Japan, its affiliate, weakened Y33 to Y718.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 56.43 at 18,099.95 in a volume of 14.2m
shares.
Roundup
THE region's markets were generally stronger, helped by some positive
company results.
HONG KONG was lifted by better than expected interim results from HSBC
Holdings. The Hang Seng index closed 187.32, or 3.5 per cent, up at 5,478.81
in turnover of HKDollars 3bn.
HSBC, which reported a 51 per cent jump in first-half profits, rose
HKDollars 3.75 to HKDollars 51.50. Cathay Pacific, with a 13 per cent
increase in half-year earnings, gained 40 cents to HKDollars 10.80.
SINGAPORE advanced on news that a one-for-one scrip issue by Singapore
Airlines had been approved in principle by the authorities. The Straits
Times Industrial index added 31.62, or 2.36 per cent, at 1,370.53 in
turnover of SDollars 167m (SDollars 86m on Tuesday). SIA foreign shares
climbed SDollars 1.20 to SDollars 15.90 in 86m volume.
SEOUL rose for the fourth consecutive session, the composite index ending
19.37 up at 513.87 in turnover of Won304bn.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower after thin trading. The weighted
index lost 23.35 to 3,793.03 in turnover of TDollars 18.7bn.
MANILA recovered from a four-day slide, led by Philippine National Bank
(PNB). The composite index improved 14.04 to 1,454.49 in combined turnover
of 235m pesos.
PNB rose 15.50 pesos to 277.50 pesos on news that there might be a reshuffle
of senior bank officials following the recent controversial appointment of
new board members.
AUSTRALIA recouped Tuesday's losses, the All Ordinaries index gaining 17.0
at 1534.4 in turnover of ADollars 255.5m.
News Corp put on ADollars 1.00 to ADollars 23.50. After the close it
reported a 65 per cent rise in net profits for the year to the end of June.
Banks improved, with Commonwealth ahead 18 cents at ADollars 6.87 and
National Australia up 11 cents at ADollars 7.33.
NEW ZEALAND was slightly firmer, the NZSE-40 index rising 1.89 to 1,459.52
in turnover of NZDollars 15.7m.
BANGKOK's SET index eased 1.63 to 752.85 in turnover of Bt5.6bn. Declines
led advances by 141 to 74. Speculative property and construction issues were
the main losers.

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Chilean equities lose their fizz as
interest rates rise - Rumours that pension fund holdings are too high have
also depressed the bolsa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Santiago stock exchange appears to have lost its fizz. The IPSA index of
the 50 most traded shares has dropped by almost 9 per cent this month,
following a steady rise between January and July in which the index climbed
by 39 per cent in dollar terms.
Brokers are at a loss to explain the bearish sentiment in the market. Not
even the announcement of Standard &amp; Poor's 'investment grade' rating for
Chile, which ranks the country as the safest haven for investment in Latin
America, lifted spirits on the trading floor of the bolsa last week.
The economy is set to grow by 8 per cent this year, a construction boom has
transformed Santiago into one huge building site, traffic jams and smog
point to the society's growing affluence, and publicly listed companies
reported an average net income growth of 21 per cent in the first half of
the year.
The strong company results alone should have boosted share values. Their
fall, instead, suggests that the bolsa is suffering from a surfeit of good
news and fears more difficult times ahead.
Investment analysts at Celfin, the company that manages Salomon Brothers'
foreign investment fund in Chile, point out that a large part of company
profits came from the revaluation of the peso earlier this year, which is a
one-off financial gain. Operating income rose by 6.5 per cent in real terms.
Chile's central bank raised interest rates last week in an attempt to dampen
a consumer spending spree that is overheating the economy and fuelling
inflation. Consumer prices are forecast to increase by 1.4 per cent in
August, the highest monthly jump this year, compared with accumulated
inflation of 5.5 per cent in the first seven months of 1992. Brokers report
that investors have begun moving money out of equity and into central bank
paper as a result of the latter's more attractive yields.
The August sell-off, however, began with rumours that Chile's biggest
institutional investors, the private pension funds known as AFPs, had
overstepped their investment ceiling in equities and would soon be forced to
offload shares.
At present, AFPs can hold only up to 30 per cent of their portfolios in
equity. But as share prices have nearly doubled over the past year, many
AFPs find themselves above the legal limit and must trim back their equity
investments within six months.
Mr Pedro Yrrarazaval, the bolsa chairman, says: 'The law is unfair as it
penalises AFPs for making good investments. The pension funds should be
allowed to expand their equity portfolios, and in no case should they be
forced to sell.'
The government is drafting a new law on pension funds which seeks to broaden
their investment horizons. It is unclear, however, whether they will be
allowed to channel more of their Dollars 10bn worth of assets into shares.
Chile's stock market capitalisation is valued at Dollars 33bn, so greater
attention is being paid to other instruments, such as foreign government
securities.
Mr Hugo Lavados, head of Chile's Securities Exchange Commission, says the
government will decide what is best for the pension funds, not what suits
the stock market. But Mr Yrrarazaval argues that the uncertainty is
affecting investor confidence. 'The government should give a clear
indication of its intentions. The market is awash with negative rumours as
nobody knows what will be changed.'
One corner of the market has proved immune to the downturn. A growing number
of companies are seeking listings as a way of raising capital, and the stock
exchange created a new index in July to track the performance of these
'emerging shares'.
The bolsa selected eight companies that have gone public over the past year,
including the Iquique free trade zone (Zofri), two bottling companies,
Edelpa and Polar, two wineries, San Pedro and Santa Rita, a ceramics
manufacturer, Cordillera, a maker of fruit juice concentrates, Jucosa, and
Puerto Ventanas, a private port.
The value of their shares, weighted in the new IPAE index, has risen by 77
per cent since the beginning of the year, more than double the performance
of the IPSA index of most traded shares.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Modest recovery for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING recouped  3/4 pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, following the
Bank of England's most aggressive intervention on the foreign exchanges
since 1986, writes James Blitz.
After an extraordinary day of trading on the sterling/ D-Mark cross, the
pound closed at DM2.7950, nearly two pfennigs above its floor against the
D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Some dealers estimated that the Bank had bought around Pounds 1bn in
sterling in the morning, more than has been spent in any previous daily
interventions to support the dollar by the world's central banks. But many
believed that the UK authorities still faced the prospect of raising
interest rates.
In the first hours of London trading, the pound was supported by a statement
from the UK chancellor that there would be no devaluation. Aggressive
intervention followed.
The pound rose above the DM2.7900 level, but fell sharply after a Bundesbank
council member said a realignment of the ERM was possible. The statement was
successfully countered by the UK chancellor and European government
officials. But sterling's gyrations illustrated the currency market's
nervousness.
Can sterling weather the crisis? Mr Julian Simmonds, head of foreign
exchange trading at Citibank in London, thinks it can. 'When sterling hits
its floor, the Bank will be supported by the Bundesbank and other central
banks coming in to buy it,' he said. He also believes that the slowdown in
the German economy should soon bring lower interest rates.
Another respected forex dealer said an interest rate rise, or even
devaluation, was quite possible. 'Politically, a devaluation is not much
more difficult for the UK than a rate rise,' he added. 'I have a feeling
that it is being considered. I cannot otherwise explain why rates have not
yet been raised and intervention is coming so late.'
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corp in London, believes the
pound is suffering from a fundamental restructuring of currency portfolios
by pension funds. 'A few institutions are now hedging themselves against the
possibility that there will be a realignment,' he said.
The dollar held its ground against the German currency in spite of a larger
than expected fall in US durable goods orders of 3.4 per cent. It lost
nearly  1/2 pfennig in early US trading on the news but closed at DM1.4065
in London, up 65 basis points on the day. In New York the dollar finally
stood at DM1.4067.
But Mr O'Neill said central banks had missed a good opportunity to rally the
dollar through intervention after the Swiss franc had lost ground in the
morning. 'Intervention would have bid the dollar up,' he said, 'but it never
came.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures firm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures ended the day firmer yesterday after the Bank of England
intervened heavily on the foreign exchanges to support the pound.
September short sterling lost around 50 basis points in the first two days
of the week. At the start of a morning of wild trading, the contract rose 15
basis points to a high of 89.20 after the Bank of England bought around
Pounds 1bn of sterling on the currency markets.
The contract then lost 10 basis points after a Bundesbank Council member
said that a realignment of the European Monetary System could take place.
His comments were countered and the contract closed at 89.15, up 10 basis
points from its previous close. The December contract finished 9 basis
points firmer at 89.17. Both prices are still discounting a base rate rise
of more than  1/4 percentage point.
Interbank rates in the sterling cash market also softened in the wake of the
intervention. Three-month money closed at 10 13/16 per cent, down  1/8 per
cent on the offered side. The one-year rate closed down 1/16 per cent at 10
15/16 per cent. The outlook for both of these rates will depend on how well
the Bank's intervention works.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m in the morning, which
was quickly taken out. Clearing banks and discount houses have bought bills
from the commercial sector at rates that correspond to 10 per cent base
rate.
Once again, they offered paper to the Bank of England quickly, fearing a
rise in the Bank's dealing rates.
The Bank bought Pounds 100m of Band 1 and Pounds 16m of Band 2 bank bills at
9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of Band 3 Treasury bills and Pounds 612m of Band
3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 15m of Band 4 Treasury bills and
Pounds 137m of Band 4 Bank bills at 9 per cent.
The Bank revised the forecast to a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn in the
afternoon and provided late assistance of Pounds 20m.
The Bundesbank helped to ease tensions on the foreign exchanges in the
morning by adding DM3.3bn of liquidity to the German money markets in its
weekly operations.
Traders quoted call money at 9.65-9.75 per cent. Most of the activity took
place at 9.70 per cent. On Tuesday it was quoted at 9.70-9.75 per cent.

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian wool market drifted down a little from last week's slightly
firmer levels, although again there was very little change in prices in
terms of the local currency. Of dominant importance outside Australia was
weakness in that currency against the US dollar, and the renewed weakness in
the US dollar itself. Wool therefore again became cheaper to buy for
practically all overseas users. The situation involves slow and very
competitive trading throughout the trade. Recession continues to play a
part, as do the final days of the main European holiday season.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine's cast-iron loss-maker
 -Anthony Robinson reports on the Krivoi Rog ore enrichment plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of the last great Comecon investment project, a sprawling iron ore
enrichment plant near Krivoi Rog in southern Ukraine, hangs in the balance
following Germany's recent decision to pull out of what was planned as a
classic communist resource development.
The aim of the multi-billion rouble project, under construction for the last
five years near the Ukrainian village of Dolinskaya, 450 km (280 miles)
south-east of Kiev, was to process 33m tonnes of low grade oxidised iron ore
annually into enriched iron pellets for the steel mills of eastern Europe.
But the collapse of the Soviet Empire has saddled a now independent Ukraine
with a vast unfinished construction site requiring billions more roubles to
complete. Designed when Soviet energy prices were low and demand for steel
was insatiable, the vast complex of power-hungry grinders, crushers and
pelletisers will never be profitable by the western accounting standards.
This became clear after Bonn took over east Germany's relatively minor 5 per
cent stake. It found that, at world prices, the value of the 3.7m tonnes of
pellets due to be delivered over ten years would be about DM220m (Dollars
133m), equivalent to only 7 per cent of the DM3.7bn investment - and that
took no account of transport cost from southern Ukraine or of the pellets'
low quality.
The German cabinet's June 4 decision to pull out of the deal was reinforced
by the fact that the steel mills that were scheduled to use the pellets had
been scrapped as part of the post-unification destruction of East Germany's
obsolete and polluting industrial plant.
Bonn sent Mr Jurgen Molleman, the economics minister, to tell President
Leonid Kravchuk personally of Bonn's decision. The Ukranian government,
horrified at the implications of the German pull-out, asked it to
reconsider, stating its own determination to complete the project. The
Ukrainian government then sent letters to all the other participants -
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania asking for a meeting to review and
renegotiate the deal.
Senior Ukrainian officials working at the site privately concede that the
original deal was highly disadvantageous for Germany and say that Ukraine is
prepared to compensate it in other ways, provided it completes its vital
segment of the plant. At present, however, Bonn is inclined to cut its
losses. It plans to retain the DM1.7bn still to be disbursed and avoid the
inevitable cost over-runs of a project that should have come on stream this
year but is no more than half finished.
But the former GDR and Bonn have already spent more than DM2bn on equipment,
construction and wages for the 4,000 Polish and East German workers employed
for the last five years in building three crusher plants, housing and
ancillary infrastructure. Mr Volker Wittenbecher, the former-East German
project manager says that 80 per cent of Germany's construction projects
have been completed and 95 per cent of the equipment has already been
delivered.
Ukraine argues that the German part of the project can be completed with
very little extra cost. Mr Viktor Hladush, a tough communist-era manager who
used to run one of Krivoi Rog's five ore enrichment plants, is now the
Ukrainian Minister of Industry. He originally opposed the decision to build
the new plant, believing that existing plants should have been modernised
instead. He insists that Dolinskaya will only be completed if it is
profitable to Ukraine.
But judging profitability is more than a profit and loss account
calculation. If Dolinskaya is scrapped, hundreds of acres of former rich,
black earth farm land will have been transformed uselessly into a
half-finished industrial desert and billions of roubles will have been lost.
Dropping the project also means that existing older plants in Krivoi Rog
will continue to pollute the city. Millions of tonnes of low grade ore will
remain on the waste tips surrounding the iron mines instead of being shipped
off for enrichment.
The possibility of using cheap, already-mined ores and the fact that most of
the actual construction costs were to be borne by East Germany, Romania,
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, originally attracted the Soviet leaders to the
project. It followed the classic pattern of pre-payment for future
deliveries of 'cheap' energy and raw materials already established by the
Druzhba oil pipeline, which brings Russian oil to eastern Europe, and the
Yamburg gas pipeline.
Like all decisions of the now defunct Comecon, it also had a political
motive - to reinforce east European dependence on Moscow.
The collapse of both Comecon and the Soviet Union, however, has changed the
political and economic landscape radically. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian
prime minister has made it clear that Russia wants nothing more to do with
the project. Ukraine has thus inherited both Moscow's original 51 per cent
stake and the commitment to supply hundreds of millions of tonnes of ore,
build a 60 km dedicated railway line from Krivoi Rog to Dolinskaya and
supply water and energy from a nuclear power station at Nikolayev, in
southern Ukraine (at present mothballed for safety reasons). In return
Ukraine will receive 51 per cent of the 10m tonnes of pellets to be produced
annually.
On the same basis Romania, the second biggest partner, with a 27 per cent
stake, is scheduled to receive 27 per cent of the pellets, followed by
Czechoslovakia (14 per cent), eastern Germany (5 per cent) and Bulgaria (4
per cent).
Czechoslovakian participation is now in doubt, however. The federal
government has indicated its desire to withdraw, although the
soon-to-be-independent Slovakian government is anxious to ensure a
continuing supply of pellets for the East Slovak steelworks in Kosice, which
already receives pellets from Krivoi Rog.
Romania, whose dependence on Ukrainian ore is reflected in the size of its
stake, seems the most determined to press on. More than 4,500 Romanians are
hard at work completing the final pelletisation plant and the country has
indicated a willingness to finish uncompleted sections if others pull out.
The Bulgarians, with the smallest stake, are nowhere to be seen at the vast
construction site with its miles of tubing, half finished crushing,
sintering and flotation plants, rutted roads and piles of machinery, packing
cases and building materials.
Despite the fact that most of the German workers have already gone home,
leaving only 200 to board up the nearly-finished assembly halls and make
detailed inventories of everything left behind, Mr Ivan Stepanov, the
Ukranian deputy director of the entire complex, expresses quiet confidence
that the project will still be completed - sometime in 1995.
He still hopes that the Germans, who alone appear to have kept close to the
original schedule, will reconsider. 'We are looking for a compromise. If
they no longer need their share of pellets perhaps they could be repaid in
some other way. But if they walk away now they will not get anything back
for what they have done.'
Brought up in the Stalinist tradition of smoking chimneys and heavy industry
the former communists who still run the Ukraine are used to thinking in
terms of energy-intensive, resource-based projects like Krivoi Rog. Such
thinking also permeates nationalist parties like Rukh, which point to
Ukraine's allegedly rich natural resources as the basis for its future
prosperity.
The reality is much grimmer. The coal and iron ore mines which spurred the
Ukrainian industrial revolution in the 19th century are now more of a
liability than an asset. After a century of exploitation the iron ore mines
are now deep holes in the ground. Coal production in the adjacent Donbas
fell by more than 20 per cent last year and many of the deep,
geologically-fractured mines are both dangerous and unprofitable. What is
more, many of the plants that formerly consumed the 54m tonnes of steel
produced annually by Ukraine before the dissolution of the Soviet Empire
were either arms factories or heavy engineering plants - often producing
equipment for the iron and steel industry. Like so much of the old command
economy it was a self-sustaining circle which generated little in the way of
consumer goods.
Against this broader background the future of Dolinskaya is intimately
linked to the future shape of the Ukrainian economy. A decision to pour many
billions more roubles into completing the plant would confirm Ukraine's
heavy industrial vocation. But they would be roubles that could otherwise be
invested in building a more modern, consumer-orientated economy. Hard
choices lie ahead.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand to resume wool
trade with Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND is resume its wool trade with Russia after nearly two years' of
severe disruption because of the former Soviet Union's financial problems.
For more than two decades it had been one of New Zealand's most important
customers for carpet-making wools.
Mr Pat Morrison, chairman of the New Zealand Wool Board said yesterday that
it was hoped that about 16,500 tonnes would be sold this season. This
confirms reports in May that the Russians would buy wool worth some
NZDollars 100m (Pounds 27m) this season, following the signing of new credit
agreements with the West.
Initial shipments of 1,400 tonnes of wool worth NZDollars 11m are being
assembled for export in Auckland and Christchurch. Mr Morrison said payment
arrangements for the initial deal had been completed on a very satisfactory
commercial basis. Most of the wool will be sold from the board's stockpile,
which grew to 580,000 tonnes, from 1989 largely because of the withdrawal of
Russian and Chinese buying, before China resumed buying in large quantities
last year.
Traders had been wary about making deals with the former Soviet republics
because of delays in settling an estimated NZDollars 350m of unpaid bills.
This included NZDollars 270m owed to the Dairy Board and NZDollars 60m to
the ANZ Bank, which underwrote a wool deal last year.
Mr Morrison said getting the trade going again had been a priority, although
it would take time to see it return to former buying levels. The Soviet
Union used to buy about 10 per cent, or 25,000 tonnes of New Zealand's total
wool production, and was viewed as the country's most consistent buyer.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian oil exploration
falls short of target

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA SIGNED a record number of oil production
sharing contracts last year but a concomitant rise in exploration
expenditure failed to materialise, according to the annual petroleum report
published by the US Embassy in Jakarta.
The government signed 22 production sharing contracts with oil companies in
1991, up from 14 in each of the previous two years, and the report estimates
a further 15 could be signed this year.
However, only 123 exploration wells drilled last year, 38.5 per cent below
the number forecast by Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company.
Actual exploration and development expenditure by oil companies was Dollars
1.875bn, significantly lower than the Dollars 2.27bn budgeted.
The report cautions that oil companies are farming out exploration in
frontier areas, where the cost of a wildcat well exceeds Dollars 30m, in
order to limit exposure.
Pertamina forecasts that oil companies' exploration expenditure will reach
Dollars 2.84bn this year, although the report says the softness of the oil
market may lead to 'some erosion in budgeted outlays'.
The report estimates Indonesia's crude and condensate production in 1991 at
1.592m barrels a day, dropping to 1.53m b/d in the first quarter of this
year. Exports in 1991 averaged 905,000 b/d, of which 44 per cent went to
Japan and 11 per cent to the US.
The value of Indonesia's oil and condensate exports last year totalled
Dollars 6.4bn, down from Dollars 8.75bn in 1990.
Indonesia also produced 22m tonnes of liquefied natural gas last year,
accounting for 38 per cent of world production. All production was exported,
with Japan accounting for 80 per cent, South Korea 13 per cent and Taiwan 7
per cent.
LNG exports in 1991 were valued at Dollars 4.04bn.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian board sells wheat to

THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board yesterday said it had sold 500,000 tonnes of
wheat to India in a ADollars 100m (Pounds 35m) deal which marks the
resumption of Australian sales to New Delhi after a gap of more than 10
years.
Mr John Lawrenson, managing director, said the board expected to sell more
wheat to India for shipment early next year to help cover a forecast
shortfall of 1.5m tonnes in the Indian harvest.
'That will depend in large part on the progress of the monsoon, but I
understand that so far it has not lived up to expectations and that the area
sown to wheat in India may fall below what is required to maintain
self-sufficiency,' Mr Lawrenson said. India is normally self-sufficient in
wheat, and has been a modest exporter in previous years.
The deal means returns of about ADollars 200 a tonne for Australian growers,
compared with average returns of between ADollars 160 and ADollars 170 a
tonne. The average return last season was ADollars 180 a tonne.
The wheat board said the wheat contract had spin-off possibilities for
Australian grain legume growers. 'India is a significant market for
Australian field peas and chick peas, and given that we will be shipping
large volumes of wheat we may be able to generate some freight advantages
that will assist the sale of these crops,' Mr Lawrenson said.

BRAZIL, COLOMBIA and Costa Rica presented a united front after three days of
talks on the establishment of a new International Coffee Agreement and said
the International Coffee Organisation must register 'decisive progress' at
its meeting in September. Brazil is to call a producers' meeting for
September 19 and 20, before the ICO discussions begin.
Representatives from the three coffee-producing countries pointed out that
producers had accepted the universal quota and agreed to negotiate other
issues presented by the consuming countries.
But they deplored the fact that consuming countries were not showing
willingness to share the responsibility for ensuring controls on coffee
imports.
'We are not going to export coffee other than that established by our
quotas,' said Mr Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's Coffee Federation.
He insisted that it was urgent to get the pact going and if there was no
will to negotiate in September the producers 'would have to analyse other
alternatives'.
The joint communique refers to the 'devastating effects' of low prices.
Colombia is to take at least 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of coffee out
of production to cut its present output of 17m bags (60 kg each), which is
draining the national coffee fund. Income from coffee has now dropped to
less than 20 per cent of Colombia's export earnings.

COPPER remained under pressure from liquidation orders on the LME for most
of the day, ignoring late news that Polish miners were threatening to resume
their strike, which took the steam out of early falls on Comex. By the end
of the LME kerb three-month copper was trading at Pounds 1,286.50 a tonne,
down Pounds 11 from Tuesday and equivalent to Dollars 2,508, down Dollars
27. This means that so far this week it has lost a large part of last week's
Dollars 90 gain. ZINC remained underpinned by developing fourth quarter
tightness and news that Peru's Centromin workers have threatened to strike
indefinitely in September. The threat of a fourth quarter squeeze on LME
zinc supplies by a group of traders and producers through strategic
purchases of futures and options prompted further short covering and widened
the backwardation from October. Late news that the European Zinc Institute
had estimated world stocks down 11,330 tonnes in July saw three-month metal
close on the kerb at Dollars 1,364.50 a tonne, up Dollars 13. TIN came in
for a late bout of profit taking. But traders said they were still looking
for a move up to Dollars 7,000 for three-month metal as the recent rally is
still intact.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Waves of selling depress
precious metals prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD DISAPPOINTED its supporters again yesterday when, instead of becoming a
haven for investors seeking shelter from turmoil in the currency markets,
waves of selling in a thin market drove down the price.
Silver also fell sharply, losing more than 2 per cent of its value in a
single day and leaving precious metals analysts divided about its probable
future direction.
As silver closed in London down 8 cents at 365.50 cents a troy ounce,
reflecting its new role as an industrial metal at a time of gloomy economic
conditions, US analysts suggested that it might fall below the 17-year low
level seen in 1991 and towards 300 cents an ounce. European analysts said,
however, that at 350 cents an ounce silver would be heavily oversold.
Gold closed in London at Dollars 338.65 an ounce, down Dollars 2.65 on the
day. The London bulion market's afternoon 'fixing' session was prolonged by
Middle East selling.
Analysts said there was also persistent selling by Australian gold
producers. 'They come in to sell above Dollars 340 an ounce,' suggested Mr
Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland. Mr William O'Neill at Merrill Lynch
pointed out: 'The fall of Australia's currency against the US dollar has
made gold selling extremely attractive in Australian dollar terms'.
Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst at Societe General Strauss Turnbull, suggested that
gold was being ignored by many investors because of its relative lack of
volatility. He said: 'There are far more exciting games for the fleet of
foot.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Fears over sterling continue to trouble
gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds ended up to a half point lower on continuing worries
about sterling and a poor response to an auction of long-dated gilts.
Prices fell sharply in the morning when the auction results were announced,
and dropped again when Bank of England intervention in the currency markets
failed to give a sustained lift to sterling.
There was a slight rally in afternoon trading in line with firmer European
markets, but longer-term issues closed well below their opening levels.
The Pounds 2.5bn auction of 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017 was covered 1.24
times with an average price of 96 7/8 , to give a yield of 9.07 per cent.
The cover compared with 1.82 times when the stock was first auctioned in
April.
Dealers said the disappointing response was not surprising given market
conditions. Only domestic investors would hold the stock because of its long
maturity, they said.
Futures market volumes were active with more than 90,000 contracts traded.
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 95.24 to 95.01 in late trading. In
the cash market, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 fell 1/2 to 97 13/16 to yield
9.26 per cent while the shorter dated 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 1997 lost  1/8
to 95 31/32 .
Speculation of another French opinion poll predicting a rising 'No' vote for
Maastricht also undermined the market.
'It will remain volatile until the September 20 (French) referendum but we
may have found some support at these levels,' said Mr John Shepperd,
economist at SG Warburg.
IN SPITE of further signs of growing anti-Maastricht sentiment, French
government bond prices rose 40 basis points. News of an unexpectedly high
trade surplus in July prompted an early rally in bond prices, and some
covering of short positions.
Dealers said that the market had been oversold on Tuesday, as fears of a
'No' vote mounted.
The French bond market outperformed German bunds yesterday, causing the
bund/OAT yield spread to tighten from 134 basis points to 125 basis points.
Conflicting comments on the Bundesbank's attitude to realignment of the
exchange rate mechanism also unsettled the market.
SWEDISH government bond prices fell early yesterday after the Riksbank
raised its marginal rate by three percentage points to 16 per cent, but
recovered later in the day as dealers covered short positions.
The rise in interest rates, the second in a week, is aimed at stemming
recent large capital outflows. Dealers said they had expected a further rate
rise, but were taken aback by the size of yesterday's increase.
The yield on the 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 rose to 11.40 per cent early
in the day, up from 11.29 at the previous close, but recovered to end at
11.11 per cent.
The Swedish central bank's move prompted Finland to lift its tender rate by
1.5 percentage points to 17 per cent.
US Treasury prices rose across the board yesterday on a stable dollar,
further evidence of economic weakness and a successful five-year note
auction.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 97
27/32 , to yield 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32
at 99 31/32 , yielding 4.250 per cent.
For the second consecutive day the dollar was able to hold its ground at
DM1.40, which helped boost bond market sentiment. The market received the
most support, however, from the July durable goods report, which registered
a 3.4 per cent decline. Analysts had predicted a flat reading in durable
goods, and although the bulk of the decline was accounted for by
transportation orders, the figures prompted a round of buying.
Prices made up the most ground in the afternoon, following the sale of
Dollars 10.5bn of five-year notes, which attracted strong demand.
JAPANESE government bonds ended slightly lower in quiet trading on profit
taking, following gains earlier in the week. After a strong opening, hedging
against a new 10-year, Y1,000bn auction depressed prices in the afternoon.
But dealers said underlying sentiment remained positive.
A coupon of 5 per cent, in line with expectations, was set for the new
issue, No 151. Dealers said average prices were good. The No 145 bond, which
is expected to become the benchmark today, opened with a yield of 4.82 per
cent and closed at 4.84 per cent.

will buy treasury bonds
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND, struggling to finance a weighty budget deficit, hopes foreign banks
will start buying its three-year treasury bonds next month, once it has
ironed out a technical hitch over the repatriation of interest, Reuter
reports from Warsaw.
None of the foreign banks invited at the end of last month to bid for a
7,000bn zloty issue - the first of its kind - took part.
Ms Alicja Malecka, a finance ministry adviser seconded from the US Treasury,
said the banks were put off because a foreign exchange permit was not ready.
'The banks were not sure they would be able to repatriate the interest,' she
said. The permit is now expected to come into force by mid-September, and
this had raised 'a lot of interest' from banks, mutual funds and individuals
in the US, Britain, Austria and Switzerland, she said.
The annualised interest on the bonds, payable every three months, was set at
47.22 per cent for the first quarter.
Although this compares with an expected annual inflation rate of 40 per
cent, the response has been modest.
By August 8, two thirds of the first tranche of one year bonds had been
sold. Unsold bonds from the first tranche will be rolled into the next
auction and public offer, at the beginning of November. The second tranche
begins next week. The bonds carry interest equal to yearly inflation plus
five per cent interest.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Firm demand for Japan Highway issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CDollars 300m Eurobond offering yesterday for Japan Highway, the Japanese
government-backed agency, ended the recent dearth of fixed-rate Canadian
paper.
The deal met firm demand from Japanese accounts, as well as European
investors in search of paper with coupons reflecting current interest rate
levels. Older deals, with higher coupons, are now trading substantially
above par, which discourages many investors.
The deal was considered rather aggressively priced to yield 36 basis points
above the comparable Canadian government bond yield: similar AAA rated
government-backed paper was trading as much as 10 basis points wider,
although those issues are quoted at a premium. Lack of supply ensured firm
demand, which withstood a declining Canadian government bond market.
Poor swap opportunities are likely to continue to limit supply in the
sector, although other Japanese utilities are eyeing the market. Yesterday's
deal was said to have been swapped into fixed-rate yen, but lead manager IBJ
International declined to comment.
BLENHEIM Group, the organiser of trade exhibitions, has joined the growing
list of UK companies seeking longer term financing in the US with a Dollars
75m private placement. Blenheim Holdings, the company's US subsidiary,
placed the senior notes, which mature in 1999, mainly with US insurance
companies. The money will be used to repay short-term borrowings.
Several British companies, including Pilkington and United Newspapers, have
tapped the US private placement market, where demand from yield-hungry US
investors has allowed them to achieve attractive funding levels. Blenheim
said the yield on its placement was 'not dissimilar' from these deals,
suggesting it is paying about 1.5 percentage points above US Treasury bond
yields. Barclays de Zoete Wedd was agent for the placing.
Blenheim has net borrowings of Pounds 42m and Mr Neville Buch, executive
chairman, said interest cover is between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, has entered the
fast-growing Euro medium-term note market with a multi-currency programme of
Dollars 2bn to provide more flexibility in the refinancing of its leasing
and credit sales business.
The programme, to be signed today, is the largest yet arranged for a German
company. It will enable Daimler, whose activities include vehicles and
aerospace, to draw tranches for varying periods, at differing interest
rates, in a variety of currencies.
Mr Paul Wick of Daimler's finance department said Debis, the group's
financial services arm, had a yearly refinancing need of some DM8bn, likely
to grow by about DM1bn a year. This mostly related to business in cars and
trucks.
Debis's activities were growing in the US - where car leasing deals are a
way of offering competitive prices in a tough market - Germany, France,
Belgium and the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Newer
markets included the Nordic area and Mexico.
The EMTN programme has been arranged by Deutsche Bank, with Merrill Lynch
International as co-arranger.
Daimler will be able to draw on the programme in dollars, D-Marks - recently
made possible by the Bundesbank's further liberalisation of the capital
market - other leading European currencies, ECUs, and Canadian and
Australian dollars. The programme will fit between its short-term commercial
paper funds and its Eurobond borrowings, with tranches expected to run
mainly for two to five years.
The funds can be drawn on by three group subsidiaries: Daimler-Benz
International Finance in the Netherlands, Daimler-Benz North America
Corporation in New York, and Daimler-Benz UK in London.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Latin American link-up -
Leslie Crawford on plans for cross-border listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock exchanges of Santiago and Buenos Aires are planning to introduce
cross-border listings following a wave of Chilean investment in Argentina.
Both exchanges believe the time is ripe for closer integration. Chilean
speculators have pumped more than Dollars 200m into the Buenos Aires Stock
Exchange - Latin America's top performer last year. Nearly all of this has
gone through unofficial channels to avoid the dreaded tax man.
In addition, many Chilean corporations are becoming household names across
the border. Chile's cash-rich utilities have acquired several Argentine
power companies that were privatised this year. Mr Pablo Yrrarazaval,
chairman of the Santiago Stock Exchange, or Bolsa, believes it makes sense
to allow Chile's budding multinationals to be quoted in Buenos Aires.
Attracting Argentine companies to Santiago would also give the Bolsa more
depth. Only 50 Chilean companies are actively traded on Chile's Bolsa, and
the daily turnover rarely exceeds Dollars 14m. The average daily trading
volume is six times higher in Buenos Aires.
As a first step, the two exchanges have signed an agreement to exchange
information on the rules for listing and trading in both centres. Chile
currently demands stricter rules on the disclosure of financial information
of its publicly quoted companies. The Securities and Exchange Commissions of
both countries are working to standardise auditing and accounting practices.
Mr Yrrarazaval is particularly worried about the different tax and foreign
investment regimes that operate in both countries. 'Argentina has the clear
advantage: there are no capital gains tax or restrictions on capital
repatriation,' he explained. In Chile, foreign investors must wait between
one and five years to repatriate capital and pay capital gains tax at a rate
of 35 per cent.
Only one Chilean company is presently quoted on a foreign stock exchange.
Compania de Telefonos de Chile (CTC), the telecommunications group
controlled by Telefonica of Spain, has been listed on the New York Stock
Exchange since 1990, where most of its shares are now traded. Demand on Wall
Street and at home has more than trebled the price of CTC shares over two
years.
Mr Yrrarazaval is pressing the finance ministry to abolish Chile's capital
gains tax. He argues that Chile needs a stock market that can compete on an
equal footing with other financial centres. The response so far has been
negative. Mr Hugo Lavados, who heads the Chilean SEC, says: 'We will not
change Chile's tax regime just to enhance stock market competition.' He
supports the idea of cross-border listings, and believes the markets will
set their own price levels to reflect the different tax burdens.
Another project in progress aims to link the smaller electronic exchanges of
Latin America and Spain. The screen-based securities exchanges were set up
in the late 1980s as rivals to the established stock exchanges in the
region. They have grown rapidly. Santiago's electronic exchange now handles
between a quarter and a third of all equity transactions.
Montevideo's electronic bourse has linked up with Barcelona to trade in
Spanish treasury bills. They are working to standardise information, and the
long-term goal is to have interactive trading between the bourses of Mexico,
Sao Paulo, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Caracas, Lima, Madrid,
Barcelona and Bilbao.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rupert Murdoch - Down and up in
Beverly Hills / Two years ago, a financial crisis nearly wrecked his
company. Now, he has rarely been so content
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS cool cream office halfway along the executive corridor at Twentieth
Century Fox's studios Rupert Murdoch is, for the moment, completely absorbed
and happy. The overnight television network ratings have just come in and
everything else stops while the chairman and chief executive of News
Corporation works out how Fox  - his network  - has done.
Good news. Fox has done well against the other three networks with 17 per
cent of the national audience. Its Wednesday evening shows  - Beverly Hills
90210, a high school drama, and Melrose Place, a series about 20-somethings
in a trendy area of Los Angles  - have beaten the competition.
'It's so exciting. It's so much fun,' says Mr Murdoch. At 61, he looks back
on nearly forty years of media competition, yet sounds as exhilarated as a
young television producer with his first hit.
Six months ago, he took on the chairman's job at Twentieth Century Fox.
After starting as a newspaper publisher in Adelaide, moving to London,
emigrating to New York and taking American citizenship, Mr Murdoch has now
come to rest in Los Angeles.
Every morning he drives himself to work in a green Mercedes convertible from
his home in Beverly Hills, a house once owned by Jules Stein, founder of
MCA. By 6.30, he is sitting at his desk at the studio where films such as
The Sound of Music and Miracle on 34th Street were made. His morning starts
with several hours of telephone calls to London and other parts of the News
Corp empire. Then he absorbs himself in the nuts and bolts of his latest
challenge  - films.
Rupert Murdoch is well and happy and living in Los Angeles. But above all
else, he has survived.
In the autumn of 1990, News Corp was almost overwhelmed by its debts of more
than USDollars 7.6bn. Nearly 150 banks had to be persuaded to roll over the
debt and come up with a new USDollars 600m loan. Yesterday came the firmest
evidence so far, not only that News Corp has survived but that it is
bouncing back: it reported a 65 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars
531m (USDollars 379.20m) for the year to the end of June.
The restructuring was a long and tortuous process. Every bank had to be kept
in the deal or it could all have started to unravel. At one point, the
negotiations hung fire because the head of an Indian bank had gone off on a
tiger shoot. At another, only a midnight call from Mr Murdoch - and a
promise to stump up his personal wealth if necessary  - persuaded a bank
chairman to stay in the consortium.
It is unlikely that Mr Murdoch will forget the experience, or the mistakes
that made it necessary.
Curled up in a cream armchair in his office, surrounded by abstract
paintings, he talks in a matter-of-fact way about what he got wrong. 'We
just got caught running when we should have been walking and that was a
sufficiently unpleasant experience to make you swear you are not going to
let it happen to you again,' he says.
'If I had been more perceptive a year earlier we would have spent less money
on Sky (the UK satellite television venture). Maybe we would have given it
one less channel and phased it in more slowly.'
Spending ADollars 1bn on re-equipping the group's four Australian newspaper
printing plants at once when only one was urgent was a clear mistake, he
says. 'With hindsight we could also have taken precautionary measures before
you had the cash tightening when (lending from) the short-term money market
disappeared,' he adds.
News Corp had been taking advantage of the lower interest rates available on
short-term borrowings. But once international banks started to get jittery
about the scale of their debt exposure there was a certain slow-motion
inevitability about the News Corp crisis. The capital commitments had been
made and the loans  - typically for two to three years  - were maturing.
There simply wasn't the money to pay them off.
Despite the scale of the problem, Mr Murdoch says he never believed his
empire was in terminal danger.
'It wasn't as if we were faced with all the tenants leaving. Our readers
hadn't left us, our advertisers hadn't left us. We were still trading and
capable of cutting costs to improve profits,' he says.
One of his leading lenders concurs: 'Most companies that were forced to
restructure their debts got into trouble because the trading conditions of
their businesses deteriorated or there was a major economic event that
turned the face of their business,' he says.
'Murdoch wasn't like that. Most of his businesses were doing all right. He
had overinvested in businesses for which he paid too much, and he was
funding everything in the short-term markets. It was his funding strategy
that caught him with his pants down.'
Mr Murdoch helped to ease the crisis by reacting swiftly, says the banker:
'Murdoch is an arrogant bugger, but he wasn't so arrogant that he didn't
know when he was in trouble.'
This view, shared by other lenders, helped to ease the financial
restructuring. And a media company also has some very glamorous products
with which to impress bankers with when times get tough. In November 1990,
Joe Roth, president of the film division of Twentieth Century Fox, put on a
tie and joined the international News Corp road show. He showed the bankers
a few clips from his latest movie  - a modestly priced Dollars 18m picture
due to open in a week's time. The bankers laughed in all the right places
and Mr Roth told them he had a hunch this picture could maybe make Dollars
75m.
The boss was taken aback, says Mr Roth. 'Rupert said to me afterwards: 'How
could you say that. This is a tiny little comedy. These are bankers]'.' Mr
Roth had the last laugh: the tiny comedy, Home Alone, grossed Dollars 507m
at the cinema box office  - Dollars 1bn when video and television deals are
included.
Spurred on by such hopes, the last bank signed on January 31, 1991. The
restructuring was at last over  - but, says Mr Murdoch, that was just the
beginning. The debt burden  - now bigger  - had only been rolled over. The
day of reckoning had merely been postponed.
Revenues were falling everywhere. News Corp had to pay its banks' fees,
along with the extra 1 per cent on interest rates they had insisted on.
True, underlying interest rates were falling, and so was the price of the
company's most important raw material, newsprint. But overall the company
faced a difficult future: the first Dollars 2.4bn of debt was due in
February 1994.
'Our shares had been battered down to ADollars 3.80 (they are now ADollars
23.50) and they were stll shorting us. We had to build back credibility
quarter by quarter. We had to take in some equity at pretty humiliating
prices and sell some assets we didn't like to sell,' Mr Murdoch says. It was
time for the serious work to begin. This took two forms  - selling assets
and cutting costs.
Disposals had begun before the agreement with the banks was finally reached.
They included getting rid of the Delux film laboratories at Fox and selling
a paper mill in the UK. But that was not enough. A more central asset would
have to go. Mr Murdoch says he gritted his teeth and accepted that he would
have to do whatever it took to survive.
'We looked at every asset,' he says, asking ''What can we miss least? What
can we replace easiest when times turn?' The answer was the smaller
magazines.'
In May 1991, New York magazine, Seventeen and six other Murdoch magazines
were sold to K-III Holdings, a company controlled by the leveraged buyout
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a deal worth Dollars 650m. A 55 per cent
stake in Mr Murdoch's Australian magazine and printing operations raised
another Dollars 575m. Selling equity  - reducing the Murdoch family interest
in News Corp to around 40 per cent  - and issuing some long term debt
brought in an additional Dollars 600m.
The second arm of the strategy was more gradual: managing the company hard,
cutting costs to get profit margins up.
This task fell to Mr Gus Fischer, a spare, thoughtful Swiss-German, who met
Rupert Murdoch when the company he ran supplied photographic printing plates
to News Corp newspapers.
He became managing director of News International, and in January 1991 also
became chief operating officer of News Corp with special responsibility for
cutting costs in the UK and the US.
Last year News International's total revenues rose by 1 per cent; operating
profits rose by 27 per cent. Over 18 months the newspaper division's costs
have been cut by Pounds 40m a year. Layers of managers and supervisors have
been removed. In 1990, News International's five UK national newspapers had
3,755 employees; now they have 2,924. Mr Fischer says: 'There is no magic
formula. It means hard work and working with people.'
Savings have been made everywhere from newspaper distribution to debt
collection from people who hadn't paid for their personal classified
advertisments. There was a department to chase non-payers, and a debt
collection agency with payments linked to the number of letters sent out.
Overall, says Mr Fischer, collecting for unpaid classified ads was costing
News International around Pounds 400,000 for every Pounds 500,000 recovered.
So now he has changed the rules. Personal classified ads are paid for by
credit card in advance, and there is no debt collection problem.
An average of 10 per cent savings has already been achieved across the group
with more to come. Mr Fischer is now turning his gaze to the US, starting
with the remaining News Corp magazines, especially TV Guide, the television
listings magazine. The process will probably be complete by the end of next
year.
'Then, like painting the Forth Bridge, it will be time to start again. There
are always costs to come out,' Mr Fischer says.
The results for the first six weeks of News Corp's new financial year show
operating profit up 17 per cent on budget and 44 per cent up on the same
period last year even though there is little sign of a lessening of
recession in the company's main markets.
Mr Dave DeVoe, News Corp's finance director based in New York, says that
margins in the UK have increased from 14 to 20 per cent. Margins have also
been improving in Australia and in the US, he says. The ratio of debt to
operating cash flow, currently five, is heading south, he says. At the start
of the 1992 financial year interest will be covered twice over by earnings,
but 1993 will see a sharp improvement, to something like
two-and-three-quarters.
Tight management is not the only factor behind these gains. Another is Mr
Murdoch's luck, consistently good throughout his career. Arguably, he was
lucky that his refinancing crisis came to a head when it did. By late 1990,
bankers were already worried enough about collapsing businesses to want to
ensure News Corp stayed afloat, but they had not yet had to face the crises
at other heavily indebted firms such as Olympia &amp; York.
Another piece of luck was the path of interest rates. Two years ago, US
interest rates were running at about 9 per cent; now they are around 4 per
cent. News Corp has benefited greatly; in the last financial year, for
example, falling interest rates have cut its debt service costs by 20 per
cent.
And luck sometimes works both ways, says one of Mr Murdoch's bankers: 'Yes,
he's been lucky with falling interest rates. On the other hand, he's not
been lucky in the sense that his three key markets - the US, the UK and
Australia  - have been very slow in coming out of recession.'
Perhaps for this reason, in Los Angeles Rupert Murdoch is still exhibiting
some of the caution of the recently burned. 'Worldwide we are in relatively
better shape,' he says carefully. 'We are getting our strongest growth in
television and the movie company is going well.'
Despite his relative caution, it is clear that the terms of his probation
from the banks are beginning to chafe.
There is a considerable way to go before reaching his hope of
investment-grade rating: News Corp debt is currently rated B1 by Moody's,
four notches below investment grade; and Standard &amp; Poor's rates the group's
subordinated debt at B, five notches below investment grade.
With a bit more freedom of action, Mr Murdoch's traditional enthusiasm for
acquisitions would be likely to reassert itself. 'If we were in an acquiring
mood we would look at improving distribution for the Fox television
network,' he says, 'which means buying another two or three stations.'
In spite of an easier financial situation, recent months have not been
entirely trouble-free. Super Zeitung, a daily newspaper set up in what was
East Germany as a joint venture with Burda, the west German publisher,
collapsed messily. Mr Murdoch pulled out, mostly because he could not get
managerial control of the operation and its costs. Thereafter, Burda closed
it down. The project had attracted a great deal of attention, partly because
of the extravagant hopes invested in it by its backers, partly because it
carried more nude photographs than the Sun, the UK's racy tabloid, could
ever dream of.
Though defunct, Super Zeitung is a reminder that News Corp is not quite the
staid, predictable business its bankers might wish it to be. Another
reminder of the group's occasional oddities was a curious incident at a
conference of News Corp executives in June. Wishing to make a point about
censorship, Mr Stephen Chao, the newly appointed president of the seven Fox
television stations, brought on a male stripper during his speech. The
audience, which included US Defence Secretary Dick Cheney and his wife, was
not amused. Mr Chao was fired on the spot. 'There are limits,' is Mr
Murdoch's only comment on the affair now.
He is more forthcoming talking his way through the prospects for the
company's main areas of business:
US Television. Fox now broadcasts 12 hours a week in prime time five days a
week. Mr Murdoch claims it will soon be the leading network among 18-49 year
olds, its target audience. It plans to go to six days a week in the autumn
and possibly seven next year. But to avoid Federal Communications Commission
rules that prevent networks exploiting their own production Fox has to stay
below 15 hours a week in prime time  - the threshold for full network status
and the restrictions that go with it.
Next year's task is to set up a Fox news service, to challenge Ted Turner's
Cable News Network, currently used as a supplementary news source by many
independent US television stations. Mr Jamie Kellner, president of Fox
Broadcasting, says the challenge is to attract younger people to the news.
'News skews quite old,' he says, in broadcaster's shorthand  - meaning that
viewers of existing news programmes are older than the audience as a whole.
'That's the Fox opportunity to break the mould and do it differently as we
have done with the rest of our programmes.'
Sky Television. Sky is operated by British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in
which News Corp owns 50 per cent and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
has a significant stake. It is expected to make operating profits of around
Pounds 50m in the year to June 1993, though overall the operation is still
losing money because of the heavy debt to its owners incurred in its early
years. 'I think the breakout is just beginning,' says Mr Murdoch, 'but of
course there will be competitors.' As the audience grows, however, 'new
players will widen the universe and that is bound to lead to very big
profits'.
Sky is planning to launch a third film channel this autumn to replace the
Comedy channel which has not been a success. The new channel will be mainly
based on the films of the 1970s and 1980s and will probably be offered free
to those already subscribing to both existing film channels.
At the moment Sky says there are 2.4m-2.5m satellite dish owners, with 1.3m
movie channel subscribers. Media buyers, who buy television time for
advertising agencies, are generally impressed with Sky's performance. It
currently reaches 14 per cent of UK homes, says one top media buyer, with
the figure likely to rise to 23 per cent by the end of 1993  - but it costs
only one-tenth the price of advertising on UK terrestrial television. 'The
only worry we have is that by pushing more towards subscription-only
channels BSkyB might turn some people off,' the buyer says.
News International. Of the five UK national newspapers, says Mr Murdoch,
three are strong market leaders (Sunday Times, Sun and News of The World);
the other two are doing better. Today is now profitable on a marginal cost
basis, he says, and The Times is breaking even overall. New York analysts
are impressed with News Corp's performance in the UK last year, given the
weakness of the local economy. One possible constraint on the future is a
rising chorus of complaints about press concentration. Mr Murdoch hinted at
the frustration this imposes: 'We now have a strong balance sheet and strong
earnings growth. The question is how do we use that competitive advantage
without being accused of having monopoly power by ignoramuses.'
Australia. Four times a year, a News Corp executive in New York feeds the
company's quarterly results into a facsimile machine for transmission to the
Australian Stock Exchange. It is a ritual that maintains News Corp's
historical relationship with Australia, but some Australians are beginning
to wonder how long the relationship will last.
The Australian businesses are in good shape, says Mr Murdoch, and getting
their share of revenue in an economy seriously hit by recession. And though
Australia is becoming less important to Mr Murdoch, he remains of immense
importance to Australia, controlling between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of
daily newspaper circulation.
Mr Murdoch says the Australian businesses will remain part of News Corp:
'Every company has to have its traditions and its roots,' he says. Those
traditions include News Corp's enthusiastic use of Australia's relaxed tax
legislation, which has allowed the group to minimise its tax bill through
the use of offshore tax havens. The Australian government has threatened to
tighten the rules, but few commentators expect News Corp to be significantly
affected. 'If it was going to make an enormous amount of difference News
Corp would simply move its domicile offshore,' says Mr Mr Alex Pollak, media
analyst at Sydney's Macquarie Bank.
One activity in Australia to which Mr Murdoch's commitment has weakened is
the airline business, described as News Corp's big problem area by one close
follower of the group. In the medium term, says Mr Murdoch, News Corp will
drop out of its 50 per cent stake in Ansett Transport Industries, the
domestic Australian airline, and its stake in Ansett Worldwide Aviation
Services, the aircraft leasing company.
The leasing activities would be the first to go. 'They have been a source of
profit when we needed it, but they do not fit a media company,' says Mr
Murdoch. This is not the best time to get a good price for an aircraft
leasing business, however, with the industry plagued by world-wide
overcapacity.
The main Ansett stake is also to be sold, but not yet. The company has won
the right to apply for international routes and a bumpy period of
de-regulation lies ahead. But the intention is to sell the stake within two
or three years. A third party  - perhaps an international airline - could be
brought in before then.
Magazines. Mr Murdoch says he is happy with the progress at TV-Guide, though
he has previously admitted to paying up to Dollars 1bn too much for the
magazine and its handful of sister publications. Circulation, once 18m, is
now under 15m, because of increasing competition from newspaper listings
sections. Mr Murdoch seems determined to return to the wider magazine
business eventually, but it is too early to say whether it will be from
acquisition, launches or a mixture of both.
Twentieth Century Fox. As Mr Murdoch talks, outside in the sprawling studio
Sean Connery is hard at work on The Rising Sun, a Dollars 40m thriller set
against a background of total Japanese economic domination of the US. He has
high hopes for it; but the studio has had a thin summer. A Dollars 20m film,
Prelude To A Kiss, passed without notice, and a new release, Buffy and the
Vampire Slayer, is not setting the world alight. The autumn and winter
should be better, however. The studio's upcoming films are Home Alone II:
Alone in New York (it will cost Dollars 40m this time, because sequels are
always more expensive Mr Murdoch says); Hoffa, the story of the missing
Teamsters union boss, starring Jack Nicholson; Toys, with Robert Williams;
and Last of the Mohicans, starring Daniel Day Lewis. Sean Connery and The
Rising Sun will follow.
Fox has ramped up its production from about eight films a year to more than
20 and has been bringing the average cost down. Joe Roth says that every
year the studio makes pictures for a few million dollars less on average.
This is done by choosing less star-driven vehicles; and by being careful
about action films  - blowing things up costs money. Last year Fox's average
cost for a film negative  - before the costs of promotion and distribution
 -was Dollars 23m. This year it is Dollars 21m compared with an industry
average of Dollars 26m-Dollars 28m.
Mr Murdoch says that one of the things you have to do at a film company is
say no to people who want to spend money. 'I'm accused of being a gambler,
but you like to know some of the odds. You also like to know what your bet
is. You don't like to bet Dollars 40m and find you've bet Dollars 60m,' he
says.
Mr Roth thinks Rupert Murdoch will stay in Los Angeles running Twentieth
Century Fox as long as it stays a challenge. 'At most he's at mid-point on
the curve,' he says. Mr Roth still decides what films the studio makes, but
he has started feeding Rupert Murdoch scripts as part of the educational
process.
'Rupert will end up shaping this as any owner would  - not so much by his
taste as by his dis-taste,' Mr Roth says.
It is already starting to happen. Mr Murdoch is clearly discouraging the
studio from making certain kinds of films: the very expensive, very violent
sort.
He says he would not have made the film Basic Instinct  - 'It has no
redeeming qualities at all, no one you wanted to like '  - even though he
knew it would probably be a success. By contrast, he talks enthusiastically
about a Clint Eastwood film he saw a few evenings before  - a bit too much
killing maybe but a very satisfying film; terrific cinematography; a bit
slow moving but very well acted.
Will Rupert Murdoch ever become an archetypal Hollywood studio boss? 'No,'
he says: 'I'm just getting into it too late in life to learn all the tricks.
But you can apply some issues of taste, some issues of economics.'
As he talks it is clear that he is as content, both professionally and
personally, as perhaps he has ever been. Los Angeles reminds him of home in
Melbourne. 'I'm even buying a sailboat I used to sail in Australia but I was
too mean to buy a boat in London for the three week summer. It's a return to
the Pacific, if you like. My garden is full of gum trees and eucalyptuses
and its an open new society in the way that a lot of Australian cities are.'
'The things that would get me out of here (Los Angeles) are never going to
happen,' he says  - though he does not write them off without a note of
wistfulness. 'If the Washington Post were to be up for sale . . .' he says,
before adding quickly: 'but there's not a one-hundredth of a per cent
chance.'
What if Rupert Murdoch were to fall under a bus? Three years ago he
nominated Andrew Knight, executive chairman of News International and former
editor of The Economist as his chosen successor for the interregnum if he
died before his children were old enough to take over. 'I have nothing to
add to that or to alter it in any way except that the children are older,'
says Mr Murdoch.
His daughter Elizabeth is working as a programme manager at KTTV, the Fox
station in Los Angeles. James who is about to go to Harvard is working on
the set of The Rising Sun, and Lachlan, who is at Princeton, is interested
in journalism. 'They are going to have to prove themselves but they are
going to be lucky and have that opportunity,' says Mr Murdoch.
Then he jumps up to show the visitor his 'war room', a neighbouring office
with an enormous wall-chart, a jigsaw of the television week. Each network
has pieces of a different colour and there is a piece for each show.
Once, the room was used by a former studio boss for afternoon assignations
with actresses. Now, Rupert Murdoch moves the pale blue Fox network pieces
around his jigsaw, trying to make Thursday night as successful as
Wednesdays.

ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss power engineering group, said
consolidated pre-tax profit in the first half fell 7 per cent to Dollars
496m but forecast that the pre-tax result for the year would reach 'about
last year's level' of Dollars 1.05bn.
'To date, ABB has not experienced any upturn in demand in the recessionary
markets and no improvement in demand is expected in the second half of this
year in the industrialised countries,' the group said.
However, ABB has continued to take in large orders at a rapid pace, notably
from developing countries for power generation plants. In the first half,
the value of new orders totalled Dollars 17.1bn, 18 per cent higher than in
the first half of last year and bringing the group's order backlog at June
30 to Dollars 30.3bn.
However, total revenues grew only 2 per cent to Dollars 13.8bn as the demand
for standard products for industry and construction as well as capital goods
stagnated or turned weaker. Revenues from western European countries were
flat at Dollars 8.1bn and down 13 per cent in North America to Dollars
2.3bn.
Earnings from the power plant division rose while those from environmental
control products and systems declined. The group said earnings from the
other business segments changed only slightly, indicating that margins had
been preserved.
In North America, gains from restructuring were more than offset by lower
sales volumes and prices. Earnings were down in the Nordic region. Earnings
in Germany, Italy, Switzerland and most Asian countries improved.
BBC Brown Boveri, the Swiss group which holds 50 per cent of ABB, said its
consolidated pre-tax profit for the half-year after deduction of third party
interests was SFr344m (Dollars 277.4m), 7.5 per cent lower than in the
comparative period. Revenues were up 5.7 per cent to SFr19.9bn. The board is
proposing to split the bearer and registered shares five for one and to
convert the participation certificates into bearer shares. The latter will
dilute present shareholders' voting power.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is selling the bulk of its test and
measuring equipment business to John Fluke, the US electronic testing
company, in exchange for cash and an unspecified number of additional
shares.
Philips holds a 7.5 per cent stake in Fluke, based in Everett, Washington.
The two companies have a product development and marketing alliance under
which each has sold the other's test and measuring equipment (T&amp;M) in their
home markets since 1978.
'It has become apparent to both companies that a unified management
structure, aligned under a single mission, would accelerate our growth and
success,' said Mr Bill Parzibok, Fluke's chief executive.
With the deal, Fluke will return to the European theatre after its five-year
hiatus with a full sales, production and service operation. The Philips
units will add some Dollars 125m to Fluke's annual sales of roughly Dollars
240m, making it the third largest player in the world market after Hewlett
Packard and Tektronix.
Philips will retain T&amp;M operations in Belgium (power supplies), Denmark
(professional TV testing units) and Sweden (timers and counters). It refused
to quantify the annual sales of these units but said 550 of its existing T&amp;M
employees would remain after the transfer to Fluke.
Philips declined to put a firm price on the transaction or reveal the exact
number of additional Fluke shares it would take. It insisted the deal was
contingent on due diligence and shareholders' approval but said it would
remain a minority shareholder. Both companies expect the deal to be
finalised by November.

equity base

<TEXT>
MEASURES have been taken to bolster the shrunken equity base of Rothschild
Bank, the Zurich affiliate of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons in London.
A source close to the bank would not reveal details of the operation, but
said the bank's total capital, after write-downs, was now in excess of the
SFr197m (Dollars 158.8m) shown in a June 30 balance sheet.
Last month, the bank revealed that a recent credit review had found that
some loans were not fully covered and so it quadrupled its provisions in the
year to March 31 1992 to SFr99.8m and dissolved its SFr63.5m in hidden
reserves.
Since then, a former senior executive has been arrested in connection with
his activities at the bank, and it was confirmed earlier this week that the
bad loan total was higher than that indicated in July.
Among the bank's known bad loans were those to the troubled York-Hannover
property group, whose Coutinho Caro subsidiary in Germany filed for
bankruptcy last week. The York-Hannover loans also exceeded the Swiss
Banking Commission's regulations limiting the amount a bank can lend to a
single client.
The source said the bank planned to make a full statement on its affairs
around September 7, after the current restructuring was approved by the
Swiss Banking Commission.
Rothschild Bank is controlled by the family interests of Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild. Rothschilds Continuation Holdings, a
Swiss company, owns 51 per cent of Rothschild Bank. The ultimate group
holding company of Rothschild Continuation is Rothschild Concordia, a Swiss
vehicle of Sir Evelyn's family.
However, Sir Evelyn's cousin, Lord Rothschild, does not have an interest in
the Swiss bank, nor does his insurance business, J Rothschild Assurance.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL, the German tyre company which has spent much of the past two
years fending off the approaches of Pirelli of Italy, yesterday reported a
sharp jump in first-half profits but said its results were still
unsatisfactory and held back by low prices.
The company said pre-tax profit totalled DM119m (Dollars 85m) in the first
six months against DM31.5m in the same period of 1991, a rise of 277 per
cent.
It said all activities turned in improved results. In the first half of
1990, Continental had profits of DM100m.
Its Continental, Uniroyal and Semperit tyre brands in Europe experienced a
marked rise in profits, mainly as a result of replacement business.
ContiTech, the non-tyre products subsidiary, was able to raise profits.
The group said business with car companies still suffered from heavy
pressure on prices, further burdening a result which was unsatisfactory.
Tyre and components companies have long complained that car manufacturers
have squeezed prices for equipment on new vehicles. Some tyre concerns have
also gone in for price cutting to raise market share.
Turnover in the period was 8 per cent higher at DM4.9bn. Tyre sales in
Europe were 12 per cent higher at DM2.5bn, partly because of the inclusion
of Nivis of Sweden for the first time. ContiTech's turnover was 4.5 per cent
higher at DM1.2bn. General Tire, at which the group took a heavy loss last
year on the closure of a Canadian plant, achieved an unchanged turnover in
dollars but this emerged as a 1.2 per cent decline to DM1.05bn in German
currency terms.

WOLTERS KLUWER, one of the Netherlands' biggest publishers, reported a 39
per cent rise in first-half net profit to Fl 109m (Dollars 69m) from Fl 78m
and has upgraded its forecast for full-year net earnings.
The 9 per cent increase in first-half turnover to Fl 1.15bn, was spread
evenly across its geographical areas of operation.
Wolters Kluwer operates mainly in Europe and the US, and is active in legal
and medical publishing, as well as in the scientific, business and
educational markets.
Costs rose at only half the rate of income. The operating result jumped by
41 per cent to Fl 180m, compared with the Fl 128m achieved during the same
six months last year.
It attributed roughly half this increase to recent acquisitions, the largest
of which was Ipsoa, the Milan-based leader on the Italian tax and legal
publishing market bought last year.
First-half net profit included after-tax extraordinary income of Fl 8.3m.
Wolters Kluwer expected a 20 per cent rise in net profit over the Fl 214m
achieved in 1991, corresponding to a 19 per cent rise in net earnings per
share on a fully diluted basis.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hoechst slides 19.8% to DM1.1bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOECHST, the German chemicals and drugs group, yesterday blamed price
pressure, rising costs and the weak dollar for a 19.8 per cent slump in
first-half profits. Plant closure costs and other structural measures had
also depressed the result.
Group sales, up 3 per cent by volume, rose only 1 per cent to DM23.4bn
(Dollars 16.7bn) because of a 2 per cent overall reduction in prices.
The fall in pre-tax profits to DM1.1bn followed a 20.3 per cent slump in
1991 earnings. The group said it hoped to avoid further reductions in the
second half by implementing rationalisation measures.
It also hoped improving market conditions would allow it to raise prices.
Hoechst's results fell mid-way between analysts' expectations, while
Monday's announcement from its Leverkusen-based competitor, Bayer, of a 9.8
per cent reduction in first-half profits was better than forecast.
The companies' figures suggest that Bayer is pressing ahead faster with
cost-cutting. The Hoechst workforce was 2 per cent lower than a year earlier
at 179,000 people. So far this year it has unveiled plans to cut a further
600 staff. Bayer had trimmed numbers by 3.5 per cent compared with last
year.
Bayer's distribution costs rose 4.5 per cent compared with 5.5 per cent at
Hoechst.
According to Hoechst's shareholders' notice, published yesterday, there had
been no fundamental change in the chemicals business.
Although sales in North America had improved 10 per cent - 2 per cent of the
rise coming from recently-acquired Great Lakes Carbon - German demand was
slack and European Community sales had improved only slightly.
Conditions continued to worsen in eastern Europe.
The only bright spot was pharmaceuticals, where encouraging developments
recorded in the first quarter continued with the help of the new market in
eastern Germany and new product launches.
Sales rose almost DM400m to DM5.4bn in spite of the effects of the weak
dollar.
The chemicals and pigments division was helped in the first half by brisk
business in organic chemicals in the US, but not enough to prevent a fall in
sales to DM5.46bn from DM5.6bn last time.
Deliveries of plastics and foils, the third biggest division after chemicals
and drugs, also rose, but results were hit by 'wholly unsatisfactory
prices', the company said.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: MAN improves despite weakness
abroad

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAN, one of Germany's biggest engineering groups, managed a 3 per cent net
profit increase last year in spite of continuing weakness in overseas
business, which accounted for 64 per cent of sales, and fading demand in the
domestic market.
Total sales rose only DM140m (Dollars 100m), about 1 per cent, to DM19.2bn.
Turnover from core interests in trucks and buses, diesel engines, rotary
printing presses and plant construction rose DM900m, but the gains were
eroded by a DM600m fall in sales of engineering products, including
sheet-fed presses, and a DM200m decline in steel trading.
Net profits rose about 3 per cent to DM12m, net return on sales was up from
2 per cent to 2.2 per cent, and the company said yesterday that it intended
to maintain its dividend at DM12 a share.
The group added that current orders of DM16.8bn - more than half in the most
profitable business sectors - provided a 'good basis for profits' in the
current year.
However, it noted, there were no detectable signs of recovery in export
markets. At the end of June, its foreign order book was down 10 per cent
compared with the same time last year.
Domestic orders were 6 per cent lower.
New delivery contracts for heavy vehicles suffered from falling demand in
the former GDR during the year, and totalled DM7.2bn compared with DM9bn.
However, the company said, demand was still stronger than in 1989-90, the
last 'normal' year before unification.
MAN reduced its workforce last year. The 2 per cent cut, mainly on printing
equipment and other engineering divisions, took numbers employed to 63,250.
The workforce in the commercial vehicle subsidiaries rose 1,000.
The group invested a record DM1bn, mainly in its vehicles and printing
factories.
Orenstein &amp; Koppel, the building and mining equipment maker, has returned to
the black with a DM7m pre-tax profit in the first half of this year,
compared with a DM19m loss last time.
O&amp;K, part of Hoesch, the steel and engineering group recently taken over by
Krupp, increased sales 9 per cent to DM865m, and cut 600 jobs in the period
under review.

HENKEL, the chemicals, cosmetics and household products group bucked the
sector's downward trend in the first half of this year with a 3 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to DM388m (Dollars 277.1m).
The recently-acquired Swedish Barnangen cosmetics business contributed four

Excluding acquisitions, sales rose 3 per cent.
The group said European sales, excluding Germany, grew 23 per cent in the

ISCOR, South Africa's largest steel producer, suffered a 44 per cent decline
in profits in the year to June after being hurt by weak export prices and a
depressed local market.
Attributable income was down to R346m (Dollars 126.2m) from R624m in the
wake of a R170m rise in financing costs to R403m. Turnover advanced by 16.6
per cent to R8.6bn from R7.4bn, but pre-tax income fell to R748m from R874m.
Earnings per share declined to 18.5 cents from 33.4 cents and the dividend
was cut to 6 cents from 11 cents per share.
The results were in line with market forecasts, but the shares fell
yesterday to close at a new low of 98 cents.
Iscor registered a 22 per cent increase in export volumes which rose to 53
per cent of total steel sales. But this was offset by an 8 per cent fall in
dollar export prices and a fairly firm rand-dollar exchange rate.
Domestic steel sales also fell 5.1 per cent to a 15-year low. Total tonnage
sold rose by 7.7 per cent to 6.04m tonnes.

CATHAY Pacific Airlines, the international airline subsidiary of Hong Kong's
Swire Pacific group, unveiled a 13 per cent increase in net profit to
HKDollars 1.26bn (USDollars 163.6m) in the six months to June 1992.
The results were below analysts' expectations, emphasising the impact of the
recession in major destinations, such as the UK, and the price war among
rival Asian airlines. The corresponding figures for 1991 had been hit by the
Gulf war.
A spokesman, defending the figures, said: 'The airline industry worldwide is
in economic disarray.'
The yield per passenger kilometre fell by 2.3 per cent, indi-cating downward
pressure on ticket prices.
The company was confident it could achieve improved results for the full
year, but earnings growth is expected to be single digit, since passenger
yields are unlikely to improve in the near-term.
Inflation also remains a problem, although the focus on boosting
productivity has helped keep unit costs stable.
Net finance charges were up sharply in the six months to June, due to the
purchase of new aircraft, and declining interest income from surplus funds.
Turnover rose 11.5 per cent at the interim stage, to HKDollars 10.98bn.
Earnings per share rose by 5.1 cents to 43.9 cents, and Cathay held its
interim dividend at 10.5 cents.

ASCII, Japan's biggest independent software company, is being bailed out by
a group of banks after diversification into films and other media left it
struggling to repay borrowings.
Six institutions led by the Industrial Bank of Japan are providing some
Y12bn (Dollars 96.1m) to cover the redemption of Swiss franc convertible
bonds due next March. Some funds have already been advanced, and the company
said yesterday that the loan package should be tied up by the end of the
week.
It would not confirm reports that the deal provided an additional Y3bn in
immediate operating funds.
Ascii had Y1.23bn pre-tax profits in the year to March on sales of Y34.5bn.
It has been hit by the Japanese economic slowdown this year, soon after
expanding from its computer publishing and software base into film
production and multi-media.
IBJ is said to be considering a management presence at Ascii to help put the
company back on course.

PIONEER International, the Australian building materials and petroleum
group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in net profits to a record
ADollars 179m (USDollars 127m) for the year to the end of June. Turnover was
down 6 per cent to ADollars 5.1bn.
The result was in spite of difficult trading caused by recession in its main
markets in Australia, the UK and included a net abnormal profit of ADollars
5.7m.
This was created by a ADollars 63.7m profit on the sale of the group's
shareholdings in the Ampolex and Oil Search exploration companies, offset by
a ADollars 58m write-down of non-current assets. Pioneer said this year was
likely to be 'one of the most challenging we will experience'. There was
evidence of an end to the recession, but tangible signs of recovery were
elusive.

WHARF (Holdings), the flagship listing of the empire founded by the late Sir
Yue-kong Pao, announced a HKDollars 900.8m (USDollars 116m) net profit for
the first half of 1992.
The company has changed its year-end from March, and the results represent a
12 per cent increase on the six months to September 1991.
The company also signed letters of intent yesterday for a Yn10bn (USDollars
1.83bn) infrastructure project which will transform the city of Wuhan in the
industrial heartland of China. It includes a containerisation terminal, air
cargo retransportation centre, modernised and expanded rail links and power
supply, and substantial property development.
Wharf's interim results held few surprises. Increased earnings came
primarily from a 10 per cent boost in rental income from its Harbour City
development, and container terminal operator Modern Terminals also showed
strong growth.
But 1992 will be a year of consolidation for the group, before a substantial
increase in the size of its property portfolio comes through in 1993.
Wharf is operating a property rental portfolio of 7m square feet. Within two
years, this will more than double, with the Times Square and Gateway Towers
developments in Hong Kong and Lane Crawford Place in Singapore due to be
completed by the end of 1994.
There was an extraordinary profit of HKDollars 57m from the sale of
long-term investments. The directors recommended an interim dividend of 16.5
cents, up from 14.5 cents in 1991.

DAF

<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicles maker in which British Aerospace holds a
16 per cent stake, will today disclose significant losses for the first half
of 1992, although lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.
The latest financial setback, which has driven the DAF share price to a
record low in recent days, comes amid mounting speculation in The
Netherlands that the group is holding discussions with Daimler-Benz, which
could possibly lead to the German automotive and aerospace group taking an
equity stake in DAF.
Dutch television said last night Daimler-Benz was considering taking a
substantial minority stake in DAF, and that an eventual full takeover was
not ruled out.
A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz and
the world's biggest truck maker, denied the Dutch TV report and said no
talks were going on at present with DAF.
DAF, which is expected to repeat today that it is still interested in
collaboration with other commercial vehicle makers, refused to comment on
the Dutch TV report last night.
A spokesman said, 'We always talk to everyone in this business. That is the
nature of the automotive industry, but we do not comment on speculation.'
The AP-Dow Jones news agency reported last night that an unnamed senior
official from the Industriebond FNV, a Dutch union confederation had
confirmed that DAF and Daimler-Benz had 'been talking very seriously for
some time'.
DAF plunged deeper into loss last year with a net deficit of Fl 394.5m
(Dollars 212m) compared with a loss of Fl 228m a year earlier. It has been
hit hard by the severity of the recession in the UK, its main market, where
truck sales have fallen to the lowest level since the early 1950s.
The group said last month that it was close to completing negotiations to
secure loans of Fl 200m from a Dutch and a Belgian bank in an effort to
strengthen its balance sheet.

MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and health group,
yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in equity accounted net profit of
ADollars 143.7m (USDollars 102.1m) for the year to the end of June.
The result included abnormal profit of ADollars 54m before tax, largely
reflecting the sale of its cross-shareholding in Amcor, the Australian
packaging and paper group.
Net operating profit after minority interests but before abnormal items was
down 3.2 per cent to ADollars 99m on turnover down 4.4 per cent to ADollars
2.8bn, reflecting the Amcor disposal.
Mayne Nickless said the result was 'steady' in the light of poorer trading
conditions.
An unchanged final dividend of 17.5 cents per share, fully franked, was
declared, making a total of 35 cents, equivalent to 34.7 cents adjusted for
a one-for-five February rights issue.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VARITY, the US diesel engine, farm and industrial equipment group, returned
to profitability in the second quarter but will continue rationalisation
because of the uncertain global economic climate.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, attributed the turnround to lower costs, better
results from Massey Ferguson farm equipment, strength in Kelsey-Hayes, the
car parks division, and foreign exchange gains.
'We are lowering costs in all our businesses and we'll get the benefit when
demand improves.'
For the three months to July 31, Varity, based in Buffalo, New York, earned
Dollars 14.1m, or 37 cents a share, the first profitable period since the
fourth quarter of 1990. A year earlier it posted a loss of Dollars 7.6m, or
49 cents a share. Sales were Dollars 891m in the latest quarter, against
Dollars 830.5m.
First-half profit was Dollars 11.7m, or 10 cents a share, against a loss of
Dollars 44.9m, or Dollars 2.16 a share, a year earlier. Sales were Dollars
1.7bn, against Dollars 1.5bn.
Massey gained from a weaker US dollar and increased market share in Britain,
France and the US while Perkins, the UK diesel engine builder, saw lower
operating income, although sales were higher in both periods. It was hit by
Europe's slowdown.
Kelsey-Hayes' sales and earnings rose about 7 per cent in the second
quarter. First-half operating income was Dollars 64m on sales of Dollars
774m, against Dollars 47m on sales of Dollars 659m last time. It is a leader
in anti-lock braking systems and recently won a Dollars 100m order from
Opel, of Germany.
'We don't see any sign of recovery in Europe. Kelsey-Hayes will see only
modest US car industry growth for the rest of the year.'

PWA, the parent of Canadian Airlines International, is to receive a CDollars
150m (USDollars 126m) cash injection from the sale of its three remaining
Airbus 310 aircraft to the federal government.
PWA will use CDollars 100m to repay debt on the five-year-old aircraft and
CDollars 50m to bolster working capital. The money will give the airlines
breathing space while it tries to negotiate an alliance with American
Airlines or other deals to ensure its survival.
The company has turned down a share exchange offer from Air Canada and is
negotiating an equity injection worth nearly CDollars 200m from all its
employees.
It says it is still negotiating the sale of CDollars 45m of spares for the
Airbus aircraft, made idle by the recession last autumn.
In July, PWA asked Ottawa and three provinces for loan guarantees, saying it
had been driven near to bankruptcy by heavy industry over-capacity and fare
wars with Air Canada. Ottawa then said it might buy the Airbus aircraft on
certain conditions, including merger talks with Air Canada. These talks
failed earlier this month.
Ottawa will use the 310s to replace Boeing 707s now operated by the Armed
Forces.

HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader and bus and coach builder which is fighting a
hostile bid from T Cowie, claimed that Cowie had won acceptances from
holders of only 1 per cent of its shares.
Henlys had served Section 212 notices, which are intended to discover the
beneficial owners of shares, on Monday and received a reply on Tuesday which
said that holders of 387,000 shares had accepted the offer.
Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief executive of Henlys, has said
that he will accept the bid for his 7 per cent stake.
On Tuesday afternoon Cowie bought 1.14m shares in the market at 73p,
equivalent to 3 per cent of Henlys shares. Sellers included Mercury Asset
Management, which sold 300,000 shares, Universities Superannuation Scheme,
selling 250,000, and Eagle Star Insurance and Scottish Equitable, which each
sold 100,000.
The final closing date for the bid is Tuesday. The share prices of the two
companies were unchanged yesterday. With Cowie at 120p its all-paper bid is
worth 84p a share or Pounds 31.8m for the company, while the partial cash
bid values Henlys at 80p a share or Pounds 30.3m.
Henlys share price remains well below those levels at 65p.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Midland encouraged to lift small business
lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK will be encouraged to increase its lending to small businesses,
a senior executive of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation , its new
owner, said yesterday.
The plan is to alter Midland's lending practices so that managers place less
emphasis on a potential borrower's collateral before deciding whether to
make a loan.
UK banks have in recent years been forcing small business borrowers to
mortgage both their business assets and private assets as a condition of
making a loan.
Instead Midland managers will take more account of a business's financial
projections in deciding whether to make a loan and will not insist that a
loan is backed 100 per cent by collateral.
Such a change would be welcomed by the small business lobby.
There is no intention of encouraging Midland to exploit Hongkong Bank's
strong balance sheet by lending at a rapid rate.
On the other hand, Hongkong Bank wants to reverse the trend of the past 18
months during which Midland has reduced the volume of loans on its balance
sheet.
'We did not buy Midland in order to see it continue shrinking,' the
executive said.
Separately, Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, said that the
parent company's main office would be moving to 10 Lower Thames Street in
the City of London.
The building on the north bank of the Thames is also occupied by Samuel
Montagu, Midland's merchant bank.
A number of trading operations are leaving the address, creating space for
the parent company's offices. However, most of Samuel Montagu's staff will
remain there.
Mr Purves said the move was a sign of his intention to give Midland's top
management considerable independence, since he would not be occupying
Midland's architecturally noted head office at Poultry, also in the City.
Meanwhile it emerged that Hongkong Bank's commitment to reduce the ratio of
Midland's costs to its income was a long-term aim. Over the next four to
five years, it wants this ratio to fall from its present level of just over
70 per cent (excluding the Thomas Cook travel business) to 60 per cent.
Hongkong Bank is keen not to create concern among Midland's employees that
draconian redundancies are in the offing.
A Hongkong Bank executive also said that the bank may have to make a further
loan loss provision against its Dollars 768m (Pounds 386m) exposure to
Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property developer which has sought bankruptcy
protection.
On Tuesday, the bank disclosed that it had made a Dollars 188m provision
against the O&amp;Y loan.
If the value of the security held against this loan does not rise, the bank
could be forced to make a further provision of similar size at the end of
the current year.

claim
</HEADLINE>

   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Takeover Panel yesterday showed some concern over a point made by
Trimoco, the motor trader, in its defence against a Pounds 25.9m hostile bid
from Hartwell.
Mr Roger Smith, Trimoco's chairman, recounted in the defence document how
two Hartwell executives had been invited on to Trimoco's board early this
year on the basis that Hartwell's parent, the Saudi Arabian Jameel group,
would reduce its stake in the company, which then stood at 23.5 per cent.
The Jameel stake has since been increased to 39.4 per cent, with the help of
loan stock conversion.
The Panel yesterday raised questions about Trimoco's suggestion that the
bidder had gone back on an agreement and the way this had been reported in
newspaper articles.
Mr John Wei, chairman and chief executive of Hartwell and one of the two who
spent a few months on Trimoco's board, has denied that there was any such
agreement.
It is understood that Hartwell has spoken to the Panel about statements made
in Trimoco's defence.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Substituting new lives for old - Philip
Coggan looks at the restructuring trend of split capital trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU NEVER give me your money, you only give me your funny paper'.
Shareholders in split capital investment trusts may be tempted to hum that
Beatles refrain at the moment as they contemplate the spate of
restructurings in the sector.
Instead of being wound up at the agreed date - with the proceeds returned to
shareholders - trusts are prolonging their lives, with new securities being
substituted for old.
The trend raises the question of whose interest is really being served by
these restructurings. It is obviously to the advantage of the managers that
the trust continues to exist, since they will continue to receive their
annual fee. Paid members of the board have a clear interest in a continuing
salary. But what about the shareholders?
The issue has been brought into focus by the failed attempt to restructure
Yeoman Investment Trust. Yeoman scrapped its proposals yesterday when two
institutional shareholders with 48 per cent of the income shares decided to
vote against the deal.
Split capital trusts were devised by the investment trust sector as a means
of increasing their investor appeal. Conventional investment trusts have
just one class of share, offering investors a mix of income and capital
growth.
By splitting a trust, the managers can more closely target investor needs.
Early splits created two classes of shares. One received all the trust's
income - and so could offer a high dividend yield which appealed to retired,
income-seeking investors. Another was entitled to all the capital growth
achieved by the trust, after the income shares were repaid - and so appealed
to higher rate taxpayers who wanted to use up their capital gains tax
allowance.
More sophisticated structures have been developed, involving zero coupon
preference shares, which pay no dividends but have a set future repayment
value. Returns made on these shares are taxed as capital gains, not as
income - giving attractive tax advantages to many investors.
Split capital structures also deal with a perennial problem of the
investment trust sector - the discount. Shares in conventional investment
trusts normally trade at a discount to their net asset values - generally
acknowledged to a function of limited investor demand for the shares.
The tax advantages of splits create additional investor demand. Furthermore,
split capital trusts have a limited lifespan - and thus investors know that
the trust will eventually be repaid at asset value. These two factors limit
the discount - and indeed enable many split trusts to trade at a premium to
their asset values.
But the prospect of trust restructurings may create problems for some
private investors. Suppose you had built an investment plan on the basis of
an expected trust wind-up date. You could have bought, say, an annuity and a
zero coupon share with the same maturity date. The annuity pays an income
stream during its life but has no value on maturity; however, at that point,
the zero is redeemed and replaces the original capital invested in the
annuity. Such a neat scheme might be ruined if the trust is not wound up.
However, it would be wrong to suggest that a restructuring will necessarily
be bad news for investors. After a number of years of dividend growth, an
income share will probably be paying a very high yield - which the private
investor might find impossible to match elsewhere. 'In most cases, it is in
the interest of income shareholders to perpetuate the income stream',
according to Mr Lewis Aaron, an investment trust analyst at Warburg
Securities.
And Mr David Thomas, of Greig Middleton, the broker which has been behind
several recent restructurings such as Fulcrum and St David's, points out
that restructurings have to be approved by 75 per cent of shareholders - a
built-in safeguard. Shareholders are hardly likely to approve of deals which
leave them worse off.
Nor does Mr Thomas see any problems with the idea of restructurings. He
argues that one simply needs to look at these trusts on a discounted cash
flow basis. If interest rates are 10 per cent, then it should make no
difference to a shareholder whether he is offered 110p next year or 100p
today.
There are difficulties, however, in restructuring a trust so that
shareholders in all classes of shares are getting a good deal.
Restructurings can accordingly be complex affairs, leaving the average
private investor bewildered by the deal on offer.
In the case of Yeoman, for example, the capital shares were to be replaced
by zero dividend preference shares and the repayment value of the income
shares - 100p this year - was to be reduced to 50p in 1999.
One small shareholder wrote to the Financial Times: 'The value of the income
shares is to be reduced by 50p, said to be recovered by enhanced income at
each pay-out. Yet this is to cover a period when it is likely that dividends
will remain low . . .Are we being made fools of?'
Much the same point was made by Orion Insurance, an institutional
shareholder with 24 per cent of the income shares. When it said it would
vote against the proposal, Yeoman offered to place its shares in the market.
Yeoman yesterday blamed 'adverse market conditions' for its failure to do
that. It now looks highly likely Yeoman will be wound up when its life
expires.
Such problems can probably be avoided in future if shareholders can be
offered money, instead of 'funny paper'.
Warburg Securities' Mr Aaron says 'these deals need to be structured so
there is a cash exit for all classes of shareholders.'
M&amp;G takes a similar view. Offering cash means that all shareholders can be
satisfied: those who want the trust to continue and those who do not.
Perhaps the fatal flaw in the Yeoman deal was that the income shareholders
were not offered a cash alternative.
Given the number of split capital launches over the last few years, Yeoman's
failure to win shareholder approval could be a useful lesson for trust
managers planning restructuring deals in the future.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wentworth warning on dividend payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WENTWORTH International Group said yesterday that it was unlikely it would
be able to pay a dividend for the year to March 31. Last time it paid 0.1p.
Mr Robert Gill, chief executive and acting chairman of the USM-quoted
plastic packaging products group, said the board was examining past
accounting practices which he described as 'sharp' and 'at the cutting
edge'. He expected that 'material' provisions would have to be made.
He cited Mr Terry Smith's book Accounting for Growth, and said that the
board was looking at areas such as the capitalisation of interest, fair
value accounting, the charging of consultancy fees to acquisition targets
and the capitalisation of acquisition costs.
Mr Gill said Wentworth would not score nought out of 12 against Mr Smith's
criteria, but would score higher than its shareholders might want.
Mr Gill joined the group, which is 62 per cent owned by Banque Indosuez, six
weeks ago, replacing Mr Haque Khan, the chairman and chief executive who
retired early at the end of July.
Mr Gill said he was 'the prime mover' behind the examination of the
accounting practices, but that Banque Indosuez was 'highly supportive'.
The board comprises Mr Gill, three non-executives from Banque Indosuez, Mr
Tim Palmer, the finance director since 1990, and, also since 1990, Mr Simon
Davies, the group development director who is responsible for the
preparation of the group's accounts.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Value Trust seeks to raise Pounds
14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH VALUE Trust, the investment trust which was formed in a revamp of
the shell company Bremner, is raising Pounds 14.2m via a placing and open
offer.
The trust acts as an arbitrageur in the investment trust sector. It buys
shares in trusts which are standing at a discount to their net asset values
and where there is a potential for gain as a result of a reorganisation or
change in investment policy.
Scottish Value achieved a net asset value total return (including reinvested
dividends) of 31.1 per cent in the year to July 31, compared with a 4.9 per
cent fall in the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. The trust's
shares were trading at a 4 per cent premium to asset value before trading
opened yesterday. Normally, only trusts which trade at a premium can raise
extra capital. The share offer has an unusual structure. Existing
shareholders are being offered units at 100p each on the basis of 15 units
for every 24 existing shares.
These units will entitle investors to receive shares at a price to be
determined later, but which will effectively be equal to the prevailing net
asset value. To the extent that shares are not taken up by existing holders,
they will be placed with institutions.
The trust also declared a second interim dividend of 1p, payable on October
16. The new shares will not be entitled to receive the dividend and the
trust will not pay any further dividends in respect of the current financial
year to September 30.
The shares closed last night down 1p at 59 1/2 p.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant retail side behind WH Smith rise
27% to Pounds 113m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR SIMON Hornby, chairman of WH Smith Group, said he was not expecting any
cyclical recovery in the company's retail markets in the current financial
year.
However, he said the pace of benefits from Smith's pursuit of scale
economies and systems was increasing.
Sir Simon was reporting on results for the year to end-May which showed a 27
per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112.7m.
Despite the recession, the group's retail chains - which sell newspapers,
books, stationery, recorded music and videos - increased sales by 10.8 per
cent to Pounds 1.3bn, while sales of its distribution activities - news,
office supplies and books - rose 8.1 per cent to Pounds 905.9m.
Sales in its DIY joint venture fell from Pounds 214.2m to Pounds 209.8m.
Sir Simon said the group had increased market share in virtually all its
retail businesses.
He said the recent reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the
newspaper distribution industry would not cover magazines, which was the
growth area of the market. Smith's magazine sales rose 10 per cent in the
year.
The MMC would look at the relationship between newspaper publishers and
wholesalers for the first time.
Although the office supplies market was down 9 per cent Smith's sales were
up 10 per cent.
Sir Simon said this business would become 'a major cash producer' and had
won 67 new accounts worth Pounds 12m a year. A new distribution centre was
being built.
A rights issue last year and sales of peripheral businesses had prompted a
Pounds 146.7m fall in net borrowings to Pounds 85.2m - 20 per cent of
shareholders' funds of Pounds 435.4m, up Pounds 185.6m. Interest charges
were down from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 3.4m.
Profits also benefited from a Pounds 9.2m pension credit. However, this was
down from Pounds 11.2m the year before and Mr John Napier, finance director,
said the credit could be expected to dwindle over the next few years.
Sir Simon said that capital expenditure of Pounds 67m had been financed from
internal resources and spending of Pounds 65m in the current year would be
too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bisichi Mining yesterday announced a planned retail property disposal,
together with unchanged profits for the first half to June 30.
It is selling its interest in a investment property in Leeds for Pounds
250,000 to London Associated Investment Trust, which holds a 40.7 per cent
stake in Bisichi. The disposal reflects a change in the two companies joint
ownership policy.
The proceeds will go some way to satisfying the costs of the acquisition,
completed earlier this week, of 11 retail units and a public house on a half
acre site in Burnley, Lancashire, for Pounds 790,000 cash.
A further contribution is the Pounds 194,000 proceeds from the sale in May
of Bisichi's holding in an Australian gold mining company.
The company announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 78,000 and static
earnings of 0.55p per share. Gross income was Pounds 189,000 (Pounds
214,000).

Earnings per share emerged at 4.2p (3.9p) and the interim dividend is

Sleepy Kids, the USM-quoted co-producer of Potsworth &amp; Co and other
animation and character merchandising, incurred an increased pre-tax loss of
Pounds 109,000 for the six months to April 30, against Pounds 62,000.
The outcome this time was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 69,000
representing a provision against income receivable from Hanna-Barbera.
The company also said it planned to raise up to Pounds 301,000 in a private
placing. A maximum of 4.3m new ordinary shares will be placed at 7p per
share by Shaw &amp; Co with a limited number of institutional and other
investors.
Turnover fell to Pounds 80,000 (Pounds 110,000) and there was an operating
loss of Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 91,000). Losses per share came through at
0.55p (0.38p).
Sleepy Kids has exercised an option for a sole and exclusive worldwide
licence for the intellectual property rights (excluding certain book rights)
over the Budgie character, already well known from the children's books
written by the Duchess of York.

Friendly Hotels suffered a Pounds 445,000 profits fall to Pounds 908,000
pre-tax for the 24 weeks ended June 14.
Directors said, however, that recent business had improved and that a
'substantial part' of the profit was made in the closing weeks of the
interim period.
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.2p and if expectations are realised
for the remainder of the year, the final will be increased - shareholders
received a 5.5p total previously.
The 33 per cent profits downturn came on the back of fairly static turnover
of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 12.8m). Basic earnings per share emerged at 2.1p
(5.9p); fully diluted the figure was 4.3p (6.4p).

SHARES OF Mallett, the London antique dealer, dived 17p to 35p on news that
the company had run up losses of Pounds 485,000 pre-tax for the half year to
June 30.
The interim dividend is omitted - 1.5p was paid previously - and payment of
a final will be considered at the year-end.
The loss, which compared with profits of Pounds 680,000, was struck from
turnover some Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 3m.
Directors said conditions had been as 'difficult as at any time since the
war, not helped by the present high exchange rate of the pound against many
world currencies, particularly the dollar'.
Costs had been reduced via a 20 per cent staff reduction since the year-end
and from the closure of the Motcomb Street premises and the transfer of the
business to the main New Bond Street premises converting office space to
retail showrooms.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wace falls 29% as competition bites - DTI
inquiry may 'raise doubts' for potential new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTENSE COMPETITION in commercial printing and higher interest costs reduced
pre-tax profit at Wace Group by 29 per cent, from Pounds 7.86m to Pounds
5.55m, in the first half of the year.
The decline in operating profit from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 10.1m stemmed
mainly from the UK printing side of the business, which accounted for about
a third of the Pounds 156.5m (Pounds 148.3m) turnover. Mr Frans ten Bos,
chairman, said pre-press work had fared better, particularly in the US.
Mr ten Bos took on executive responsibilities following the resignation of
Mr John Clegg as managing director in January.
The Department of Trade and Industry has since been investigating share
dealings in the names of some of Mr Clegg's relatives. Wace reiterated that
it had nothing to fear from the investigation.
Meanwhile, Mr ten Bos acknowledged that the inquiry might raise a doubt in
the mind of a potential new chief executive. None has yet been recruited,
although he said the group had no need to rush into the appointment.
UK operating profit slipped to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 6.81m) on Pounds 79.2m
(Pounds 77m) turnover. One commercial printing subsidiary lost Pounds
500,000. 'Some competitors were quoting at less than the cost of materials,'
he said. More than 1,000 printing companies had gone out of business last
year and 'a hell of a lot more will go to the wall this year'.
Label printing and packaging had done well, but work related to advertising,
publicity and mail order had suffered.
In the US, operating profit rose 55 per cent to Pounds 3.65m. 'Last year we
had a few bleeders. That has been stopped, said Mr ten Bos. On the
Continent, growth in Germany and Italy helped operating profit to reach
Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 2.11m).
Interest charges rose to Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 3.41m) and net debt at the end
of June rose from Pounds 80.4m to Pounds 90.6m, giving gearing of 125 per
cent.
Mr Stephen Puckett, finance director, said this was partly caused by Pounds
3.3m of earn-out payments made in cash. Another Pounds 4.3m was satisfied in
shares. Cash-flow would be positive in the second half.
Earnings per share fell to 2.9p (5.2p). The interim dividend is maintained
at 2.25p.
COMMENT
These results showed the resilience of the pre-press business and reflected
well on management action to eliminate losses. Although the group will
remain slightly cash negative this year, stability seems to have been
achieved with the tailing off of earn-outs. Reducing the debt will depend on
progress in disposing of the Pounds 64m property portfolio, which can hardly
be a rapid process. After a seasonally better second half, full-year pre-tax
profit is forecast to reach Pounds 15m, giving a prospective p/e of 10 on
yesterday's close of 90p. Although the dividend payments (including the
preference shares) were not covered by profit in the first half, the betting
is that the final will be maintained to offer a yield of 12 per cent. The
yield on the convertible bonds is about 18 per cent. While the stock is not
without its attractions, the DTI inquiry, the weak dollar and the chief
executive lacuna act as a drag. And some risk remains because of high debt
and exposure to the UK media sector.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pioneer International up 9% to
record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIONEER International, the Australian building materials and petroleum
group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in net profits to a record
ADollars 179m (USDollars 127m) for the year to the end of June. Turnover was
down 6 per cent to ADollars 5.1bn.
The group said the result was in spite of difficult trading caused by
recession in its main markets in Australia, the UK and the US.
The result was struck after including a net abnormal profit of ADollars
5.7m. This was created by a ADollars 63.7m profit on the sale of the group's
shareholdings in the Ampolex and Oil Search exploration companies, offset by
a ADollars 58m write-down of non-current assets. Pioneer said this year was
likely to be 'one of the most challenging we will experience'. It added
there was evidence of an end to the recession, but tangible signs of
recovery were elusive.
However, the group said it expected to benefit from the federal government's
budget announcement that its programme of public works would be expanded by
ADollars 1.2bn to ADollars 4.5bn over the next two years.
At the operating level, profits from petroleum activities were flat at
ADollars 187.7m because of a fall in demand and a reduction in refinery
margins, exacerbated by a change in the pricing formula applied by the
Australian regulatory authorities.

<TEXT>
MAYNE Nickless, the Australian transport, security and health group,
yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in equity accounted net profit of
ADollars 143.7m (USDollars 102.1m) for the year to the end of June.
The result included abnormal profit of ADollars 54m before tax, largely
reflecting the sale of its cross-shareholding in Amcor, the Australian
packaging and paper group.
Net operating profit after minority interests but before abnormal items was
down 3.2 per cent to ADollars 99m on turnover down 4.4 per cent to ADollars
2.8bn, reflecting the Amcor disposal.
Mayne Nickless described the result as 'steady' in the light of poorer
trading conditions which had put pressure on prices and margins in spite of
generally steady volumes.
Revenue increased nearly 9 per cent by the acquisition of Metropol Security
Services, Interlink Express, a UK parcels company, and full ownership of
Hospital Corporation Australia .
The board said reduced earnings from Australian express freight activities
were offset by improved contributions from healthcare businesses, express
freight in the UK and security services in the UK and Canada.
European earnings jumped 150 per cent before interest and tax to ADollars
29m, sparking an increase of 80 per cent in non-Australian earnings to
ADollars 46m.
An unchanged final dividend of 17.5 cents per share, fully franked, was
declared, making a total of 35 cents, equivalent to 34.7 cents adjusted for
a one-for-five February rights issue.

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN appealed yesterday for a 72-hour ceasefire in Afghanistan where two
weeks of fighting in Kabul between the rebel Hezb-e-Islami faction and the
mujahideen government have killed more than 1,800 people, Reuter reports
from Kabul.
Relentless exchanges of artillery and rocket fire have pounded the capital.
Hundreds of people streamed out of the city during a lull in the
bombardments yesterday.
Pakistan called for the ceasefire to start from noon today. There was no
immediate reaction from the Afghan factions.
The appeal came as Afghanistan's vice-president and an all-party group
prepared to set up a base outside Kabul to hold peace talks between
dissident mujahideen and embattled President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Polish and Yemeni diplomats had earlier left Kabul by road for Pakistan,
abandoning hope for an early truce.

FT  27 AUG 92 / News Corp profit soars 65% to ADollars 531m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media group, yesterday
underlined its return to robust financial health by announcing a 65 per cent
increase in net profit to ADollars 531m (Pounds 196m) for the year to the
end of June.
The result, in line with market expectations, confirms that News Corp has
dramatically improved profitability since completing a USDollars 7.6bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) refinancing in February last year.
News Corp said revenue fell by 7 per cent to ADollars 10.2bn, reflecting the
sale of assets worth ADollars 2.4bn, used to make early repayments of debts
scheduled under the group's refinancing agreement.
The group said the 'outstanding' result was due to stronger performances
from its UK and Australian newspapers, together with its television and
free-standing inserts businesses in the US.
News Corp also benefited from falling interest rates, which cut the cost of
servicing debt by 20 per cent to ADollars 932m.
The main disappointments were the Twentieth Century Fox film business, which
suffered from three expensive failures, and Ansett Transport Industries, the
50 per cent-owned Australian aviation group suffering from low prices in a
recently deregulated market.
News Corp said it lost ADollars 56.8m from equity accounted investments,
mostly reflecting losses at Ansett and BSkyB, the 50 per cent-owned UK
satellite television business.
However, the group said BSkyB had moved into profit in March, 16 months
after its loss-making Sky service merged with the rival British Satellite
Broadcasting.
News Corp said operating profits before interest and tax rose by 2 per cent
to ADollars 1.6bn, reflecting stronger margins and the effects of group
cost-cutting.
Net profit fell to ADollars 502m after abnormal losses of ADollars 29m.
These losses reflected rationalisation costs and the closure of a German
newspaper, offset by a profit on the sale of the group's 55 per cent
interest in its Australian magazine and commercial printing operations.
The group made a net loss after abnormals of ADollars 393m in the previous
year, after taking account of abnormal losses of ADollars 714m caused by
refinancing fees and losses on the disposal of assets.
At the operating level, US profits fell to ADollars 880m from ADollars 1bn
the previous year, mainly reflecting the sale of eight consumer magazines
and a newspaper in June 1991.
The group said Fox Broadcasting, its television network, achieved 21 per
cent growth in ratings. TV Guide performed 'well' in spite of a downturn in
consumer advertising. However, HarperCollins, the publishing division,
reported flat results, following cuts in public education funding.
UK profits increased 93 per cent to ADollars 382m, reflecting the stemming
of BSkyB losses and a 28 per cent increase in profits from the group's five
national newspapers.
In Australia and the Pacific Basin, profits fell from ADollars 332m to
ADollars 328m, reflecting the sale of the commercial printing interests.
However the group said its metropolitan newspapers performed 'exceptionally
well'.
The South China Morning Post, in Hong Kong, made a record profit.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Murdoch plans Dollars 1bn debt offering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS CORPORATION plans to raise about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in long-term
public debt in the next few months, write Ray Snoddy in London and Kevin
Brown in Sydney. The decision, a further step in the rehabilitation of the
world's third largest media company, is designed to replace short-term bank
loans.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times
during an interview in Los Angeles that he planned to sell in the medium
term its 50 per cent holdings in Ansett Transport Industries (Ansett) which
operates one of Australia's two domestic airlines and Ansett Worldwide
Aviation Services (AWAS), an aircraft leasing company.
He said the shares 'have been a source of profit when we needed it, but they
do not fit a media company'. That is the first confirmation of speculation
that News Corp's long-term strategy excludes continued investment in the
troubled Australian aviation businesses.
News Corp said last month Mr Murdoch would step down as joint chairman of
Ansett. However, News Corp has previously denied it planned to sell its
stakes in Ansett or AWAS. Both companies are co-owned with TNT, the
Australian transport group.
Mr Murdoch said three major merchant banks had asked to raise the new
long-term debt.
'We'd have to negotiate the rate, but they say Dollars 1bn to replace bank
debt is no problem,' said Mr Murdoch.
Mr Murdoch said the long-term finance plan was part of a strategy to escape
restrictions by a consortium of banks in return for rolling over debt of
more than Dollars 7bn.
'Right now, anything over Dollars 50m, I have to go and get permission from
the banks. We certainly plan to be out of that box in the next several
months,' Mr Murdoch said.
He said he hoped to win investment rating from the financial community for
the first time.
Mr Murdoch stressed that he intended to see the company through the strains
of airline de-regulation in Australia.
'This may take two or three years. I would see eventually a third partner, a
major international airline coming in at some stage and then we might go
out,' Mr Murdoch said.
He added that the same applied to Ansett Worldwide, the airline leasing
business.
Ansett has been in financial difficulties since the deregulation of
Australian domestic aviation in October 1990.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Toyota Motor suffers 40% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA MOTOR, Japan's biggest automotive group, suffered a 39.7 per cent
slide in worldwide pre-tax profits to Y427.9bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for the year
to June as a fall in domestic car demand was compounded by foreign exchange
losses and the cost of new domestic and British outlets.
It was the second successive year of decline and Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, its
president designate, said yesterday he expected no significant upturn in
1992-93.
Although Toyota remains the most profitable private sector company in Japan,
the performance was its worst since the present group was created through
the merger of its manufacturing and sales arms 10 years ago. Revenues were
3.1 per cent ahead at Y10,163bn, passing the Y10,000bn mark for the first
time.
The company sold 4.51m vehicles during the year, down by 26,674 units, but
margins at Toyota and its consolidated component suppliers and marketing
offshoots were severely squeezed, and group operating income fell 56.3 per
cent to Y218.5bn.
Mr Toyoda said rationalisation measures had saved the company Y40bn during
the year. This was more than offset, however, by Y56bn in extra depreciation
charges. Toyota is building plants in northern and southern Japan and at
Derby in the UK, and its accounting system loads such outgoings to the
units' early years.
The company also took Y100bn exchange losses due to the weaker dollar. In
its US pricing, Toyota would 'closely observe what other companies do', said
Mr Toyoda, but he suggested the Japanese domestic market could not at the
moment absorb price increases.
The company would further review its product range at home, perhaps placing
more stress on affordable lines.
For the Japanese parent company alone, pre-tax profits of Y375.9bn were down
34.6 per cent. Although sales rose 4.4 per cent to Y8,941bn, operating
margins shrank to 1.4 per cent from 4 per cent. For the current year Mr
Toyoda, who takes over as president next month, projected a 5.1 per cent
rise in parent sales to Y9,400bn.
Toyota is paying an unchanged dividend of Y19 from parent net earnings per
share of Y53.97, compared with Y97.57.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Advance of 26% to Pounds 113m at WH Smith: Chairman
attributes result to wide diversity of group's activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WH SMITH Group, the retailer and distributor which grew from a newsagent's
shop opened 200 years ago this year, was glad of its wide range of
activities in its latest financial year. Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said
that the breadth gave strength which helped the group increase pre-tax
profits by 26.6 per cent to Pounds 112.7m in the year to end May.
Smith's A shares rose 15p to 376p yesterday as the profit rise exceeded
expectations.
The rise was on sales of Pounds 2.13bn, up 8 per cent. Trading profits rose
7.8 per cent to Pounds 120.9m, and interest charges fell from Pounds 28.2m
to Pounds 3.4m, partly because of the Pounds 148m rights issue at the end of
the previous financial year.
Sir Simon said that gross margins had been maintained in spite of
competitive pressures. Productivity had increased.
Profits benefited from the closure last year of its travel business and the
sale of television interests for Pounds 45m. Both operations had been
loss-making.
However, Smith's joint venture in do-it-yourself retailing lost the group
Pounds 2.7m, compared with a profit of Pounds 10.4m. Sir Malcolm Field,
group managing director, said that progress had been made in developing a
new format for the stores. Smith had been forced to join the 'insane' price
cutting in the sector to protect market share, he said.
Aside from DIY, Smith's retailing activities, which include the WH Smith
chain, Our Price music and video shops, Waterstones book shops, and a 50 per
cent stake in Virgin Retail, increased trading profits from Pounds 87.8m to
Pounds 89.8m. Sir Simon said the market for recorded music fell 5 per cent,
but Smith had held its market share. He was sure the market would recover.
The group's US retailing activities were 'beginning to go forward very
well', Sir Simon said. Trading profits from the US were Pounds 6.5m, up from
Pounds 4m.
The distribution activities, including newspaper and book wholesaling and
office supplies, lifted trading profits from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 29m. A
sharp fall in the rate of tax offset the increase in shares in issue to push
earnings per share up 11.7 per cent to 31.5p. A proposed final dividend of
9.1p (up from 8.5p) will give a total of 13.4p (against 12.5p last time) up
7.2 per cent.

FT  27 AUG 92 / GRE cuts loss in first half to Pounds 39m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the composite insurer, yesterday reported that its
loss before tax had been reduced to Pounds 39m from Pounds 88m for the six
months ended June 30.
Losses on mortgage indemnity, which are triggered by house repossessions,
doubled to Pounds 16m, while the recent IRA bomb in the City of London
accounted for another Pounds 10m of losses.
The interim dividend was cut to 2.5p from 4.4p. Mr Sid Hopkins, chief
executive, said the full year dividend would be at least in line with last
year's total of 7p.
Underwriting losses in the UK, which accounts for half of the group's
general insurance underwriting book, were reduced by Pounds 55m to Pounds
125m, while the US and South Africa were back in the black with profits of
Pounds 1m.
Investment income fell to Pounds 133m from Pounds 142m because of property
write-downs and foreign exchange translations. About 40 per cent of equity
investments are protected through an insurance policy.
Mr Hopkins said: 'We are very pleased with the trend. But we do not want to
be lulled into a false security. Anything can happen, including another
hurricane.
'We will continue to increase premiums to reflect increases in our product
costs.'
Household theft claims in the UK rose 9 per cent to 25,000 and subsidence
claims in the second quarter rose to 2,124 from 1,902.
Underwriting losses fell from Pounds 38m to Pounds 9m because of the mild
weather and a fall in subsidence costs. However, premiums are expected to
rise by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.
Underwriting losses from motor insurance fell from Pounds 47m to Pounds 19m.
The number of cars insured by the company declined by 75,000 to 600,000.
During the past three years, the the number of cars insured by GRE has
fallen by more than 300,000 because of competition and a decision to
increase the premiums of high-risk categories, such as younger drivers.
Mr Hopkins said he was considering direct writing in the UK on the lines of
that offered by the company's Irish subsidiary, the new PMPA.
Car thefts in Germany pushed the underwriting loss there up Pounds 12m to
Pounds 28m.
The loss per share fell to 5.6p from 11.1p. The solvency ratio at the end of
June was 42 per cent compared with 43 per cent.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Coal fund allows managers to choose 'sweet equity'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIN Management, the company set up to manage the pension scheme of the coal
industry, allows the managers of its venture capital fund CIN Venture to
invest in projects alongside pensioners while choosing only the most
lucrative part of each deal.
The practice is approved by the trustees of the pension scheme, including
representatives of the National Union of Miners and is not uncommon among
venture capital fund managers, according to industry experts.
It emerges in a document circulated by one of CINVEN's rivals. CIN's venture
capital managers are permitted to use their own money to invest in the same
deals as pensioners but may restrict their funds to the highest yielding
'sweet equity' of each deal, avoiding the lower yielding loan stock.
Advisers who help investors find venture capital funds frown on the
practise.
'Taking just the sweet equity has its dangers and it reduces the returns to
investors. On the good deals, it bites in a lot,' said one venture capital
adviser. 'But the worst is the double-dip, where the manager gets sweet
equity plus carried interest.'
CINVEN, unlike most other venture capital fund managers, does not allow its
managers to profit from so-called 'carried interest'. That represents a
share, usually 20 per cent, of all profits earned once a certain rate of
return is achieved, and is usually even more lucrative than co-investment
arrangements.
CINVEN, the UK's second largest venture capital investor, with roughly
Pounds 800m under management, is a bellwether of the industry. It handles
roughly 4 per cent or Pounds 600m of the Coal Board's pension scheme. It
also manages Pounds 120m of British Rail Pension Scheme assets and roughly
Pounds 75m of Barclays Bank Pension Scheme assets.
At CINVEN, fund managers are required to invest along with pensioners in
each deal in equal proportion to pensioners and may not pick and choose
among deals, a CINVEN spokesman said. Fund managers borrow from a single
bank at commercial rates and pledge their shares as collateral. While fund
managers have earned spectacular returns on some deals, such as the recent
management buyout of Taunton Cider, there have been other deals where the
investment has been lost completely.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Review of building contracts proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has proposed an independent review of contract arrangements
in the construction industry after complaints that late payments and other
contract abuses are forcing many companies out of business.
The review would also examine customers' complaints that many contractors
bid low prices to win contracts and then try to boost margins by claiming
additional payments during construction.
A letter to industry leaders from the construction policy directorate of the
Department of the Environment says there is profound dissatisfaction with
existing arrangements.
It proposes an independent review of contractual arrangements, jointly
commissioned by government and the industry. The review, which would cover
public and private sector construction contracts, would be expected to
report next autumn. It would cost about Pounds 250,000 and would be financed
jointly.
The proposal follows complaints that many small and medium-sized
sub-contractors have got into difficulties because main contractors have
delayed payments.
The British Constructional Steelwork Association says more than 100 of its
members and their subsidiaries have ceased trading since 1989. It says main
contractors have been boosting their cashflows by withholding payments to
sub-contractors, in some cases for several years.
The association identifies three main areas of contract abuse:
Late repayment of retention money, held back by developers and main
contractors as insurance against defects emerging after work was completed.
Delays in certifying that work has been completed correctly which would
enable bills to be paid promptly.
Querying bills in the knowledge that sub-contractors will accept a lower
payment rather than risk long delays and potentially high legal costs
pursuing extra money.
Money retained against potential defects, normally worth between 2 per cent
and 5 per cent of the contract value, should be repaid a year after legal
completion of work, according to the association. 'One of our members had to
wait five years for repayment because of a dispute over what constituted
legal completion,' it said.
The Environment Department said yesterday that there was deep concern about
the adversarial nature of contract relationships in the construction
industry. The review would be the first commissioned by the government since
the publication 30 years ago of the Branwell Report into construction
contract practices.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Bosnia peace hopes rise after sanctions threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, IVO DAWNAY and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations and European Community were last night close to winning
agreement on two major documents that could form the basis for bringing
peace to the Balkans, including Bosnia-Hercegovina.
This emerged after the first day's intense negotiations behind closed doors
at the London conference on the former Yugoslavia. The conference, sponsored
jointly by the UN and EC, opened as the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
suffered the most intense mortar attacks and gun battles in more than a
month, with at least six people killed.
EC diplomats said that if the two documents were accepted by all the
republics of the former Yugoslavia, this could pave the way for discussions
on the foundations for a future constitutional arrangement for Bosnia.
The first document, a Statement of Principles, says all sides involved in
the bitter ethnic fighting in Bosnia, and all the other republics, must
accept the principle of the inviolability of borders.
The second document, an Action Programme which was last night accepted in
principle by all the feuding sides, will set up six working committees once
the London conference ends later today. The committees, among other things,
will try to promote a constitutional settlement for Bosnia, as well as
seeking a long-term solution to the region's ethnic minority problems.
The Statement of Principles stipulates that all sides must guarantee human
rights, condemn forcible deportation, allow the safe return of those
deported from their homes and stop seizing territory.
EC diplomats said last night Serbia was still reluctant to agree to this
document. But Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the rump Yugoslav
federation, said he would try to persuade other Serb leaders to accept it.
Mr John Major, prime minister of Britain, which holds the EC presidency,
warned that Serbia would face more isolation if the Belgrade government did
not take steps to stop the fighting in Bosnia.
Attempting a 'carrot and stick' approach, he promised to speed
reconstruction aid and integration into the international community of those
who co-operate with the peace process. But he added in a clear reference to
Serbia, that it faced 'economic, cultural, political and diplomatic
isolation' if it failed to act.
The day included diplomatic posturings by Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan
Karadzic, who briefly stormed out in protest at his observer status.
British and EC officials, meanwhile, said the conference was close to a
formal agreement on the planned expansion of the UN force in Bosnia so that
troops could guard convoys taking food to the civilian population.
Canada announced yesterday it would send 1,200 troops to support such an
operation. Britain last week said it would contribute up to 1,800 troops and
Italy and France are among other nations who have already pledged
contributions.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Swedish interest rates up to 16%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S central bank raised its lending rate yesterday by 3 percentage
points to 16 per cent to defend the krona and stem a rapid outflow of
capital.
Bankers expressed doubts, however, that the increase would be enough to
resolve the country's economic difficulties and calm the financial markets.
They said concern about the Swedish minority government's perceived
inability to carry out its tough economic policy had not gone away. Hopes of
a broad-based economic agreement between the government and the opposition
remain slight.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, in an interview with the Financial Times,
said there was no reason for the government to change its economic policies
or introduce new spending cuts to contain a growing budget deficit.
The non-Socialist government was last night making informal soundings on
negotiating a broad agreement with the main Social Democratic opposition on
measures to restore financial confidence. But Mr Bildt said he 'doubted'
this would lead anywhere, while Social Democrat leader Mr Ingvar Carlsson
said there were 'no conditions for co-operation' if the government stuck to
its existing policies.
Both sides agree there should be no devaluation and the fixed exchange rate
of the Swedish currency should be maintained. They also want the krona to
shadow the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System as soon
as possible.
There was a sharp difference of opinion between Mr Bildt and the central
bank yesterday. The premier said he found it 'difficult to understand' what
had been happening on Swedish markets in recent days with the huge outflow
of capital, soaring short-term interest rates and plummeting stock market.
He blamed the financial troubles mainly on international factors.
But Mr Bengt Dennis, the central bank governor, disagreed. 'The key to low
interest rates lie in the hands of the government and the parliament,' he
said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs that Mr Rupert Murdoch is getting itchy inside the
straitjacket imposed by last year's refinancing. Asset sales mean the
repayment schedule is undemanding until 1994, but plans to raise Dollars 1bn
from the debt market suggest a degree of impatience. On the basis of
yesterday's full-year figures, however, News Corporation looks fully able to
deliver earnings growth without a big move.
The performance of newspaper titles in the UK and Australia is perhaps the
most impressive feature. With costs pared and capital expenditure already in
the bag, the group should be well placed for any upturn in advertising
spend.
The same might be said of BSkyB: at the very least the project is no longer
draining cash at the operating level. The scale of losses at Ansett are more
disappointing - and are likely to remain a drag on earnings unless a serious
buyer steps forward.
On the basis of yesterday's figures, Ansett's attractions are difficult to
pinpoint. With a third domestic Australian airline due to take to the skies
next month, margins will doubtless come under renewed pressure. But events
are now unfolding in News Corp's favour. An effective tax rate of 4 per cent
will rise as tax losses run out, but only to perhaps 10 per cent in the
current year.
Servicing the debt pile cost ADollars 238m less than a year ago, thanks to
lower interest rates. Given the potential for growth, a prospective multiple
of around 11 times this year's forecast earnings is undemanding. But the low
tax charge and the debt makes it less clear that the company deserves to
trade on much of a price earnings premium to the market.

The most intriguing passage in yesterday's interim statement from GRE
underlines the vulnerability of life company bonus rates. It is easy for the
market to take cheap shots at GRE's investment record. The reality is,
though, that its place at the bottom of most performance tables can in part
be explained by a more prudent actuarial approach.
Declining investment returns and pressure for more generous surrender values
suggest that competitors cannot possibly sustain the level of policyholder
rewards they achieved in the 1980s. Precious few of them have fully
acknowledged that the days of easy returns seem to be over.
GRE still has some sorting out to do on the life side - but the message of a
much reduced first-half loss is that at last the company is getting to grips
with general insurance. The mild UK winter has helped and Germany remains a
blot.
On the other hand, there is ample evidence in the UK private motor and
household accounts of a willingness to sacrifice market share in the quest
for renewed profitability. The delayed impact of UK rate rises means the
rebound could be quite sharp next year.
In the short term that prospect and the absence of serious mortgage
guarantee exposure underpins the shares, which have outperformed the market
and other composites this year by 17 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.
Longer term, though, GRE has to prove that once the process of loss
elimination is complete, its UK operation is a quality business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WH Smith's full-year profits show the benefit of last year's rights issue
and a handily reduced tax charge. That said, the good news is not restricted
to the financial side of the business.
The defensive strengths of the core retailing and distribution operations
shine through, and it is heartening to hear that better management
information systems are being extended into Our Price records and
Waterstone's booksellers. The hope must be that this will allow staff
productivity and stock control to continue to improve across the group. Even
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into newspaper
distribution seems unlikely to undermine Smith's profits.
However, there are bad points, and a picture of WH Smith as a well-run core
business which squanders money on diversifications is not entirely unfair.
The latest problem child is the Do It All joint venture with Boots. This
suffers from a weak market position relative to rivals Texas and B&amp;Q, and
the 'shed' price wars which have been such a feature this year. Some
rationalisation is now under way, but it is difficult to see Do It All
differentiating itself sufficiently from the competition to overcome its
inherent weakness.
Fortunately, though it may continue to be a drain on earnings, it is
difficult to see the DIY arm becoming a threat to the group. Even after
yesterday's rise, the shares look reasonable value against the sector.

FT  27 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: An interest in equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It must be obvious after yesterday - if it were not obvious before - that
the government will not shrink from raising interest rates to defend the
pound. The exact timing of any such move is anyone's guess, and will depend
on how long Mr Lamont can continue calling the market's bluff. The question
for investors is whether an increase in rates is already reflected in the
price of shares.
Equities are probably braced for a rise approaching 1 percentage point in
the next few weeks. Prices might dip on any such announcement, but if a
single rate rise and intervention turned out to be enough to lift sterling
off its ERM floor and hold it stable, equities could conceivably rally. The
risk is that one rate rise might not be enough.
If sterling were still under pressure, rates mights have to rise again, in
which case earning prospects would be really squeezed. History suggests that
it can take more than a single interest rate rise to smother a full blown
sterling crisis.
With another lurch in the dollar or further anti-Maastricht French opinion
polls still a real possibility, there are more uncomfortable days to come.
The current clash is primarily between a strong mark and a weak dollar, and
sterling - along with other ERM currencies such as the franc and the lira -
is caught up in the backwash. That is not a position from which it is
sensible to make short-term decisions.

The fayre at Simpsons, the famous City watering hole, has been the same for

However, a group of dissident shareholders is threatening to spoil things at

rebel diner Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments.
Unfortunately, he and his chums haven't banked on the City's appetite for

Customers like nothing better than to be reminded of school lunches by the
'eat what you're given' attitude of Simpsons' staff. Managers of the

Economists at Midland's Greenwell Montagu and James Capel have more than a
mere sterling crisis to worry about. With the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation's takeover of Midland Bank, a battle of the titans is shaping up
to sort out who becomes top dog.
In the blue corner, smooth-talking Roger Bootle, head of Greenwell Montagu's
economic squad. In the red, Keith Skeoch, his level-headed rival at James
Capel. The destinies of several nervous underlings hang on the outcome.
Since both chief economists are highly regarded by their City colleagues,
Observer suggests a good starting point is to compare their forecasts for
growth this year. In January the James Capel team forecast that the economy
would grow by 2.0 per cent and Greenwell Montagu forecast growth of 0.9 per
cent. The consensus now is for a contraction of 0.5 per cent.
On present form, Bootle seems the favourite.

The fall of sterling has taken on added significance in the Dorset resort of
Lyme Regis, where, in counting his day's takings from holidaymakers, a
market proprietor dropped two Pounds 1 coins on the stone floor. One bounced
markedly less than the other.
Although both looked genuine, the impact chipped the yellow surface of the
non-bouncer, revealing grey metal beneath, which turns out to be lead. A
further check of the takings discovered a second coin of similar sort.
Both are convincingly moulded with milled and inscribed edges and turn the
market scales at the same weight as the genuine article - three-eighths of
an ounce.
What profit the forgers have left after production costs can only be guessed
at. But, given the effects of wet weather as well as recession on Britain's
holiday trade, the proprietor is regretting having to hand the coins to the
police. He has already had bids for them from curio collectors of Pounds
1.20 a piece.

Will the chancellor's hurried appearance on the steps of Her Majesty's
Treasury go down as one of those memorable occasions, like Denis Healey's
decision to turn back just before he got on a plane to the IMF meeting
during the 1976 sterling crisis?
It was very much a last-minute decision. It is not the first time that the
chancellor has made impromptu statements. He often pops out of his home at
Number 11 to give his thoughts on the economy. But standing in front of the
Treasury is much more dramatic. It is one thing for the Minister of Fun to
make reassuring public appearances. But is it really necessary for the
chancellor of the exchequer to stoop to giving soundbites of this sort?  You
would never catch a central banker giving such hostages to fortune.  But
then he's not a central banker.
In terms of his timing he cannot be faulted. If you are going to say
something, it is best to say it first thing in the morning. Then people have
all day to think about it. However, opinions of Lamont watchers are mixed.
One thought he had done the right thing. Another said he wouldn't have
recommended it. The markets are looking for actions not words. The TV
archives now have plenty of material for 'Lamont's last stand'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Foreign Affairs: Not Kuwait, but . . . - While the Balkan
case differs from that of the Gulf, there is no excuse for western inaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the Balkan case differs from that of the Gulf, there is no excuse for
western inaction
'Too bad Bosnia's got no oil' was the headline on a recent editorial in the
Catholic weekly, The Tablet. It encapsulates an argument now fashionable
among western liberal idealists. Last year, the argument says, western
governments were ready to take military action to restore the sovereignty of
Kuwait. Their failure to defend Bosnia shows they are guilty of double
standards.
Western governments can hardly complain. They asked for it by recognising
Bosnia-Hercegovina on April 7, and sponsoring its admission to the UN. A
month earlier, an FT editorial had warned that 'independence for Bosnia will
be meaningless unless the territorial integrity of the republic can be
guaranteed': an unfulfilled, and perhaps unfulfillable, condition.
The Yugoslav People's Army, as it then still was, was encamped in force on
Bosnian territory, with large quantities of heavy weapons. Many of its
officers and men were drawn from Bosnia's Serb population, which formed
nearly a third of that of the republic. The great majority of Bosnian Serbs
had boycotted the referendum on independence. Many were clearly ready to
fight rather than obey an independent government that did not include their
own leaders.
Of course those leaders were influenced by the government in Belgrade, and
could expect support from it. But even had that not been so - even if there
had been no Serbian 'interference' in the new state's affairs from the
moment its independence was proclaimed - the Bosnian government would still
have been unable to control much of its nominal territory against the wishes
of a minority so large, so determined and so heavily armed. Any attempt by
outsiders to help it do so would have meant joining in a civil war.
An additional problem was that, although the Croats (17 per cent of the
population) had voted for independence, they had done so tactically, to get
away from Yugoslavia, rather than because they thought of themselves as
Bosnian. In fact, no Bosnian nationality had previously existed. The Moslems
had been elevated by Tito to the status of a nationality in their own right;
they identified with Bosnia because, once Yugoslavia began to break up into
its component republics, they had no other state to call their own. Yet by
themselves they made up only 43 per cent of its people.
Serbs and Croats between them are 49 per cent, and many Croats want to be
part of Croatia. A majority of the Bosnian electorate might even have voted
for partition, had that proposition been put to them. That would not have
been a solution, since it would have completely ignored the interests of the
Moslems. But an independent Bosnia could only have worked on the basis of
agreement between the three communities.
Oil or no oil, the parallel with Kuwait is false. Kuwait had existed as an
independent state for 29 years before Iraq invaded it. Its sovereignty was
not questioned by any of its inhabitants, and President Saddam Hussein could
not find even a token group of them to 'invite' or support his invasion.
Coming to Kuwait's rescue was therefore a very simple matter politically.
None of that is true in the case of Bosnia. This being so, the EC would have
been much better advised not to recognise that state until an agreement
between the three communities had been worked out. The still unexplained
thing is that it went ahead with recognition while negotiations for an
agreement were in progress, without waiting for their outcome. Stranger
still, it was apparently the US which insisted on recognition, although
earlier it had opposed German pressure for recognition of Slovenia and
Croatia*.
None of the above in any way justifies or excuses the Serb reaction, which
has been to displace the Moslem and Croat population from the greater part
of Bosnia-Hercegovina by a campaign of mass terror. Nor can the Serbian
leadership in Belgrade escape a large share of responsibility for this, even
if the extent to which it directly planned and co-ordinated the crime
remains, for the moment, unclear. Nor yet can the 'international community',
that much-quoted but still elusive phenomenon, wash its hands of the affair
simply because it is so complex.
It makes no difference to assert that atrocities have been committed by all
sides, or that some of the more spectacular mortar attacks on Sarajevo have
been staged by the Bosnian army to arouse international sympathy. Those
assertions may be true, but do not alter the fact that by far the largest
number of victims are Moslem, and the largest number of perpetrators
Serbian.
Bosnia is not Kuwait. But it is perhaps a little bit like Iraq, with its
three unequally matched communities condemned to live together. In both
countries western governments have been reluctant to get involved
militarily, especially with ground troops, for fear of being caught up in an
insoluble communal conflict. In both cases their reluctance has been
partially and temporarily overridden by pressure from public opinion,
outraged on humanitarian grounds, and by alarm at the scale of the refugee
problem. Troops did go into northern Iraq last year to secure a 'safe haven'
for the Kurds; and now troops are being sent into Bosnia to protect
humanitarian convoys.
It might make more sense if the Iraqi precedent were followed more
precisely. There, the ground troops went in for a limited period and came
out again, using the threat of air strikes to deter Mr Saddam from
attempting to reverse what they had achieved; and now a similar threat is
being used to protect the Shia in the south as well. Why not declare an
'exclusion zone' in Bosnia as well? And, rather than expose UN troops to an
escalating conflict in Serb-held territory, why not use western troops, as
in Kurdistan, to secure a 'safe haven' for Bosnian Moslems, who could then
hold it for themselves with a promise of western air cover, while
negotiating with the other communities from a position of relative strength?
Such a policy would encounter the same objection as the one in Iraq: that it
tends towards a fragmentation of the country. That objection would probably
be voiced especially by the Moslems themselves, who (unlike the Kurds) were
scattered throughout the country and therefore have an interest in keeping
it together. Yet the reality is that after what has happened they will not
for a long time, if ever, be able to live with the Serbs as they did in the
past. Even the pro-Bosnian 'Yugofax' magazine admits this, in a telling
report from Sarajevo:
'B-H's ethnic tolerance is rapidly being eroded. It is true that 20 per cent
of Sarajevo's defence forces are still Serb and the majority of Serbs
ignored Karadzic's call for them to attack their neighbours. But those who
did respond have caused so much torment that they have created an anti-Serb
atmosphere which did not exist in B-H even during world war two. For the
ordinary citizen it is hard to grasp that while all Chetniks (extremists)
are Serbs, not all Serbs are Chetniks.'
That being so, the only imaginable future for Bosnia-Hercegovina is one
based on cantons or 'constituent units'. The proper goal of western action,
both military and diplomatic, is a haven or canton large enough for all the
Moslem population to live in.

   From Mr L BELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is almost beyond belief that, in the present state of the UK
economy, the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, should not merely be considering
an increase in interest rates but is actually advertising his readiness to
do so in an attempt to reassure speculators of his determination to beat
inflation.
After examining the devaluations of 1931, 1949 and 1967, Sir Alec Cairncross
and Barry Eichengreen, in their book, Sterling in Decline, concluded that
despite the variety of circumstances, such as terms of trade and behaviour
of money supply, there is little evidence in any of those three episodes
that the immediate gain in competitiveness was quickly extinguished by an
inflation of wages and prices. Mr Lamont might do well to get this book out
of the Treasury library.

Sir, Your article on shift work in Europe ('Cost constraints prompt a
continental shift', August 25) did not tell the full story. LSI Logic's
choice of Germany was wrong from the start: 21-shift working is abnormal
there and shift premiums high. In France and the UK, continuous working is
accepted. And in the UK, 21-shift premiums are lower.
There are limits. In France shift workers may not work overtime. In the UK,
union pressure has meant a move from four shift teams for continuous working
to five or six - bearable costs in capital-intensive industries.
So LSI could have found European locations to rival the US, if not Asia. It
probably excluded the UK for lacking a 'highly skilled workforce'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Government assumption for council tax values faulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JUDY MALLABER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman ('Town Hall 2', August 24) has misunderstood the nature of
the Local Government Information Unit's analysis. This is hardly surprising,
since he has not seen the relevant work.
Our analysis looked at the gap between the government's original estimates
of the 1991 values and the actual valuations that are now becoming known.
But it did not conclude 'that average tax bills would be Pounds 61 higher
than predicted'.
The LGIU recently carried out a survey of a number of local authorities to
find out how the properties in their area had been valued and banded. The
information collected does demonstrate that the actual valuations are lower
overall than the estimates on which the government's illustrative council
tax figures were based.
Our figures are based on the Inland Revenue's valuations. They are supported
by similar research done by one of the local authority associations. The
analysis shows how the government's initial overestimates of values will
lead to higher bills than the illustrative figures, unless additional
funding from central government is forthcoming.
Our conclusion is that these errors in estimating property values have
reduced the overall tax base for council tax. To make sense of how we
reached this conclusion, it is necessary to understand how the tax for each
band is to be calc-ulated.
Council tax will be set for band D which covers properties worth between
Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000 in England, the values for Wales and
Scotland being slightly different. Ratios then determine the tax for the
other bands. For example, the tax for band H will be exactly double band D.
The income which the government assumes a local authority will receive from
council tax depends on the number of 'band D equivalent' properties. The
basis for the illustrative figures produced by the DoE in 1991 was that
councils would 'raise revenue of Pounds 6.8bn from the council tax' and, on
their estimates of the number of band D equivalents, this would require a
council tax for band D of Pounds 400.
Our figures suggest that the actual number of band D equivalents resulting
from the valuations is 13.3 per cent below the DoE's original estimates.
This means that band D tax in England would have to rise to Pounds 461 in
order to raise the same amount of revenue. This is obviously where the
Pounds 61 in the article comes from.
But our figures have nothing to do with 'average bills'. Each band is
affected differently by any rise in band D tax, as the figures of the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy quoted in the article
show. For example, on our figures, a band D tax of Pounds 461 would increase
band H from Pounds 800 to Pounds 923; band A from Pounds 267 to Pounds 308.
These figures were not plucked out of thin air, nor can they be said to be
misleading. They simply result from taking the government's illustrative
council tax figures - using exactly the same assumptions as the DoE in 1991,
with one exception. We adjusted the distribution of properties between the
bands in line with the results of our survey. In fact, our estimate of the
potential tax increase in each band is very modest compared with those
quoted from Cipfa, which showed band D tax going up by Pounds 139 and band H
by Pounds 278.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Letter: Consultants in DTI scheme are capable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MASCALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sarah Hegarty ('Consultancy and fool's gold', August 18) does
considerable disservice to the DTI's Enterprise Initiative Scheme.
I am sure most small and medium-sized enterprises using the scheme have
found that the quality of consultancies reflects not only the quality of the
consultant but also their own commitment to, and involvement in, the
exercise. Any director or manager who thinks he can lie back and be 'cured'
by a consultant will be disillusioned.
Successful consultancy on a smaller scale is a partnership between willing
participants.
The key elements of successful consulting with smaller companies are
painstaking briefing, close collaboration and scaling objectives to the
capabilities of the client. He, in turn, must enter the relationship knowing
that he has to take up the issues raised after the consultant has left.
The selection and management of consultants are, rightly, rigorous. We are
competent and often highly qualified, and deserve better from your
newspaper.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Saving days are here again: Debt repayment, not borrowing,
is the name of the game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The profligate 1980s have given way to the prudish 1990s. History suggests
that after two years of recession, Britain's consumers ought to be ready for
a renewed bout of spending. Instead, they appear increasingly keen to save
rather than spend, rent rather than buy, and pay off debts rather than
borrow.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total domestic demand,
has fallen further and for longer than in either of the past two recessions
of 1974-75 and 1980-81. The hopes of the government, and of many economic
forecasters, for a recovery this year rested on a fall in savings and a
revival in spending. Yet savings remain stubbornly high and the much
heralded post-election spending spree has failed to materialise.
The failure of the UK economy to pick up suggests that the Treasury
underestimated the extent to which high real interest rates, unprecedented
levels of consumer debt and depressed expectations about medium-term
prospects would discourage consumers. A year ago, Goldman Sachs, the
investment bank, forecast that consumption would rise by 1.5 per cent this
year, assuming a fall in net personal sector savings from 10.2 per cent of
disposable income last year to 9.4 per cent in 1992. But savings rose
instead, to 11.5 per cent in the first quarter, its highest level since
1982.
The recession has reversed the past decade's pattern of falling savings and
high borrowing. Net savings (the difference between consumer income and
consumption) fell from 13.3 per cent of disposable income in 1980 to 5.4 per
cent in 1988. But this fall was not matched by a drop in household
investments in financial assets such as deposit accounts or shares. Gross
savings flows into financial assets also fell, but only slightly.
What allowed households to maintain their acquisition of financial assets,
while increasing the proportion of income consumed, was the rise in
borrowing. Gross borrowing rose from 6.5 per cent of disposable income to
16.5 per cent over the same period. Households borrowed to finance their
gross savings and to purchase more durable consumer goods than their current
incomes allowed. Household debt doubled to more than 100 per cent of income
in 1988.
The recession combined with high interest rates have encouraged consumers to
reduce borrowing and pay off debts. The rise in net savings since 1990 is
associated with the sharpest fall in consumer borrowing since the mid-1970s,
as the chart shows. The annual growth of credit extended to households by
banks and building societies reached a peak of 24.8 per cent in 1988 but
fell to 5.8 per cent by the end of last year. The latest consumer credit
figures reveal that outstanding credits, including bank loans and unpaid
credit card bills, but excluding mortgages, fell by Pounds 55m in June, the
first fall this year.
The reasons for this decline in borrowing and consumption are complex. But
the underlying message is not encouraging for those expecting an imminent
pick-up in spending. From statistics and personal experiences (below), three
factors stand out:
Cashflow. Many consumers have cut their spending and decided not to borrow
in order to service their interest payments and avoid losing their homes.
The Bank of England estimates that up to 1m homeowners, one in 10 of
households with mortgages, now owe more to building societies and banks than
the value of their home. More than 180,000 homes have been repossessed and a
further 305,000 mortgage-holders are more than six months in arrears.
Mr David Roberts is caught in this debt trap. Currently battling to meet his
mortgage payments, he is resigned to losing his current house and says he
will not buy another. Nor will he borrow so readily again.
Unemployment. Rising redundancies and the rising threat of unemployment mean
that a much wider group than those facing the immediate threat of
repossession is saving and repaying debts.
The monthly rate of increase of unemployment has fallen in the past few
months. But headline news of the decision by Ford UK to cut production will
nurture the fear that further redundancies are in store.
Mr Chris Poulter typifies the caution of the 1990s. A 23-year-old City
foreign exchange dealer without a mortgage, he is saving rather than
spending and will not run up debts until he is confident that his
medium-term prospects are more secure.
Costly debt. Most consumers are not threatened either by repossession or
unemployment. But the combination of large debts with the highest levels of
real interest rates at this stage in the economic cycle since the 1930s
makes repaying debt a much more attractive investment than saving or
borrowing.
Consider the arithmetic. Paying off Pounds 10,000 in mortgage debt in a lump
sum means a saving of about Pounds 1,000-Pounds 1,100 in interest payments
over the year, equivalent to Pounds 1,300-Pounds 1,470 in pre-tax income.
This implies an after-tax return of 13-14 1/2 per cent. Adjusted for
inflation, the real return is 11-12 per cent.
This compares with short-term real interest rates of a little above 6 per
cent and no real return on investment in housing. So repaying debt makes
sense.
Mr John Williams, a 38-year-old businessman, has no mortgage and does not
face the threat of unemployment. But he is repaying his debts. 'In the past
I would have serviced my bank loans, hire purchase and credit-card debts by
paying off the interest and a minimum amount of the capital,' he says, 'but
now I am only concerned about paying off as much capital as I can.'
One thing he will not do is borrow to buy durable goods. Consumers borrowed
to buy cars and refrigerators in the 1980s when they believed incomes would
keep rising. Now, depressed expectations and high interest rates mean many
people are postponing purchases of durable household goods. The fall in
durable goods spending has been far sharper than in overall consumption, as
the chart shows.
While real interest rates remain high and consumers such as Mr Williams
continue to find debt repayment so attractive, a consumer-led recovery
remains remote. Never has virtue been so rewarded - or so unwelcome.

1990s-style

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WILLIAMS, a 38-year-old businessman, believes there has never been a
better time to free himself of debts accumulated in the 1980s.
A new refrigerator, a better stereo and even new clothes have been foregone
as Mr Williams, who has cut up three of his five credit cards, has made
repayment a priority.
Although he and his wife are in secure jobs and have no children, they rent
a house and do not intend to take out a mortgage to buy property until all
their debts - mainly hire purchase agreements, bank loans and outstanding
credit card bills - have been paid. Nor will they act until they are sure
that house prices have bottomed out.
'I am a great deal less profligate than I used to be. Before I would have
spent money on anything that took my fancy and used my credit cards to pay
for it. Now I don't want to incur any more debt,' says Mr Williams.
ANDREA DIPPLE (right), financial planning manager at a large food and drinks
company, had always wanted to buy her own home. She liked the idea of
decorating it exactly as she pleased, an option that would not have been
open to her had she rented.
Unfortunately, her decision to buy a house in Kent at the end of 1989 has
already cost her Pounds 20,000, not as a result of extensive home
improvements but because the value of the property has fallen from Pounds
64,000 to Pounds 45,000.
'If the privilege of decorating a house as you like it is going to cost
Pounds 20,000, then I think I would rather rent,' she says.
Keeping up mortgage payments is not a problem for Ms Dipple - her salary has
doubled since she bought the house. The real headache is that she has taken
a new job 75 miles away and, at the age of 26, finds herself with a deficit
of Pounds 20,000 and a house she cannot sell.
JOY EVANS and her husband, both retired, sold their Manchester home three
years ago, bought a smaller house and put the difference into a building
society. The fact that their new house has gone down by some Pounds 10,000
in value does not worry them since they do not envisage having to sell it.
Although they have never felt so rich, Mrs Evans says their desire to spend
has been curtailed by worries over the difficulties facing their children,
one of whom has had to let her house in order to meet her mortgage payments.
CHRIS POULTER (right), a foreign exchange dealer at Citibank, has put off
buying a house for more than three years and will probably leave it for at
least another. In the meantime, most of the money he has earned over the
past four years has gone into a building society.
'I haven't bought a car, and I've not had to buy a tv or washing machine,
because the flats I have rented already had them,' he says.
Although he can afford to go out and spend money, Mr Poulter, 23, says he
does not feel particularly rich. With the recession causing job losses
throughout the City, fear of unemployment lurks at the back of his mind.
'My current spending plans are certainly nothing more than my living costs
and a nice holiday every so often.'
DAVID ROBERTS lost his job in a sheet metal manufacturer about two years
ago, since when he has done temporary work. He is now Pounds 12,000 in
arrears on his mortgage and an order to repossess his Stevenage home has
been served. He has reached an arrangement with the building society to
continue paying Pounds 235 a month, rising to Pounds 400 at an unspecified
future date.
In addition to their mortgage problems, Mr Roberts and his wife owe another
Pounds 25,000 on bank and hire purchase debts.
'I used to be able to do what I wanted. If the kids needed a pair of
trainers I could just go and buy them. Now I have to tell them to wait,'
says Mr Roberts. 'We can only afford the basics. I would rather save to buy
something than run up debts again.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Leading Article: German raids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIOLENCE against foreigners which has flared since the weekend in the
east German port of Rostock is an indication of the trials afflicting
unified Germany. Well-drilled gangs of hoodlums, many of them Molotov
cocktail-wielding members of extreme rightwing groups, have mounted nightly
attacks on accommodation for refugees. In some shameful cases, local
townspeople have stood by and applauded. The episodes illustrate the serious
tensions caused by the probable influx of 400,000 asylum-seekers into
Germany during the whole of 1992. Even though many of the thugs in Rostock
came from western Germany, the turmoil shows the inflammable nature of the
social tinder in a region struggling with the passage from communism to
capitalism.
More widely, the unrest underlines the malaise gnawing at the spirit of
consensus which has fostered Germany's postwar stability. Two years ago,
Germany's parliamentary democracy failed to recognise the full extent of the
challenges brought by reunification. Bringing together two unequal parts of
a divided country has seriously strained Germany's economic and social
fabric. The trouble on the north German coast is a further reminder that the
transition still cannot be judged an unqualified success.
On the specific question of asylum, Germany is bearing a disproportionate
part of the burden in Europe caused by widespread immigration from
distressed areas of the former eastern bloc and the third world. Germany
needs to change its constitution - as the opposition Social Democrats have
now belatedly recognised - to stop misuse of liberal asylum regulations
drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war. The problems of housing
and feeding large numbers of people seeking solace from foreign hardship
have tested social security budgets, as well as the patience of even
well-meaning Germans. Many towns have simply run out of hostel space.
The country also needs to tighten policing in the increasingly large areas
affected by outbreaks of xenophobia during the last year. The east German
police, still containing many officers who sustained communist rule for 40
years, lacks authority in many regions east of the Elbe. The Rostock forces
of law and order proved remarkably ineffective this week, although
reinforcements have been rushed to the city to try to forestall the threat
of more attacks in the next few days.
Above all, Germany must try to prevent further worsening of a strained
climate where sections of the population are only too willing to seek
scapegoats for the failures and disappointments of unification. It is up to
German politicians to unite a country which is manifestly still divided,
rather than to indulge in inter-party bickering. If they fail in that task,
the rampage in Rostock will not be the last sign of ugliness along the road
to unity.

WORDS ARE cheap. Deeds may yet be required, however much Mr Lamont may hope
that yesterday's words will prove a substitute.
If so, the chancellor is entitled to curse his luck, for the pound is not
weak. Its trade-weighted effective exchange rate is higher than during the
second half of 1991 and early 1992. The pound is stronger against the dollar
than at any time since February 1991. Before that it had not been close to
Dollars 2 since 1981. The pound is also stronger against the Japanese yen
than at any time since March 1991.
Only against the D-Mark is the pound weak. This problem is shared by many,
both outside the ERM and within it. The difficulty for the latter is that
they may have to do something about it. In the UK's case, yesterday's London
close of DM2.797 was less than two pfennigs above sterling's ERM floor. But
pity the Italians, who are at their floor already.
Will the chancellor's luck change? If this is a crisis at all, it is one
between the dollar and the D-Mark. The question then is whether anything
effective might be done about the soaring D-Mark and the collapsing dollar.
The chances of effective intervention still seem remote. Recent intervention
has had little effect, because many investors doubt whether the authorities
have had their hearts in it. They doubt, in particular, whether the monetary
authorities of the big three economies would allow intervention to override
their domestic monetary objectives.
History suggests two sufficient conditions for whole-hearted intervention by
a major country: that there appears to be no significant conflict between
exchange rate policy and other central domestic goals or that the benefits
of exchange rate stabilisation outweigh the costs to other domestic goals.
Neither condition has yet been fulfilled.
Could things change? They just might. The US authorities do not want dearer
money, but they will also want neither the dollar in free fall nor an
impotent G7. The Bundesbank may be happy about the disinflationary
implications of a strong D-Mark. It may be happy as well about the dwindling
likelihood of European economic and monetary union. But it will not wish to
be blamed for sabotaging either the future of the European Community or the
credibility of the G7.
What if sterling slides to its floor, intervention notwithstanding? Mr
Lamont could then remind his European partners, including the Bundesbank,
that ERM intervention is an obligation upon all. If intervention were to
prove unsuccessful, it is also hardly evident that British policy is out of
line with realities.
Many will agree that the problem lies with Germany. The Bundesbank will do
so too. But instead of lowering interest rates, it may well suggest a D-Mark
revaluation - which would be unacceptable to many, especially the French. If
neither the G7 nor the currency markets come to the rescue, Mr Lamont may
yet have to make good on yesterday's words.

ECOCIDE IN THE USSR
By Murray Feshbach and Alfred Friendly Jnr
Basic Books, 376pp, dollars 29. To be published in the UK by Aurum Press
pounds 19.95
At the end of a recent visit to the city of Cherepovets, 500km north of
Moscow and the site of the largest functioning blast furnace in the world, a
young businessman I had met took me out of town about 10km, through a wood
to a good-sized lake. It was peaceful and still after the din of the vast
steelworks, and fresh after the carbon and sulphur which pollute the town.
A few hundred metres out in the lake, an object rose out of the water. I
said: 'It looks to me like the top of a church.' 'It is,' replied my
companion.' He pointed across the lake. 'There is another': and there was
another tower with an onion dome, poking out of the placid surface.
We were looking at what had been a valley, with villages, flooded in order
to provide a transportation link in a chain of canals which led to the
Baltic Sea. The villages which had been there had simply been covered over.
It was an eerie and desolate spectacle.
A few months before, in another industrial city - Novokuznetsk, in Siberia -
I had felt myself grow nauseous within an hour or two of arrival. Water ran
black from the taps and, by the evening, a thin film clung to my hands and
face. The town was built near another huge steel plant and was itself
surrounded by the slag heaps of coal mines.
On these and other occasions, the question inevitably arises: how can people
live like that; how can they let it happen? To these questions, Murray
Feshbach, a US academic, and Alfred Friendly, a journalist and former Moscow
bureau chief of Newsweek magazine, provide the answers in a well-researched
and frightening book.
The citizens of the former Soviet Union live like that because they have no
choice. Cherepovets and Novokuznetsk are not the worst; and even if they
were, a move to another town would not bring much relief.
How did this environmental catastrophe arise? Feshbach and Friendly make the
now familiar but more than usually well-documented case that it is largely
the product of the idealism released by the Bolshevik revolution and turned
loose upon nature by the grandiose projects of the Stalin period.
'For the environment the central planning system became Frankenstein's
monster. The fatal flaw was not necessarily in the nature of planning but in
the yardstick - gross output - that Soviet planners used to set their
targets and measure their progress . . .
'Most damaging of all to nature, the planning system treated all natural
resources - land, water, mineral deposits and forests - as state property,
virtually as a free good, the cost of which to the user was either minimal
or nil.'
The results have been the sunken villages of Cherepovets and the nausea of
Novokuznetsk; the ruin of Lake Baikal and of the Aral Sea; the high risk of
respiratory illness which threatens some 70m city dwellers; an infant
mortality rate of 33 per thousand, on a par with the third world; and the
constant danger posed by a dozen operational Chernobyl-style reactors.
Dr Grigory Barenboim, an environmental consultant, is quoted as saying: 'We
have become an environmental testing ground for the whole world and an
ecological threat for the entire planet.' The authors themselves say: 'In
the last decade of the 20th century, there are no leading industrial cities
in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life
expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children. The
growth that made the USSR a superpower has been so ill-managed, so greedy in
its exploitation of natural resources and so indifferent to the health of
its people, that ecocide is inevitable.'
Such ecological violence is no longer a secret within the republics of the
former Soviet Union - though it was until the late 1980s. Then a series of
angry liberals - including the late physicist and human rights campaigner,
Andrei Sakharov, and Russian nationalists like the writer Valentin Rasputin
 -put the destruction of their environment in the vanguard of their
campaigns.
As Feshbach and Friendly show, a great many ordinary people, especially
women with children, began to protest spontaneously in the late-1980s, and
almost immediately forced a demoralised Communist party on to the defensive.
It has had an effect. In Cherepovets, for example, the steelworks is
switching to using less polluting coke dust - partly a result of government
tax incentives. Some nuclear powerstations have been shut (contributing to a
shortage of electricity), and Lake Baikal may be saved, due in part to a
vigorous campaign by the Russian environment ministry.
But more has remained unchanged. A 1985 decree which ordered the closure of
ecologically dangerous metalworks in Chelyabinsk and Magnitogorsk has been
rescinded. The metallurgical ministry sent a circular asking the inhabitants
to 'understand the difficult situation in the country' and to 'demonstrate
responsibility and provide help to the nation's economy'.
But, as the authors say, 'demonstrating responsibility means accepting the
prolongation of ecocide'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Copier protection
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT news that the European Commission is thinking of prolonging
anti-dumping duties on Japanese photocopiers is a sad illustration of the
perverse effects of protectionism. For five years, Japanese manufacturers
have been subject to a levy of 20 per cent on copiers exported to the EC. In
those five years, four things have happened. Japanese producers have
switched production to the EC; their share of the EC copier market has
risen; the number of independent EC suppliers has fallen from five to three;
and copier prices in the EC are lower than they were before.
This raises two questions. First, it is not obvious why the three surviving
European manufacturers should seek the continuance of a policy which seems
to have served them so badly in the past. Second, given that the object of
the anti-dumping duties is to make EC consumers pay more for their copiers,
why should they tolerate the reimposition of duties, successful or not?
The policy may prove damaging to the European companies over the longer term
as well. It could be argued that in several markets, not just in the EC,
anti-dumping duties have not only dulled the competitive edge of domestic
suppliers. They have also helped Japanese companies by bringing forward
global strategies which they would eventually have pursued anyway.
A Japanese manufacturer such as Canon - the EC market leader in copiers -
talks openly of how its eventual aim in copiers, typewriters, word
processors and cameras is to establish manufacturing sites in developing
countries to serve developed markets. Thus, the Japanese market will be
supplied from south-east Asia or mainland China. The US market will be
supplied from Mexico or South America. The EC will eventually be supplied
from the former communist bloc or from Turkey. The necessary first stage is
to establish manufacturing in the developed country itself. In several
cases, such manufacture has specifically been brought forward by the threat
of anti-dumping penalties. If EC producers cannot cope with this first stage
of the strategy, it is unclear how they will deal with the second.
Nor is it quite clear why the rest of the EC population should care. The use
of cashflow from domestic business to attack foreign markets has been
standard practice for European companies for the best part of a century. Now
that EC manufacturers find the tables turned, they seek protection on the
grounds of lack of reciprocal access to the Japanese market. But for the
most part, that is no longer the issue. Japanese manufacturers are exporting
technology to the EC. In such cases as UK car manufacturing, they are also
making a material contribution to the balance of trade. If EC producers
cannot meet the challenge, there comes a point where it is no longer the
business of EC consumers to bail them out by paying over the odds for their
products.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: The London Philharmonic - Edinburgh International
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A country proud of its ancient customs, there seems to be a tradition in
the making: an annual visit to the Edinburgh Festival by one of the London
orchestras. This year the honour fell to the London Philharmonic - an
honour, as it was allowed to programme the central German classics, while
the hard work of preparing the festival's rarities was left to supposedly
lesser visitors.
So exalted a position should not be claimed easily. Even in a festival that
can no longer lure (or afford) the prestigious Berlin and Vienna orchestras,
the competition is fierce. It was unfortunate for the London Philharmonic
that it should have appeared hard on the heels of the St Petersburg
Philharmonic, which had left ears tingling, passions roused, hearts elated.
The London orchestra's playing was not on that level. Its festival visit
comprised a pair of concerts at the Usher Hall, one each under the
orchestra's past and present music directors, Klaus Tennstedt and Franz
Welser-Most. Among the audiences, there was some disagreement as to which of
the two was the stronger. I have no doubts. Both for maturity of
musicianship and sheer quality of sound, it was Tennstedt's evening that
lifted the spirits.
The playing did not exhibit the pungent clarity of the Russians, or their
exhilarating passion. But the depth of tone, reaching molten-like to the
orchestra's core, is in itself a distinctive feature, which it seems only
Tennstedt can draw from the London Philharmonic players. His two Beethoven
works, the Overture to Egmont and the Seventh Symphony, were both rock-firm,
wise, sensitive, impressive in their unhurried determination to plumb the
music to its foundations.
In Strauss's Four Last Songs, the music's beauties were indulged in a still
more leisurely fashion. Tennstedt's grand, romantic vision ideally demands a
soprano of limitless tonal opulence, which Felicity Lott did her noble best
to provide. The gap between the last two chords was so long that one feared
the audience would applaud too soon.
The other concert, on Monday under Welser-Most, was a very different affair.
The single work on the programme was Bruckner's Eighth Symphony. So often
seen as a slow and reflective symphonic journey best left to older
conductors, the piece was here turned on its head. Welser-Most is a young
man and he made of it a young man's music. Within 10 minutes, the first
movement was a frenzy of brass fanfares and string tremolandos; the opening
of the finale foretold a battle of giants. This was the symphony as drama.
As befits a performance in the city of John Knox, Bruckner's deep-seated
spirituality took on a harder edge, arguing in impassioned debate,
celebrating with brass chorales of lacerating loudness and ferocity. To my
ears, the performance entirely lacked dignity and radiant beauty, the
essential Bruckner virtues.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: The Madras House - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
VIRGINIA Woolf wrote that 'In or about December 1910 human nature changed.'
She was writing years later in Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown, a lecture/essay
where she observes how Edwardian novelists - Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy
and others - had failed to show an adequately modern grasp of the real
nature of the working class, of women, of the changing social order. In the
plays of Harley Granville-Barker, however, those things are both felt and
seriously presented. Especially in his poignant, acute comedy The Madras
House.
'We've so organised the world's work as to make companionship between men
and women a very artificial thing.' This is the most remarkable of the many
extraordinary lines of The Madras House, not least for the ease with which
it is located amid a vivid discussion. It is spoken by Philip Madras, heir
apparent to a leading London couture house.
Philip, the protagonist of a play virtually devoid of plot but as rich in
episodic detail as a 19th-century novel, is a perpetual observer - as
sardonic as Professor Higgins in Pygmalion (whom he anticipates), as
wistfully detached as a Dickensian hero and as humanely concerned as Pierre
in War and Peace.
The play shows Philip in four different contexts: among a middle-class
household with six adult but unmarried daughters; in the office of a drapery
firm with numerous female employees, in an all-male business meeting (with
female mannequins modelling clothes in silence), and at home with his
parents and wife. And it shows us four married couples, each so oddly
matched and so juxtaposed with the play's several unmarried women that we
cannot help but reconsider marriage versus independence from many different
angles.
Every scene is full of amusement; every scene has its pain at the world's
wretched muddle. In this production, which the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith is
premiering at the Festival, the lines are slightly reordered so that Philip
launches the play with the observation 'What are the two most important
things in a man's character? His attitude towards money and his attitude
towards women.' Philip keeps those two attitudes brilliantly interconnected,
so that the play rises to its climax in his final, long dialogue with his
wife Jessica. Like Higgins, he is an intellectual, impervious to female
allurements; he treats his wife as a fellow-man - it is his compliment.
Granville-Barker was riding a great new wave of drama. You feel Ibsen, Wilde
and Shaw throughout The Madras House; they enrich it and add to its
excitement. In terms of exposition and pacing, he is not the
master-playwright they are; in several ways, his is a novelist's
sensibility. But The Madras House, like The Voysey Inheritance, is a real
play, and a great one. Its characters, situations, lines and arguments are
vivid, and live keenly in your mind after the curtain's fall.
Why is it so seldom performed? One problem, its large cast, is here solved
in Peter James's production by having the women play multiple roles - to
ingenious effect. Between scenes, the production also keeps confronting
Philip and his friend Thomas with an ominous array of women in corsets - in
the fashionable underpinnings marketed by the Madras House and required by
the old order. Yes, a feminist production of a feminist play. Pamela
Howard's designs strengthen the drama by being rudimentary. There are flaws:
in particular the great all-male third act seems word-imperfect and
under-rehearsed, its six contrasting characters not yet interacting
spontaneously.
Roger Allam's Philip provides an eloquent central thread to the play -
ironic, witty, sharp, vehement, wide awake to the dilemmas. But he is a
little too completely English - too Higgins, suave, urbane. For Eve Matheson
as his polished, intelligent wife, every praise. Helen Ryan, Sam Kelly,
Suzanna Hamilton and Frances Cuka are the best of the other players. No
brief newspaper review can convey the way this play's detail becomes so
enthralling. I had not seen it before; hours after, I am still electrified.
No British play of this century has so excited me.
The Madras House runs at the Lyceum until August 29. On September 2 it
transfers to the Lyric, Hammersmith, where it continues until October 10

FT  27 AUG 92 / Arts: Salome - Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SETTING aside the Seven Veils, Richard Strauss's Salome has been
over-dressed these many years: too many kootch-girls, eunuchs and catamites,
the Dance itself too often a swollen production-number. None of this popular
campery stems from Wilde's play, to which - as translated by Mike Nichols'
grandmother] (not many people know that) - Strauss made judicious cuts, but
added no 'decadent' titivation whatever. In the original text Herod's party,
far from being an orgy, was more like a 'political breakfast', with visiting
Roman dignitaries and local Jewish ones.
For the Salzburg Festival, the producer Luc Bondy has stripped the phoney
accretions away. This is a co-production with the Theatre Royal de la
Monnaie; Brussels has struck lucky, for the result is dismaying in exactly
the right way. The opera becomes an intimate drame a trois,
Herod-Herodias-Salome - or rather a quatre, since John the Baptist is here
not an abstracted, visionary ascetic but a hulking youth, desperately
tempted by Salome's nubile blandishments.
There are no supernumerary guests; even Wilde's gigantic black executioner
is reduced to a janitor-figure, woken from dull sleep to do his job.
Salome's dance is a private, improvised affair, and the seven veils are
passing props, not stages in a striptease. On the other hand, the five
disputatious Jews (and their ingenious fugue) get an unusually clear run for
their money; and the two converted Nazarenes pass through  - a happy
inspiration, this - with their whole family, eager pilgrims seeking their
Saviour.
In this context, Catherine Malfitano's baby-faced Salome is no unhappy
daughter of a decadent court, but an imp of wilful perversity, sung with
great imaginative command.
The cistern from which Bryn Terfel's sonorously impassioned Jokanaan emerges
is no more than a hole beneath the cracked parquet of Herod's dusty terrace,
in Erich Wonder's stark setting. Hanna Schwarz's Herodias is a tough cookie
out of Dynasty. Kenneth Riegel's clever Herod, familiar from Covent Garden,
has altered subtly for Bondy's production - less arch, more bumbling and
beleaguered.
He has to work hard to be heard, for in the Kleines Festspielhaus Christoph
von Dohnanyi's approach to the score is scathingly violent, once past the
exquisite first pages. It is easy to treat this music as ripely tonal at
bottom, with dissonant overlay; Dohnanyi does the opposite, gleefully
highlighting every cross-grained line and chord. The score fairly shrieks -
and yet Bondy fits gestures to music with precise, penetrating effect. An
uncomfortably memorable production.

BODY HEAT (18) Barbican
HITLER: A FILM FROM GERMANY ICA from next week
TAKING the rap used to be something people did for a crime they had or had
not committed. Now it is what filmgoers do (with or without criminal record)
when pinned to their seats by black movies whose plot sense is as minimal as
their musical variety.
Ernest Dickerson's Juice is a Harlem-set rap-scored melodrama about four
young blacks who fall out with the law after a robbery with murder. Since it
marks the writing-directing debut of Spike Lee's longtime camera-person, the
film has gained encomia from those publications that worship at the altar of
Political Correctness.
'Energetic, entertaining and engagaging, and without the feeling of
difficult truths being forgotten' says Time Out. And right-on ideologues
will no doubt applaud the film's 90 percent non-white cast, the dialogue
rich in local argot ('I'm gonna beat your ass', 'You gonna beat my ass?'
'Yes, I gonna ..' etc.) and the screenplay that weaves and feints through
half an hour of tired street comedy before standing stiffly to attention to
give us a 'plot'.
This concerns aspiring disc jockey 'Q' (Omar Epps) and his two friends Steel
and Rahim who are appalled when a fourth friend Bishop goes gun-crazy during
a shop hold-up. Why he does so is unclear; but perhaps an earlier glimpse of
Cagney on TV in White Heat has wired him up for mayhem.
Either way, the film soon turns into a throwback Warners melodrama, with
Bishop gunning for his former friends, and the early sub-Spike Lee street
comedy is forgotten in a hail of B-movie cliches. We especially note the
tilted angles and harsh-lit close-ups of the police interrogation sequence:
these look as if they were kidnapped, feebly protesting, from Public Enemy
or The Roaring Twenties.
With its two-dimensional characters and trite moralising, this film would
have been laughed off the screen if presented by white film-makers with
white actors in white roles. But we cannot laugh around - or we are not
supposed to - with the cinema of Spike Lee and his acolytes. Although some
of those film-makers, like Lee himself, are talented social satirists, most
like Mr Dickerson are bargain-basement disciples empowered and encouraged
only by the mighty karma of PC
How mighty that karma is is evident in the 1992 New Directors programme of
shorts sponsored by the British Film Institute with Channel 4. This is the
fifth year's fruit from the annual scheme whereby six aspiring film-makers
receive Pounds 30,000 apiece to make calling-card movies.
The quality is so low this year that we need not detain you with an autopsy
on each film. But I wonder if the reason for the cinematic poverty is not
that ethnic tokenism is being exercised in the choice of directors. Three
are white (one male, two female), one is black, one is Asian and one is
Dutch-Trinidadian. For good measure, lesbianism, the environment and
cultural colonialism are among the Important Themes treated.
This would be fine if the films were any good. But they are so banal that
one wonders what the 990-odd submissions apparently rejected by the BFI were
like. Were they bad? Were they banal? Or were they just Politically
Incorrect? Better luck, and much better selection, in 1993.
It is not a good week - it is not a good summer - and Hollywod fails to come
to the rescue. 'I wanna see your ass in the air' shouts the trainer to the
figure skater in The Cutting Edge; much around the time that that part of
the filmgoer's anatomy has slid deep into the upholstery in response to this
dotty tale of love and ambition on the ice rink.
Tony Gilroy wrote the script, Paul M. Glaser (TV's Starsky) directed, and DB
Sweeney and Moira Kelly play the ice partners for whom initial antagonism is
a prelude to - yes] - passion. The wiser characters realise this early on.
'Foreplay]' they chuckle avuncularly as Sweeney slings Kelly
life-endangeringly on to the ice or she screams at him down a hotel corridor
after a drunken dinner date.
Never mind. We can always turn to more peaceable matters like the reception
accorded our hero's career-change - he used to be an ice-hockey player - by
his redneck bar-owning father ('Are they gonna make you shave you legs?').
Or for tragicomic relief there is Roy Dotrice as the duo's trainer,
struggling with his Russian accent much as Laocoon struggled with his
consignment of snakes.
Hokum so wholehearted earns affection if not admiration. It skates over
every known emotion in the pop-melodramatic rink, while never pausing to
make an original incision on any.
Revival corner this week features Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 directing debut
Body Heat, launching a Barbican season in honour of actor William Hurt.
Adultery and murder; Hurt and Kathleen Turner; and a shameless set of
plunderings from the fatal-woman thrillers of yesteryear. Double Indemnity,
The Woman In The Window, Out Of The Past: bring on the Venetian blinds,
paint the dialogue in wisecracking monochrome.
But if Body Heat is plagiarism posturing as art, it is still more enjoyable
than anything director Kasdan has made since. Main reason: a script is
served up with a salty crackle by Hurt and Turner, aided by Mickey Rourke's
debut cameo as a soft-spoken bomb-maker.
Jostling an 11-year-old American film is a 15-year-old European one.
Hans-Jurgen Syberberg's Hitler: A Film From Germany, revived at the ICA, is
a monstrous 7-hour cabaret from the man who brought us Ludwig: Requiem For A
Virgin King and Parsifal the movie. On soundstages thick with smoke,
puppetry, slide projections and other theatrical-pedagogic devices oft
called 'Brechtian', modern German history is recounted for us as if by a mad
schoolteacher with a runaway props budget.
The good news is that Syberberg both absorbs and contextualises the kitsch
associations that grew around Hitler in 1970s culture, when in such musicals
as Cabaret and such films as Visconti's The Damned Herr Fuhrer became a
superstar. The bad news is - well, actually there is no bad news. Against
expectation, Syberberg's seminar is horribly compulsive.
Even at its most hectoring - a toga'd Adolf rearing from a grave marked 'RW'
(Richard Wagner), Goering or Goebbels puppets cavorting against Leni
Riefenstahl back-projections - Hitler has a passionate wit about the fatal
windings of politics and an absurdist ferocity that puts the hiss back into
history.
How disturbing, though, that the summer has brought us so few new films from
Europe and so many old ones reminding us of her former glory. The European
Film Award nominations, just announced, pour salt on the continent's wounded
self-esteem. The awards are nicknamed 'Felixes' in reference to Neil Simon's
odd couple. They were Felix and Oscar, you recall, of whom Oscar was the
flamboyant shambolic one while Felix was the fastidious introvert.
Oh what wisdom from careless sobriquets] While Oscar wassails loudly and
untidily each April, Felix dons his dinner jacket each autumn graciously to
honour films that few people have heard of and fewer have seen.

The first hot ticket at this year's Edinburgh Festival was for the flamenco
dancer Cristina Hoyos. Anyone who missed her there can catch up on Channel 4
tonight at 11.00 in El Amor Brujo. She stars in this dramatisation of Manuel
de Falla's Spanish folk tale, directed by Carlos Saura, best known for his
films Carmen and Blood Wedding, which also featured flamenco dancers.
Survival (ITV at 7.30) really gets away from it all, going not just to
Antarctica but underneath that continent. Holes are sawed through the ice to
allow scuba divers to explore with their cameras one of the few natural
environments yet to be contaminated by man.
There is still plenty of carnage going on, with seals hunting cod and the
Antarctic robber fish eating virtually everything. Pictures of penguins
provide light relief.
These days persuade David Jason to appear in a TV series and it seems
destined to be a smash hit. But Jason worked his way through the ranks. In
tonight's Porridge (BBC 1 at 9.30) he has a bit part as an old con who is
reluctant to leave prison. These repeats of the 1970s classic comedy series
are holding up very well.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Management: A change of propaganda - Impoverished Russians
are having a first taste of promotional gimmicks, and are being invited to
buy designer clothes
</HEADLINE>

An executive without a car is like a rabbit without ears.' If that Russian
slogan does not grab you, there is a long-running advertisement on Moscow
buses for a brand of western toothpaste which is not to be found in the
shops.
A year after the collapse of communism, the Russian advertising market is
still in its infancy. More than half a dozen big western agencies have
offices in Moscow, but out of the 200 Russian agencies there, only a handful
offer a full range of marketing services. Foreign companies are promoting
goods which are mostly unavailable, and domestic companies producing ads
which mean little or nothing.
Russian advertisements are still addressed more to other businesses than the
consumer, reflecting the fact that 'biznez' is still the preserve of
state-owned enterprises and a few slick entrepreneurs. A lack of
sophisticated marketing advice also means that companies often use
television where specialist publications would be more appropriate.
As a result, grumpy TV viewers are treated to adverts offering shares in
banks, trading houses and new-style commodity exchanges, or to glitzy
pictures accompanied by acronyms and symbols which are never explained.
A notorious example is the collie which advertises Alisa, a Russian exchange
which trades in building materials. 'This dog begins to inspire hatred,
hatred for people who are really rich from those who feel this dog has
nothing to do with them,' said Sergei Abramov, a Russian marketing expert.
If any explanation is provided, it usually makes clear the product in
question (such as holidays abroad) is for a resented minority of Russians
with lots of money, or foreigners.
Thanks to the appearance of western consumer goods advertised by western
companies, the market is finally moving towards ads aimed at ordinary
people.
A billboard in central Moscow displays a Mars bar, a product now available
in kiosks around the capital; television ads show western-looking women
using Vidal Sassoon shampoo as a Russian male voice extols the virtues of
'Wosh end Go'.
The new breed of ads is exemplified by insurance company White Tower's use
of a picture of a Russian family to illustrate 'seven good reasons' for
buying an insurance policy. Under the banner headline: 'We foresaw
misfortune in sunny weather', the ad - prepared by InterCity Communications,
one of the biggest Moscow agencies - offers a service which few Russians
needed to bother with in the past.
Research by the US-based BBDO agency, which updates a Russian market sample
every month, shows that brand recognition is very high, even though there is
still very little precise information about who has money to spend.
After years of seeing the Olivetti name on the clock which appears on TV
screens just before the evening news, many viewers interviewed for the
research said they thought the Italian computer company was a clock-maker.
Another branch of marketing, public relations, has developed along typically
corrupt Russian lines. For Russian businessmen it consists mainly of
organising rumours against competitors and paying journalists to write
flattering articles about themselves or critical articles about rivals.
Inter-City's Karine Iskhanova admits it is common practice for agencies to
pay newspapers to write articles about their clients without specifying they
are ads. She also says that many clients are still intent on dictating ads,
and who should appear in them (including a general manager's scantily-clad
girlfriend lying on a pile of money to advertise computers). At the other
extreme, officials are also beginning to look at public relations as a
necessary substitute for old-style propaganda. The Defence Ministry, alarmed
by falling conscription rates, is now running a TV ad proclaiming that 'real
men' serve in the army, and showing handsome youths jumping over obstacle
courses and handling sophisticated military hardware.
In seeking to introduce western capitalist values, the Russian government
has just hired BBDO (as part of a consortium of western advisers in banking,
auditing and public relations) to help excite 160m citizens about the
prospect of receiving vouchers to obtain Rbs10,000 of shares in the
century's biggest ever privatisation campaign.
Given the shortage of both home-made consumer goods and marketing expertise,
the opportunities for foreign advertising companies and western products are
as challenging as the obstacles. There is almost no distribution system, the
currency is not yet fully convertible, and the banking system is chaotic.
However, the cheapness of advertising space and time is an important
incentive for western manufacturers. By all accounts television (Pounds
1,250 for a 30-second spot around evening news) and radio (Pounds 75 for 30
seconds) are extremely cheap, while newspapers have tended to price
themselves out of the market by raising fees in an attempt to compensate for
falling circulation. 'We're talking pennies (per thousand of audience),'
says one Californian executive.
After being lied to for seven decades, the Russian audience is remarkably
gullible to whatever is new and different, providing it is not offensive.
Mike Adams, chief executive of Young &amp; Rubicam/Sovero, a US-Russian joint
venture in advertising and public relations, suggests the following values
are particularly important in understanding the Russian audience: the
individual as part of the community; envy; the moral imperative; suffering;
honouring the past.
While western agencies try to persuade Russian clients that they are not
only sensitive but affordable, Russian companies are making a pitch for
foreign business. 'You have to grow up in this market to know it,' says Oleg
Pisarsky, director-general of Metapress agency. 'It is based on
acquaintances and trust. The only thing my foreign competitors have is piles
of dollars.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Management: Russia embraces the tyranny of fashion -
Impoverished Russians are having a first taste of promotional gimmicks, and
are being invited to buy designer clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Not many people in the West spend 20 times the average monthly wage on one
jacket - no matter how fashionable it may be.
But many shoppers in Russia are mysteriously doing exactly that, splashing
out on clothes in the newly-opened Escada fashion store in St Petersburg.
Escada's prices are considered high even in the company's home market of
Germany, but when translated into roubles at the open market rate they verge
on the stratospheric.
A stylish pink jacket is on sale for more than Rbs100,000 (Pounds 325). It
would take a comparatively well-paid Russian engineer 20 months to earn such
a sum.
Nevertheless, Escada has been 'very encouraged' by its first Russian store,
which opened in the Passazh shopping centre on the Nevskii Prospekt earlier
this month. It says sales are running at comparable levels to those of a new
store in Germany.
Such a performance shows the strength of Russia's unofficial economy, the
latent spending power of a new generation of entrepreneurs (and crooks), and
the craving for high-status consumer goods in a land which has been deprived
of them for decades.
Irina Nylander, Escada's area manager, says the brand is a status symbol for
the emerging business classes who believe in flaunting their wealth. 'If you
have a diamond ring in Russia you wear it,' she says, strolling round the
store in striking red hot pants.
Many of the customers are young independent entrepreneurs who walk into the
store with plastic bags containing 'bricks' of roubles. Nylander estimates
that foreigners account for less than 5 per cent of sales.
Escada, Germany's second biggest clothing manufacturer, conducted little
formal market research before opening in St Petersburg; its initiative owed
more to a chance encounter between a company director and a Russian trade
minister.
The company now plans to expand in Russia, in contrast with its retrenchment
in western Europe. Its principle designer and co-founder, Margaratha Ley,
died in June at the age of 59. Her husband and business manager, Wolfgang
Ley, admits the company was left to drift during her extended illness. A
dozen years of near 30 per cent annual growth ended, an extensive new
distribution centre hit teething troubles and the company fell into loss
this year.
Russia may contribute to a turnaround in Escada's fortunes, although it is a
difficult place to do business, with unpredictable investment and customs
laws and an uncertain economic climate, says Nylander.
She also argues that Russians are impatient capitalists. 'People want to
make a million in a month. They want a big profit margin on every deal. But
we emphasise that to be successful you have to build a trading relationship
over a long time,' she says.
But in spite of such concerns, she claims Escada has been able to establish
a mutually beneficial trading arrangement with Passazh, the retailing
concern which owns the centre where its shop is found. She claims it is
important to have an effective local partner, who can deal with many of the
bureaucratic worries.
Escada pays no fixed rent to Passazh but effectively leases its store by
giving it a percentage of its takings. It has also agreed to take on all the
staff from the previous shop on the premises - it now employs 50 people in
total - and to maintain the fabric of its section of the centre.
The overhead costs are lower than in Germany but they are offset by higher
distribution expenses, a customs charge of 6 per cent on imported goods, and
a further 2.5 per cent charge for converting rouble sales into Deutschmarks.
The net result is that margins between Russia and Germany are similar.
The company has spent much time and effort promoting the Escada brand name
and its store-opening programme in Russia by means of press, radio and
television advertising. It believes it can quickly - and cheaply - make the
Escada brand synonymous with high fashion in the minds of millions of
Russians, stealing a march on its competitors. Whether it can sustain its
early advantage in such a fast-changing economy remains a moot point,
however.
A glamorous TV advertising campaign is currently running ahead of the Moscow
store openings. In St Petersburg, local government officials and the press
were invited to a lavish party on the eve of the opening which generated a
great deal of media coverage.
'When Passazh opened its doors at 10 am people were running down the arcade
towards our shop. There were so many people I did not know what to do,'
Nylander says.
Ironically, although the media's headlines focused on the high prices -
'Shop and Shock' ran one - Escada's first customer was a Russian journalist
who spent Rbs289,000.
But not all are so impressed by what Escada has to offer. 'Only a valyutnaya
can afford to buy here,' said one shopper, bitterly referring to Russia's
high-earning hard currency prostitutes.
Such private resentments could easily spill over into public hostility
towards the more high-profile expressions of the vast inequalities of wealth
that are rapidly developing in Russia. Escada will have to tread a narrow
path to ensure it becomes a victor, not a victim, in the volatile world of
Russian fashion.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Seeing may not be believing on pension
costs - Norma Cohen explains why there is unease about the treatment of fund
surpluses under current rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Great Illusion is the title given to the chapter on pension fund
accounting in Accounting for Growth, the controversial book by Terry Smith,
the suspended head of research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
While more publicity-shy members of both the accountancy and pensions
professions would choose a more moderate description of current rules, the
balance of their convictions lie with Mr Smith's conclusion.
The current rule on accounting for pension costs, known as SSAP 24, has been
singled out for a review by the Accounting Standards Board. And while the
ASB says no revision is likely within the next year, key aspects of SSAP are
troubling.
The Pensions Research Accountants Group (PRAG), an ad hoc committee of
leading actuaries and accountants, in a report submitted to the ASB last
week concluded that in key respects, the standard is unsatisfactory. It
says: 'The standard in its current form allows employers a great deal of
flexibility to adjust results on a short-term basis, substantially impairs
an informed reader's ability to make judgments about annual pension costs
and in practice prevents any general attempt to compare one employer's
pension cost figures with another's by adjusting one or both to a common
calculation basis.'
Similarly, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in a
paper it prepared for the ASB, concluded that to compensate for the
flexibility it offers to preparers of accounts, a much greater degree of
disclosure is required. 'The time for a period of experimentation with SSAP
24 is now over and revision is necessary,' the ICAEW said.
'It is a better method than what was in use before but it is still
unsatisfactory,' said Mr Thomas Crowter of KPMG Actuarial Services, noting
that prior to 1988 when the rule took effect, no standard existed. 'Most
analysts are pretty financially sophisticated people and even they often
can't understand pension fund expense.'
Among the complaints about SSAP 24 is the scope it gives companies to
calculate the value of pension fund surpluses or deficits. Some 92 per cent
of respondents to a recent survey from the Society of Pension Consultants
said they were in that category.
Indeed, Mr Crowter argues, there is reason to question whether companies
should be entitled to show pension fund surpluses on their balance sheets as
assets at all. 'Do the assets really belong to the employer and are they at
his disposal?' he asked.
This question lies at the heart at the current debate over pension fund law.
Currently, the government has commissioned an independent panel to study
pension reform in the aftermath of the Maxwell pension scandal and the
ownership and control of assets is at the top of the agenda.
While the UK courts have implied in recent decisions that scheme members
should have a say in the disposal of scheme surpluses, that right has yet to
be enshrined in law.
But aside from this question, which must await legislation for a suitable
answer, other pressing issues remain.
In the calculation of pension expense, there are several standards currently
in use, the choice of any one of which can change the picture significantly.
But because most companies do not include enough information in their
accounts about their methods of calculation, the actual figure shown in the
profit and loss account means little.
Part of the difficulty in assessing pension expense, even without the
existence of either a surplus or a deficit, is that it depends on a variety
of assumptions used by actuaries. The key variables are assumptions about
general increases in employee average earnings, dividend growth on
investment portfolio and the assumed growth rate of the retail price index.
Also, discretionary increases in pension benefits, frequently awarded
annually at the judgment of trustees, will have an effect on cost
assumptions.
By altering any of these key variables, an actuary may increase or decrease
the amount of contribution needed from the employer or, indeed, make a
surplus arise or disappear. The SPC survey, for instance, found that only 50
per cent of respondents allowed for discretionary increases in their SSAP 24
calculation of cost. 'If the remaining 50 per cent of respondents are
required by the Social Security Act of 1990 to convert these discretionary
practices into guarantees, then large increases in pension cost may result,'
the survey concluded.
Thus, some pensions experts argue, SSAP 24 should first require disclosure
of the underlying actuarial assumptions along with the impact of
discretionary increases. 'This is being done but in a haphazard way by
auditors,' said Mr Andrew Wilson, partner in charge of research at actuarial
consultants R Watson.
However, some experts in pensions accountancy believe that improving
disclosure will not solve the shortcomings of SSAP 24. Mr Ken Wild, partner
at Touche Ross and chairman of the ICAEW committee which prepared the review
of the standard, warned that so much information would have to be provided
to make the information meaningful that 'you will end up with information
overload'. Instead, he suggested, the ASB may wish to concentrate on
limiting flexibility in the rule and insist expenses be calculated in
specific ways.
The greatest debate lies over the method used to recognise the benefits of
pension surpluses. The SPC survey found that when SSAP 24 came into effect
in 1988, 20 per cent of respondents immediately put the surplus on the
balance sheet as a prepayment. However, the remainder amortised the benefits
over time as a variation to the ongoing cost. And therein lies the rub.
The most popular method has been known as the straight line method, which
allocates spreading the surplus over, say, 15 years and increasing the
amount amortised in each successive year by a percentage equal to the
average salary increase. Such a method will give accounts the greatest
nominal benefits in the out-years.
More controversial is the use of the so-called straight line method,
preferred by 27 per cent of respondents to the SPC survey. This recognises
presumed investment income from the surplus over its life, in addition to
amortising the surplus itself, and will give the company very large up-front
benefits which reduce as time goes on. Last, there is the level monetary
amount, a hybrid of both approaches.
Meanwhile, there is a debate about how to spread pension expense over the
average working life of employees. One method, that favoured by PRAG, is
known as the projected unit method. This requires the company to set a
contribution rate which includes assumptions of salary increases over the
average working life - typically 15 years. Mr Wilson argues that this method
can produce the most accurate picture of cost unless there are significant
changes in the demographic make-up of the workforce.
The alternative method is known as attained age and calculates the like cost
of providing benefits to employees once they have reached the age at which
they become eligible. However, Mr Wilson notes, such a method is
inappropriate for a scheme which has been wound up or which is still
accepting new members.

FT  27 AUG 92 / People: Smooth passage of command at Thomas Cook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'If we do it right it will be like one of the better Olympic baton passes'
is how the new chief executive of Thomas Cook, Christopher Rodrigues, 42,
describes the succession at the top of the travel and financial services
group that is being sold to Westdeutsche Landesbank and German package tour
operator LTU. His predecessor Peter Middleton, tipped as the next chief
executive of Lloyd's, stepped down yesterday, but refused to divulge his
next destination.
A former diplomat who has headed Thomas Cook for five years, Middleton
hand-picked fellow Englishman and marketing expert Rodrigues from American
Express back in 1988 - initially to serve as Cook's chief operating officer,
more recently as managing director.
Rodrigues, then poised to take up a quite different job, had agreed at the
suggestion of a headhunter to have lunch with Middleton - but 'as a
competitor' since he thought the description of the Cook vacancy looked to
be 'boloney'. Middleton, whom he calls 'a charismatic recruiter', simply
informed his lunch guest he was joining Cooks and so had better start
writing his own job description.
They have been a partnership of 'human change agents' ever since, according
to Rodrigues - turning round an organisation at first seemingly staffed with
'message takers, instruction issuers and administrators'. Cooks suffered
years of neglect, including under Midland's stewardship since 1972.
Middleton adds: 'what we had to do - and Christopher was central to that -
was rehabilitate the brand and put it back where it was in its colourful
past'.
Well on the way towards that goal, Rodrigues stresses that the new German
ownership (effective October) will not cramp his style. On the contrary,
'they have very stretching aspirations for us'.
A Cambridge rowing blue, and Harvard MBA, the new Cook boss spent four years
at McKinsey, whence one of his clients Lou Gerstner, then of American
Express Travel Related Services, hired him, explaining 'it will be cheaper
for us and more profitable for you'. He spent nine years at American
Express, progressing to managing director of travel and travel management
services for the UK and USSR.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Technology: No such thing as plain sailing - British
Entrepreneurs / Louise Kehoe concludes a series by observing the differences
between US and UK risk-takers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To British high-technology entrepreneurs, the grass seems much greener on
the other side of the Atlantic. American start-up companies, they believe,
enjoy big advantages over their UK counterparts.
Yet from a US perspective, the struggle to build a new business is fraught
with difficulties that Europeans seldom face. While there are more
high-technology start-ups in the US, a greater number of them fail.
Perhaps because failed ventures are more common, they are more readily
accepted in the US. Fear of failure is cited again and again by British
entrepreneurs as one of the greatest barriers to the formation of new UK
ventures.
'You have got to be able to take risks, knowing that some of them won't pay
off and that you will learn from things that go wrong,' says Michael Skok,
founder of European Software Publishing, based in Maidenhead, Berkshire.
Unlike the UK, stigma seldom attaches to the failure of a new venture in the
US and the people involved will, in many cases, return to the same investors
with a new business plan.
Still, on both sides of the Atlantic, the entrepreneur with a good track
record stands a better chance of raising money, says Bob Jones, a data
communications specialist who recently raised Pounds 2.1m in the UK and US
for his latest venture, Sonix Communications, based in Cirencester,
Gloucestershire.
Jones, who previously founded two other companies, followed the American
pattern, seeking out venture capitalists with knowledge of the data
communications market. This led him to Schroder Ventures in London and to
Greylock Management in the US, which has made its first UK investment in
Sonix.
For Sonix, having the backing of venture groups with a strong reputation for
IT funding provides credibility and a source of market expertise. This
contrasts with the traditional British view that financiers are there simply
to provide money. Raising money 'is tough on both sides of the water',
explains Jones.
Perhaps the greatest myth in the UK is that US start-ups have it easy when
it comes to raising venture capital. Competition for venture funds in the US
has become more intense over the past few years as funding has declined.
While UK venture capitalists say they may see a dozen or so new business
plans per month, their US counterparts are barraged with almost as many per
week. It appears that the smaller number of British enterprises seeking
venture capital may have a better chance of raising some money, although the
amounts raised are significantly lower than in the US.
In 1991, US venture capitalists invested Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 550m) in 465
computer and electronics companies, according to a survey by Technologic
Partners of New York. In the UK, Pounds 101m was invested in 194 such
companies, according to data from the British Venture Capital Association
(BVCA).
Overall patterns of British venture capital investing suggest that 'start-up
and early-stage' funding is more readily available in the UK than in the US.
The BVCA says that three-quarters of the Pounds 445m invested last year
across all industry sectors (excluding management buyouts) went to companies
that had not previously received any venture capital.
By contrast, in the US more than 85 per cent of venture capital investments
in the high-technology sector were second or subsequent rounds of financing.
Thus entrepreneurs on both sides of the Atlantic complain about a dearth of
venture capital.
For the US entrepreneur the biggest challenge is to get a foot in the door,
raising seed money for a new venture, while in the UK the common complaint
is that companies are 'under-funded', which limits their growth potential.
Antipathy towards the 'money men' seems to be a characteristic of
entrepreneurs wherever they do business. British high-technology
entrepreneurs charge that venture capitalists do not understand the capital
requirements of their businesses and point to the large number of technology
investment specialists in the US.
In the US, however, one is more likely to hear the wrenching stories of
entrepreneurs who have been ousted from the companies they have founded, to
be replaced by venture capitalists. The 'hands-on' American venture
capitalist is far less forgiving of an entrepreneur's lack of management
skills. And while the British complain about the 'onerous terms' imposed by
venture capital investors, such as the demand for preference shares with
hefty dividend payments, it is in the US that venture capitalists have been
dubbed 'vulture capitalist' for their alleged greed.
Apart from the difficulties of raising money, British entrepreneurs
generally agree that the regulatory environment in the UK is more
favourable. In contrast, their US counterparts complain bitterly about
becoming entangled in the bureaucratic red tape of employment and
environmental regulations.
While Peter Rigby, founder of Computer Specialist Holdings in Birmingham, is
proud to share the story of a former telephonist who has become his top
sales manager, Ray Fortune, president of Ultra Network Technologies, in
California, expresses exasperation over the hoops that he has had to jump
through to reclassify the job of a valued secretary and provide her with
access to share options.
One of the biggest challenges facing ambitious British high-technology
manufacturers is cracking the US market. While most are convinced that it is
important to establish a beachhead in the US, they lack the resources needed
for a large-scale assault.
Viewed from 'over there', however, the problem is equally daunting. Unlike
the British start-up company, which can begin life by addressing the 'home'
market, a fledgling US company rarely has the option of establishing its
reputation on a regional basis.
Neither do US companies find the transatlantic crossing painless. Many are
naive in their approach to the European market, taking at face value the
prospects of a 'single market' and failing to recognise at first that within
Europe each national market has its own unique characteristics.
British entrepreneurs are at least better placed to assess the challenge.
One of the most striking differences between start-ups in the UK and those
in the US is that most business founders in the UK are British.
Not so in the US, and particularly in the Silicon Valley high-technology
enclave, where ambitious individuals from Europe and Asia figure high in the
ranks of business builders.
Also noticeable in the UK is the relative lack of experience of the British
high-technology entrepreneur. While some of America's most famous
entrepreneurs are start-lingly young, the majority have a long career in
established companies behind them.
Another glaring difference is that American entrepreneurs rapidly learn the
value of 'blowing their own trumpets'. Some of the largest US venture
capital groups maintain close links with public relations agencies that
promote start-up companies. Call it British reserve, or a lack of marketing
expertise; whatever the cause, the result is that few small British
high-technology ventures get the recognition that they deserve.
While entrepreneurs complain that they are not valued in British society,
they fail to recognise that the acclaim afforded to their American
counterparts is not automatic. It costs money.
In both countries, the building of high-technology winners is a gruelling
and expensive business with uncertain returns. The US high-technology
industry has a more firmly-entrenched process of business development, but
the route that its entrepreneurs must follow is still an uphill struggle.
For the British entrepreneur who must cut out his own path, it may be some
comfort to know that nobody else has found a short cut to success.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Technology: Transgenic pigs head for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transgenic pigs, bred for use in organ transplants, could prove profitable
for the daring investor. British expertise and US finance have brought the
futuristic scheme to the point of patent application.
According to David White, a lecturer in transplantation immunology at
Cambridge University, pigs hold the key to future organ supply. While
transplantation skills race ahead, human supply lags behind, depriving
thousands of patients each year of a lifesaving operation.
Eric Rose, of Columbia Medical School in New York, has estimated that in the
US a potential 20,000 heart transplant could be performed annually, yet
fewer than 2,000 transplants are carried out each year. Discrepancies in
supply and demand also exist in kidney, liver and pancreas transplantation.
Anatomically and physiologically, pigs have many similarities to humans.
They grow to a size comparable with even the biggest man. And since they
frequently give birth to 12 or 13 piglets at a time, they can easily satisfy
current demand.
However, the big drawback between discordant species is immunological. The
host rejects the organ graft within 10-15 minutes of transplantation. Every
human has antibodies in the blood against every other distantly-related
species, including the pig. In addition to natural antibodies, a further
body defence system is activated, known as complement. 'Complement acts as
the bomb of the immune system,' says White.
Working with transplant pioneer Sir Roy Calne at Cambridge, White has used
genetic manipulation to slow down the human complement response to the
transplant. White has inserted into mouse cells a human gene - known as
Decay Accelerating Factor (Daf) - which regulates complement activity. This
protects the mouse from being destroyed by human complement.
By transferring this technology to a clinically useful animal, White hopes
to produce a transgenic pig. Its organs could be more successfully
transplanted since rejection is less likely to occur. Once the graft is in
place, animal models have demonstrated that it stands an increased chance of
success.
'If you consider that in markets such as India where kidneys are bought and
sold (the recipient pays more than Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 10,000) of which
the middleman gets about Dollars 10,000 and the donor between Dollars
5,000-Dollars 7,000), this puts pigs into a very high-value bracket indeed,'
says White.
Some Dollars 1.5m has already been spent on White's research, with finance
raised by the American concern Warburg Pincus. A patent is now pending for
the transgenic technique developed at Cambridge. 'We're just beginning on
the pig, but we have high hopes of success,' White said.
In the US, transgenic pigs are already a reality. Since 1987, a Princeton,
New Jersey company called DNX has been studying the potential of transgenic
pigs as a source of universally compatible organs - specifically kidneys and
hearts.
Some 30 transgenic pigs have so far been produced by DNX, according to Paul
Schmitt, president and chief executive officer. The pigs are able to produce
human haemoglobin, for use in the race for universally compatible,
easily-stored blood substitutes.
However, John Logan, the company's vice president of research, believes that
within 18 months the same patented technology will produce pigs whose organs
will be transplanted into non-human primates. 'We don't want to mislead
people at this stage,' Logan said. 'The days of using pig organs in human
transplantation operations are way off - but I believe they will come.'
DNX has currently raised Dollars 49m through a private placement and an
initial public stock offering. Schmitt believes current market opportunities
includes blood substitutes, drug testing and the donor organ market.
'Transgenic animal technology which is both technically innovative and
cost-effective is the way forward,' he said.

Evidence of the growing significance of the 'Keele Connection'in the CIVIL
SERVICE is provided by yesterday's appointment as civil service commissioner
of Eric Sorensen, chief executive of the London Docklands Development
Corporation since March 1991. Sorensen is a graduate of Keele University -
as are several recently promoted top mandarins, including Richard Mottram,
permanent secretary at the Office of Public Service and Science, and John
Vereker, head of schools at the department for education. As a commissioner,
he will share responsibility for the selection of the high-fliers who will
become the next generation of Whitehall mandarins.
At 49, Sorensen has spent most of his career in the civil service. He was
appointed by Michael Heseltine to lead his Merseyside Task Force and later
spent nearly a year at the Cabinet Office pulling together the Government's
inner city programmes. He has also been deputy secretary at the Housing
Corporation and director of personnel management and training at the
environment department.
Maintaining the civil service Oxbridge tradition is Geoffrey Maddrell, also
made a commissioner yesterday. A Cambridge graduate, 56-year-old Maddrell is
currently chief executive of Proshare, the organisation set up to promote
share ownership. A member of the CBI Education and Training Affairs
Committee, he is a non-executive director of Transport Development Group and
a governor of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology. He held senior positions with Tootal and Bowater and was a past
chairman of the Manchester Training and Enterprise Council.
Maddrell replaces Gerald Dennis who retires as commissioner at the end of
August. Sorensen takes over the seat vacated by Julian Moore who is returns
to the Office of Public Service and Science.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S history of conquest and colonisation is reflected in genetic
differences within the population, the meeting heard.
Professor Derek Roberts, a genetic anthropologist at the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrated how Orkney islanders are a breed apart,
while descendants of Vikings could be alive and well in the Lake District.
Prof Roberts explained how, using blood grouping and other variable protein
markers, he has traced the British population's heterogenous origins.
He suggested that a trend in the distribution of people with the blood group
O reflects the push of the original neolithic Britons north and westwards,
ending up isolated in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, while Orkney islanders
could be the relics of an ancient population relegated to the far north.
They were found to be genetically distinct from mainland Scotland, with a
very high frequency of the rare blood group B and the highest level of
multiple sclerosis in the UK.
People who live in the central Lake District resemble Norwegians more
closely than their neighbours in Carlisle and could be descendants of Viking
raiders, he said.
US researchers have identified 12 distinct genetic boundaries in the UK,
implying a different heritage for each group. Prof Roberts said these
probably represented remnants of settlements in the distant past.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Tesco plans Pounds 30m depot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO plans to build its largest distribution depot in Britain on a site
being developed by Gwent Europark, a consortium of developers, beside the M4
motorway at Newport, Gwent.
The Pounds 30m project, conditional on obtaining government grants, would
create 600 jobs within five years and is intended as part of a larger
development that could create more than 2,000 jobs.
The site is at the point where the M4 meets the road link to the second
Severn bridge which is expected to open by 1996.
If Tesco obtains a regional grant from the Welsh Office, it will develop
350,000 sq ft in a first phase - which would be the company's largest
undertaking in Britain, in terms of both capital and floorspace. A second
phase could see the depot extended to 500,000 sq ft.
Tesco already has a 250,000 sq ft dry-goods depot at Chepstow near the Welsh
end of the Severn bridge. The company is understood to have obtained
planning consent for a similar depot near the English end of the second
Severn crossing, but is unlikely to go ahead with that scheme if the grant
is approved. Officals in the Welsh Office believe the scheme meets all the
criteria necessary for financial support.
Tesco's planning application for the Welsh depot, made in conjunction with
Hoggett Lock Necrews, the Welsh arm of international architects Whinney
McKay Lewis, is expected to be approved.

MSF, the general technical union, will become the first union to apply to
the British Standards Institution's BS 5750 corporate quality assurance
scheme, according to Mr Roger Lyons who takes over as general secretary next
week.
Mr Lyons said that no formal application had yet been made but he expected
one to be made after discussion with the union's staff representatives.
Mr Lyons believes that most unions, including his own, need to be more
'user-friendly, customer-conscious and quality-driven'. BS 5750 sets quality
standards for every company, which are assessed by independent experts. MSF
is being advised on staff training by the Industrial Society and all 120
full-time officials have been called in for discussions on the BS 5750
application.
Other unions, including the TGWU general union, have also promised a quality
assessment to guarantee a certain level of service to members.
The TGWU has said that every member will get an individual statement setting
out what they are entitled to.
The GMB general union is also investigating the possibility of gaining the
Investors in People kitemark, which assesses the general level of training
in an organisation and requires a high standard of training and development
in all areas.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMISTS designing drugs will soon be able to use virtual reality technology
to work from inside three-dimensional images of molecules.
Drug design is likely to be one of the most important industrial
applications of virtual reality, and the pharmaceutical industry is expected
to buy tens of millions of pounds' worth of systems once developments are
complete.
A VR helmet will give the illusion of walking through the screen of a
graphics computer and being surrounded by molecular images.
It will be possible to pick up images of atoms and rearrange them in new
chemical patterns by moving the head and manipulating a hand-held device
known as a 3D mouse or bat.
A prototype system - the result of a joint project by York University, the
drug company Glaxo, computer company IBM and specialist VR developer
Division - was unveiled at yesterday's British Association meeting in
Southampton.
Project director Dr Rod Hubbard of York University said: 'The sheer quality
of change that you experience as you move into three dimensions is difficult
to describe.
'Even though the image you see in VR is still crude compared with the
high-resolution computer graphics we normally use, this is in many ways
compensated by being able both to move easily around the image and to
interact directly with the molecular model through natural head and arm
movements.'
The hardware for the project was made by Division, based near Bristol, which
is working with IBM to add virtual reality to the US company's RS/6000
workstation.
The VR development system costs about Pounds 50,000, said Mr Pierre DuPont
of Division, but it is likely to become much cheaper in the future. It uses
a parallel processing computer to cope with the large amounts of data
required.
Eventually, said Dr Peter Murray-Rust of Glaxo, scientists might be able to
'experience' biological molecules such as proteins instead of having to
'learn' them from two-dimensional books.

<TEXT>
SOLDIERS and warfare are playing a significant role in the spread of Aids
through Africa, two experts on the syndrome told the association's meeting.
Sir Donald Acheson, formerly the government's chief medical officer and now
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said war,
'particularly the slow-burning anarchic disturbances currently so
prevalent', was an important factor in Aids, 'as in all sexually transmitted
diseases'.
Sir Donald has just returned from the former Yugoslavia, where he is the
World Health Organisation's special representative.
Dr Andrew Cliff of Cambridge University gave the meeting his detailed
computer analysis of Aids in Uganda, showing that 'military-associated
factors have been instrumental in the development of the geographical
pattern of clinical Aids'.
Sir Donald said homosexual men - the group hit first and hardest by the
disease - were beginning to 'relapse' back to unsafe sexual behaviour in the
UK after avoiding risks during the late 1980s.
Sir Donald also said the latest evidence showed 'beyond a shadow of doubt'
that the UK now had a pool of 'second-generation cases' of heterosexual HIV
infection, acquired within the country. Sir Donald forecast 'famine and a
serious upsurge of respiratory and intestinal disease' in the former
Yugoslavia during the coming winter.
Chemists at Southampton University have developed a candidate Aids drug,
So221, which is undergoing pre-clinical tests.

A DEVICE to measure a person's size and shape in seconds could have
important applications in medicine and the clothing industry.
The Loughborough Anthropometric Shadow Scanner, developed at Loughborough
University, uses projected strips of light and TV cameras linked to a
computer to display body shapes numerically.
Professor Peter Jones, head of the research group, said it intended to
establish a databank of body shapes.

<TEXT>
CARS VARY greatly in how comfortable they are to drive and the amount of
back pain they cause, the Vehicle Ergonomics Group at Loughborough
University said, Clive Cookson writes.
The unit, which has evaluated 100 different cars since 1980, found that one
popular medium-sized car caused almost twice as much lower-back pain as two
of its rivals.
'It would seem that this car should carry a health warning,' said Dr Mark
Porter of the unit, although he refused to identify it.
Dr Porter said a study of high-mileage drivers of the four most popular
fleet cars in the UK showed that more than half were suffering lower-back
pain. Research carried out in the US found that men who spent at least half
of their working lives driving were three times more likely than low-mileage
drivers to develop a slipped disc.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Pension funds call for divorce reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVORCE laws in England and Wales should be changed to require courts to
divide pension rights between the couple, the industry's trade association
said yesterday.
The National Association of Pension Funds' recommendations, which would
bring the law into line with Scotland, would mainly benefit women, with the
aim of helping to ease poverty among divorced women in their old age.
At present, pension rights on divorce are left to the courts' discretion.
Alimony cases that ignore pension benefits often leave ex-wives to compete
with a new wife for pension payments or to forgo it entirely.
With one in three marriages ending in divorce, there have been increased
calls for a change in the law to allow the division of a pension, which is
usually the most valuable asset after the family home.
Under Scottish law, 'matrimonial property' includes the proportion of
pension and insurance rights that are accumulated during the marriage.
The NAPF recommendations include:
The split of rights should take place at the time of divorce and not be
delayed until retirement.
The amount to be divided should be determined by the present value of
pension rights.
The divorced partner should be allowed to use the pension rights only to
provide a retirement pension and not to take cash instead.
The NAPF was responding to proposals put forward by the Pensions Management
Institute working group on pension and divorce, which was set up in
February.
That followed the 1990 Barber judgement from the European Court, which ruled
that pensions are effectively deferred pay and that companies may not
discriminate in pay offered to men and women.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Owners Abroad to cut holidays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS Abroad, Britain's second largest travel company, said yesterday that
it will offer 100,000 fewer summer holidays next year to give some stability
to the package tour market.
The announcement came a day after Thomson, the biggest holiday company, said
it was determined to restore its market share to one third and called on its
rivals to offer fewer holidays in 1993. Thomson said its market share this
year was 30 per cent.
Mr Dermot Blastland, managing director of Owners Abroad's tour operations,
said the company's market share had remained constant at about 19 per cent.
It sold 1.64m summer holidays this year, against a target of 1.75m.
Owners Abroad has frequently said it is more interested in increasing profit
margins than winning a set proportion of the market.
Mr Blastland said the instability and price-cutting in the holiday market
were the result of the collapse of Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure
Group (ILG) last year. Previously, ILG was the second biggest travel
company.
Mr Blastland said that companies had competed for ILG's share of the
business throughout this year. 'When a company with a 20 per cent market
share disappears, it takes a little bit of time to work out the
implications,' he said.
He added that he expected the UK holiday market to decline by about 5 per
cent next year.
Owners Abroad said the average price of its summer holidays would rise by 3
per cent in 1993, a similar increase to that announced by Thomson. The
weakness of the dollar would, however, enable it to reduce prices to Florida
by 10 per cent. It intends to double the number of holidays to Florida to
50,000.

similar to those depicted in science-fiction programmes such as Star Trek -
already exist and some may eventually be available for home use, Professor
Anthony Turner, head of biotechnology at Cranfield Institute of Technology,
told the meeting.
Prof Turner said sophisticated new biosensors and sensitive diagnostic tests
were already being used to monitor glucose levels in diabetics and to detect
pregnancy within a fortnight of conception.
The future of biosensors - accurate detectors created by the linking of
biology and electronics - looks assured.
Medisense, the biotechnology company based in Abingdon, Buckinghamshire, has
developed a kit which allows diabetics to monitor their blood glucose levels
from a single drop of blood, giving accurate results in 20 seconds.
Magazines aimed at women aged between 16 and 35 carry advertisements for
products using biosensors, such as a home ovulation kit to determine their
chance of pregnancy and a kit which can detect success within a minute. Both
rely on the sensitivity of antibodies which latch on to substances produced
by ovulating or pregnant women.
Prof Turner said research was under way in Japan on ways of allowing tests
carried out by biosensors in casualty departments to be used at home as a
form of preventative medicine. However, he warned: 'I'm not sure it's
completely worked through.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Festivals more needy of sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTS FESTIVALS are becom-ing more dependent on business sponsorship as less
public money is made available, according to a report published yesterday.
The report, by the Policy Studies Institute, an independent research body,
was compiled from a survey of 527 arts festivals, and estimates that
festivals had a total income of Pounds 40.6m last year, with a total
expenditure of Pounds 40.9m. More than half said their most recent festival
incurred a deficit, and 13 per cent had an accumulated deficit.
Festival incomes ranged from Pounds 115 to more than Pounds 5.5m. The
largest source of funding for festivals is box-office receipts, which
provide 41 per cent of the total income. Just two festivals, the Edinburgh
International Festival and Glyndebourne Festival Opera, account for more
than a third of total box-office receipts.
General arts festivals are the most likely to attract business funding,
which provides an average 18 per cent of their income. Folk festivals were
the least successful in attracting business sponsorship, obtaining just 3
per cent of their income from that source.
The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts said yesterday that the
amount of competition for business sponsorship funds had increased over the
past few years. 'Most businesses we deal with get between 35 and 100
applications for sponsorship a week,' the association said.
Total business sponsorship of the arts for the year to April 1991 was Pounds
57m. Figures for the year to April 1992 are not yet available, but the
association does not expect the total to drop below the figure for last
year.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Building society ranks may be halved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WILL be only just over half as many building societies by the end of
the century, the industry's leaders believe, according to the results of a
poll in next month's issue of Mortgage Finance Gazette.
A third of building society chief executives believe that 40 of the current
figure of 90 societies will close in the next eight years, though executives
of small societies with assets of less than Pounds 150m remain relatively
optimistic about survival.
The chief executives also believe that sources of profit will shift from
mortgage-related insurance products towards pensions and non-deposit
investment business.
There seems to be general acceptance that new building societies legislation
will not be introduced for at least five years, but that some changes in the
law will be needed much sooner to allow societies to raise more funds in the
commercial money markets.
In spite of this, some society chiefs believe that up to five building
societies will shed mutual status and become banks before the end of the
decade to free themselves of the legal restrictions governing societies.
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-largest building society, has shut seven of its
eight branches in Scotland with the loss of 34 full-time jobs. It had
already closed five Scottish branches in the past two years.

THE PRIVATE rented sector is unlikely to become as significant in the UK
housing market in the foreseeable future as it is in Germany, France or
Scandinavia, according to Housing Finance, the economics journal of the
Council of Mortgage Lenders.
The council says that private rented accommodation makes up only 7.4 per
cent of the UK housing stock, compared with 45 per cent in Germany, 33 per
cent in the US and 18 per cent in France.
Recent market research indicates that owner-occupation was still the most
desired form of tenure in the UK.
The council adds that the surveys show that only a 2 per cent annual
increase in house prices was needed to make ownership more financially
attractive than renting.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Former Punch cartoonist bids for magazine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BID for Punch, once the UK's best-known humorous magazine, has been made
by Mr Bill Tidy, one of its former cartoonists, and Mr John Cocker, a
Canadian physician.
Mr Tidy said yesterday that he and Mr Cocker had lodged a bid for Punch with
Mr Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers, which owns the
title. Punch folded in April after losses of up to Pounds 1m annually,
following 150 years of political, commercial and editorial volatility.
Mr Cocker has a range of publishing involvements, including the Punch Digest
for Canadian Doctors, a bi-monthly subscription-only spin-off of Punch.
Licensed by United Newspapers, the magazine publishes extracts from Punch
and other humour and lifestyle pieces.
Mr Tidy declined to say how much his bid was, but it is thought to be
substantially less than the Pounds 6m United Newspapers was said to be
looking for following the closure of Punch.
Mr Tidy said yesterday: 'The only thing we have in our favour is an
assurance from United Newspapers that they would only sell to someone who
would carry on Punch's tradition of first-rate humour. They have refused
offers from quite large institutions.
'It's a funny world, is business; sometimes money talks, sometimes pride and
prejudice talks. I can't fight the giants but we can't let them buy
everything, can we?'
Punch hit its circulation peak in the 1940s, reaching about 175,000 readers
weekly. By last year that had collapsed to no more than 33,000, hit by rival
publications and changing tastes in humour.
United Newspapers has a number of assets that are associated with the
magazine. The title is still a good brand name. The Punch library and
archive is still supplying cartoons and pictures to a wide range of
customers, as well as publishing a variety of cartoon anthologies from the
magazine's archives.
Mr Tidy's connection with Punch started in 1958, although he departed a
short time before it folded, in a disagreement over senior editorial
appointments. Mr Tidy said that United Newspapers had promised 'to let us
know as soon as possible'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Pounds 20,000 fine imposed after roof fall death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEICESTER magistrates yesterday imposed a record fine of Pounds 20,000 plus
costs on a company which broke health and safety rules. The offences came to
light after an employee died when he fell through a roof.
The Alexandra Stone Company was fined Pounds 18,000 after pleading guilty to
failing to display a warning notice on the roof and a further Pounds 2,000
because other safety precautions had not been taken.
The fine was the highest since higher limits for fines by magistrates were
introduced earlier this year. Under the Offshore Safety Act 1992, certain
health and safety offences committed on or after March 6 became subject to
maximum fines of Pounds 20,000. The previous limit had been Pounds 2,000.
The new maximum also applies to Sheriffs' courts in Scotland.
Alexandra Stone is based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, and produces
paving slabs and kerbstones.
The man who died was Mr Amrik Singh, 56, a production foreman who had worked
for the company for more than 30 years. He fell through the asbestos cement
roof while walking along a valley gutter.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Building orders fall by a fifth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION orders won by British contractors slumped by almost a fifth
during the three months to the end of June, according to figures published
yesterday by the Department of the Environment.
The fall in orders, along with fears that British interest rates may have to
rise to defend sterling, sent construction and building material shares
tumbling further on the London stock exchange yesterday.
According to the department the value of construction orders at constant
1985 prices fell by 18 per cent on the corresponding period last year and by
19 per cent compared with the previous three months.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'These are desperate,
dire figures which show that the recession is still deepening in housing and
construction. They underline the slump in industrial investment.'
He added: 'The slump in this industry is acting as a massive drag on the
rest of the economy.'
Housing and construction activity affected a range of industrial products
from bricks, cement and steel to carpets, textiles, light bulbs and white
goods, said Mr Straw.
According to the environment department, private housing orders in the
second quarter of this year were 13 per cent lower than in the corresponding
period last year and 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months.
Private commercial orders, mainly offices and shops, were 28 per cent lower
than in the corresponding period last year and 29 per cent lower than in the
preceding three months.
Private industrial orders were 28 per cent and 25 per cent respectively
lower over the same periods. Public-sector orders, other than housing, were
8 per cent and 7 per cent lower.
Construction companies have recently expressed concern that the government
may seek to restrain public spending on construction to offset rises in
social security payments caused by rises in unemployment. Contractors, in
particular, fear that road spending could be curtailed.
The only bright spot in the figures was a sharp rise in public housing and
housing association orders which rose by 36 per cent compared with the
corresponding quarter last year.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Ford set to cut prices on old stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, leader in the UK market for new cars, is expected shortly to announce
price cuts of between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,000 for selected cars across
its range to dispose of outstanding stocks of 1992 models.
The package of price cuts and other financial incentives is the latest sign
of distress marketing by carmakers in the UK.
The industry has been hit by disappointing sales during the crucial month of
August. Figures released earlier this week showed that registrations in the
first 20 days of the month at 290,550 were only 0.9 per cent higher than the
same period a year ago.
Sales of new cars have not rallied in spite of measures by carmakers
including widespread dealer discounting and offers of free insurance, free
road-fund licences and low-cost finance for buyers.
Ford's last price-cutting initiative came in the wake of the March Budget,
which halved the rate of special car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. In
addition, Ford made further price cuts averaging 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent
on models representing around 30 per cent of its sales volume.
A tentative improvement in overall sales of new cars was achieved in the
three months from April to June, but sales fell year-on-year in July and
after the first seven months of the year registrations were still 4.3 per
cent lower than last year's very depressed level.
Ford and Rover have already imposed short-time working on several of their
UK vehicle assembly lines to cut production and reduce excessive stock
levels.
The indication that Ford is planning another round of price cuts on old
stock follows the warning earlier this week from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders that rapidly rising imports coupled with the poor
state of domestic demand 'must increase the risk of stock problems in the
months to come'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Exodus of Names from Lloyd's slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES ARE leaving Lloyd's of London at a far slower rate than expected,
according to a senior member of the insurance market's governing council.
About 1,600 Names, the individuals who provide capital to underwrite
insurance risks, are expected to leave at the end of this year, compared
with almost 4,000 who resigned in 1991. That would leave Lloyd's with just
over 20,000 Names next year.
Members of the governing council are becoming increasingly optimistic about
the market's prospects as they await the outcome of a poll of Names, which
is in effect a vote of confidence in the council.
Voting ends at noon on Friday and the result should be known that afternoon.
Names are voting on several resolutions, including a proposal from a
dissident group to rescind the levy imposed in June to top up Lloyd's
central fund, which aims at ensuring that the insurance liabilities of
bankrupt Names are met. It would be an embarrassment to the council if Names
voted to rescind the levy.
However, the senior council member said that such a vote would have a
symbolic effect only as it is impossible for the Pounds 500m raised with the
levy to be returned. 'It could, however, prevent us from making further such
levies.'
Meanwhile, it emerged that the exodus of Names would lead to a reduction in
the market's underwriting capacity from Pounds 10bn to Pounds 9bn. But
Lloyd's has taken some special measures to boost the amount of business that
an individual can underwrite for a given stock of capital to offset the
affect of the Names' resignations. The effect of these measures could be to
maintain the market's underwriting capacity at Pounds 10bn.
The council is also pleased that the average underwriting capacity for each
Name is rising, from Pounds 340,000 in 1988 to Pounds 455,000 this year and
an estimated Pounds 500,000 next year. It believes this shows that only
individuals with the appropriate financial resources are continuing to
participate in the market.
The council also believes that the market's productivity is improving. Its
ratio of overheads to income appears to have risen because of costs
associated with redundancies, but it is convinced that underlying running
costs are falling.
One reason for this is a reduction in the number of syndicates, which pool
Names resources. Smaller syndicates are being absorbed by larger ones,
leading to economies of scale.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Man is charged over tunnel contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAN appeared at Bow Street magistrates court yesterday charged by the
Serious Fraud Office with corruption in connection with a contract tender to
provide pipes for the Channel tunnel, Raymond Hughes writes.
Mr Thomas East, former procurement supervisor with H and G Engineering, a UK
process engineering and management contractor, was remanded on conditional
bail until September 23. He was ordered to be held in custody until he could
produce sureties totalling Pounds 400,000.
The charge against Mr East alleges that, on a day before June 25 1991, he
corruptly agreed to accept a gift or consideration as an inducement or
reward 'for doing an act or showing favour in relation to his principal's
affairs, namely, providing information or assistance for the benefit of
Hoesch Export AG in relation to a contract tender for pipes on the Channel
Tunnel project'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Banker's claim of unfair dismissal fails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEN Ellis, who was sacked as head of the foreign-exchange department of
merchant bank Robert Fleming in June 1989, cannot make a claim that he was
unfairly dismissed, a London industrial tribunal ruled yesterday.
The tribunal said his claim should have been made within three months of his
dismissal.
Mr Ellis told the tribunal that his career was in ruins. He said he could
not get a job in the City because of 'gossip' about his role in an al-leged
fraud at Robert Fleming.
Mr Craig Hope, solicitor for Robert Fleming, said Mr Ellis had been
dismissed for breaches of staff dealing rules and other irregularities. Mr
Ellis denied he had breached bank regulations.
In 1989 Robert Fleming called in the Serious Fraud Office to investigate
irregularities discovered in its foreign-exchange dealings. The bank
confirmed yesterday that the investigation had not resulted in any
prosecutions.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Plea to lenders on repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER PEOPLE might be made homeless if local authorities were informed when
mortgage lenders planned to repossess homes in their area, according to a
report published today by the London Research Centre, an independent think
tank.
A survey of English councils found that nine out of 10 councils rarely or
never received advance notification of repossessions. The Council of
Mortgage Lenders' code of guidance advises lenders to give advance warning
where rehousing by the local authority might be necessary.
The survey found that local authorities had limited scope to help owners in
arrears, apart from delaying repossession until alternative accommodation
could be found.
Few councils operate mortgage-rescue schemes: just 22 had schemes although a
further 25 were planning them. The survey estimates that, among the 19
authorities able to provide figures, only 136 repossessions were halted by
mortgage-rescue schemes in 1991-92. No local authority planned more than 30
rescues for 1992-93.
However, four out of five councils provided some sort of specialist advice
or debt counselling for mortgage arrears, either directly or by funding
agencies such as local Citizens' Advice Bureaux.
And with lenders adopting a more flexible attitude to repossessions, the
report suggests that local authorities may be able to help people with
mortgage arrears to reach arrangements that allow them to remain in their
homes.

<DATELINE>
   THE ENTRY and pass rates for GCSEs
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the main examinations for 16-year-olds in England and Wales - reached record
levels this year, but the number of entries in maths was sharply down,
according to provisional results released yesterday.
The results show that pupils sat for a total of 5.1m examinations, 1.3 per
cent up on last year, with a 2.3 per cent increase in the proportion of
passes at grades A to C.
More than half the entries were awarded one of the top three grades,
generally regarded as the pass standard. One in eight entries was awarded a
grade A.
The number of maths entries was down by 2.6 per cent, but the number for
English was the same as last year. The Joint Council for the GCSE said the
decline in maths, which will cause concern, might have been caused by a
shift to non-national courses.
There were increases in the percentages gaining grades A to C in all three
national curriculum subjects. In English the percentage rose from 54 per
cent last year to 55 per cent, in maths from 43 to 45 per cent, and in
science from 37 to 44 per cent this year.
Business studies was the subject recording the largest one-year increase in
GCSE entries, up 17 per cent. Last week's figures for A-level entries also
showed it to be growing rapidly in popularity among 18-year-olds.
Entries in modern languages were up 5 per cent, with a large increase in
entries for 'single science' at the expense of biology, chemistry and
physics.
Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, dismissed suggestions that the GCSE was
getting easier. 'We can now look forward to seeing more students than ever
continuing in education beyond the age of 16,' he said.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said the improved performance made the government's determination
to limit the coursework component of the GCSE 'totally inexplicable'. He
added: 'All over the country the evidence points to coursework as a key
motivating factor in improved performance.'
The results broadly mirrored last week's A-level results, which also showed
improved performance in spite of a continued decline in maths and science.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Exports surge by 50% at British Nuclear Fuels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 50 PER CENT surge in export sales helped British Nuclear Fuels, the
state-owned company that supplies and reprocesses fuel for the nuclear power
industry, increase its annual pre-tax profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 161m.
Turnover increased by Pounds 40m to Pounds 1,028m, although the rise in
export sales to Pounds 268m was partly offset by what BNFL said was a
temporary reduction in UK sales. The company increased its dividend to the
government, its sole shareholder, by Pounds 2m to Pounds 52m.
Mr Neville Chamberlain, chief executive, said increased exports were the key
to future growth. BNFL had opened an office in Seoul in response to South
Korea's expanding nuclear programme, and it could also have a valuable role
in Russia in improving nuclear safety and by dismantling nuclear weapons.
Two-thirds of BNFL's business is covered by fixed-price deals with Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear, worth Pounds 17bn over the next 15 years.
Mr Chamberlain said: 'Our future income is largely secured. Whether we
prosper or not depends on how well we control our costs.'
The company's cost-cutting programme has already involved 750 job losses at
its head office at Risley, Cheshire. In May it announced that 550 jobs were
to be lost at its uranium enrichment plant in Capenhurst, Cheshire, because
of the collapse of the market since the end of the cold war.
In addition to providing fuel for other nuclear plants, BNFL operates two
power stations at Calder Hall on the Sellafield site in Cumbria, and
Chapelcross in southern Scotland.
Its Pounds 2.8bn thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield is due to
open early next year and already has an order book worth about Pounds 9bn.
Sir Christopher Harding, former company chairman, said: 'Those who see
global warming, exacerbated by the burning of fossil fuels, as one of the
main long-term threats to the environment cannot long ignore the benign
contribution to rising world energy demand which nuclear power represents.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Neighbours build up links with Pretoria -
Philip Gawith on a struggling region which has found a new level of
co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC need has concentrated political minds in southern Africa where
seven countries are co-operating in the handling of 8.2m tonnes of maize
imported into the region, which has been devastated by one of the worst
droughts this century.
At the heart of the scheme is Spoornet, the state-run South African rail
company, enjoying a level of regional co-operation which would have been
unthinkable during the apartheid years.
Although co-operation over the shipments was prompted by fears in some areas
of possible starvation, it is also a sign of it being more acceptable for
South Africa's neighbours - Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia
and Malawi - to be seen doing business with it now that a transition to
democracy is under way. This raises the question of what steps South Africa
should take to integrate itself formally into the region and what sort of
economic assistance the international community can offer.
At the heart of these issues lies one broad plank of consensus: the southern
African region will prosper or perish as a unit. Although differences in
wealth and resources between countries mean that there will not be an even
rate of progress or failure, it is inconceivable that South Africa will
flourish in splendid isolation or that its neighbours will progress without
it.
South Africa is well aware, in the phrase of Dr Anton Rupert, the famous
tobacco entrepreneur: 'If your neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep
peacefully.' Already there are 27,000 Mozambican refugees living in the
eastern Transvaal, victims of drought and civil war. Refugees are also
filtering into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe.
Not only does this sort of inflow strain limited resources, but the economic
fragility of South Africa's neighbours also limits what ought to be
important markets. According to a study by the London-based Overseas
Development Institute (ODI)*, Africa accounts for only 7 per cent of South
Africa's exports, with a quarter of this going to Zimbabwe.
Aside from trade and humanitarian concerns, regional politicians are also
aware that, in an era of capital scarcity, they have a lot of work to do if
they are to garner even a fraction of international capital flows, very
little of which currently come to Africa.
The main obstacles to foreign investment in the region are problems of
political instability, economic decay and a dilapidated infrastructure.
However, the recent talks between Mozambican President Joachim Chissano and
rebel Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, the upcoming elections in Angola, and
South Africa's transition process all represent important progress, albeit
of a very fragile kind.
Peace, however, is only the first step. The extent to which governments will
subsequently be able to forge a framework of economic co-operation remains
to be seen.
The potential for regional integration is also complicated by South Africa's
dominant position whereby its gross national product (GNP) exceeds the
combined GNP of the 20 member countries of the two regional trade groupings
 -the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) and the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the new version of SADCC - by about 40 per cent.
Conventional wisdom suggests that greater economic convergence is necessary
for successful integration.
In their more sanguine moments, South Africa's neighbours look on it as a
market for their goods, and a source of funds for projects which other
international investors or governments won't fund. Underlying that, however,
is an anxiety that the normalisation of South Africa's political situation
may be to their disadvantage.
Thus the ODI special report, which investigates the possibility of granting
financial and trade privileges to South Africa, found that the most common
reaction outside South Africa when the possibility of EC preferences was
raised was 'incredulity'. The report finds, however, that the gains from
preferential trade regimes with the EC would be small because the bulk of
South Africa's exports are metals and minerals which face low barriers.
The authors conclude, therefore, that since South Africa's principal
economic problems are domestic, not external, foreign assistance would
probably best be directed elsewhere. This thinking is likely to be consonant
with the priorities of any future government, which will face overwhelming
pressure to improve domestic social conditions.
Trade concessions will be welcome, and regional integration may provide a
warm feeling of returning to the fold, but these issues will not top any
list of economic priorities.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Hurricane batters southern US but lets insurers off lightly
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US
history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana,
inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the
low-lying city of New Orleans.
The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed
north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday
night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun
country.
Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was
much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to
total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior
member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday.
In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per
hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City,
Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles
west of New Orleans.
Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday
afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained
windspeeds were below 75 mph.
Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and
thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths
in Florida and three in the Bahamas.
The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining
industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was
cut.
The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said
that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn
of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property,
he said.
In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose
basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band
across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house
sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill
in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal.
Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and
shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been
badly damaged, a Holiday Inn.
Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and
health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all
water.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the
insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have
raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S first presidential impeachment process seems set to go ahead, after
the approval yesterday by a special congressional commission of a report
accusing President Fernando Collor of large-scale corruption.
Amid loud cheers, 16 of the 21-member commission voted to accept the report,
including four who had been expected to support Mr Collor. Mr Marcelo
Barbieri of the Democratic Movement (PMDB), the main opposition party, said:
'To vote against the report is to vote against morality'.
Mr Marcelo Levenere, the head of the Brazilian Lawyers' Association,
announced after the vote that he and the head of the national journalists'
association would file next Wednesday a formal request for Mr Collor's
impeachment.
As street protests increase, those parties supporting the government are
wavering, fearing their candidates might suffer in municipal elections in
October. One minister told the Financial Times that Mr Collor no longer had
the 168 votes needed in Congress to stave off an impeachment initiative.
The two main pro-government parties are split internally. Mr Paulo Maluf,
head of the Social Democratic party (PDS), estimated that 30 of his 44
members would vote for impeachment. Members of the Liberal Front party (PFL)
from Minas Gerais state said they were withdrawing their support for Mr
Collor.
The minister said the president would not quit and seemed to be 'living in
the clouds'. He added, however, that the country was being governed by the
cabinet under Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister. 'We are staying
on, not out of support for Collor but to make sure that at least the
administration continues to function,' he said.
On Tuesday night, political parties used their television time for the
election campaign almost exclusively to attack the president.
A two-thirds vote in Congress is required for the process to begin, at which
point Mr Collor would be suspended from office.

DAEWOO, South Korea's fourth-biggest conglomerate, is set to produce 180,000
cars a year in Uzbekistan from 1995, in one of the biggest automotive deals
yet signed in the former Soviet Union, local agency reports say.
The Russian Interfax news service reported that Daewoo had agreed to form
the car-manufacturing joint venture with Avtoselkhozmash, an Uzbek state
company.
Three car models will be produced at a tractor trailer plant in Asaka.
The Daewoo deal highlights the interest that many foreign car companies are
now showing in breaking into the potentially vast market in the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
Yesterday, Moscow staged its first international motor show since 1913,
enticing most of the big western companies into exhibiting some of their
latest models.
Mr Andrei Loginov, president of the Russian Automobile Federation, said the
Russian car market was growing by more than 600,000 units a year, including
an increasing representation of foreign brands.
Many western companies said they were attending the show as a marketing
exercise, but were also hoping to develop channels to distribute their cars
in Russia.
Mr James Walker, a representative of Trinity Motors, which has recently
started distributing General Motors cars in Russia, said the market was a
lot stronger than many people realised.
'We have researched this market for two years and looked into whether there
are really buyers here.
'We think about 3 per cent of people in Moscow could afford to buy a Dollars
30,000 (Pounds 15,075) car,' Mr Walker asserted.
'We are talking about a total of 300,000 people.'
Volvo, the Swedish car company, which has long had a representation in
Russia, estimates it will sell 5,000 cars this year, more than twice the
number for 1991.

NEW orders for manufactured durable goods, a key indicator of the US
economy's health, fell 3.4 per cent last month, the US Commerce Department
reported yesterday, Nancy Dunne writes in Washington. The fall, the biggest
since December, was mainly due to a big drop in demand for transport
equipment, especially aircraft, after a revised rise of 2.8 per cent for
June, previously estimated at 2.7 per cent.
The one strength in the new figures was a 2.7 per cent increase in
electronic and electrical equipment orders, with a 3.9 per cent rise in
shipments. The 10 domestic US automakers reported that, despite a 31 per
cent surge in truck sales, car sales had dipped 0.2 per cent for the month.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community has to come up with a quick solution to the oilseeds
row if it wants to avoid US retaliation, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative, said yesterday.
'Our timetable on this oilseeds dispute is immediate, indeed it is
yesterday. We are well overdue to have a solution there,' Mrs Hills
declared. 'I'm certainly hopeful Europe will find a solution, because we
have no choice, we will have to take action if we don't (agree) in the very
near future.'
Washington says its soyabean growers had been hurt by EC subsidies, and the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has twice ruled in its favour
despite a revamp of the EC system after the first ruling.
The US has drawn up a list of EC food and drink imports worth Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 502m) on which it says it will impose prohibitive duties if it does
not get satisfaction.
On Monday, the American Soyabean Association (ASA), urged Mrs Hills to
proceed immediately to implement retaliatory action against the EC. 'We do
not make this recommendation lightly,' said Mr Steve Yoder, president of the
ASA. 'Unfortunately, EC unwillingness to make substantive reforms in its
internal oilseeds subsidy regime has left our industries no other options.'
Lack of progress against the EC oilseeds regime after five years undermined
confidence in rule enforcement under Gatt, he added.
The row is being handled under a Gatt disputes procedure which allows 60
days to find a solution that may include compensation. The deadline expired
last week but Washington has so far not published its list of retaliatory
duties.
Failure to find a solution could undermine the standing of Gatt as a
troubleshooter, Mrs Hills said yesterday.
'If panel reports are to be treated with such disdain, and there is not to
be a credible response, you really have a lack of credibility,' she said.
'If we don't have a decent disputes settlement mechanism, it really puts
tremendous pressure on nations to stand by Gatt. I don't think that is what
Europe wants, I surely hope that is not what Europe wants.'

<TEXT>
COOPER ROLLS, a joint venture between the UK's Rolls-Royce engineering
company and Cooper Industries of the US, has won orders worth over Dollars
140m (Pounds 70.3m) for 16 Coberra gas turbine systems.
The turbines will be installed on oil and gas platforms offshore of India,
and will be part of three large projects undertaken by the Oil and Natural
Gas Commission of India (ONGC).
Rolls-Royce Industrial and Marine Gas Turbines' share of the contract will
be Dollars 50m for seven RB211 and nine Avon industrial gas generators.
The orders take ONGC's total of Rolls-Royce engines installed or on order to
35. All have been ordered for offshore work.
Coberra gas turbines range in power output from 10MW to 30MW, with more than
500 systems installed or on order worldwide.
More than 110 have been supplied for offshore work.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Cultural warriors misfiring: Jurek Martin finds the Bush
campaign lagging in the polls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, they can be likened to Woody Allen;
to television evangelist Rev Pat Robertson they are agents of atheist
lesbians; to California Attorney-General Dan Lungren, they would release
convicted murderers in droves; to polemecist/politician Pat Buchanan, they
are on the wrong side of a cultural and religious war, and want pre-teens to
be able to sue their parents.
To President George Bush, they are rarely to be mentioned by name, though
inference is fine. For him they are, mostly by implication, mere physical
cowards, enviromental terrorists and without God - but everything that
everybody else says about them is just fine, too. They would also tax and
spend as if there were no tomorrow - and enjoy it.
The 'black hats' are, of course, Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential candidate, his wife Hillary, vice-presidential candidate Al
Gore, and all the Democratic political barons in Congress. The 'white hats'
are those with a different, more 'decent' and, naturally, Republican vision
of what life in America should be about.
Such is the great divide in the past week in the life of the US presidential
election campaign.
The basic question for the Bush campaign, as the fervour from the Republican
convention in Houston last week dissipates, is whether or not it is barking
up the wrong social tree by painting an exclusionary picture of an American
society that has otherwise long been characterised as a melting-pot
eternally susceptible to change.
This may only be part of the broader election canvas, which also runs to
more legitimate criticism of the opposition and to defence of the
presidential record, especially in foreign policy. But the Republicans so
far have chosen to make it a very substantial element.
The early evidence is that this decision is not working. The New York
Times/CBS poll yesterday not only found Mr Clinton's lead over Mr Bush
widening again, to 51:36 per cent from the single digits of convention week,
but it also revealed a public far more interested in what Mr Bush (and Mr
Clinton) might have to say about the economy and health care than about
issues, such as the rights of homosexuals and the promotion of religion and
family values, that so dominated at Houston.
Nor did the poll find much interest in the sort of changes in society that
Mr Bush advocates - in effect a return to the traditional nuclear family
around one male breadwinner, car-pooling and church. No fewer than 95 per
cent of those surveyed agreed there was a need for 'real change in the way
things are going in the country'. Only 15 per cent (and only a third of Mr
Bush's supporters) thought the president could bring that about; 61 per cent
thought Mr Clinton could.
Only in the Deep South, where the fundamentalist strain runs deepest, and
among Roman Catholics, those most exercised by abortion, had Mr Bush
significantly trimmed his pre-convention deficit. Even Mr Robert Teeter,
campaign chairman and a veteran pollster, conceded he thought that
nationally Mr Bush was still behind 'about 50-40 per cent'. The president,
on a personal approval rating still below 40 per cent, is reading and
hearing with distressing frequency that no incumbent president has recovered
from such depths so late in the campaign and won re-election.
Earlier surveys this week from Time and Newsweek magazines had come to much
the same conclusion. Time found only 10 per cent subscribing to the
Republican party platform's view that abortion should be made illegal in all
circumstances. An accompanying article quoted a construction company
executive as saying he rated family values as a campaign issue behind
'counting all the sand on all the beaches in the world'.
The nature of the Republican onslaught has given a field day to the
president's critics. Mr George Will, conservative columnist, yesterday
described the Bush campaign as an 'intellectual slum', with 'its riff-raff
of liars and aspiring ayatollahs'. A New York Times editorial said that
moderate Republicans and principled conservatives 'have every reason to
worry about the drift of their party into the hands of those who would use
faith as a cudgel'.
The Bush campaign dismisses such criticism as a reflection of the liberal
media's bias, though no liberal has ever claimed Mr Will as a soulmate.
Moreover, the distaste expressed in print and on the air from both sides of
the political divide does help shape public perceptions, as any listener to
a radio talk show quickly discovers.
The president had hoped he could get away by seeming above the most partisan
and personal of the onslaughts, especially those directed at Mrs Clinton,
portrayed as the ultimate radical feminist. But, since the convention, he
has shared platforms with both Mr Gingrich and Rev Robertson, and expressed
no visible dissent.
Nor has the president dissociated himself in the slightest from the bleak
description of cultural and religious warfare conjured up by Mr Buchanan,
whose campaign in the Republican primary elections against Mr Bush, for what
he used to call 'the soul of the Republican party', only attracted a quarter
of the party electorate.
The inevitable conclusion is that Mr Bush is being increasingly seen as a
captive of the exclusionary religious and ideological right. This alone
cannot win him another term in the White House. Another tactical shift in
his campaign seems very probable.

FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Long-term boost for Taiwan in split with S
Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE between South Korea and Taiwan will suffer initial damage after
diplomatic links end between the two, but some sectors of Taiwan industry
expect to benefit in the long term from the split.
Taiwan made known its intention to sever diplomatic ties with Mr Roh
Tae-woo's government last weekend, calling the recent Seoul-Beijing
reconciliation 'a hostile and unfriendly act'.
At the same time, Mr Frederick Chien, foreign minister, said preferential
import tariffs and quotas which helped create a Dollars 494m (Pounds 248m)
deficit with South Korea in 1991 would be scrapped, and direct air links,
except by foreign carriers, suspended on September 15.
Despite pledges by Mr Vincent Siew, economics minister, that South Korea
would receive the same treatment as non-privileged trading partners,
Taiwan's anger at not being informed earlier of Seoul's decision to
recognise Beijing has prompted some retaliatory action.
South Korea's car import quota for 1992 will be cut short only two-thirds
filled, the National Consumer Association has urged a boycott of South
Korean goods, and Mr Eugene Chien, communications minister, has said South
Korean bids for infrastructure projects in the six-year plan, assessed at
Dollars 300bn, would not be welcome.
The break was a blow for Taiwan's government, but analysts say trade volume
with South Korea is too small to have much effect on the island's export-led
economy.
South Korea is Taiwan's 13th biggest trading partner, and two-way trade
totalled Dollars 3.03bn last year.
Mr Siew said Taiwan would 'maintain civilian, economic and trade ties with
South Korea based on reciprocity and mutual benefit'.
A South Korean delegation is expected in Taipei in September to discuss
formation of unofficial ties; officials expect direct flights to return to
normal once new links are cemented.
News of the Taipei-Seoul split was welcomed in the steel, petrochemical and
shipping industries, which have complained of dumping and undercutting of
rates among their South Korean competitors.
An official of Taiwan's Iron and Steel Industries Association said: 'We had
plenty of evidence (of dumping), but when it got to the cabinet, diplomatic
considerations came in, and nothing was done.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / German banks defend low saver rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN banks defended themselves yesterday against charges that they were
paying too little interest on savings accounts, arguing that rates paid on
most deposits were well above the inflation rate.
Stung by the Federal Cartel office's decision to investigate savings rates
in the Berlin area, leading banks said that most pass-book accounts - on
which low rates are mostly payable - were used as cash accounts, with money
available on demand.
The cartel office, based in Berlin, said it was limiting its inquiries to
the city to keep down the cost and complexity of the operation. But it said
the suspicion that banks were colluding to keep rates low on pass-book
savings applied to the whole country.
The cartel office has written to banks informing them of its scrutiny and
will send a further letter with detailed questions about their position and
policies in the savings market. The banks under investigation are: Deutsche
Bank, Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank, Berliner Bank, Berliner Volksbank,
Grundkreditbank, Landesbank Berlin, and the Postbank.
If the cartel office finds against the banks, it can require them to lift
rates. It said there were around DM500bn (Pounds 179bn) of savings in
pass-book accounts, of which roughly half were subject to interest rates of
less than 3 per cent. This is below the inflation rate and has hardly risen
in recent years.
The cartel authorities received support from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy
president of the Bundesbank, who said banks should do more to encourage the
expansion of savings across a wide spectrum of the population.
However, banks said the strong growth in savings deposits, helped by the
switch of east German savers to higher-rate accounts, showed they were
offering competitive rates. At mid-year, Deutsche Bank had DM40bn-worth of
savings deposits, only a quarter of which were in pass-book accounts paying
an average 2.7 per cent; the rest were mostly at rates of 7 per cent or
more.
To obtain higher rates, savers need a minimum of DM5,000. Pass-book accounts
are for savings of less than DM2,000. The cartel office claimed this
discriminated against people saving small amounts regularly to build up a
larger balance.

France's trade account returned to the black last month with a surplus of

This means that France has had a trading surplus for six of the first seven

<TEXT>
FIGHTING intensified in Georgia yesterday as President Eduard Shevardnadze
said efforts to end his army's battle with Abkhazian separatists were going
nowhere. However, the Georgian president retracted a threat by his regional
commander to attack the Abkhazian stronghold.
Georgian officials yesterday said about 1,500 separatists and northern
Caucasian volunteers had attacked the town of Gagra, near Russia's southern
border, in the worst fighting so far in the two-week conflict. Both sides
reported minimal casualties among their own forces, but claimed to have
inflicted dozens.
Mr Shevardnadze said he was speaking daily by telephone with the leader of
the uprising, Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, and with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, whom both sides see as a potential mediator. Yesterday, Mr
Shevardnadze sent an envoy with a Russian parliamentary delegation to Mr
Ardzinba's stronghold of Gudauta. The delegation aims to narrow differences
between the sides prior to planned talks on September 3 between Mr
Shevardnadze and Mr Ardzinba, to be overseen by Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Shevardnadze also backed away from an ultimatum issued on Tuesday by the
Georgian commander in Abkhazia, Colonel Gia Karkarashvili. Col Karkarashvili
made the threat - he said he would attack Gudauta directly if Mr Ardzinba
did not surrender by 1pm yesterday - after the Abkhazians killed two
Georgian negotiators during talks on Monday.
'Ultimatums do not work practically,' Mr Shevardnadze said. 'The
commander-in-chief of the guards reacted this way because two of his men
were killed. The only part of the ultimatum that I approved was that if they
stopped blowing up bridges and railways, if they stopped all this, 'we would
no longer be facing you'.'
Mr Shevardnadze made it clear that he accepted a major role for Mr Yeltsin
in ending the conflict. He said Mr Yeltsin had promised to try to seal up
the mountain gorge of Bzipi, through which more than 1,500 forces from
sympathetic northern Caucasians regions, such as Chechenia, have joined the
Abkhazian side.

FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Tornados to record military activity in south Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS sending six Tornado aircraft to the Gulf today to help enforce
the allied 'no-fly' zone in south Iraq. Three will be equipped with
television cameras to record Iraqi military activity against the Shia rebels
in the south of the country.
The pilots and navigators, including some who served in the Gulf war, left
the UK yesterday with logistic support equipment and supplies.
They are to monitor the region south of the 32nd parallel for both aircraft
movement, banned under the 'no-fly' zone rules, and for military action
against the Shias.
They will not try to prevent ground attacks that Iraq might launch on Shias.
Television recordings taken of any attacks will be presented to the UN
Security Council and some might be made public.
The allies will, however, take 'appropriate action' to prevent breaches of
the 'no-fly' zone.
The six Tornado aircraft should arrive in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, by 3pm
today, just 30 minutes before the 'no-fly' zone comes into effect. Dhahran
is 600km south of the main Shia region.
Three of the aircraft are Tornado GR1 reconnaissance aircraft which will fly
'at medium height' - above 20,000ft. They are equipped with TIALD - thermal
imaging and laser designating - observation equipment used in the Gulf war.
This time they will also be fitted with television cameras accurate enough,
for example, to pick out the number of wheels on a road vehicle.
The other three are Tornado GR1A bomber aircraft fitted with sensors
designed for low-level flying. They will be used in conjunction with French
Mirage 2000 and US fighter aircraft, possibly F15s and F16s.
All three countries co-operate on patrols over the Kurdish region of Iraq,
north of the 36th parallel, where a 'no-fly' zone already applies. UK
defence experts said yesterday that Iraqi aircraft flew over the southern
region as recently as Tuesday.
They said that Iraq was also involved in heavy construction work in the
region but that it was not possible to tell whether this was a canal being
dug to drain the marshland in which the Shias are based, or if a road was
being built to take heavy armour deep into this difficult terrain.
The construction might be preparation for an Iraqi push into the marshlands
within days. One source said Iraq had attacked the region roughly once a
month since spring 1991 and the last such sortie took place at the end of
July. More than 75,000 men from 10 Iraqi divisions are based around the Shia
area.

<TEXT>
RUSSIAN authorities have convinced the International Monetary Fund they plan
to stick to their current agreement with the Fund on the eve of debt talks
with the Group of Seven.
Mr Richard Erb, the Fund's deputy managing director, said yesterday that Mr
Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, was one of those who had
agreed, despite saying in a newspaper interview last week that the deal with
the IMF should be changed.
His public statement appears to have been inspired more by domestic
political considerations, and yesterday's show of unity with the IMF was
probably necessitated by a keen desire to obtain a rapid rescheduling of the
former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 35.1bn) foreign debt.
A Russian delegation arrived in Paris yesterday for talks today with G7
representatives to press for a rescheduling of the debt. Russia's first
agreement with the Fund, which released an initial credit tranche of Dollars
1bn while setting economic targets for this year, is a basic condition for a
wider agreement on rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations to
agree to reschedule.
Mr Erb said the Paris Club could agree to a rescheduling before Russia
concluded a full standby agreement with the Fund. The standby, setting
targets for next year, is to be negotiated in September and October. If it
is agreed, it would unlock a further Dollars 3bn in IMF resources that were
part of a Dollars 24bn western aid package promised for this year.
Mr Erb said it was too early to say whether Russia could meet inflation and
budget deficit targets agreed for the end of this year.
But although he had warned the Russian authorities against the temptations
of 'spending just a little more here and a little more there', he repeated
that the Fund would be flexible. 'There will be adaptations on the way. You
cannot put in place up front a detailed road map.'

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT least 10 South African police generals are expected to be forced to
retire soon in a police shake-up aimed at countering widespread criticism of
the role of security forces in township violence.
According to the Star, the Johannesburg daily newspaper, police generals who
have failed to adapt to the new political situation brought about by
government reform will be retired. A police spokesman would not confirm the
report, but said the minister of law and order, Mr Hernus Kriel, would make
a statement on the issue.
Such a move, involving about a fifth of the force's generals, would
represent one of the most important steps yet taken by President FW de Klerk
to tackle the problem of poor policing, which has contributed significantly
to township violence. Some 7,000 people have died in such fighting since
1990.
The move could also help smooth the way for resuming talks on a
post-apartheid constitution, suspended two months ago by the African
National Congress, which alleged police involvement in the massacre of over
40 people at the Boipatong squatter camp near Johannesburg. The ANC is
demanding government moves to tackle violence before it will resume the
talks.
A report by British investigators last month found no evidence of direct
police complicity in the Boipatong incident, but portrayed the police as
incompetent.
The investigators said that the South African police force 'suffers serious
organisational problems', and lacked 'adequate mechanisms for internal and
external accountability, since they seem unable or unwilling to establish
what action was taken by whom with what result'.
In an attempt to improve the credibility of the force, which is widely
distrusted by blacks, three black police generals are to be appointed, one
of them as chief of 'community policing', according to the Star's report.
For years the police fought a political battle against government opponents,
especially the ANC, in the townships. Retirements at the level of general
will not improve police attitudes overnight, but they will send an important
signal to more junior officers.
On its own such a move is unlikely to break the deadlock over constitutional
talks, but it would demonstrate a willingness by Mr de Klerk to face up to
the problem of police partiality. However, he would still be left with the
task of tackling the issue of military involvement in political murders.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Palestinians hedge optimismon Israeli plan

THE Palestinian delegation at the Middle East peace talks yesterday
described the first detailed Israeli proposals for the future of the
occupied Arab territories as 'a very maximalist position'.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said the tone of the first
two rounds of talks with Israel offered some grounds for optimism, but
added: 'There are actually more grounds for being very cautious and treading
very carefully on terrain that might be a minefield.'
She said the most important issue to be addressed was Jewish settlements and
human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. She was sharply critical of
President George Bush for proposing to give Israel Dollars 10bn in loan
guarantees while the construction of 11,000 housing units continued.
Describing these units as '11,000 obstacles to peace', Mrs Ashrawi added:
'If the US is rich enough to start distributing billions of dollars, at
least it should make sure that these dollars are not used to violate its own
policy and to undermine the peace process.' She added that the credibility
of the US as an even-handed peace broker could be at stake.
Israel is understood to have submitted three documents setting out proposals
for the administration of the occupied territories over the next five years.
During the final two years of that period it is proposed that negotiations
would be held over the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.
In line with ideas put forward by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister,
Israel is proposing the election of a 15-member administrative council to
run such activities as health, education, social welfare and transportation.
The elections could be held as early as next March or April.
Mrs Ashrawi welcomed Israel's acceptance of the need for elections, but said
the new government was sticking to the old policy of suggesting elections
for administrators and functionaries.
'These are not people to be elected', she said. 'You do not run national
elections in order to appoint administrators. You have elections for a
representative body which becomes the source of authority and which, in
itself, appoints people who are administrators on the basis of merit and
ability.'
The Palestinians say that there must be 'a meaningful transfer of
authority'. In proposals put forward at previous talks in March, the
Palestinians sought national elections for a 180-seat legislature and the
subsequent appointment of an executive and a judiciary.
The negotiations in Washington are scheduled to continue until September 23
and are being held in parallel with talks between Israel and delegations
from Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader Yassir Arafat yesterday told
a UN conference on the Palestinian question in Geneva that American bias in
favour of Israel was a 'cause to abort' the US-sponsored peace talks. The
PLO is officially excluded from the talks.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Citibank rejects claims it violated Reserve Bank rules in
Bombay securities scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CITIBANK, the US bank, yesterday denied that it had violated guidelines of
the Reserve Bank of India, or that it had actively financed brokers involved
in the Rs35bn (Pounds 630m) Bombay securities scandal.
In a statement issued in Bombay in response to publication of an official
report on the scandal, Citibank blamed the Indian banking system for
irregularities in its Indian operations.
It said that if Citibank government bond transfer forms had bounced, as the
report said, it was because other banks had dishonoured the forms. 'This
highlights the need to assess the settlement drawbacks in the entire
system,' it said. The bank also denied that it had 'accommodated' or been
involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, the key broker in the scandal, and that it
had guaranteed returns to its customers under portfolio management schemes.
It said fiduciary accounts were managed on the basis of a written mandate
received from customers.
According to the report published on Tuesday, Citibank and Bank of America
accrued large profits in the Indian financial markets by flouting guidelines
laid down by the Reserve Bank of India.
Bank of America has not yet commented on the report.
The report by the Janakiraman committee of the Reserve Bank, the third in a
series, found that the American banks, among other Indian and foreign banks,
used portfolio management schemes as a 'deposit substitute' to mobilise
funds, mainly from government corporations.
Large corporate cash surpluses were attracted by the banks, especially those
with more aggressive marketing strategies, by offering guaranteed rates of
return far exceeding the deposit rates permitted by the Reserve Bank, and
without the client bearing the risk of capital loss on its portfolio
investment.
The report says that the 'client's perception of the portfolio management
schemes seemed to support the suspicion that they considered the funds
placed under the schemes merely as deployment of short-term funds with banks
in the nature of bank deposits enjoying a higher rate of interest and not
subject to any risk.'
To circumvent the stipulation that portfolio management funds had to be
placed with the banks for a period of one year, several banks offered
facilities for 'ready forward', or repurchase, transactions: securities,
bonds and units were sold to clients and repurchased after a specific period
at a pre-determined rate which assured the client a guaranteed rate of
return with no risk.
The banks would then use the money freely in the interim period to earn the
highest possible return. The Reserve Bank guidelines require all
transactions between a bank's investment account and portfolio account to be
'strictly at market rates'.
The guidelines also expressly prohibited ready forward deals in government
bonds and units, but almost all the banks violated this norm, according to
the report.
An indication of the magnitude of the funds collected under these schemes,
says the report, is ascertainable from the fact that between April 1991 and
May 31 1992, Citibank entered into ready forward transactions for an
aggregate value of Rs59.72bn.
Bank of America entered into transactions for an aggregate value of
Rs69.54bn. Standard Chartered of the UK operated a similar scheme, called
Corporate Cash Deployment Services, for which the funds received and
outstanding on March 31 this year for the Bombay branch alone are an
estimated Rs7bn.
The committee suspects that a large amount of these funds were routed by
banks to finance brokers through ready forward deals. In many cases, says
the report, brokers may have helped to obtain these funds, especially from
state-owned enterprises, 'mainly motivated by the expectation that that the
funds would in turn be made available to them by the banks/institutions'.
The committee says it has not substantiated this suspicion, but bankers say
it is plausible that the 'guaranteed' returns were at levels far higher than
the yields of the underlying securities, which were usually either bonds,
units, or government paper. The inflated yields had to be earned elsewhere,
most likely in the sharply rising Bombay stock market of 1991-92, until the
bubble burst this May.
Simultaneously, the diversion of funds would be laundered under the guise of
portfolio management scheme investment in units, bonds and securities
through ready forward deals.
The committee highlighted the substantial value of bonds held by banks
either on their own account or in portfolio management schemes and the
significant erosion in their value due to the fall in market value of the
bonds.
The committee's latest report focused particularly on Citibank and the Bank
of America. It will carry out a similar exercise on the role of Standard
Chartered and ANZ Grindlays in its fourth and final report.
Citibank was the largest portfolio manager, having innovated the scheme and
accounting for 56 per cent (Rs12.98bn) of the total investment of Rs23.29bn
in portfolio management schemes up to June 30 this year.
When questioned by the committee, Citibank argued that there was no
violation of guidelines since these transactions went through portfolio
management scheme funds and Reserve Bank restrictions did not apply to these
funds.
The report lists several instances of alleged violations of the rules, for
example detailing a bond deal between Citibank and Bank of America involving
several brokers.
The report also says that the transactions which earlier did not tally, have
shown up in the records of some other bank or institution, thus reducing
fears that money had 'disappeared' from the system.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Owen likely to head EC
peace drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, the former British foreign secretary, looked certain yesterday to
succeed Lord Carrington as the European Community's chief peace negotiator
for Yugoslavia, after France tacitly waived earlier reservations, writes Ivo
Dawnay.
Barring last-minute hitches his endorsement could be formally announced
today, although it is believed France is insisting he revoke publicly his
controversial comments last month when he argued for direct military action
against Serbs.
Once appointed, Lord Owen - until last April Dr David Owen, one-time leader
of the UK's now-defunct Social Democratic party - would work alongside Mr
Cyrus Vance, UN negotiator, as co-chairman of the peace machinery being set
up at UN headquarters in Geneva.
At a meeting of EC foreign ministers on Tuesday night a French
representative voiced reservations over the substitution of Lord Owen for
Lord Carrington, citing the former's hardline stance on Serbian aggression
in Bosnia.
However, there was little support for the alternative candidate, Mr Thierry
de Beauce, Lord Carrington's deputy. Mr de Beauce is expected to continue in
the deputy's job.
Lord Owen's succession to the high-profile post will represent a remarkable
coup for a politician widely regarded in the UK as charismatic and
intelligent, but also as arrogant and abrasive.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs and a key player in
negotiations, has strongly objected to Lord Owen's proposed appoint-ment.
It has also been criticised by Britain's Labour party, for whom he served as
foreign secretary under the Callaghan administration in the 1970s, and the
smaller Liberal Democrat opposition party with whom he had numerous disputes
when leader of the Social Democrats, their political allies.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Disparate groups vie for
attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORLD of infinite fragmentation along ethnic, religious or linguistic
lines was the spectre raised by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, in an opening speech to the conference on Yugoslavia
yesterday, writes Anthony Robinson.
Outside it looked as though the patchwork-quilt world was already a reality.
The non-official, self-appointed spokesmen for former Yugoslavia's feuding
ethnic groups vied for attention with Abkhazians and Ossetians swept up in
similar conflicts by the Soviet Union's demise.
Ethnic Albanians from Kosovo voiced fears of a similar fate to that of
fellow Moslems in Bosnia. Across the square, a middle-aged Kosovan-Serb
widow denounced the Kosovan-Albanians for expelling her family from their
ancestral home in the former Serb heartland.
Conspiracy theories and dubious histories were as thick on the ground
outside the conference as inside. British Moslems attacked Bosnia's carve-up
with a banner reading 'Inquisition in Spain 1492 - extermination of Bosnia,
1992.' They handed out pamphlets claiming 'the hidden agenda of western
governments is to stop the creation of a Moslem state in Europe with a
Moslem majority.' Maybe. But 1492 marked the expulsion of the Moors and Jews
from Spain, not the Inquisition.
Serb supporters of President Slobodan Milosevic rejected Moslem criticism
and characterised Serbs as the victims of Moslem chicanery. When Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, walked out of the conference in protest
at his observer status, fellow Serbs pointed angrily at the presence of a
Saudi Arabian delegation. 'The Saudis are represented and the Bosnian Serbs
not. That's crazy,' muttered one.
However, some of those on the fringes were there to demonstrate that not all
former Yugoslav citizens supported the ethnic divisiveness which has
destroyed so much of their country.
Ms Vesna Pesic, from the small reformist party, was one of a group of
democrats from all Yugoslavia's ethnic groups who held a counter-conference
at the National Liberal Club earlier this week.
The war would never be stopped if the international community showed
indulgence to the criminals who perpetrated it, she said.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Panic promises salvation
for a pariah state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBS are looking to the London conference with despair and anger, fearing
the international community will punish them for fighting in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Following the United Nations decision in May to impose sanctions on Serbia
for backing Serb fighters in the newly independent Bosnia, the Serbs are
citizens of a pariah state.
But from their point of view they are victims of an international
conspiracy.
Their ire is fuelled by the media, which are tightly controlled by President
Slobodan Milosevic. Belgrade television blames the war in Bosnia on 'Moslem
fundamentalists' and 'Croat fascists', while Serbs are portrayed as innocent
defenders of their homes.
Attitudes are coloured by the second world war, when hundreds of thousands
of Serbs, Jews and gypsies were killed by Ustashe, or pro-Nazi Croats. The
people of Serbia cannot accept today that Bosnian Serbs can be the
aggressors.
The war in Bosnia, which has claimed at least 10,000 lives, is depicted not
as a land grab but as a battle for survival of the Serbian nation. Serbian
television does not show reports about hundreds of thousands of Slavic
Moslems being driven from their homes.
Some people admit 'excesses' by Serb forces. But they qualify this with
protests that Croats are equally culpable in the carve-up of Bosnia, yet
remain unpunished by the international community.
Inside Serbia few people hold out much hope of a change for the better.
There are no signs that the opposition parties - disorganised and no match
for the propaganda machine of the ruling Socialists - can mount a united
challenge to Mr Milosevic.
However, Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the internationally unrecognised
Yugoslavia, rivals the president in popularity. He appears to many Serbs to
be a breath of fresh air, offering to rescue the republic from collapse.
His sense of humour and willingness to speak out contrast with the
authoritarian and arrogant manner of Mr Milosevic.
Sanctions, which include an oil embargo, are biting and Mr Panic is offering
a way out.
He has denounced 'ethnic cleansing' and promised to halt its spread inside
Serbia. He also appears intent on doing a deal with Serbia's ethnic
minorities, who make up a third of the 9.8m population. Capitalising on his
popularity, he has arrested or sacked some obvious violators of minority
rights in Serbia; yesterday he removed Mr Mihaly Kertes, a deputy interior
minister, for his failure to support the government's programme 'of
opposition to ethnic cleansing'.
However, he faces resistance from warlords and ultranationalists.
Perhaps his trickiest task in ending Serbia's isolation will be to convince
his people that the UN peacekeeping zones covering Serbian enclaves in
Croatia are part of Croatia and do not belong to Serbia.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Minorities plan starts to
run into opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN by the London conference to tackle the crucial question of minorities
in the former Yugoslavia yesterday ran into opposition from countries
fearful that it might set a precedent for ethnic rights on their own
territory.
The difficulties were revealed when Ambassador Peter Hall, the EC's
conference co-ordinator, submitted a memorandum to all participants. It
spelled out the role of the Minorities Task Force (MTF), one of six special
steering committees which will start work once this week's conference is
over.
The task force will try to establish a 'consistent approach' to minorities
throughout the former Yugoslavia. In particular, it will look at the status
of ethnic Albanian minorities in the Serb-controlled province of Kosovo,
ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, Moslems in Sandjak, and ethnic Albanians in
Macedonia.
However, Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Nastase warned of any 'separate
international law for Yugoslavia'. Arrangements might be proposed for the
specific situation of Yugoslavia which were acceptable to all parties.
Western diplomats said that Romania, as well as France, Spain, Russia and
Turkey among others, are increasingly concerned that if a blueprint for
ethnic minorities of the former Yugoslavia is agreed by the MTF, those
principles could eventually be applied to other countries.
'Romania will never give the ethnic Hungarian minority special status, even
though in parts of Transylvania, Hungarians are clearly in the majority.
Instead, they will say ethnic minority rights come under the umbrella of
human rights,' a UN diplomat said.
'It is not only Romania which is reluctant do tackle head on the problem of
ethnic rights, which is one of the crucial elements of the Yugoslav problem.
If we talk about special status for Corsica, Paris would block it, or
minorities in Turkey, or Bratislava (the capital of Slovakia) could block
special status for the Ruthenes if they were in a majority in some region or
other.
'These special committees will first have to agree among each other about
the status of ethnic minorities in the former Yugoslavia because they know
it will eventually affect their own countries. This is going to be a long
haul.'

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE middle-level US State Department official in charge of managing
day-to-day policy towards the former Yugoslavia has resigned in protest
against what he considers Washington's ineffectual approach.
Mr George Kenney also charged in an interview with the Washington Post that
the London conference was 'a charade' whose outcome was doomed to fail
because of an unwillingness to exert sufficient pressure on Serbia 'to stop
its campaign of genocide in Bosnia'.
He said many US public statements on Bosnia this year, some of which he had
drafted, had consistently deleted accounts of suffering to reduce the risk
of public pressure on the administration to intervene more forcefully in the
region.
US policy, he said, was 'made on the fly,' interspersed with occasional
bursts of activity by Mr James Baker, secretary of state until last Sunday,
the day Mr Kenney submitted his resignation. Mostly, he added, Mr Baker was
'an invisible ghost' to officials at his level, a common complaint in the
State Department.
He attributed such positive developments as there were to Ms Margaret
Tutwiler, the influential former spokeswoman, who, he said, was gripped by
the tragedy in the Balkans. She is 'in reality a bleeding heart liberal who
hated scenes of people being blown up'. He said of Mr Lawrence Eagleburger,
acting secretary of state and a former ambassador to Belgrade, 'his basic
attitude is 'a pox on all their houses'. He feels we should wait until they
exhaust themselves and then move in'.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Latest opinion poll deals blow to Mitterrand
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand's hopes of a positive result in next month's
referendum were dealt another blow yesterday by an opinion poll indicating
that a majority would vote against ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
The poll, conducted by the IPSOS market research consultancy for Le Point
magazine, indicated that 52 per cent of the electorate intend to vote 'no'
on September 20.
Mr Mitterrand said the poll showed that the French needed better
explanations, saying that advocates of European union would have to
'explain, explain, explain in order to convince, convince, convince'. He was
speaking after an informal meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, one of the
champions of union, on the German North Sea island of Borkum.
The poll is the second to show a majority for the anti-Maastricht faction.
The first to do so was a BVA study published on Tuesday. The other three
polls released this week have shown slender majorities in favour.
When the interviewees were asked why people would oppose the ratification of
the treaty 47 per cent cited opposition to Mr Mitterrand and 39 per cent
hostility to Europe. So far the anti-Maastricht lobby is believed to be
running a better campaign: 33 per cent of the poll said so, compared with 19
per cent who praised tne pro-Maastricht campaign.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is considering a request from the
French TV1 television channel to make a live contribution to a televised
debate on Maastricht next Thursday evening, writes Alison Smith in London.
Downing Street said yesterday there was a purely logistical problem, in that
the premier had engagements the evening. No decision would be taken,
however, until after the close of the London peace conference on the former
Yugoslavia.
The Foreign Office advice to Mr Major will include an assessment of the
likely reaction of President Mitterrand - both to a refusal as well as an
acceptance. The prime minister will also want to consider the potentially
damaging domestic political effects of a decision to go ahead. Any move to
intervene in the French referendum would antagonise Tory Euro-sceptics
afresh.

RIGHT-WING militants in Rostock yesterday threatened to continue their
attacks on asylum seekers and the police until the September 1 anniversary
of Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland 53 years ago, writes Leslie Colitt in
Berlin.
Rostock police said they were taking the warning seriously. The neo-Nazis
had boasted that by then they would make Rostock Auslanderfrei, a reference
to Nazi Germany's policy of exterminating the Jews in occupied countries.
Rioters again fought with police last night and overturned a car. It was the
fifth consecutive night of violence.
Nerves in the city were at a raw edge after Tuesday's violence. Nearly 800
east German youths supported by neo-Nazis from west Germany threw Molotov
cocktails and paving stones at 1,600 policemen. Nearly 70 officers were
injured in the clashes, several with severe burns. Ten rioters were
arrested, one for the attempted murder of a policeman.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Volatile times ahead for EC's equity markets: The French
vote on Maastricht treaty is making brokers jumpy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN equity markets have fallen heavily from their May peaks, and there
could still be some nerve-wracking weeks ahead.
German shares, as measured by the DAX index, are 18.7 per cent per cent
below the level reached in May. France's CAC-40 has dropped 19.7 per cent
and Italy's BCI index, burdened by additional problems such as a long wait
for a new government after the April election, has fallen by 28.6 per cent.
Volumes have been low across the continent during August, but much of the
decline happened before the holidays.
The consensus of European equity market-watchers is that any further drop is
likely to be limited to around 4-5 per cent in the run-up to the French
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on September 20. But severe volatility
cannot be ruled out.
Since the start of the summer, the markets have adjusted to several
disappointments: the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by Danish voters;
the increasing weakness in the dollar; diminishing hopes for a recovery in
the US and UK economies; a poor corporate reporting season in Europe and
economic uncertainty in Japan.
Analysts have cut earnings forecasts and the markets have tended to ignore
any pleasant surprises among companies' interim results.
In the first quarter of 1992, shares in cyclical industries sped ahead on
hopes of an upturn. According to the FT-A World Indices, by the end of the
first quarter, the European chemical sector rose 9.1 per cent in local
currency terms, while cars rose by 8.5 per cent and car components by 20 per
cent.
But recovery expectations dimmed and by the end of the second quarter
chemicals had fallen back by 1.6 per cent, the gain in car shares had been
reduced to 1.6 per cent and in the component sector to 9.8 per cent.
Since then, poor interims and downgradings in earnings forecasts have taken
9.5 per cent off chemicals, 21.9 per cent off cars and 11.7 per cent off
components.
The outlook is dominated by the French referendum on Maastricht. A 'no' vote
may have been largely built into French equity values, but other continental
markets have not discounted the possible consequences of a 'no' vote, such
as a radical realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), or rising
interest rates in Italy, Spain and the UK.
Morgan Stanley's strategist, Mr Richard Davidson does not rule out a
devaluation against the D-Mark of the lira, the peseta, and the pound
sterling, but he believes the benefits would be fleeting.
Nobody would applaud a 'no' vote more than Ms Lisa Hosking, strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston. She says it would break the untenable situation
in which many EC members find themselves. 'Economies which need low interest
rates have high interest rates and their governments cannot act freely.'
However, Mr Davidson argues that a French 'yes' vote, followed by
ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the British and German parliaments
would create a bullish scenario for European bourses: German interest rates
would come down, stimulating economic growth in Europe.
European equity investors also have to consider the effects on European
earnings of the dollar's decline and of the economic slowdown in Germany.
Analysts generally agree that the bottom for the dollar may not be far off
at around DM1.30-DM1.35, and that although the currency will remain volatile
until the US presidential elections in November, it could rebound to DM1.65
next year.
Some analysts say the European markets have over-reacted to the dollar's
weakness, since dollar earnings only make up between 2-4 per cent of
European earnings growth. The likelihood of a narrowing of interest rate
differentials between Germany and the US by the middle of next year as well
as a move by institutions to increase their underweight position in
dollar-denominated assets should lend support to the US currency.
Germany is more of a problem. Its economy is slowing and there are no signs
of interest rates coming down quickly enough to provide the necessary
stimulus. Some analysts warn that the Bundesbank is trying to get the
economy back to the way it was in the late 1980s, an impossible task
following reunification.
Another drag on the German stock market is its heavy concentration of
cyclical and export-dependent industries whose earnings downturn has not yet
been factored into equity values. Analysts believe German companies face a
greater problem regarding their profit margins than other north European
economies, which makes their earnings outlook more vulnerable.
The current environment does not lend itself to the outperformance of one
sector against the other, analysts say. By contrast, individual stocks are
being singled out by increasingly selective investors in the light of each
company's interim earnings.
Any signs of lower interest rates would get the financial sectors moving
ahead, with the quality stocks rising fastest. It could also herald a switch
back from defensive sectors, such as utilities and food, into the cyclical
industries.
Low volume and uncertainty work both ways, however. If next week, European
fund managers return, refreshed and invigorated from their holidays, any
sudden decision to buy at current, depressed levels could send prices
sharply higher, at least for the short term.

<TEXT>
GERMAN industry shed 11.5 per cent of its workforce in the year to the end
of June, dramatically reducing the impact of high wage settlements on its
costs.
Numbers employed in manufacturing and mining fell 1.1m to 8.3m, according to
a report from the federal statistics office. Even though wage settlements
averaged 7 per cent, industry's pay costs rose just 1.5 per cent.
Wage bills in the west increased 2.8 per cent, and fell 15 per cent in the
east.
The fall in the former GDR was due to a 50 per cent cut in the industrial
workforce, which left only 953,000 in work, and a reduction in the west of
150,000.
The figures underline the seriousness of the state of the east German labour
market, seen as an important factor behind the past four day's attacks on
foreigners and police in Rostock, the stricken shipbuilding town on the
Baltic.
They also demonstrate the fading ability of western industry, the country's
main wealth generator, to maintain expansive employment rates seen in the
past 10 years.
Publication of the statistics followed recent warnings of further heavy job
cuts by many leading companies, and coincided with an unofficial report that
a further 1m jobs are earmarked for the axe. The state railways and postal
services alone plan to reduce their payrolls by 200,000, and steelmakers are
planning to cut 33,000.
According to the federal statistics office, capital goods manufacturers shed
83,000 jobs in the year under review, consumer product companies lost
33,000, and the mining workforce fell 10,000.
Blaming high wage costs, more than 40 per cent of German companies employing
500 people or more, have posted plans to reduce personnel.
Meanwhile, western industry increased its total sales in the first half by
1.8 per cent to DM980bn, (Pounds 351.2m) and raised overseas turnover by 2.8
per cent to DM266bn.
Sales by eastern factories and mines, hit by restructuring and the loss of
east European markets, fell almost 8 per cent to just DM44bn.
The official figures also demonstrate how far industry in the former GDR has
to go to catch up with that in the west. Wage bills in the east are
equivalent to almost 18 per cent of sales, compared with less than 4 per
cent in the west.
Average west German inflation is expected to have stabilised during August
despite an unexpected increase reported from the state of Hesse yesterday.
The annual rate of price rises in the region rose to 3.4 per cent from 2.7
per cent in July.
The increase broke a four-month run of steady decline. However, inflation in
Baden-Wurttemberg was unchanged at 3.2 per cent. The most populous state,
North Rhine-Westphalia recently reported a slight move upwards to 3.4 per
cent after 3.3 per cent in July.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Sweden gripped by a crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S 3 percentage point rise in the Swedish central bank's key
marginal interest rate to 16 per cent underlines the gravity of the crisis
of confidence shown by the financial markets in the handling of the economy.
Observers believe it will provide a breathing space but not a solution.
The financial markets have their attention firmly focused on the size of the
budget deficit - likely to be SKr140bn (Pounds 13.7bn) or more this year -
and the seeming lack of government willingness to tackle the problem.
Unless the non-socialist minority government can reach broad agreement this
autumn with opposition parties on economic policy the markets believe a
solution will not be forthcoming and the outflow of capital, soaring
interest rates and a plummeting stock market could persist.
Last night the prospects of a political deal looked doubtful. In part, this
is because the government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt continues to play
down the severity of the crisis.
Mr Bildt believes the 'markets are wrong' and ought to appreciate the
government is sticking to its bold free market strategy. 'Our problem has
been with us all the time since we took office last October', Mr Bildt told
the Financial Times yesterday. The deficit will 'come down gradually,' as
the economy improves, he says, but the central bank is less sanguine.
'They (the markets) have come back from their holidays and woken up to
reality', said a bank official.
Mr Bildt lacks an overall majority in parliament and has had to rely on the
right-wing populist New Democrats, seen by the markets as unreliable.
Last spring the New Democrats caused a setback to the government's budget
plans by refusing to agree to the abolition of part-time pensions, and they
continue to threaten government policies.
What the markets would like is not the government's downfall but a broad
economic agreement across the parliamentary spectrum, including the
opposition Social Democrats. This approach is now the norm in other Nordic
countries such as Denmark.
Mr Poul Schluter, the Conservative Danish prime minister, has held power for
nearly 10 years by making compromises with opposition parties.
The Swedish government and the Social Democrats agree on a substantial
number of issues. They both support the present exchange rate policy and
rule out any devaluation of the currency.
They also want to link the krona to the exchange rate mechanism of the
European monetary system as soon as possible. Both agree there must be no
further unfinanced tax cuts and they accept broadly the need for more
structural change.
Responsible Social Democrats, such as their finance spokesman Mr Allan
Larsson, call for fiscal prudence and see the deficit as a problem. But many
in his party hanker for big spending programmes to cut Sweden's rising
unemployment rate.
Yesterday Mr Bildt said he wanted 'as broad a political support as possible'
for economic policies but personal antipathy between himself and Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, the Social Democratic leader, suggests it will be hard to secure
any genuine understanding.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Chancellor attempts to calm currency markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, yesterday tried to calm currency
markets by confirming government policy on the pound. 'We have had a
difficult past few days which has been due to the strength of the D-Mark and
the weakness of the dollar,' he said. 'Sterling has actually appreciated
very considerably against the dollar. But. . . . there are going to be no
devaluations, no leaving the ERM. We are absolutely committed to the ERM.
That is our policy. It is at the centre of our policy.
'We are going to maintain sterling's parity and we will do whatever is
necessary. And I hope there is no room for any doubt about that at all, that
the government is determined to maintain our position.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / The case for a realignment: Adjustment of the ERM currencies
is becoming increasingly likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURES for a realignment of the European exchange rate mechanism are
growing, as a result of the strong D-Mark and mounting doubts about economic
and monetary union.
Such a change would probably lead to a two-speed system for linking Europe's
currencies, in which the values of the strong currencies in the system were
increased while the weaker ones were depressed.
Such a move would receive less than rapturous welcome from individual
governments, particularly from those countries deemed to have 'second class'
currencies under the new system.
It would also worry those who believe that sticking to the existing parities
governing the ERM's 10 currencies is essential if downward pressure on
inflation across Europe is to be maintained.
But a growing number of international economists believe a French rejection
of Emu in its September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty might trigger
unstoppable pressures for an ERM realignment, the first since 1987.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
the Swiss Bank, said: 'A No vote would stop Emu in its tracks. It would
almost certainly lead to a big bout of selling of the weak ERM currencies
such as the pound and the Italian lira, and force a realignment on to the
political agenda.'
Mr Winfried Hutmann, head of research at Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a
German investment bank, said a realignment would be welcome because it would
'allow room for a downward movement in some European currencies and speed up
European growth'.
Behind such statements are the special circumstances of German unification
which has increased German inflation, and led to high interest rates. These
have pushed the D-Mark to new highs, and also forced other ERM nations to
adopt similarly tight monetary policies.
Another important factor is the increasing doubts over whether Emu - which
is supposed to lead by around the end of the century to a single European
currency, presided over by a single European central bank - will go ahead on
schedule.
The tight targets for Emu agreed at the end of last year related to
inflation and government borrowing persuaded many investors that the weak
currencies in the system would be 'hardened' by the process of moving
towards union. That has helped to increase buying support for weak
currencies, which have included the pound and lira, together with the
Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo
But the theories about currency 'hardening' have received a blow from strong
indications that France, one of Emu's prime movers, might decide to reject
the concept.
If the French vote No, then a wave of buying for the currencies regarded as
strong - including the D-Mark and probably those of France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Denmark - can be expected. Would the resulting large
increase in their value - and the lowering of the values of the weak
currencies - spell the end for the ERM? Mr Dieter Wermuth, head of research
at the Frankfurt office of Caisse des Depots, the French financial agency,
said: 'After the initial panic, the ERM will survive. The ERM is more
important than Emu.'
According to Mr Michael O'Hanlon, an international economist at the London
office of Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, a continuation of the ERM
after a No vote would almost certainly require a realignment to depress the
values of the weaker currencies and allow countries like Britain and Italy
to cut interest rates and speed growth.
Of concern to the UK government is the danger of the financial markets
interpreting such a move as a straightforward sterling devaluation. In this
case, according to some economists, the markets might require higher, rather
than lower, UK interest rates.
But Mr George Magnus, international bond economist at SG Warburg Securities,
the UK investment house, thinks the risks for Britain of a move of this kind
would be worth taking. 'On balance, a realignment would have beneficial
effects for the European economy. If the realignment involved the whole of
Europe and was dressed up as being made in the context of the unique
circumstances of German unification, then I think, in the case of Britain,
that the markets would be forgiving.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Bank raises tender rate in Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Finland raised its tender rate to 17 per cent from 15.5 per cent
yesterday to try to stem capital outflows and calm international financial
markets. The action followed yesterday's steep rise in Swedish interest
rates.
The troubles of the ailing Finnish economy, however, show signs of coming to
an end. Yesterday the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
published its annual survey on Finland which suggests that last winter's
devaluation and wage restraint have helped to boost exports and improve
business confidence.
In a surprisingly optimistic survey the OECD points to a 3.3 per cent
increase in GDP next year after a decline of 6.1 per cent in 1991 and 1.3
per cent this year.
It also predicts a surge in industrial output of 5.5 per cent in 1993 after
a drop of 9.3 per cent last year and a 1 per cent increase this year. The
survey sees a powerful export led recovery with a 7.5 per cent improvement
in exports in 1992 and 8.5 per cent next year. Unemployment may fall to
below 11 per cent next year.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Bundesbank member stirs fears over EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council,
yesterday sent nervous ripples through the exchange markets when he
suggested that there was 'potential for realignment' in the European
Monetary System (EMS).
The remarks, contained in the advance text of a speech in Dusseldorf,
sparked a flurry of D-Mark purchases in the morning by prompting speculation
that an EMS shake-up might be in the offing.
In view of the morning frisson, when he held the speech in the early
afternoon at a securities market conference, Mr Jochimsen excised the
passage hinting at the need for realignment. This allowed the Bundesbank to
issue a statement later denying that the central bank was seeking a
realignment.
By then the damage had been done. Mr Jochimsen's comments in the text
effectively negated the effect of large-scale Bank of England support for
the pound in early European trading.
Mr Jochimsen, the president of the state central bank of North
Rhine-Westphalia, is one of the most outspoken members of the council. His
remarks added to the feeling among some currency dealers that the Bundesbank
might be following a 'hidden agenda' of trying to provoke a realignment.
Such a policy would be in outright opposition to the declared stance of
Britain and France, which are trying to stave off any risk of a currency
adjustment for a mixture of political and economic reasons.
Currency dealers know the Bundesbank cannot possibly admit that it favours
policies compounding the problems of the EMS. But its high interest rate
policies of the last year, by adding to the constraints faced by the other
members of the system, have added to the political hurdles confronting the
EC's plan for economic and monetary union - a project the Bundesbank regards
with well-known antipathy.
Mr Jochimsen yesterday appeared taken aback by the interpretation put on his
speech by the exchange markets. He has, however, earned a reputation during
the past year or so for challenging the mainstream policy line of the
Bundesbank's Frankfurt directorate.
Last year he particularly irritated Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of
the Bundesbank, for his opposition to the Bundesbank's plan to reduce the
number of regional central bank presidents on the council. He was also the
first council member to criticise the Maastricht deal on economic and
monetary union agreed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl with EC leaders last
December.
On the basic question of an EMS realignment, the Bundesbank has made clear
for some time that it would not oppose a currency adjustment if currencies
within the system came very close to their D-Mark floors.
Mr Jochimsen himself, however, does not believe that a realignment will take
place during the three weeks leading up to the French referendum on
September 20. Above all, the German government is at present opposed to a
D-Mark revaluation.
The Bundesbank believes that some currencies - above all, the lira - are
overvalued. It is also concerned about the possible need to buy large
quantities of foreign exchange if the present EMS unrest turns into a
full-scale crisis.
The liquidity created by such intervention would place a fresh obstacle in
the path of the Bundesbank's efforts to lower the growth in money supply.
In past years, when faced with a conflict of interest between curbing
speculative inflows from abroad and submitting to pressure for a
revaluation, the Bundesbank has invariably used its influence to press
successfully for revaluation.

FT  27 AUG 92 / GRE warns on bonuses and quits 'with-profits' sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the insurance company, said yesterday it would stop
selling 'with-profits' policies. The move intensifies speculation that
investors in with-profits pensions and endowment policies - which support
the majority of British mortgages - will face heavy cuts in the pay-outs
they receive.
Mr James Morley, GRE's finance director, said it was possible that some
insurers' current with-profits policies would not be able to pay the bonuses
needed to cover mortgages.
He added: 'Membership of the (European) ERM means low inflation and low
returns from equities. Paying out bonuses requires a high rate of return. If
you are getting a low rate of return from your assets you have a mismatch
which can only be addressed by reducing bonus rates.'
GRE said the days of the traditional with-profits policy were numbered. Such
policies now accounted for less than 30 per cent of its new business.
It will now follow several other companies, including Standard Life,
Scottish Amicable and Sun Life by offering only unit-linked and unitised
with-profits policies, which put less strain on reserves in the early years
of a policy, because bonuses only need to be added to premiums already paid,
and not to a notional, much larger 'sum assured'.
GRE said: 'We believe that the returns that are being declared by other
companies simply cannot be sustained. They may well be buying their way into
the various league tables of endowment performance. The historical returns
we got in the 1980s cannot be maintained in the 1990s.'
GRE itself cut both its reversionary bonus, paid annually, and its terminal
bonus, paid only when a contract matures, at the beginning of this year.
This badly affected its competitive position compared with other life
offices. It finished bottom in this year's survey of pay-outs for 10-year
policies by Money Management magazine, generally accepted as the industry
standard.
GRE's views on future bonuses were echoed by independent actuaries. Mr
Charles Cannon, actuary with Mercer Fraser, said: 'Looking at the last five
years it is clear that the bonuses being paid out by some companies are
greater than could have been earned by the funds over those five years.' He
said bonuses could not be supported from reserves forever, and predicted
that pay-outs would be cut.
Mr Nick Dumbreck, actuary with R. Watson, agreed. He said: 'There's no doubt
that the with-profits life offices are feeling the pinch this year. We've
seen a number of offices switching out of equities and into fixed interest,
not necessarily because they believe fixed interest is going to perform
better, but because they need it to maintain cover for their solvency
margins.'

FT  27 AUG 92 / Gulf allies impose 'no-fly' zone in south Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, TONY WALKER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France yesterday announced an air exclusion zone over
southern Iraq and made an open-ended commitment to protect the Shia
population against what President George Bush described as the 'brutality
and harsh repression' of President Saddam Hussein's regime.
From today, Iraqi helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft will be forbidden to
fly south of the 32nd parallel, establishing a zone similar to that in the
north which protects the Kurdish population above the 36th parallel. Allied
air forces are prepared to shoot down Iraqi aircraft violating the 'no-fly'
zone, although they do not expect challenges.
'If Iraq violates the 'no-fly' rule, the coalition forces will respond
appropriately and decisively,' a Pentagon spokesman said, but he declined to
reveal the specific rules of engagement.
Iraq's representative at the UN, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, later warned that
military confrontation was inevitable if the west's plans went ahead,
according to Baghdad radio.
Mr Bush also threatened tougher measures against the Baghdad regime if it
continues to oppress the population in contravention of UN resolution 688
passed at the end of the Gulf war.
The US administration is believed to be ready to order air attacks against
targets in Baghdad if Iraq stands by its threat to refuse UN weapons
inspectors access to government ministries.
Many Arab governments have opposed the allied air exclusion zone, warning
that it could lead to a three-way partition of Iraq. But Mr Bush said the US
did not support partition and claimed the allies were receiving 'the full
and active support of a number of countries that form part of the Gulf
Co-operation Council, including Saudi Arabia'. Washington is understood to
have warned Iran against trying to increase its influence among its Shia
co-religionists in southern Iraq.
The US has more than 200 combat and reconnaissance aircraft in Saudi Arabia
and on the carrier USS Independence in the Gulf, and will provide most of
the patrols over southern Iraq. Britain is contributing six Tornado
aircraft, expected in Saudi Arabia today, and France is sending 10 Mirage
2000s.
Mr Bush again denied that the decision was related to his re-election
campaign. The president said recent evidence from witnesses and from Mr Max
van der Stoel, the UN human rights envoy, had provided graphic proof of
Saddam Hussein's brutality.
Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds: The UN Security Council last
night reaffirmed its guarantee of the inviolability of Kuwait's border with
Iraq and urged a UN boundary commission to complete the demarcation process
as soon as possible.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Intervention steadies pound: Bank of England spends Pounds
1bn to hold the line on interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, PETER MARSH and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's biggest intervention to support sterling in six years
helped yesterday to steady the pound against the D-Mark and to stave off a
possible rise in UK interest rates.
The Bank spent about Pounds 1bn buying sterling for D-Marks after Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, stressed that Britain would not devalue the pound or
withdraw from the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
The impact of Britain's intervention was reduced after remarks by a member
of the Bundesbank council about the 'potential' for an ERM realignment. The
pound sagged for a few hours before closing in London up  3/4 pfennig at
DM2.7950, 1 1/2 pfennigs above its effective floor in the ERM. In New York,
it was quoted at DM2.7925 at the close and early today was trading at
DM2.7945 as markets opened in Japan.
Mr Lamont, speaking yesterday morning on the steps of the Treasury building
in Whitehall, said he wanted to remove any 'scintilla of doubt' that
government policy was committed to maintaining sterling's ERM position. The
government would do 'whatever necessary' to keep sterling within ERM
parities.
The chancellor's statement was followed by heavy buying of pounds by Bank
currency dealers. In a well-rehearsed operation, they sought to amplify the
effect of Mr Lamont's comments by large purchases of sterling in selected
international banks.
This move was seen on the currency markets as a significant stepping up in
the government's battle to defend the pound. The last time that the Bank
intervened on such a scale to support sterling was in 1986.
But comments yesterday by Mr Reimut Jochimsen, president of the central bank
of North Rhine-Westphalia, strengthened the belief of foreign exchange
dealers that the Bundesbank might be trying to provoke a realignment.
Such a move, which would consolidate Germany's anti-inflation strategy,
might lead to large selling of weaker ERM currencies, including the pound
and the lira.
Mr Jochimsen's remarks were contained in the advance text of a speech he
made yesterday in Dusseldorf. Later in the day, he excised the passage from
his talk. This allowed the Bundesbank to issue a statement denying that it
was seeking a realignment.
Mr Jochimsen's comments fitted in with the views of a growing number of
international economists that the recent strains in financial markets and on
currencies might make a realignment inevitable. Such a move would revalue
upwards strong ERM currencies and depress the value of weak ones.
Yesterday's slight weakening of the D-Mark against the dollar eased
anxieties about the immediate prospect of strains within the ERM pushing up
interest rates across Europe.
The dollar closed in London up some  3/4 pfennig at DM1.4065. Against
sterling, it was nearly half a cent firmer at Dollars 1.9870. In New York it
finished at DM1.4067 and Dollars 1.9845, while early today it was quoted at
DM1.40825 and Dollars 1.98335 shortly after Japanese markets opened.
The faltering signs of dollar strength led to steadier trading on most
European bourses. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed up
4.0 at 2,285.0, helped by a firmer tone on Wall Street, which finished 14.59
higher at 3,246.81.
The rate for three-month money in the sterling cash market eased slightly,
indicating slightly reduced expectations of an imminent rise in bank base
rates, now at 10 per cent. Dealers, however, continued to price in an
increase of at least  3/4 point.
The more settled market conditions led to a reasonably smooth auction by the
Bank of England of Pounds 2.5bn of long-dated gilts. The offer was 1.2 times
subscribed. Gilts, however, closed about  1/2 a point lower in volatile
trading.
Nervousness about sterling's longer-term prospects was heightened by another
opinion poll in France indicating a narrow margin favouring a 'No' vote in
next month's Maastricht referendum.

FT  27 AUG 92 / Chancellor fails to sway critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNUSUAL sight of Mr Norman Lamont making a breakfast-time statement on
the Treasury doorstep put the spotlight on the link between his political
future and the government's rejection of devaluation, highlighting the
division of opinion among Tory backbenchers.
Critics of the government's exchange rate policy renewed their warnings,
while other MPs queued up to express support for the chancellor. But on both
sides of the division, MPs continued to talk of a rise in interest rates as
a real possibility.
Sir Teddy Taylor, chairman of the dissident Conservative European Reform
Group, said that he believed the government would have to change its policy,
and that this would jeopardise the chancellor's position.
'I feel that the chancellor, by his unusual statement, has put his head on
the block because clearly if the government is forced to move away from the
present policies his continuance in office will be virtually impossible,' he
said.
Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the all-party Treasury committee of MPs,
said this could yet be the moment at which interest rates had to rise as the
markets seemed to have become 'doubting Thomases'.
While an increase in interest rates would be unwelcome, he said, it would be
far more damaging if the chancellor had not emphasised his readiness to take
appropriate action. He dismissed Sir Teddy's comments on the prospect that
Mr Lamont might be forced from office.
The calls of Tory Euro-sceptics such as Mr Toby Jessel, the MP for
Twickenham, for the UK to leave the ERM were attacked yesterday by Mr Tim
Smith, a party vice-chairman. He said their comments were 'extremely
unhelpful' while sterling was under pressure. Most backbenchers, he added,
supported Mr Lamont because they knew that 'if we were to follow the
alternatives there is no guarantee whatever that we would be able to cut
interest rates'.
Treasury insiders were cheered by the chorus of helpful comments from Tory
MPs, but Mr Lamont's words brought a sharp attack from the opposition.
Labour accused the government of failing to put forward proposals to help
revive the economy.

FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: KNP falls to Fl 158m midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KNP, the Dutch paper and packaging group, reported a 43 per cent plunge in
first-half net profit to Fl 91m (Dollars 57.64m) from Fl 158m as Europe-wide
over-capacity in paper production, higher raw material costs and slumping
prices bit deep into margins.
The company forecasts a substantial drop in earnings for the full year.
For the six months to June, KNP said sales were unchanged at Fl 2.4bn, the
operating result fell from Fl 277m to Fl 173m and cash flow was down by Fl
61m to Fl 235m.
Both KNP's paper divisions (coated wood-free and coated wood-containing
papers) faced heavy market over-capacity, which exceeded the climb in
overall volume demand, which was 10 per cent.
In the packaging division, operating results fell, largely due to a slowing
of demand in the former East Germany, which last year inflated first-half
results. Selling prices overall were also lower.
Over-capacity, now slight, is expected to mount and raw material prices to
climb in the second half. Overall, 1992 earnings will fall by at least 25
per cent from the Fl 280m achieved last year.

CUBA wants the UN General Assembly to debate, for the second year running,
the US economic embargo against the island which Havana says is illegal,
Cuban state media said yesterday, Reuter reports from Havana.
A written request for the issue to be included in the agenda of the next
assembly session, starting next month, was sent recently to UN
secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali by Cuba's ambassador to the UN.
The subject was debated at the UN last year but Cuba's government backed
away from demanding a formal vote on a resolution condemning the embargo,
apparently because it could not muster enough support for its passage,
diplomats said.
Cuba is condemning what it calls recent moves by the US government to
tighten the trade restrictions, imposed by Washington 30 years ago soon
after it broke off diplomatic ties with Havana.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MISTRIAL was declared yesterday in the US case of former senior Central
Intelligence Agency official Mr Clair George, accused of concealing his
knowledge of the Iran-contra affair.
The jury was unable to reach agreement on any of the nine criminal charges,
which included obstructing Congressional and grand jury investigations into
the affair.
Almost simultaneously, President George Bush said he had no knowledge of a
1987 memorandum, apparently at odds with his version of events, submitted as
a court document in the Iran-contra case against Mr Caspar Weinberger,
former US defence secretary. 'I've told very openly everything I've had to
say about that,' Mr Bush said.
The memo was dictated in August 1987, by Mr George Shultz, then secretary of
state, and took exception to Mr Bush's claim in a newspaper interview the
previous day that he might have opposed the operation by White House aide
Lt-Col Oliver North, if he had he been aware that Mr Shultz and Mr
Weinberger were objecting to it so vigorously.
The memo records: 'Cap (Weinberger) called me and said, that's terrible. He
(Bush) was on the other side. It's on the record. Why did he say that?'
A second trial for Mr George was set for October 19.
Mr Weinberger's case, also on charges of unlawfully withholding information,
will be heard in early January.
In the end, the jury was unable to decide between the conflicting evidence
of Mr George and Mr Alan Fiers, a former friend and subordinate at the CIA,
who pleaded guilty in July to lesser charges in return for co-operation with
the prosecution.

SAFEWAY said it expects its third-quarter net income to be about half of the
previous year's Dollars 36.1m, excluding extraordinary items, Reuter reports
from California.
The supermarket chain said it expected its third quarter ending September 5
to reflect continued pressure on sales and margins. Safeway's 1991
third-quarter net was Dollars 36.1m before a charge of Dollars 12.7m on
early retirement of debt and a gain of Dollars 16.9m on the stock offering
of an affiliate.

DOMINION Textile, Canada's only surviving integrated textile group, has sold
its Wayn-Tex carpet-backing manufacturing unit in the US to Mancuso, the New

in Montreal.
The sale is a key part of Domtex's restructuring. The company is reducing
debt and concentrating on fewer product lines, while developing its
international business in the US, Europe and Asia. It is keeping its US
non-woven fabrics subsidiary.

CANADIAN Pacific is ready to sell its Canpar parcel delivery unit if a long

Emlak will provide 80 per cent of the equity, its Italian partners putting

HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, reported a
25 per cent climb in first-half net profit to Fl 42.1m (Dollars 26.6m) from
Fl 33.6m during the same period a year earlier, writes David Brown.
However, the company expected its growth rate to moderate during the second
half, due to the weakening outlook for the European consumer electronics and
automotive markets and instability of the US dollar exchange rate.
Consolidated net turnover advanced by 28 per cent to Fl 1.61bn from Fl
1.25bn. Operating profit also rose 28 per cent to Fl 83.1m from Fl 64.4m.

<TEXT>
BAYER, the German chemical company, yesterday announced a 9.8 per cent
decline in its first half pre-tax profits to DM1.75bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and
said it no longer expected the world economy to improve fundamentally in the
second half.
'We are bracing ourselves for tougher competition in all areas,' it added.
But it still expected to report a 'satisfactory' result, although this would
be slightly lower than in 1991. Bayer made pre-tax profits of DM3.2bn last
year, a fall of 5 per cent which was not as steep as those of its German
rivals, BASF and Hoechst.
The latest results from Bayer were better than the market expected and the
share price dipped by only 10 pfennigs to DM256 on a day when the Frankfurt
stock market was down sharply as the weak dollar highlighted problems for
German exporting companies.
Bayer said its first-half earnings drop was caused by continuing pressure on
prices, especially in those sectors linked to manufacturing industry.
Currency movements also hit profits. Turnover was down by 0.2 per cent to
DM22.2bn. Volume sales rose 3 per cent.
In Europe, turnover was 2 per cent lower at DM14.6bn, mainly because of the
weaker German economy. Business was fairly stable in the rest of western
Europe.

GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that it is to sell its Allison
Transmission division to ZF Friedrichshafen, the large German manufacturer
of transmission, steering and suspension products.
GM announced last January that it was putting Indianapolis-based Allison up
for sale as part of a plan to concentrate on its core car and truck
manufacturing operations.
No price was disclosed for the deal, but Allison had 1991 sales of around
Dollars 850m. The subsidiary, employing around 5,000 people, makes automatic
transmissions for trucks, buses, off-highway and military vehicles.
GM said it would continue to rely on the company as a supplier of
transmissions.
Dr Klaus Bleyer, chief executive of ZF, said the deal promoted 'ZF's
long-term strategy of providing world-class powertrain products to a global
customer base'.
The German company, which had 1991 revenues of about Dollars 3.8bn and
already has a substantial manufacturing presence in the US, said it would
maintain Allison's current management and workforce and would continue to
manufacture in Indianapolis.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UN chief wants 3,500 troops to guard Somali aid

<TEXT>
THE United Nations should send a force of 3,500 troops to Somalia to escort
relief supplies, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, Agencies report. A force of this size is bigger than many
diplomats at the UN had anticipated.
The UN chief - who sent his recommendation to the Security Council in New
York yesterday - said the UN force would include the 500 Pakistani troops
about to be deployed to the famine-stricken country.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the UN force should operate in four port areas. A
total of 1,500 troops would go to Bosasso in the south-west and two
contingents of 750 each would be based in Berbera and Kismayu. The
Pakistanis are assigned to Mogadishu.
Looking beyond humanitarian aid, he said the UN would need to help
demobilise regular and irregular forces and to re-establish law and order in
Somalia.
Earlier, the International Committee of the Red Cross called for increased
co-ordination of relief aid for Somalia, warning that simply bringing food
could lead to further strife.
'Somalia still remains an extremely dangerous and volatile place,' it said.
'Large quantities of food swamping the country in an uncontrolled fashion
could quite easily spark off new security problems.'
Since the regime of Siad Barre fell 18 months ago, the country has
disintegrated into anarchy. Many thousands have died, one in six has fled
the country and unescorted food shipments for the large number of starving
people risk being looted by armed gangs.
Since Friday, Washington has been flying food to north-eastern Kenya for
about 1m Kenyan drought victims and the nearly 400,000 refugees - mainly
Somalis - living in camps along the border.
More US food is to be flown into Somalia this week.

THE fragile economic background to South Africa's political transition
process was yesterday underlined by Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve
Bank, the country's central bank.
Speaking at the bank's annual general meeting in Pretoria, Dr Stals
described the past year as one of 'frustration and disappointment'. The
country had experienced a deepening of the longest recession since 1945  -
real gross domestic product fell at annualised rates of 2 and 2.5 per cent
in the first and second quarters of 1992.
Despite the weak state of the economy Dr Stals resisted calls to relax
monetary policy in order to boost the economy. He also rejected pleas to
devalue the rand, as endorsed last week by the Old Mutual, the country's
largest insurer.
Dr Stals also said the country could only enjoy lower nominal interest rates
when inflation had been brought down. Inflation, which has exceeded 10 per
cent a year for 20 years, is now running at 15.1 per cent, according to the
June consumer price index.
'The reduction of the inflation rate must remain a policy priority, even in
the present subdued economy,' he said.

MALAYSIA has appealed for financial help from countries using the Strait of
Malacca in order to purchase navigation and monitoring equipment.
The appeal comes after a cruise liner carrying more than 530 passengers and
crew sank in the Strait following a collision early on Sunday morning with a
fishing vessel. At least two people were killed and up to 11 others are
missing, believed dead.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, said it was only fair that
those using the Strait should pay for its upkeep. .
He said the Strait, through which up to 2,000 vessels pass every 24 hours,
should be treated in a similar way to the Suez or Panama canals. In the past
Malaysia has suggested that a levy be imposed on countries or ships using
the Strait, a move firmly opposed by shipping companies.
Naval vessels with divers were trying to find the wreck of the Royal
Pacific, which was on a trip advertised as a 'Cruise to Nowhere'.
Most of the survivors were picked up by passing ships and brought to
Singapore, where the cruise started on Friday.
Three naval vessels are searching for the eight missing people - five
Singaporeans, one American, one Burmese and one Indonesian.

provincial referendum if a national vote is held.
Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, is ready to delay the province's
referendum on sovereignty, promised in October, for a national referendum.
Mr Clark and others fear that the year required for normal ratification by
the federal parliament and the 10 provincial legislatures might risk
unravelling the constitutional deal, repeating the 1990 failure of the Meech
Lake accord.
The premiers meet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney tomorrow to approve the
legal draft of the agreement and to discuss the ratification.

<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, threw the country's
struggling equities market into turmoil yesterday with a confusing statement
about government action to smooth sharp fluctuations in share prices.
Mr Cavallo, addressing a conference of financial executives on Monday, said
that money raised from privatisations would in future be ploughed back into
the capital markets.
Asked for an explanation, a top government official said yesterday: 'The
proposal is to put proceeds from privatisations back into the market through
a partially state-owned institution that would intervene to stop prices
going up too far or falling too far.'
Mr Cavallo spoke after the market index fell 8.8 per cent on Monday. Prices
continued falling yesterday, with a 6 per cent drop at lunchtime. So far
this year share prices have fallen by half, after rising 393 per cent in
1991.
The suggestion appeared not only to be ill-defined but to run counter to
government efforts to deregulate the economy. One market operator said:
'Nobody can understand exactly what he is proposing.'
Even the government official said: 'I think Cavallo has got it wrong. It
goes against our free-market philosophy. The market should learn from its
mistakes. Cavallo was just thinking out loud. I don't think anything will
come of this.'
The government is partly blamed for the market's collapse by encouraging
inexperienced investors to pay too much for shares in Telecom, a privatised
telephone company that raised Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 900m) for the treasury
in March. Telecom's share price has since fallen by a quarter.
Officials denied Mr Cavallo's statement was intended to talk up the market
in expectation of further flotations.

STERLING cash and futures prices discounted a full percentage point rise in

Short sterling futures dived again in the early afternoon as the pound
touched DM2.7860, less than a pfennig from its ERM floor. News of an opinion
poll showing that a majority of French will vote against the Maastricht
treaty next month worsened spirits. The September contract fell 22 basis
points from its previous close, to 88.98. The December contract dipped 26
basis points from its previous close to a low of 89.00. Volumes were very
high, at over 50,000 lots.
In the sterling cash market, period rates firmed even further. Three-month
money rose to 10 7/8 per cent on the offered side from its previous close of
10 13/16 per cent. All period rates from six-months out closed at 11 per
cent on the offered side for the first time. The one-year rate had
previously finished at 10 7/8 per cent.
Several dealers suggested that the British government may have missed its
chance to turn the market by not lifting interest rates yesterday. 'If they
raise rates to 11 per cent tomorrow, they will find that the market is
already lending money at that figure,' said one dealer. 'Eleven per cent
base rates may not be enough to save the pound.'
The only relief appeared to be in the Eurodeutschmark futures market, which
rose on hopes of a cut in short-term German interest rates. At one stage,
the September contract was up 3 basis points from its opening level at
90.39.
The Bank of England was highly accommodating in its operations, dealing in
all four bands and the repurchase agreement (repo) at the rates established
on Monday.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 950m. In the morning, it bought
Pounds 50m of Band 2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 15m of Band 3 bank
bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 2m of Band 3 LA bills, Pounds 184m of Band 3
bank bills, Pounds 9m of Band 4 LA bills at 9 per cent and Pounds 226m of
Band 4 bank bills.
Later the Bank bought Pounds 5m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 50m of Band 2 bank bills, Pounds 69m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds
252m of Band 3 bank bills, Pounds 3m of Band 3 Treasury bills, Pounds 145m
in Band 4 bank bills, and Pounds 60m in the repo.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Close shave for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING fell within  1/2 pfennig of its floor against the D-Mark in the
European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, but the Bank of England narrowly
avoided the need to support the currency through intervention, writes James
Blitz.
After a comparatively quiet morning in European trading, the pound and the
Italian lira fell sharply against the D-Mark after an opinion poll indicated
that 51 per cent of the French population would vote against the Maastricht
treaty in next month's referendum.
The prospect of European monetary union collapsing has become a strong
incentive for investing in D-Marks as a safe haven. Sterling dived to an
offered rate of DM2.7820, compared to its floor of DM2.7780. The Italian
lira was offered at L764.5 per D-Mark, compared with its floor of L765. Both
falls threatened interest rate rises.
In London the government continued to insist that it would do 'whatever was
necessary' to protect the pound's parity within the ERM.
The two currencies rebounded from their lows after another French opinion
poll came out showing 51 per cent in favour of Maastricht. However, Mr Mark
Brett, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said it was
pointless to buy sterling on the back of the second poll. 'If only 51 per
cent vote in favour of Maastricht in France, the treaty will be politically
dead anyway,' he added.
The Bank of England may have been saved from having to intervene because the
French opinion polls were released at 3pm. ERM rules only operate between
8am and 4pm in London time, so the Bank no longer needed to intervene after
an hour.
Sterling closed in London 1 1/4 pfennigs down at DM2.7875. Today, the
Bundesbank carries out its weekly intervention in the market. If it
withdraws funds from circulation to keep in line with its monetary growth
targets, it will push up call money rates. This will scare sterling holders
into thinking there will be another Lombard rate rise.
The D-Mark also gained substantially against the French franc, ending at
FFr3.413 from a previous FFr3.405. A measure of the German currency's
strength over Europe is that it has moved up two places in the EMS grid. It
is now third from the top of the grid, narrowly behind the Belgian and
Spanish currencies.
The dollar had a quiet morning in Europe but was rocked by poorer than
expected August consumer confidence figures. The conference board index was
expected to rise to 63 per cent from July's 61.2 per cent but dropped to 58
per cent, its lowest since March.
The US currency quickly fell from DM1.4010 to a low of DM1.3940, but
clambered back to end in London at DM1.4000, down 35 basis points. In New
York it closed at DM1.4022.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Thomson urges rivals to cut number of holidays next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON, the UK's biggest travel company, urged its competitors yesterday to
cut the number of holidays on offer for 1993 but said it would not do so
itself.
Mr Charles Newbold, Thomson's managing director, unveiled a range of
discounts for next summer and warned that the company was ready to cut
prices again to achieve its aim of reclaiming a third of the market. 'We've
drawn a line in the sand,' Mr Newbold said. 'We're not going to go backwards
so that our competitors can succeed.'
Thomson's announcement of its programme marks the start of the battle for
next year's holiday business. Owners Abroad, the second largest company, is
due to launch its 1993 summer programme today. Mr Newbold's comments come at
the end of a summer which has seen companies cutting prices sharply as they
tried to sell an estimated 500,000 surplus holidays. Thomson said it still
had up to 130,000 holidays unsold this summer. Its market share has fallen
to about 30 per cent.
Mr Newbold accused competitors of behaving irresponsibly by offering too
many holidays and said the industry's profits were likely to fall by more
than half this year. The number of charter holidays sold in 1992 is likely
to be 12-15 per cent higher than last year's 10.3m.
'There are certainly one or two companies that won't survive and the travel
business will be well rid of them. It will be a long time before we see the
madness we saw this year in the industry,' Mr Newbold said.
He denied that Thomson had misjudged the growth of the foreign holiday
market. 'The only mistake we made was to believe our competitors would be
sensible,' he said.
Thomson aims to sell 2.25m 1993 summer holidays, the same number it offered
this year. The average holiday price has risen by only 3 per cent,
suggesting a rise in real terms is unlikely. The decline in the dollar has
enabled the company to offer 8 per cent price cuts for holidays to the US
and the Caribbean. The price of packages to Spain has, however, risen by 4.5
per cent, while the cost of a holiday in Cyprus has gone up by more than 7
per cent.
Owners Abroad cut more than 100,000 holidays from its 1992 offering in an
attempt to trim the industry's over-supply. It says it intends to reduce
capacity further in 1993.

Yesterday's interim figures from the Hongkong Bank underline that strong
Pacific operations are likely to set it apart from the pack. Asset growth in
the Far East is running at an annual rate of 13 per cent, and the return on
assets remains respectable. There are still some lingering doubts about the
extent of provisioning for Olympia &amp; York, but loan losses across the group
appear to be under control despite the influx of new business in Hong Kong.
Even so, pro forma consolidation of Midland shows just how dilutive the
acquisition will be: earnings per share fall from 21p to 14.4p on
consolidation, and the tier I capital ratio drops from 9.4 per cent to 6.4
per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim results from British Gas show some of the strains which
have forced it into the arms of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. While
warm weather may have been the proximate cause of much of the profits
decline, the company clearly has an underlying difficulty in squaring costs
with its pricing formula. Added to that, if the full-year dividend is raised
in line with expectations, the company will be unable to meet its medium
term objective of a twice-covered dividend unless demand picks up sharply.
However, it is the MMC reference which overshadows all. As far as the
natural monopoly pipelines are concerned, rate of return will be the key
issue. On the supply of gas to consumers and industry, the extent and shape
of competition will be the focus. It may be that horse trading might gain
British Gas a higher rate of return on pipes, while the marketing of gas is
restructured. But until the possibilities on marketing become more concrete,
it is impossible to say what value is buried in British Gas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GrandMet shareholders will doubtless be hoping that problems really do come
in threes. Dollar weakness and the wide publicity given to its accounting
techniques have already taken their toll; yesterday's further downward
lurch, which means the company has lost more than a quarter of its value
since early June, was prompted by a warning that pre-tax profits for the 12
months to September are unlikely to do better than match last year's Pounds
950m.
The episode is a good illustration of the time-lag between general
downgrades for economic growth and reduced expectations for individual
company earnings. The major trading trouble-spot in this case looks to be
GrandMet's Green Giant vegetable business in the US, whose canned and frozen
brands are under margin pressure due to the cheaper food input costs
obtained by own-label competitors. But weak demand is also having an impact
on US food volumes generally, and has dashed hopes for a second half
recovery in the Pearle eye care business. Beer volumes are down 10 per cent
in south-east England.
There does seem to be a danger, though, of overdoing the gloom. The forecast
of an 8 per cent dividend increase is presumably a sign of this year's
strong cash flow, while dollar woes should have a benign effect on the
balance sheet. Relative to the market at least the stock should again start
to perform.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On its own, turmoil in the foreign exchange markets seems an unsatisfactory
explanation for the weakness of European equity markets. After all,
sterling's difficulties seem most acute, yet yesterday's fall in the UK
market was again mirrored in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and elsewhere. Most
European equity markets are, like the FT-SE, some 15-20 per cent below their
May peaks.
The precarious position of sterling, and recent French opinion polls,
underline that progress towards monetary union may be two-speed. Currencies
in the slow lane will, presumably, be seen as more volatile and investors
may demand a risk premium. The bond markets seem to be discounting this, yet
the risk to equity markets is less obvious. Higher bond yields in slow-track
economies could act as brake on recovery, but against this short-term
interest rates might fall.
A better explanation for falling shares may be that doubts about monetary
union have refocused attention on economic fundamentals. Interim results
from Mannesmann to Peugeot have been disappointing and earnings forecasts
have been scaled back - most aggressively in Germany. The weakness of the
dollar has inflicted further damage in this regard, and if a cut in German
interest rates was factored in to equity prices in May, it has now been
factored back out. Sooner or later, though, European equity markets may find
it impossible to believe both that Germany is leading Europe into downswing
and that interest rates set by Germany will not be cut.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Pounding the floor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An eerie silence surrounds the Treasury and the Bank of England as sterling
edges closer to its ERM floor. For those who had expected wholesale
intervention when the pound breached DM2.80, the quiet is disconcerting.
Government tactics seem to be to hold fire until it can see the whites of
the speculators' eyes. While this runs counter to received wisdom in the ERM
 -continental governments have tended to intervene early and raise interest
rates in small steps - the strategy is not without merit.
One aim is to let the foreign exchanges do as much of the work as possible.
Unless dealers believe devaluation is imminent, they take a large risk in
selling sterling short in sight of the ERM floor. The potential profits are
small, but the risk of being caught by massive intervention and an interest
rate rise is high. Consistent with the strategy of heightening unease, any
support the Bank has offered sterling this week has been done very quietly
through discreet banks.
That said, this is a game of bluff. If the markets take the government on,
the intervention and interest rate rises required could be large, and the
wait until the French referendum on Maastricht is an eternity to the foreign
exchanges. In any event sterling weakness is in large part the product of
dollar weakness and mark strength. If that relationship takes another lurch,
the Treasury's nice calculations could be blown apart.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Import rise doubles UK motor industry deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK motor industry's trade deficit more than doubled in the first half of
this year to Pounds 1.37bn from Pounds 617m in the same period of 1991.
The first-half figure was greater than the Pounds 1bn deficit for the whole
of 1991.
The deficit in the second quarter more than trebled, from Pounds 276m to
Pounds 834m, as a surge in car imports was accompanied by a fall in car
exports, sharply reversing the earlier positive trend.
The motor industry is becoming concerned that new car stocks in the UK have
reached excessive levels.
The surge in car imports in the second quarter was fuelled by carmakers'
expectations of a significant rise in new car demand in August,
traditionally the most important month for sales because of the new prefix
on car registrations.
But the recovery has failed to materialise. Figures released yesterday show
that new car registrations of 290,550 in the first 20 days of August were
only 0.9 per cent higher than the depressed level in the same period a year
ago.
Sales have failed to rally in spite of big spending on marketing by
carmakers, including widespread dealer discounting, manufacturer cash
rebates and offers such as free insurance, free road fund licence and
low-cost finance.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned yesterday that the
scale of the increase in imports coupled with the poor state of domestic
demand 'must increase the risk of stock problems in the months to come'.
Ford and Rover are two companies which have already been forced to impose
short-time working on several of their UK vehicle assembly lines in order to
cut production and reduce bloated stock levels.
The rebound in imports of automotive products is evident in all sectors of
the industry.
The value of imports of parts and accessories in the first six months of
this year jumped by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn, while the value of car
imports increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.4bn.
The value of commercial vehicle imports rose by 30.7 per cent to Pounds
396m.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Hurricane damage put at Dollars 20bn as 2m people told to
leave homes

DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was
estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century
threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.
Government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised
or ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.
The hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causing
billions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday
was moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140
miles an hour.
At least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed the
Bahamas.
Ms Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida's Dade County, which
bore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already caused
Dollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.
However, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to
assess the costs accurately. The US industry's Property Claims Service, the
official compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally
of the Florida bill.
A hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coast
from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.
Several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central
Louisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this
morning.
New Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because
the city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its
centre and a large lake immediately to the north.
Much of America's oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texas
and Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down.
These included British Petroleum's Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.
In Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some
10-15 miles south of Miami. The town of Homestead, near the centre of the
storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.
Miami's city centre escaped with relatively light damage. More than 24 hours
after the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were still
without power.
The brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US
industry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm
Group and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. These are also the
leading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, together
with American International Group.
A spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company had
roughly 20 per cent of the Florida market. The mutually-owned company has no
reinsurance. Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its
reserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.
According to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, other
insurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are Hartford
Insurance, Aetna and Travellers. Travellers said it had flown 50 claims
adjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses. About 12
per cent of Travellers' home insurance premium income came from Florida last
year, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.
The last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989,
cost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the
total damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Gilt prices fall as sterling remains
fragile
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bonds were hit by French opinion polls showing an
increasing 'No' vote for Maastricht. Sterling, lira and peseta bonds fell by
between a half and one point, French bonds fell sharply although German
bunds held steady.
Rumours of the poll results were in the markets by lunch time, and prices
were dragged further down on confirmation of the first poll's findings that
51 per cent of people intending to vote would oppose the treaty. A later
poll showing a small majority in favour of ratification lifted sentiment
slightly.
In London, the poll results came on top of worries about sterling, which
fell to within a pfennig of its lower limit against the D-Mark of DM2.778.
Gilt prices fell across the yield curve, with the benchmark 9 3/4 per cent
due 2002 down half a point to 101 17/32 . In very active futures trading,
the Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.07 to 95.20 in late trading.
'Sterling is still looking very fragile and the bias for gilts remains
downwards,' said Mr Philip Tyson, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Spanish and Italian government bonds, also perceived as more at risk from an
ERM re-alignment, fell on Maastricht and currency worries, with the Italian
futures contract down more than a quarter of a point from its opening of
92.75 to about 92.47.
French government bonds fell by up to half a point because of the polls and
a weakening franc. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent 2002 bond rose from 9.13
per cent at the opening to 9.21 by late afternoon. The 10-year French German
yield spread moved from 122 basis points to more than 130 basis points.
Dealers said a French interest rate rise was still some way off, but the
franc was beginning to behave like weaker currencies in the system such as
sterling. A rise in interest rates could further boost the anti-Maastricht
vote, one observer said.
German government bonds held steady on the strength of the D-Mark and
investors switching out of other European government bonds. The Liffe bund
futures contract edged up from 88.13 at the opening to 88.15.
AFTER rising in early trading in the wake of a stable dollar and a weak
consumer confidence report, US Treasury prices fell on news of poor demand
at the afternoon auction of Dollars 15bn in two-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 97
27/32 , to yield 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower at
midsession, however, down  1/32 at 100, yielding 4.231 per cent.
For the first half of the day the bond market was tied to the dollar's
performance. Despite an early dip in the US currency - it dropped below
DM1.40 briefly before recovering to stand virtually unchanged - bond prices
held up well, posting modest gains by mid-morning. Sentiment was helped by
news of a weakening in the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey
from 61.2 in July to 58.0 in August - analysts had expected a slight
increase in the figures. Prices retreated following the two-year auction,
which drew only moderate demand from investors.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher following afternoon buying on
continued expectations of lower interest rates. Analysts said gloomy
economic news due in the next couple of weeks could prompt the authorities
to cut rates sooner rather than later. This should lift the shorter end of
the market, although longer dated issues may be held back by worries about
oversupply.
The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a 4.73 per cent yield and closed at
4.64 per cent, just below the day's high. It continued to firm to 4.63 per
cent in London trading.
The Ministry of Finance's announcement that no further shares in NTT will be
sold before fiscal year 1994/95 came too late for the market. But dealers
said the 247.19 point fall in the Nikkei to 16,380.77 showed the market is
sceptical whether further measures to be announced on Friday to boost the
economy and stock market will be enough.

and Mitsubishi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit agency, yesterday lowered ratings
of two Japanese commercial banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Mitsubishi.
The downgrade of two of the most conservatively run commercial banks, from
Aa1 to Aa3, shows the extent of deterioration of property related assets at
Japanese banks.
Moody's referred to DKB's involvement in the restructuring of financial
companies which lent heavily to property related developments. DKB is likely
to face further asset quality deterioration owing to direct and indirect
property related exposure domestically and internationally.
DKB is also burdened by higher overhead costs, thus making its low profit
margins more vulnerable to a rise in non-performing loans.
Mitsubishi faces exposure to the weak US property market through Bank of
California, its US subsidiary. The bank also faces exposure to the property
market through its non-bank financial affiliates.
Moody's said Mitsubishi faces a competitive disadvantage because of its weak
core profitability and low penetration in the domestic retail market. It
added that although the bank's core earnings are improving due to higher
interest rate profit margins, the increasing problems in assets quality
could jeopardise the bank's financial performance in the medium term.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic demand for Amoco USDollars
250m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE the continued weakness of the dollar, two borrowers launched
offerings totalling Dollars 350m in the Eurodollar bond market yesterday.
Amoco Canada Petroleum, the arm of the US oil and gas company which acquired
Dome Petroleum in 1988, launched a USDollars 250m issue of 10-year bonds,
its first Eurobond since 1986.
Last year, the company raised CDollars 2bn in new bank debt and commercial
paper, retiring most of the remaining debt incurred in the CDollars 5bn
acquisition of Dome. The proceeds of yesterday's Eurobond will be used to
refinance some of that short-term debt.
Amoco's infrequent appearance in the market, combined with its AAA debt
rating, allowed it to achieve unusually fine pricing, while meeting
enthusiastic investor demand. Amoco is one of a dwindling band of companies
to have held on to a AAA debt rating (British Gas recently lost its top
rating, for example). Nevertheless, the pricing of the bonds at a yield
spread of 42 basis points above the US Treasury yield, the same level as for
Japanese government guaranteed agencies such as Japan's Export-Import Bank,
was considered an aggressive move.
'More frequent triple-A corporate borrowers would not have been acceptable
at that level,' one trader said. In fact, there is little comparable paper
at the 10-year area of the yield curve, which is well liked by investors due
to the positive shape of the yield curve.
The steep yield curve in the US market, coupled with the feeling that the US
dollar must be close to bottoming out, seems to have helped buoy European
sentiment on dollar bonds. While dealers reported some selling of Eurodollar
bonds by Japanese accounts, European accounts have not been unloading paper.
'Partly, they do not want to liquidate because they do not know what else to
buy,' one trader said. Many investors are positioned in German bonds for
interest rate cuts which have yet to materialise. These positions are costly
to hold because of the inverted yield curve. Other European markets remain
vulnerable to worries over the Maastricht Treaty.
Also in the dollar sector, Telebras, the Mexican telecommunications company,
launched a Dollars 100m issue of five-year Eurobonds via Merrill Lynch.
In the German market, Credit National, the French agency, launched a DM300m
five-year deal via Dresdner Bank, which was aimed at retail investors in
Benelux and Switzerland.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Equity Issues: Bankers await result of French
Maastricht poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT bankers are waiting for the French referendum on ratification of
the Maastricht Treaty on September 20 to see whether stock market conditions
will improve, providing a more favourable environment for international
equity issues.
They hope to see a steady stream of international equity offerings from
European state-controlled companies this autumn, as governments in Spain,
Italy, Sweden and France push ahead with privatisation programmes, but this
could depend on the referendum's outcome.
'If France votes against European economic and monetary union, the equity
markets will not be as conducive to new issues,' said one Japanese banker,
warning that a 'no' vote would upset the currency, fixed interest and equity
markets, whereas a 'yes' vote would help boost sentiment in Europe's
financial markets.
Activity in the international equity markets has dried up in recent weeks
mainly because of poor market conditions - although some syndicate managers
have warned that investor demand is much weaker during the summer months
especially following Wellcome's large global offering.
European governments such as those in Italy and Spain are eager to reduce
their budget deficits in order to help meet the targets set out in the
Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union. In addition, some
governments are less willing to make heavy investments in the state-owned
industries.
Already several European companies have announced their intentions to raise
capital in the equity markets.
They are expected to use either straight share offerings or equity-related
issues such as convertible bonds and bonds with warrants.
Repsol, the Spanish state-controlled oil and gas group, plans to raise up to
Pta100bn with a share offering aimed at international investors.
The international offering is expected to reduce the state's stake in Repsol
from 62.3 per cent to 40-50 per cent, bankers said.
The Spanish group recently raised Pta80bn with a convertible bond issue
aimed at domestic investors.
The bonds are due for conversion at the end of September.
Elsewhere in Europe, Sweden's centre-right government is due to launch its
most ambitious privatisation with the sale of shares in Procordia, the food
and pharmaceuticals group. The share sale is likely to take place in October
or November although details of the international tranche are still to be
decided, according to bankers involved in the issue.
The French state is due to reduce its stake in one of the three
state-controlled insurance companies - AGF, UAP and GAN - and if the
Socialists lose at the next election, it is likely that a new centre-right
government would step up the pace of privatisation.
One investment banker warned that governments will come under pressure to
launch their sales of shares in state-controlled companies fairly swiftly in
order to avoid clashing with Italy's large privatisation programme aimed at
reducing the government's level of indebtedness.
The privatisation programme is seen as a test of the government's ability to
improve the state of the economy.
Four Italian public sector groups - IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA - were
transformed into joint stock companies this month as a first step towards
privatisation.

despite provisions
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal, Canada's third largest bank, reported a 14 per cent gain
in third-quarter profit despite higher loan loss provisions.
Net income for the July 31 quarter was CDollars 173m (USDollars 89m), or
CDollars 1.29 a share, up from CDollars 152m, or CDollars 1.17 a share, a
year earlier. This reflected improving market share, strong treasury and
international operations and tight cost control.
Net interest income was up 16 per cent. Return on common equity was 15.1 per
cent.
Despite the recession, small and medium-sized business loans were up 15 per
cent and consumer mortgages up 17 per cent. Growth in US corporate business
continued good.
Foreign exchange trading revenues gained 18 per cent and a CDollars 7m
dividend was received from the Brazilian subsidiary. Expenses were held to a
5 per cent increase.
Nine month earnings were CDollars 480m, or CDollars 3.59 a share, against
CDollars 419m, or CDollars 3.28, a year earlier. Average assets were
CDollars 103bn against CDollars 93bn.
Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 2.1bn, or 3.2 per cent of total
loans, up CDollars 318m from April 30.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: USX polishes up a brighter
future - The US steel and energy giant which survived intact by giving each
division its own listing on the New York Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE start of last year the outlook facing USX, the huge US steel and
energy group, looked bleak indeed: Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate raider, was
demanding the break-up of the business. The United Steelworkers union was
threatening strikes at its plants. And recession had sent US demand for
steel plummeting.
Eighteen months on, US steel demand remains weak, but USX's position has so
improved that some bolder Wall Street analysts believe the steel part of the
business could provide one of the market's better-performing investments
over the next year or so.
The changed perception is due in large measure to an improvement in earnings
by both its steel and energy operations, but it may also be due in some
measure to the unique defensive measures USX took in the spring of last year
to protect itself from Mr Icahn's break-up demands.
Mr Icahn, then with a 13 per cent stake in the company, argued that the
separation of US Steel, the largest integrated steel manufacturer in
America, and Marathon, the 11th largest oil and gas company, would create
value for shareholders, since Wall Street would place a higher value on the
parts of the business than the whole.
USX eventually got him, and its shareholders, to agree to a less drastic
plan: the group would remain one legal entity, but its stock would be
divided into two separate issues, each with a quotation on the New York
Stock Exchange. One would track the fortunes of the steel business and the
other Marathon.
USX's management argued that this would give it both the valuation benefits
of a break-up and the administrative savings and tax and debt-rating
advantages of a single corporate parent.
The results have been mixed, but appear moderately successful. On the
negative side, the two separate stocks have not performed as well as hoped.
Just before the split took effect in May last year, USX shares were trading
at around Dollars 28. A similar package of Marathon and US Steel shares
trades today at somewhat below that level, due largely to a slump in oil
stocks and the slow pace of US economic growth. There is, of course, no
knowing whether the old combined shares would have done even worse than
this.
Mr Charles Corry, USX's chairman, says the split has clearly been a success
because the two shares now move independently, based on the different
influences of the steel and energy sectors.
Each of the businesses had their own successful secondary offerings of
shares this spring and were appealing to different groups of investors,
points out Mr Tom Usher, who heads US Steel. 'Some people were excited about
steel because of the cyclical play. Others felt the energy business was
going to come on strong.'
The split has allowed Wall Street to focus more clearly on the separate
divisions. In the past USX suffered because brokers' analysts specialise in
the steel sector or energy but rarely both.
Mr Corry points to other benefits from not legally splitting the group. The
biggest, he says, has been the advantage of filing a single tax return in a
year like 1991, when steel lost money and energy produced a profit. 'Instead
of one paying taxes and the other simply having a claim to carry over
against future income, all the money stayed within the corporation.'
He believes the unified legal entity has also saved debt financing costs. US
Steel, which would have faced particularly high rates because of last year's
losses, has benefited from the 'blended rates' available to the group as a
whole.
Why, then, has not a single other US conglomerate beaten a path to Shearson
Lehman, the investment bank which devised the split, in search of the same
medicine?
It may be partly fashion. Wall Street's latest tricks tend to be assimilated
slowly and warily by corporate managements. It may also be because the
disappearance of the hostile takeover in the 1990s makes such defensive
tactics less vital.
Also, fund managers seem divided over the merits of the scheme, while
residual doubts remain among Wall Street analysts about the finer points of
the split.
Nevertheless, those same analysts are growing increasingly enthusiastic
about USX's business operations. The steel division, which lost Dollars 507m
last year after a Dollars 402m restructuring charge, was the only integrated
company to return to the black in the second quarter of this year, although
it achieved that thanks to a pension credit.
Among the Big Steel companies, USX seems to be one of the best placed to
take advantage of any recovery in both US demand and prices. It has
massively restructured the business over the past decade, slashing
steel-making capacity and employment while spending heavily on plant
modernisation, some of it in ventures with Japanese manufacturers.
The workforce now stands at just 18,000, producing around 9.5m tons a year,
compared with the 120,000 people who made 10.3m tons in 1982. Productivity
at its largest plant, in Gary, Indiana, has shot up to 2.7 man hours per
ton, compared with more than 7 a decade ago, and is now widely reckoned to
be the best among Big Steel's plants.
That said, none of the integrated manufacturers faces an easy ride over the
next five to 10 years as they face increasing competition from the small,
nimble mini-mills which have been taking market share for years and are now
invading the last bastion of the integrateds - flat-rolled steel.
But US Steel recently underlined how much better equipped it is than many
other companies to wage this fight when it revealed it was considering
building a flat-rolled mini-mill of its own.
Marathon, for its part, is out of market favour because of the oil
industry's poor earnings outlook. Yet it has one of the fastest-growing
production profiles among the major US energy companies, thanks to the
development of the British North Sea's East Brae field, due to start
production late next year.
This, and increased production in the Gulf of Mexico, promise a big hike in
earnings from 1994.
USX's restructuring days are not yet over. It has a string of non-steel
businesses inside the steel division, including a clutch of coal mines.
The group also got approval this year to follow up last year's stock split
by issuing a new class of shares to track the performance of its Delhi US
natural gas gathering business, which had operating income last year of
Dollars 33m.
It is keeping open the option of selling Delhi outright to another company.
But it is possible that the first company to follow USX's stock-splitting
lead will be USX itself.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: TWA and pilots agree terms over
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the debt-laden carrier operating under Chapter 11 of
the US bankruptcy code, yesterday took a significant step towards emerging
from bankruptcy through an agreement in principle with the Air Line Pilots
Association (ALPA).
ALPA, the last union to accept TWA's reorganisation plan, said pilots had
agreed to reduce the costs of wages and benefits by 15 per cent, with
offsets, for three years.
The union said it had received 'contractual language to transfer pilots'
jobs in the event of asset sales, to set requirements for addressing TWA's
pension shortfall, and to ensure appropriate changes to operational
structure'.
Mr Bill Compton, chairman of TWA pilots union, said his executive hoped the
restructuring would lead to a rebirth of TWA. 'With agreements involving the
flight attendants and machinists recently accomplished, our agreement will,
upon ratification, complete TWA's needed cost reductions and enable labour
and the creditors to assist in implementing the required improvements to
TWA's revenue-generating capacity.'
The company's creditors committee, which has agreed to the stand-alone
reorganisation, will forgive about Dollars 1bn of the carrier's roughly
Dollars 1.5bn in debt in exchange for a 55 per cent equity stake in TWA.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Deere reduces production target
for fourth quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEERE &amp; Company, the world's biggest manufacturer of farm equipment,
yesterday unveiled weak third quarter earnings and warned of an uncertain
outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.
The US company has scaled back fourth quarter production tonnage to about 21
per cent below last year's levels. This compares with a 5 per cent decline
in third quarter production tonnage and a 4 per cent reduction for the first
nine months of 1992.
Mr Hans Becherer, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Although the lower
production will facilitate our efforts to reduce company and dealer
inventories, profitability will remain under pressure and our equipment
operations will incur a net loss in the fourth quarter and for the entire
fiscal year. However, our financial services operations are expected to
continue to perform well during the remainder of 1992.'
The Moline, Illinois-based company had third quarter net income of Dollars
9.1m, or 12 cents a share, compared with Dollars 31.3m, or 41 cents, a year
ago. Sales and revenues slid 2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.75bn
from Dollars 1.79bn.
Mr Becherer said profitability had been hurt by high sales incentives costs
in a soft market.
'Despite the current reasonably favourable economic fundamentals of North
American agriculture, farmers have remained very cautious in making capital
purchases and retail sales have been lower than anticipated,' he said
Industry-wide retail sales of industrial equipment had been slow in 1992
despite a gradual improvement in construction activity. In addition, the
soft US economy appeared to be affecting consumer confidence and spending
for durable goods.
On Wall Street, shares in Deere slid below their previous 52-week low to
close Dollars  7/8 down at Dollars 38 1/2 .
During the third quarter, Deere's North American lawn and grounds care
equipment operations increased its operating loss.
For the first nine months, Deere had net income of Dollars 33.2m, or 44
cents a share, against Dollars 61.3m, or 80 cents, a year earlier. Sales and
revenues were 2 per cent lower at Dollars 5.07bn compared with Dollars
5.15bn.

<TEXT>
BANK of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth largest bank, reports that earnings in
the first nine months of fiscal 1992 were up 8.9 per cent, reflecting
increased domestic and foreign margins and gains in fee and other income.
For the three months to July 31, net profit was CDollars 165m (USDollars
138.6m), or 71 cents a share, against Dollars 165m, or 73 cents, a year
earlier.
The latest quarter showed a small decline from the second quarter. Return on
equity was 14.53 per cent, against 16.35 per cent, and on assets 0.69 per
cent, against 0.75 per cent. Net interest income rose 5.1 per cent and other
income 6.1 per cent.
Non-performing loans were CDollars 2bn at July 31, or 2.9 per cent of total
loans, against 2.7 per cent at April 30. Loan losses for fiscal 1992 are
estimated at CDollars 640m, unchanged from April 30. Sovereign loans, after
provision, were reduced to CDollars 1.05bn from CDollars 1.6bn at April 30,
due mainly to the Mexico's removal from the official 'basket' of developing
country loans.
Last May Bank of Nova Scotia said its exposure to the Olympia and York
Developments group was about CDollars 600m. Analysts said the results and
provisions indicate that the bank has provided fully for this exposure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK chemicals group, yesterday blamed
reduced tariff protection for the closure of part of an industrial site in
Sydney, with the loss of 200 jobs.
The company said the closure had been forced because of reduced domestic
demand, 'dumping' of imported chemicals by overseas competitors, low
international prices and higher government charges.
It said six of the eight plants at the site would cease production over the
next few months. Products from overseas plants will be imported to meet
orders.
ICI's action follows earlier warnings that parts of its Australian
manufacturing operations were at risk from tariff reduction, which is being
pursued by the federal Labor government under its policy to open the economy
to international markets.
The announcement was criticised by the Construction Forestry and Mining
Employees Union.

TDK, the world's largest maker of magnetic tape, yesterday reported an 18.4
per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y11.01bn (Dollars 88m) in the first
quarter of the fiscal year which ended in June. Sales rose by 0.8 per cent
to Y133.5bn.
The results reflect the poor market conditions in the electronics industry.
TDK's sales of electronic materials and components were off by 3.4 per cent
to Y91.4bn. However, the company said it increased sales of thin film and
other magnetic heads, metal magnets and chip capacitors.
The company also increased sales of audiotape and videotape in the face of
stagnant market conditions. Floppy disks and satellite receiving antennae
sales also rose, producing an 11.3 per cent rise in TDK's recording media
division to Y42.12bn.
Overseas sales, led by the US, rose by 5.8 per cent to Y70.32bn.
Net after-tax earnings dropped by 19.2 per cent to Y5.29bn.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Surge of 38% at Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-Poulenc, France's largest chemicals group, yesterday announced a 38
per cent increase in net income to FFr1.55bn (Dollars 316m) in the first
half of 1992 from FFr1.12bn in the same period last year.
The news of a rise in profits for Rhone-Poulenc, one of the growing band of
French state-controlled companies which is keen to move into the private
sector, contrasts with the recent stream of lacklustre interim sales figures
from other large French industrial concerns including Elf-Aquitaine, the oil
group which, on Monday, disclosed a sharp fall in first half profits.
Rhone-Poulenc, like other French companies, saw sales growth fall below
inflation - running at an annual rate of 3 per cent in France - during the
first half with an increase of 1.3 per cent to FFr42.56bn. However it
managed to boost operating income by 22 per cent to FFr4bn.
Net income per share rose by 67.6 per cent to FFr21.34 during the first six
months of the year.
The second quarter was slightly more robust than the first, with operating
income rising by 18.9 per cent from FFr1.55bn to FFr1.84bn between the two
quarters on static sales.
This growth in interim operating income was fuelled by a strong performance
from its burgeoning health division, where operating income rose by 34 per
cent to FFr2.15bn in the first half.
The group also fared well in speciality chemicals and fibre interests, which
benefited from restructuring.
Speciality chemicals saw operating income rise from FFr156m to FFr407m
during the first half, while the contribution from fibres and polymers rose
from FFr311m to FFr418m.
Rhone-Poulenc's strong first half performance reflects the switch in group
strategy to build up its healthcare business thereby reducing its reliance
on its old basic chemicals interests.

for profits fall

<TEXT>
BAYER, the German chemical company, yesterday announced a 9.8 per cent
decline in its first half pre-tax profits to DM1.75bn (Dollars 1.25bn) and
said it no longer expected the world economy to improve fundamentally in the
second half.
'We are bracing ourselves for tougher competition in all areas,' it added.
But it still expected to report a 'satisfactory' result, although this would
be slightly lower than in 1991. Bayer made pre-tax profits of DM3.2bn last
year, a fall of 5 per cent which was not as steep as those of its German
rivals, BASF and Hoechst.
The latest results from Bayer were better than the market expected and the
share price dipped by only 10 pfennigs to DM256 on a day when the Frankfurt
stock market was down sharply as the weak dollar highlighted problems for
German exporting companies.
Bayer said its first-half earnings drop was caused by continuing pressure on
prices, especially in those sectors linked to manufacturing industry.
Currency movements also hit profits. Turnover was down by 0.2 per cent to
DM22.2bn. Volume sales rose 3 per cent.
In Europe, turnover was 2 per cent lower at DM14.6bn, mainly because of the
weaker German economy. Business was fairly stable in the rest of western
Europe. In North America, the trend remained favourable, with sales up by 8
per cent in dollar terms, though by only around 6 per cent to DM4.6bn when
translated into D-Marks.
Sales in South America dropped by 5 per cent to DM920m, mainly as a result
of the sale of the fibres manufacturing operation in Peru. Turnover in Asia
and Africa rose to DM2.1bn, with a third of the increase stemming from the
strength of the yen.

HAGEMEYER, the Netherlands-based international trading company, reported a
25 per cent climb in first-half net profit to Fl 42.1m (Dollars 26.6m) from
Fl 33.6m during the same period a year earlier, writes David Brown in
Amsterdam.
However, the company expected its growth rate to moderate during the second
half, due to the weakening outlook for the European consumer electronics and
automotive markets and instability of the US dollar exchange rate.
Consolidated net turnover advanced by 28 per cent to Fl 1.61bn from Fl
1.25bn, the bulk of which was accounted for by new acquisitions. Organic
growth in existing business was just over 3 per cent. Operating profit
advanced at the same 28 per cent rate to Fl 83.1m from Fl 64.4m.
Hagemeyer, 60 per cent controlled by First Pacific, the Hong Kong investment
group, said its recent acquisition of Froschl of Germany gave a particular
impetus to growth. Froschl, Germany's leading electo-technical wholesale
group, benefited from heavy new infrastructure investments in the former
east Germany.
*****
TOPDANMARK, the Danish banking and insurance group, said it expected its
performance for the second half of 1992 to be at least as good as the first
half of the year, when it recorded a DKr126.5m (Dollars 23.4m) pre-tax
profit, writes Our Correspondent in Copenhagen.
Topdanmark's whole year 1991 group pre-tax loss was DKr273m. The first half
1991 pre-tax profit was DKr120.8m. The group's rationalisation programme
would continue to contribute positively to the overall group result in the
second half of the year, along with expected improved earnings by its
Activbanken banking unit.
It said that these positive indicators would be offset to a certain extent
by increased loan loss provisions in Activbanken, coupled with group share
portfolio losses and an expected rise in claims in the insurance division.
Topdanmark said its sale of 27.08 per cent of its shares to Eureko, a
recently set up Netherlands-based joint insurance venture, had been a
lucrative transaction. Eureko is a joint insurance venture between Denmark's
Topdanmark, Britain's Friends Provident Life Office, Sweden's Wasa Insurance
Group, and the Netherlands' Cooperati Avero/Centraal Beheer Group.
Topdanmark is Denmark's third biggest insurance group.

SOPHUS BERENDSEN, the Danish holding company, announced increased first-half
1992 group pre-tax profits of DKr613.88m (Dollars 113.6m), writes Our
Correspondent in Copenhagen. It expects solid growth in profits for the
whole year, despite difficult trading conditions.
Berendsen's first-half 1991 group pre-tax profits were DKr459.89m and
pre-tax profits for the whole of last year were DKr973m.
Berendsen attributed its good first half-year result mainly to a strong
performance by Rentokil, the group's British-based pest control and
environmental services subsidiary. Rentokil last week announced first-half
1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 42.3m (Dollars 84.36m), compared with Pounds
34.5m in the same period in 1991.
Berendsen said cost-saving schemes in its industrial distribution unit had
also helped overall group performance, along with solid progress by its new
Netherlands-based textile service subsidiary.

FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swedes confirm Procordia to head
state sell-off list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is likely to be
privatised in late October or early November, pushing it to the top of the
state's disposal list. The decision will be confirmed shortly by Mr Per
Westerberg, the industry minister.
The state owns 40.4 per cent of Procordia's voting shares and 34.2 per cent
of the equity. The other big shareholder in the company is Volvo which holds
45 per cent of its voting rights and 39.5 per cent of the equity.
The government had hoped to kick off its ambitious privatisation of the
state-dominated industrial sector earlier in the year but this was held up
by Volvo's SKr38.7bn reverse takeover attempt to acquire majority control of
Procordia last January.
The resulting highly public confrontation between the two main Procordia
shareholders ended four months later when Volvo withdrew its offer.
Ministers decided instead to sell off the state's equity in SSAB, the
Swedish steel company, as its first privatisation.
The government, which is being assisted in its preparation of the
privatisation by S. G. Warburg and Goldman Sachs, hopes to attract
considerable international interest in the sale of the state's shares while
at the same time ensuring there is also a wide dispersion of Procordia's
shares within Sweden.
There has been a short delay in the announcement of the plans for Procordia
while the company was involved in merger discussions with Erbamony, part of
Montedison, the Italian chemicals conglomerate, which failed to achieve an
agreement.
The underlying strength of the company was confirmed yesterday with the
publication of its first-half results. Procordia recorded an 8 per cent
improvement in profits after financial items to SKr2.29bn (Dollars 446m) for
the first six months of the year, up from SKr2.11bn. Turnover grew by 2 per
cent to SKr19.75bn from SKr19.4bn.
Kabi Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical arm of Procordia, enjoyed an 11 per cent
increase in its operating profits to SKr1.39bn from SKr1.25bn while sales
improved by 15 per cent to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.84bn. The company also
prospered in other parts of its business activities.
Operating profit in the food division rose by 16 per cent to SKr141m from
SKr122m while as a result of the record-breaking hot Swedish summer beverage
operating profits climbed by 35 per cent to SKr145m from SKr107m for the
first half.

quarter

<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, Japan's largest consumer electronics
company, yesterday reported a 62 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax
profits to Y36.3bn (Dollars 290.4m) in the first quarter which ended in
June. Sales fell 3 per cent to Y1,712.9bn reflecting the weak consumer
electronics market.
Matsushita also lowered its parent company pre-tax profits forecast for the
year from Y80bn to Y50bn. This was 53 per cent below the figure for last
year. Matsushita is one of Japan's largest and most important industrial
companies, and the lower profits forecast, announced after the close of
trading, is likely to be received badly on the stock exchange. Other large
companies could announce similar revisions in the coming weeks. Last week,
better-than-expected quarterly results from Sony and Pioneer Electronic
buoyed market sentiment.
'Matsushita is bigger and they seem to be a little slower in adjusting the
cost structure,' said Mr Mike Jeremy, analyst at Baring Securities.
Matsushita's results were dragged down in part by a poor performance at
Victor Company of Japan (JVC), in which Matsushita holds a 52.4 per cent
stake. JVC yesterday said it expected to lose Y21bn at the pre-tax level for
the year as a whole, compared with an earlier forecast of Y1bn, and a loss
last year of Y2.3bn.
JVC said it was planning to cut 700 jobs this year through attrition and
reduced hiring.
Both companies have been hit by the slowdown in the saturated market for
video equipment. Matsushita's sales of video equipment were off 11 per cent
to Y350.4bn. Audio equipment sales fell 5 per cent to Y132.5bn.
Sales were also poor throughout Matsushita's product range. Sales of home
appliances, mainly white goods, rose 3 per cent. However, sales in all other
product areas - including components, communication and industrial
equipment, batteries and kitchen products - were down between 1 per cent and
3 per cent.
Unlike Sony, Matsushita was not boosted by its US entertainment business,
MCI. Entertainment revenues were off 1 per cent to Y133.8bn, reflecting a
lack of hit films.
Domestic sales declined 6 per cent to Y864.0bn. Overseas sales, hit by the
higher value of the yen, were down 1 per cent to Y848.9bn.
Income per share fell from Y17.40 to Y4.32.

SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by Saab Scania and General
Motors of the US, yesterday announced a 20 per cent reduction in financial
losses in the second quarter of the year to SKr507m (Dollars 98m) compared
with SKr634m for the same period of 1991.
For the first half of the year as a whole the company suffered a loss of
SKr800m, compared with SKr1.58bn for the same months of last year.
Sales increased by 8 per cent to SKr8.05bn from SKr7.44bn.
The figures suggest that the company, which was formed two-and-a-half years
ago, is slowly pulling itself into profitability.
Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, currently at GM's South African operations,
starts work next Tuesday as the new chief executive, replacing Mr David
Herman, who took up the top position at Adam Opel in Germany last month.

Losec thrive

<TEXT>
ASTRA, Sweden's leading pharmaceuticals company, yesterday announced a 33
per cent rise in its pre-tax profit for the first half of the year to
SKr2.32bn (Dollars 453m) from SKr1.75bn.
Sales rose by 28 per cent to SKr7.63bn from SKr5.94bn. Earnings per share
grew by 34 per cent to SKr12.40 from SKr9.25.
The company said it expected sales to climb by between 20 and 25 per cent
during the whole of 1992 with a faster rate of increase in its profits.
Astra continues to thrive with sales of Losec, its anti-peptic ulcer drug,
rising by 39 per cent to SKr2.03bn from SKr1.46bn in the first half. Total
sales for Losec, including those sold through licensees, rose to SKr3.3bn
from SKr2.25bn. Excluding Japan, where large-scale initial sales to the
wholesale trade took place during the second quarter of last year, there was
a 57 per cent growth in Losec sales.
Further growth in profits and sales for Losec can be expected after
regulatory approval was given to the drug in Belgium, Brazil and France from
July for the long-term treatment of severe ulceration and inflammation of
the oesophagus as well as severe peptic ulcer disease.
There was also an impressive 64 per cent jump in sales of the group's
anti-inflammatory asthma agent Pulmicort to SKr898m from SKr548m while sales
of its vasodilating agent Plendil increased to SKr296m from SKr154m.
Cardo, the Swedish industrial holding company, announced yesterday it made a
SKr115.3m profit for the first six months, almost the same as the SKr114.2m
in the same period of 1991.
In its forecast for 1992 the company said it was still expecting a SKr260m
profit for the whole year, very similar to its performance last year. Sales
improved to SKr5.41bn from SKr5.14bn.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Trimoco forecasts interim profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRIMOCO, the motor group fighting a Pounds 25.9m bid from its rival
Hartwell, has accused its challenger of reneging on an agreement to reduce
its stake in the company.
It has also forecast that it would make a pre-tax profit of not less than
Pounds 1.2m for the six months to September 30, compared with a Pounds
250,000 loss, and said that the total 1992-93 dividend would be maintained
at 1p.
Hartwell is owned by the Jameel family, and the cash bid of 17 1/2 p a share
was triggered when the Jameel interest in Trimoco rose from 29.8 to 39.4 per
cent after the conversion of loan stock.
The target's share price closed at 18 1/2 p yesterday.
Mr Roger Smith, Trimoco's chairman, said that Mr John Wei, Hartwell's
chairman and chief executive, and Mr Mahmoud Abdulla were both invited on to
Trimoco's board in January this year when Hartwell's stake stood at 23.5 per
cent.
In Trimoco's defence document, published yesterday, Mr Smith says that the
board appointments were made on the basis that 'the Jameel Group would
reduce its shareholding in the company'.
He said the background to the discussions included Ford of Britain's
dealership rules. These say that if one group holds more than a 10 per cent
stake in another, Ford looks at the combined number of dealerships to see
whether the maximum of eight is being exceeded. The total for these two
groups is 12.
Mr Wei said that although discussions had taken place, there was no
agreement and called on Trimoco to prove that there was one. He said the bid
was a technical one, complying with the Takeover Code - which had also set
the price.
Ford said its agreement with Hartwell was the same as with every other
franchisee. As Hartwell had a stake of more than 10 per cent in Trimoco, it
would expect it to shed either dealerships or shares to bring it down below
one or other of the limits.
Hartwell's defence document also said the bid price was at a 20 per cent
discount to net asset value and that it had a pension surplus of Pounds
8.8m, equivalent to 6p a share.
The bid undervalued the company, contained no premium for control and would
deny shareholders the benefit of Trimoco's future performance.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Graseby down 10% as defence side falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COLLAPSE in Graseby's defence earnings resulted in a 10 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30.
The medical products and controls group, formerly known as Cambridge
Electronic Industries, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds
4.6m on sales of Pounds 51m (Pounds 49.4m).
However, Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and Goring Kerr the
instruments business, acquired earlier this year, partly offset the fall in
defence earnings. The new businesses accounted for half of the group's
pre-tax profits.
Defence, which last year contributed about 60 per cent of profits, accounted
for less than 10 per cent. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said: 'The
fall-off in the defence market has resulted from the peace dividend. We did
not expect its demise so quickly.'
Graseby Security, the defence division which had been included in
instruments, is now part of environmental and defence. That sector showed a
fall in trading profits from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2m.
Instruments' trading profits rose from Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 2.45m because
of a strong performance from Goring Kerr.
The medical business edged ahead to Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.56m).
In June the group bought 80 per cent of Intertest, which develops x-ray
techniques to detect foreign bodies in foods, for Pounds 2.7m, as a bolt-on
acquisition.
Mr Lester said he was planning to sell many of the smaller non-core
businesses and property over the next 18 months which could raise about
Pounds 20m.
Borrowings by the year end are expected to be about Pounds 20m, representing
gearing of 70 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 5.5p.
The interim dividend is maintained at 3.3p.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 280,000 related to the costs of disposals.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bridon recovers to Pounds 0.7m but cuts
interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDON, the maker of rope and other engineered products, restored pre-tax
profits to Pounds 700,000 in the first half of the year, but followed up the
omission of its final dividend by halving the interim.
Turnover remained flat at Pounds 162.5m (Pounds 161.6m), but Mr David
Allday, chief executive, said the underlying trend showed a 5 per cent fall.
Weakness persisted in all the group's main markets: construction, mining,
fishing and offshore oil and gas.
The pre-tax figure was a sevenfold improvement on last year's Pounds 100,000
and followed reduced exceptional costs of Pounds 500,000, compared with
Pounds 2.7m, and interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.3m).
Trading profit fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.8m) after the main wire and
wire rope division saw a slide to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 3m). However,
cost-cutting, including reducing the workforce from 5,400 in December 1990
to about 4,700 by last December, helped to restore profits compared with the
second half of last year.
Last year's final dividend was cut to 1.5p (5.5p) after the group plunged
into pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.6m.
Mr Allday said the interim dividend of 1.25p (2.5p) had been adjusted in
line with last year's total reduction from 8p to 4p. The plan was to
maintain the total at that level.
This was in spite of believing that market conditions were getting tougher
and that turnover might be down by about Pounds 10m in the second half.
Some 45 per cent of Bridon's sales lie overseas, with the US accounting for
nearly half. Losses increased at the US manufacturing subsidiary and the oil
and gas-related distribution companies also had a poor six months.
In terms of exports, the group was selling Pounds 1m of goods a month to
dollar-related areas, but the slide in the currency could cost Pounds 2m
this year in trading profit. At Dollars 2 to the pound, he said, the group
had to consider whether the business was worth doing.
In Italy, judicial investigations of corruption had led the construction
industry to 'grind to a halt'. This was the biggest worry for the second
half as interim trading results from Italy had turned from Pounds 150,000
profit to Pounds 250,000 loss.
The trading profit breakdown showed the rationalised fibre products division
 -mooring ropes and baler twine - more than doubling its contribution to
Pounds 900,000; industrial textiles cutting losses to Pounds 100,000 and
engineering making Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.7m), an improvement on last year's
second half.
Earnings per share increased to 1.3p (0.2p).

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bad debts leave Bradford &amp; Bingley lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD DEBTS on its residential mortgage book resulted in a sharp drop in
interim profits at Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest UK building
society.
The pre-tax line for the six months to June 30 was Pounds 38.9m, down 27 per
cent on last time's Pounds 52.9m. The bad debt charge rose from Pounds 6.9m
to Pounds 25.7m.
Mr John Smith, finance director, said that just under half the bad debts
came from loans made by Leamington Spa, the loss-making building society
which Bradford &amp; Bingley rescued a year ago, and the remainder from its own
residential mortgage lending.
'The housing market is not making the recovery we all hoped for and these
results reflect this fact,' Mr Smith said.
During the half year, assets rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 12.5bn (Pounds
11.9bn); the figure was Pounds 9.84bn a year ago before the takeover of
Leamington Spa.
Net operating profit before provisions rose by only 8 per cent, from Pounds
59.8m to Pounds 64.8m.
The society's loan book has grown to Pounds 10.1bn, against Pounds 7.91bn a
year earlier and Pounds 9.53bn in December.
Non-interest income was up from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 30.6m, of which
Pounds 9.6m came from insurance income (up from Pounds 9.1m). Life-backed
commissions were down, but income from Peps advanced 31 per cent. Retail
deposits were Pounds 8.98bn, slightly up from Pounds 8.69bn at the end of
1991.
In July, the society issued Pounds 50m of permanent interest bearing shares,
bring its Tier 1 capital ration to over 10.25 per cent, up from 9.52 per
cent at the end of December.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Changes to UK banking rules - EC
requirement will lead to external audit of banks' interim figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BANKS will only be able to include half-year profits in their core
capital resources, known as tier one capital, if their interim profits are
verified by an external auditor, the Bank of England said yesterday.
Under internationally agreed rules, banks have to maintain a ratio of
capital resources to assets - mostly loans - of at least 8 per cent.
The preservation of capital in this way is intended as a protection for
depositors should a bank run into difficulties.
Of this 8 per cent ratio, at least 4 per cent must be in the form of tier
one capital, principally equity.
In the past the Bank of England allowed profits of a UK bank to be included
in tier one capital if the bank published an interim statement, whether or
not the profits were verified by an auditor.
But from January 1 1993, a bank's auditor will have to review interim
profits and pass judgment on whether they have been calculated reasonably
and in accordance with UK accounting rules, if the bank wants to include the
profits in tier one capital.
Banks were given this instruction yesterday in a notice sent out by the Bank
of England, which said that the requirement stemmed from the provisions of
the European Community Directive on Own Funds.
However, banks will not be required to carry out a full audit of their six
months' figures. The Cadbury Committee's recent report on corporate
governance suggested that UK companies audit their interim figures.
A bank can include interim profits in tier two capital, which is less
precious to banks than tier one, if the interim results have been verified
by the bank's internal audit department.
In the absence of any such verification, interim profits will be excluded
from all calculations of a bank's capital.
Most of the big UK banks already ask their auditors to check interim
figures. But smaller banks do this less frequently.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Core business strength behind Mersey Docks'
40% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company continued to progress in the first half
of 1992, unveiling a 40 per cent pre-tax profits advance to Pounds 7.63m.
Unlike last time's outcome of Pounds 5.46m which included Pounds 218,000
from the company's property developments, the current result contained no
such contribution, said Mr Bill Slater, chairman.
Instead, it reflected the strength of the core business, he said.
Turnover grew 44 per cent to Pounds 42m (Pounds 29.2m) enhanced by the
inclusion of Merlin Stevedores, the general and bulk cargo handler, and
Coastal Container Line, which trades to Belfast.
The cargo handled by the Port of Liverpool rose by 15 per cent, or almost 2m
tonnes, to 13m tonnes.
Mr Slater said that the company was happy handling both imports and exports,
and both full and empty containers - all contributed to turnover.
The company had increased its trade share (shippers were reducing the number
of ports ships docked in, to MDH's advantage), and had secured new business,
from the now closed Ellesmere Port and at the expense of ports in the
south-east.
Mr Slater said that MDH had sold a minority stake in Coastal Container to
Cawoods of Northern Ireland, which had closed its operation in Ellesmere
Port and had transferred the trade to MDH's Royal Seaforth Container
Terminal. This should add to MDH's Irish Sea trade.
The construction by PowerGen of the bulk coal terminal on MDH land at
Gladstone Dock was proceeding.
Mr Slater said that up to 6m tonnes of coal a year should land in the port
en route for Fiddler's Ferry power stat-ion.
Also, Liverpool Freeport has been expanded to include Birkenhead, thereby
boosting bonded warehousing.
Earnings per share advanced only 16 per cent to 8.12p (6.99p) after a full
tax charge.
The interim dividend is lifted 25 per cent to 2.5p.
The government still holds a 20 per cent stake in MDH.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: L&amp;M cuts losses and bankers extend loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON &amp; Metropolitan, a property company with negative net worth of Pounds
44m, yesterday announced that its banks had agreed to extend their loans for
another year.
The company, which has debts of Pounds 129m, incurred pre-tax losses of
Pounds 26m for 1991. That compared with Pounds 100.3m in 1990, when losses
were increased by Pounds 88.9m of provisions against falling property values
and the collapse of a consortium that had planned to buy London's County
Hall.
Its plunge into loss precipitated a financial restructuring in March 1991,
when banks accepted warrants in return for injecting new working capital
into the company, converting unsecured debt into five year debt and
extending their secured debt until June 30 1992.
This debt and the working capital facilities have been further extended
until June 1993 by the company's dozen banks.
Mr Chris Harris, chairman and managing director, said he believed the
company's future was secure.
'There is arguably very little to be gained by putting the company into
receivership,' he said.
Instead of merely winding the company down, L&amp;M was engaged in long term
projects such as its golf course development in the south of France, he
said. The group has recently signed a joint venture agreement with Pierre et
Vacances, a resort group, for the project's development.
L&amp;M's development in progress is valued at Pounds 75m, while its investment
programme is worth Pounds 22m. The group's accounts will be qualified by its
auditors as they were prepared on a going concern basis.
The operating loss increased from Pounds 9.28m to Pounds 13.7m, while
interest payable increased from Pounds 3.38m to Pounds 12.7m.
Last year, the company sold 18 properties for Pounds 26m. It made new
provisions of Pounds 6m, half of which related to an unlet office building
in St John Street, in London.
At the end of the year, shareholders had negative equity of Pounds 40m
compared with Pounds 21m a year earlier.
Losses per share fell from 171.9p to 44.3p.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Interest charges behind sharp fall at Wates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wates City of London, the property company which holds all its assets except
one within the City core, reported a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds
4.57m to Pounds 3.74m in the six months to June 30.
The downturn was the result of a Pounds 1.83m rise in interest charges to
Pounds 3.25m, a figure struck after capitalising Pounds 1.2m of interest
from the Queen St/Cheapside property. The interest rise reflected the Pounds
19m acquisition last August of 35, Basinghall St from Trafalgar House and
the repayment of Pounds 5m of redeemable warrants.
The company said the annual Pounds 1.79m rental income on this property was
the primary reason behind the 10 per cent rise in net rental income from
Pounds 7.23m to Pounds 7.94m. There were no occupational leases due for
review in the first half, but 52,300 net lettable sq ft - a property in
Cheapside - were subject to an upwards only review in September.
Mr John Nettleton, finance director, said that Wates had recently noticed a
pick-up in demand after the 'silly offers' which followed the general
election - companies were getting to the stage where they had to move.
However, he also said that since Friday things were likely to revert to
their former 'crawling pace'. The 'over-stated' over-supply problem would
now be compounded by worries over the D-Mark and interest rates, thereby
affecting the investor market. He felt, however, that the tenant market was
'relatively sure'.
Debt stood at Pounds 95m (Pounds 63m), giving gearing of 52 (25) per cent.
That excluded gearing on joint ventures. Earnings fell to 1.95p (2.36p) but
the interim dividend is held at 0.77p.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cowie buys 3% of Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader pursuing an aggressive bid for rival Henlys Group,
yesterday went into the market to buy shares in its target.
Its brokers were bidding for shares at 73p and appear to have picked up 1.1m
 -3 per cent of Henlys capital. Under takeover rules Cowie is allowed to buy
up to 10 per cent without making a full cash offer.
Cowie's share price closed at 120p, up 1p, putting a value of 84p per share
on its 7-for-10 share offer, valuing Henlys at Pounds 31.8m. The partial
cash offer of one share plus 40p cash for two Henlys shares values them at
80p apiece and the company at Pounds 30.3m.
Henlys shares fell to 62p before Cowie started buying, and closed at 65p,
down 2p on the day.
The bid is due to close next Tuesday, but with a bank holiday on Monday,
shareholders are expected to decide on the bid this week. The stock market
price suggests that a majority will decide not to accept the bid.
Cowie has sent Henlys' shareholders a document summarising its case. It
emphasised the improvement in income and capital value shareholders would
get if they accepted. Henlys summarised its case in a document sent to
shareholders last week.
Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief executive of Henlys who left
the group last November, is pledging his 7 per cent shareholding to Cowie.
Mr Matthews is keen to buy Henlys coach and bus business. He said he would
merge it with another UK bus manufacturer and rationalise the business.
However, some of Henlys institutional shareholders have indicated that they
will not accept the offer.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Gibbs Mew rejects Pounds 11m Brierley Invs
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brierley Investments Limited has announced a 200p per share offer for the
80.3 per cent of Gibbs Mew that its BIL Securities (Far East) subsidiary
does not already own.
The offer values the Salisbury-based brewer and commercial property company
at about Pounds 11m. Its shares closed up 15p at 198p.
Gibbs Mew is a family-run business. Some 59 per cent of the shares are owned
by the Gibbs family and the directors, whose response was terse: 'The board
of Gibbs Mew has no hesitation in unanimously rejecting this unwelcome offer
which it believes significantly undervalues Gibbs Mew's assets and
prospects.'
Mr Stephen Bellamy of BIL, which first bought Gibbs shares in 1987 and
lifted its stake to 19.7 per cent two months ago, said the aim was to gain
control of Gibbs Mew.
BIL wanted to strengthen the management team and use its greater financial
resources to exploit the potential of the target. Otherwise 'the independent
shareholders would have a long wait for the family to get it right'.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Uni Storebrand placed under administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's biggest insurer, was ruled technically insolvent
yesterday and put under the administration of finance authorities after
revealing it had debts of NKr4bn (Pounds 361m).
The move highlights the depth of the crisis in the country's financial
sector which late last year forced state intervention to shore-up several of
its banks through a NKr6bn rescue package.
Mr Anders Eckhoff, Uni's chairman, refused to identify the creditors but
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, last June provided a Dollars 30m
(Pounds 15m) certificate loan to Uni due for payment today.
Mr Jan Erik Langangen, who resigned from Uni last month as president and
chief executive, yesterday announced his resignation as chairman of Statoil.
Uni's immediate problems arose out of a NKr4.7bn acquisition for 28.3 per
cent of shares in Skandia Forsakring, Sweden's biggest insurer. Uni financed
the acquisition through loans of NKr3.6bn. The bid failed and the value of
the investment has fallen to less than half.
Mr Eckhoff said that Uni had a certificate loan of NKr200m due yesterday and
that a loan of NKr1bn was due next week. The finance ministry said that in
the next three days the holding company had payments on loans of NKr659m
due.
'There was not sufficient willingness in influential circles to prevent this
situation,' Mr Eckhoff said.
Following yesterday's action, the holding company has been put under
official administration and a new holding company called Uni Storebrand New
AS has been established.
The new holding company will acquire the assets of the old holding company
in order to maintain the group's activities. Group assets were put at
NKr91.83bn at the end of 1991.
The non-life, life and international insurance activities will remain intact
under separate subsidiaries and continue operations.
The state will not transfer funds to the new holding company but there would
be possibilities for it to acquire the liquidity it needs from the central
bank.
A new 'administration' board will comprise three people, including two
lawyers.
An official with the Oslo bourse said a decision would be made today on
whether to relist Uni Storebrand's bonds and shares. However, he did not
believe the shares could be relisted.

FT  26 AUG 92 / British Gas falls into Pounds 82m loss: Warm weather and
growing competition blamed for disappointing second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday blamed warm weather and growing competition in the gas
market for a disappointing second-quarter fall to a pre-tax loss of Pounds
82m on a current cost basis.
The loss compares with a Pounds 183m profit a year ago. The company warned
this would reduce full-year profits unless the weather was significantly
colder in the second half.
The figures were in the mid-range of analysts' forecasts, but the shares
fell 5 1/2 p to 237 1/2 p.
First-half profits fell to Pounds 778m from Pounds 1.16bn last year. Mr
Philip Rogerson, managing director of group finance, said the fall was 70
per cent due to exceptionally warm weather which depressed demand, and 30
per cent to increasing competition and the recession.
In UK gas supply, operating profits fell Pounds 200m in the second quarter,
reflecting a 12 per cent fall in sales volume. Purchase costs increased 4
per cent, while non-gas costs rose 4.5 per cent - which disappointed
analysts looking for signs of cost savings.
Mr Rogerson said independent shippers increased their share of the firm
contract market to 30 per cent, and British Gas lost business in the
interruptible market by customers switching to oil.
Operating profits for exploration and production fell to Pounds 2m from
Pounds 51m, due to decreased sales and production, and depressed sterling
oil prices. However, profits from overseas gas supply rose from Pounds 19m
to Pounds 23m.
'This is genuinely a very poor set of figures,' said Mr Steve Turner,
analyst at Smith New Court. 'We underestimated the effects of the weather,
but it is clear that margins are very badly squeezed and little progress has
been made on cutting costs.'
Mr Turner is downgrading his forecast for full-year net income to Pounds 1bn
from Pounds 1.1bn.
Earnings per share for the half-year were 11.7p, against 17.4p last time.
Although a change of year-end makes direct comparisons difficult, a 6.4p
half-year dividend, compared with a pro forma 6p a year ago, was apparently
better news for the City. Based on a 45:55 split between interim and final
dividends - which British Gas has hinted at - the pay-out would total 14.2p,
compared with a pro forma 13.4p last year.
However, while Mr Rogerson said British Gas had not changed its policy of
increasing the dividend in real terms, analysts said he indicated the
company was changing its thinking on dividend cover - which could imply a
lower total payout.

FT  26 AUG 92 / GrandMet weakened by tough US trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAND METROPOLITAN, the food, drinks and retailing group, warned yesterday
that profits growth this year would be flattened by tough trading conditions
in the US food market and the weak dollar.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, said pre-tax profits for
the year to September 30 would be broadly in line with last year's Pounds
950m - between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m below market forecasts. GrandMet's
shares fell 33p to close at 379p.
Trading profits from the group's US food operations, which showed little
growth in the first half of the year, have been further affected by weak
overall consumer demand and price pressures.
Green Giant vegetables, which account for a third of the sector's profits,
were hit by a bumper harvest that cut prices to 1984 levels and squeezed
margins.
'Market share trends, however, remain generally positive,' Sir Allen said.
Pillsbury brands increased volume sales by 7 per cent compared with a 1 per
cent increase in the market generally.
The Pearle eyecare chain in the US and Chef and Brewer pubs in the UK
continued to reflect difficult retail market conditions but IDV, the group's
drinks business, and Burger King 'sustained good progress'.
With more than half group profits coming from the US, the weakness of the
dollar has compounded the effects of the testing trading conditions. The
exchange rate in the first half added Pounds 21m to trading profits; but
this benefit has been wiped out by the dollar's decline since.
GrandMet's accounts, however, will include extraordinary profits this year
from the disposal of Express Dairy and other businesses as well as its
investment in Remy Cointreau.
A final dividend of 7.7p will bring a total payment of 12.3p, an increase of
8.4 per cent. Sir Allen said gearing would be lower than last year's 75 per
cent. Interest cover should improve to about 10 times compared with 6.6
times last year.
GrandMet filed yesterday for a Dollars 600m issue of fixed-rate debt
securities in the US. The new debt, in tranches of seven, 12 and 30 years,
takes advantage of lower market rates and will replace existing borrowings
and lengthen the group's debt maturity. About 90 per cent of GrandMet's
Pounds 2.4bn debts are dollar-denominated.

FT  26 AUG 92 / When beans mean less profitability: Maggie Urry reports that
the food manufacturing sector is worried by squeezed margins in staple
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the first signs that times were getting tougher for companies reliant
on consumer spending, the food manufacturing sector has appeared immune.
Even in recessions people have to eat, the argument ran.
But now the defensive qualities of the sector are being questioned as, day
after day, news of downgraded profit forecasts have been hitting shares of
leading companies in the sector. Hillsdown, United Biscuits, Northern Foods,
Ranks Hovis McDougall, and many others have seen their shares drop after
brokers have become gloomier in their projections.
With many companies reporting interim results over the next few weeks, the
market is in for a run of bad news. There are even fears of dividend cuts
for some of the high-yielding shares in the sector.
Consumers have shown that they do not have to eat - at least not in the same
quantities, at the same prices and at the same quality. Falling volumes and
prices have cut manufacturers margins. As one food industry chief says: 'The
customer is looking for a cheaper product and if you don't make it someone
else will.'
Sales volumes of baked beans - one of the most basic of products - have
fallen by around 5 per cent, according to industry estimates. The price of
Heinz beans, the market leader, has been cut from 29p to 25p a tin. The cost
to Heinz is rumoured to be staggering.
But when the leader cuts its price to that degree, the price of other brands
and own-label tins have to be reduced as well. And, one industry chairman
reveals, there are some cheap baked beans being imported from Italy selling
for 19p a tin.
The baked bean story illustrates many facets of the industry's problems:
falling volumes, falling prices, increasing competition, more imports.
The head of another food company says that consumers used to buy four or
five tins of beans at once, putting them in the cupboard and using them when
convenient. But now consumers are destocking. Food sales volumes have been
weakening, and since June, have been decidedly poor.
The same chairman says that consumers are also trading down to cheaper
products which may not taste as good, so stocks at home last longer. 'It may
sound ridiculous, but it's quite important.'
With volumes sluggish, the supermarkets are putting even more pressure than
usual on manufacturers to cut prices, adding to factors such as a glut of
fresh produce, to bring food deflation. Manufacturers suffering volume falls
cannot be baled out by rising prices.
There is also a problem of overcapacity in many parts of the industry. The
good times of the 1980s, when food manufacturers were increasing their
margins, steadily led to new entrants and more investment.
Mr David Lang, food manufacturing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, says
'the problems in the industry are where there is a competitive imbalance'.
Where there is fragmentation among the suppliers up against the powerful
retailers or where there is too big a price gap between own-label and
branded goods, the result is 'mayhem', Mr Lang says.
Overcapacity in the milling and baking sector has been a matter of concern
for some years, but with no sign of anyone cutting capacity the difficulties
look set to continue. Although there are two large players  - RHM and
Associated British Foods - independents have come into the industry and most
superstores now have their own bakeries.
In sugar, by contrast, ABF, which now owns British Sugar, and Tate &amp; Lyle
have the market almost to themselves and there is a competitive balance
between the manufacturers and the retailers.
Imports are also a worry. Mr John Major, the prime minister, addressed a
meeting of food manufacturers last autumn exhorting them to reverse the
worsening balance of payments trend in food.
'Now everyone is doing worse,' says one manufacturer who was there.
Chickens are one example. Severe overcapacity in the UK is being tackled,
mainly since Hillsdown bought Unigate's poultry business early this year.
But now retailers are increasingly importing chickens from France.
Feathers - and accusations - are flying. Imported chickens may not have been
raised under the stringent health regulations imposed in the UK after the
salmonella scare. These health regulations have increased the price of
British chickens, allowing imported chickens to undercut them. Some British
producers are even relocating in France to counter the problem.
Added to the difficulties at home, many food groups are also suffering in
their international activities. United Biscuits, for example, makes nearly
half of its sales outside the UK. Its Keebler biscuit business in the US is
suffering from similar market conditions as in the UK, while the dollar
exchange rate is making the situation look even worse when translated to
sterling. In addition, Grand Metropolitan's trading statement yesterday made
reference to a softening of continental European markets.
It is hard to see an end to the gloom until the consumer is ready to spend
more freely again. Industry heads are looking for the usual Christmas boost,
but it will be November or even December before that shows in sales, too
late to give chairmen reporting results in September an excuse to be
optimistic.

FT  26 AUG 92 / HSBC surprises with 51% advance

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HSBC Holdings, the owner of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland of the
UK, yesterday surprised analysts when it unveiled a 51 per cent increase in
profits to HKDollars 5bn (Pounds 325m) from HKDollars 3.3bn in the six
months to June 30.
The results, which did not include Midland's interim profit of Pounds 89m or
the bank's recent HKDollars 3.39bn sale of 10 per cent of Cathay Pacific,
were struck after a 63 per cent increase to HKDollars 4.48bn in charges for
bad and doubtful debts.
Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property company was the main source
of bad debts. At the interim stage, the bank has loans totalling USDollars
768m outstanding to O&amp;Y and made a specific provision of USDollars 187.5m
against them.
A dividend of 70.5 HK cents (4.8p) was declared, 31 per cent up on the 54 HK
cents paid a year ago. It said that shareholders could expect to receive not
less than HKDollars 2 a share in dividends for the whole year, or 14.2p a
share. The bank said it intended to distribute a third of its dividend at
the interim stage and two-thirds at year-end.
Mr William Purves, chairman, said at a press conference late yesterday that
the merger with Midland was proceeding well. 'The things we want to do
should be completed by 1993', he said.
The main operating subsidiary, Hongkong Bank, made a net profit of HKDollars
4bn. This figure includes the bank's share of Hang Seng Bank's profits,
Wardley, its Asia-Pacific merchant banking arm, and Hongkong Bank of
Australia. Although there is no precise comparison with last year, due to
restructuring, the whole of HSBC made HKDollars 3.3bn last time.
Profits in Canada were flat, due to higher provisions, but the British Bank
of the Middle East enjoyed 'strong profit growth', while Australia returned
to profit, and Marine Midland Bank of the US made a half-year profit of
HKDollars 337m compared with a loss last time of HKDollars 849m.
HSBC's costs as a percentage of operating income were 51.6 per cent, and
would have been 60 per cent had Midland's results been incorporated. Mr
Purves said the maintenance of a cost-income ratio of 60 per cent was an aim
of the merged bank.

Can you believe it? The new deputy chairman of Women into Business (WIB)
does not believe in compulsory maternity leave and bans women wearing
trousers to the office.
How careless of this branch of the Small Business Bureau, a Parliamentary
lobby group, to let in what might sound like an unreconstructed MCP, you may
say. Meet 46-year-old Tina Knight, managing director of Nighthawk
Electronics. Knight is not your average feminist. She has been fighting to
save the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital for Women, but she normally
riles at anything smacking of 'wimmin's' issues.
Yes, networking can help business women 'feel not quite so abnormal'. But on
the whole, she believes problems encountered by small company entrepreneurs
have very little to do with gender. The SBB - as opposed to WIB - is,
according to Knight, a very male preserve. 'We should be all together' she
says, and seems to be there to try and make that happen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rumblings at the top of the Harvard Business Review, flagship of the
world's best known management school, are getting ever louder.
The professionals are being brought in to transform a long-standing cottage
industry into a major publishing venture. Laurance Allen, 47, an old FT hand
who started our US publishing operation, is taking over as publisher of the
70-year-old bi-monthly (circulation 220,000) and T George Harris, 67, an
ex-Time Life staffer and former editor of American Health and Psychology
Today magazines, is the new editor.
Bringing in a couple of publishing professionals is the surest sign that
Harvard is intent on maximising the returns from its academic name. The
Review has sales of around Dollars 25m and is unusual in that over half its
revenues come from subscriptions and the rest is split between reprints and
advertising.
The unease of some Harvard business professors is understandable. The Review
has not lost its way like Vanity Fair had. Admittedly, its reputation for
being first with the latest management thinking has been challenged by the
California Management Review (and also, among top executives, by the
McKinsey Quarterly).
But it is still a 'must' read for many executives, not only at the top of
organisations but also down the hierarchy.
The dilemma for successive editors of the Review has been how to increase
its circulation - by making it less of a journal and more of a magazine -
while retaining its definitive character and its academic respectability, at
least at the Harvard Business School itself. The next editor is not a
Harvard professor like the last two incumbents, Theodore Levitt and Rosabeth
Moss Kanter. But the combination of his age, his record and his
establishment connections - he is married to a Rockefeller - suggest that he
is also not another Tina Brown.

Some hacks go to extreme lengths to obtain the confidential information

However, Reuters yesterday had the distinction of having a completely
legitimate reason for sitting through one of nine sessions of Canary Wharf's

John Edmonds, leader of Britain's centre right GMB general union and the
most intellectually forceful of Britain's union leaders, is usually more
popular with Labour Party leaders than his fellow trade union bosses.
But senior Labour figures are now grumbling that he has been letting down
the side in that hot-house of left-wing politics - Liverpool. In a case
which bears superficial resemblance to Alan Bleasdale's GBH - a black comedy
about left-wing politics in Liverpool - Mrs Frances Kidd, a moderate
Liverpool Labour councillor, has just won an unfair dismissal claim after
losing her job as a book-keeper with the GMB's Liverpool branch.
Peter Horan, the GMB's regional secretary, says that she was sacked for
giving a policeman access to confidential union files. Mrs Kidd was a
prosecution witness in a case against a GMB member alleged to have assaulted
the mayor of Liverpool. The GMB member was acquitted.
Mrs Kidd and various senior Labour figures see things differently. They
believe that she was the victim of political persecution from the far-left
after voting in favour of contracting-out garbage collection in the city.
Mrs Kidd, and other moderate Labour members, voted that way after a
recommendation to comply with the government's contracting-out legislation
from David Blunkett, Labour's then local government spokesman.
It is alleged that Mrs Kidd was then refused leave to attend council
meetings and generally bullied by her employers. In October 1991 she was
sacked and in November a union appeal, chaired by Mr Edmonds, unanimously
upheld the decision. 'The trouble is', said one Labour figure 'that John has
simply not dealt with the Liverpool left in his union in the way that most
other unions have.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: Need for urgent action on salmon and sea trout
stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES FERGUSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The National Rivers Authority's response to the government's invitation
to submit proposals for the phasing out of the north-east drift net fishery
has dismayed members of the Salmon &amp; Trout Association.
We have long argued that the existence of an interceptory drift net fishery
for salmon and sea trout, using monofilament nets, is a national scandal.
Over the past 20 years, catches of Atlantic salmon have plummeted by 80 per
cent. We would be the first to agree that part of this decline may result
from actions and circumstances beyond our shores. But we must now do all in
our power to safeguard remaining stock.
The NRA envisages that this fishery will run down by natural wastage under
existing legislation over the next 30 years, with a 50 per cent reduction
achieved within 10 years.
We believe that a shorter period should be considered and that any necessary
legislation to this end should be speedily enacted. We understand that the
NRA board would also favour an earlier cessation of the fishery - if the
government were also of the same opinion.
Mr John Gummer, minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, is no doubt
heavily involved in revision of the Common Fisheries Policy during the UK's
presidency of the European Community. He should also take appropriate action
as far as the UK's coastal fisheries for salmon and sea trout are concerned.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: ANC plans company competition authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MANDLA LANGA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much of what Sir Alan Walters and Mr George Guise, say about South
Africa's economic problems (Personal View, August 19) is unworthy of serious
discussion. They are, for instance, under the strange impression that the
domination of an economy by a small number of large, privately owned
corporations is the same thing as socialism.
But they have correctly diagnosed one of South Africa's problems: domination
of the economy by 'the interlocked interests of the five conglomerates which
account for more than three-quarters of the market capitalisation of the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange'. They point out that this leads to inefficiency
and a lack of effective competition. The African National Congress agrees
with them that, in order to ensure the unleashing of the full productive
potential of South African industry, it may well be necessary for
conglomerates to be broken up or subject to a regulatory framework which
makes them accountable for the power they wield in the economy.
Sir Alan and Mr Guise believe that, to achieve such a break-up, it is
necessary only to abolish some unspecified regulatory obstacles to takeover
bids, whereupon foreign predators, such as Lord Hanson, will undertake the
restructuring of the economy. This simplistic notion ignores the fact that
takeover bids have produced the present conglomerates.
The ANC will establish an effective competition authority with power to
order, where necessary, the break-up of monopolies and to vet takeover bids,
blocking those which would operate against the public interest.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: Lottery will be national gambol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD OGIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No serious gambler worth his ace of clubs would play to win a game in
which the odds are a distant million to one. But that is not the view of Dr
Emanuel Moran of the National Council on Gambling, writing on the UK
national lottery (Personal View, August 14).
Apparently, the national lottery, a flutter for good causes, with just these
long odds, will encourage in people the 'dangers of excess which
characterise all forms of gambling'.
Dr Moran's assertion is one often made by opponents of the national lottery
and it is highly questionable for the things it fails to explain.
Obviously no one wants a socially damaging national lottery. But precisely
what would its harmful social effects be?
A national lottery for good causes is entertainment, not gambling. To paint
it into some ill-defined picture of society's modern social malaise is
extremely emotive.
National lotteries have been a commonplace on the Continent for decades and,
almost invariably, the proceeds are used to fund community projects ranging
from opera houses to club houses and environmental initiatives.
This is the purpose of a UK national lottery, as it appears in the
government's Lottery White Paper. Richard Ogier,

FT  26 AUG 92 / It's no game on London's monopoly board: Plans to reform
Britain's property laws threaten the capital's largest residential estates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the facades of London's most prestigious addresses, an acrimonious
dispute has erupted.
On one side are the ground landlords, often from aristocratic families, who
have retained large tracts of their ancestral estates in spite of war, laws
and taxes. Some parts of central London resemble a monopoly board, with the
best streets and squares owned by individual players.
On the other side are their leaseholders. They have often lived in their
houses for decades and regard them as their own. But frequently their tenure
is troubled by fraught negotiations with their landlords over repairs and
renewal of leases.
The resentment harboured by leaseholders has prompted a public airing of
grievances. The Leasehold Enfranchisement Association, a lobby group, says
many tenants have been reduced 'to an unacceptable point of distress and
potential homelessness'.
It has just completed a critical review of the great estates - the land
owned by private landlords - such as the Grosvenor Estate, Cadogan Estate,
Ilchester Estate and the Smith's Charity Estate in South Kensington.
It concluded that the great estates' 'commercial sophistication and bloated
mercantile size (was) based on local housing monopolies and virtually nil
public accountability'.
'Leaseholders,' it said, 'have been the victims of a long-running feat of
legerdemain kept in motion by the repressive techniques of managing agents.'
The rise of tension between landlord and leaseholder is the result of
legislation - scheduled to be enacted next summer - that will force most
landowners to sell their freeholds to leaseholders.
The change in the law would close a long chapter in the history of London's
property market. The 'building lease', which was created more than 300 years
ago, has played a crucial role in shaping the capital. By keeping the
freehold of their land and letting plots to builders for a specified term,
landlords could keep tight control over the quality of buildings. From
Bloomsbury to Belgravia, the grandiose estates of central London are the
legacy of the building lease.
Pressure for leasehold reform first arose in the second half of the 19th
century, when many of the long leases granted in the property expansion of
the 18th century fell due. But it was not until 1967 that leasehold
enfranchisement became a reality. A bill granted leaseholders the right to
buy the freeholds of their houses.
However, the Leasehold Reform Act excluded property with high rateable
values, and thus many of the houses belonging to the great estates. The
omission was a product of intense lobbying by large, private landowners.
One of the more curious arguments used against comprehensive leasehold
enfranchisement was the Cadogan Estate's threat to halt a redevelopment
programme of 65 acres of Chelsea. 'The effect would be to drive us, and
others like us, out of the country into speculative development overseas,'
said Earl Cadogan in 1967. Despite winning the desired concession, the plan
to rebuild Chelsea was dropped.
A stronger argument used against leasehold enfranchisement was that it
interfered with the right of a private citizen to own and enjoy his private
property.
The Duke of Westminster, owner of the Grosvenor Estate, felt so strongly
that he took his case to the European Court of Human Rights. But the Court
found against him. 'The compulsory transfer of property from one individual
to another might constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public
interest,' it concluded. 'The enhancement of social justice within the
community could properly be described as being in the public interest.'
Now the tide is moving even further against landowners. The rights of
leaseholders are, once again, to be extended at the expense of landlords,
because of the predicament of flat dwellers who were excluded from the 1967
act. The government has decided to enfranchise flat owners, because building
societies are unwilling to grant mortgages on the increasingly short leases
that date back to the flat conversions in the 1960s. Since the white paper,
expected this autumn, will not include any restrictions on the value of
flats eligible for enfranchisement, the government has also decided to
remove the value restrictions on houses from the 1967 Leasehold Reform Act.
Once again, the large landowners have tried to defend their right to their
estates. Mr Jeremy Newsum, chief executive of Grosvenor Estate, says the
government's proposals 'amount to a massive infringement of two
long-standing democratic principles: the right for a private citizen to own
and enjoy his private property as he wishes, and to uphold contracts freely
entered into'.
This view is shared by many Tory backbenchers. In a debate in the Commons
earlier this year, Mr William Benyon, then MP for Milton Keynes, said that
the closest parallel to such an arbitrary transfer of property from one
sector of the population to another was the dissolution of the monasteries
in the 16th century.
The large estates also believe that the maintenance and character of
historic London is at stake. The Grosvenor Estate argues that, without its
involvement, the appearance of Mayfair and Belgravia would be threatened.
This argument wins little sympathy from the advocates of reform, who say
that owner-occupiers take better care of property. The Leasehold
Enfranchisement Association maintains that, by the time the Grosvenor Estate
sold its Pimlico property, it was already dilapidated and the subject of
brothel prosecutions.
Perhaps the strongest element of the leaseholders' case is that, while the
freeholder provided the land, it was usually the leaseholder who built the
house on the land and bore the costs of improvements and maintenance.
The ground landlord did not even take any risk in the building of their
estates. Speculative developers made the investments and frequently suffered
losses as a result. The Adam Brothers, the 18th century developers, nearly
went bankrupt when they failed to let houses they built at the Adelphi. The
Duke of St Albans, who had given them a 99-year lease, lost nothing.
This was the overriding justification for leasehold enfranchisement in 1967.
The white paper for that act criticised the unfairness of a system in which
the landlord kept full ownership of a house built on his land at the end of
its lease.
A quarter of a century later, debate on the issue has lost none of its
fervour. But the current moves for reform may well represent the final act.
After hundreds of years of stewardship, London's biggest landowners are
likely to be faced with the break-up of their estates.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: A self-help solution on housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARY SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Gavin McCrone (Personal View, August 17) brought some realism
to the housing market debate.
If the ERM is to have any real impact on curbing inflationary pressures
within the British economy, the old housing market solutions - increased
mortgage tax relief and short-term interest rate reductions - will have to
be assigned to history.
Prof McCrone clearly understands this. But do Conservative backbenchers, now
that the housing market is undergoing structural change similar to that
faced by manufacturing industry in the early 1980s?
If the government really wants to help those who own homes and who are
affected by the asset value to debt ratio of their property or unstable
employment prospects, it needs to formulate innovative solutions.
Encouraging a partnership solution through self-help is one possible
measure. The government could allow 100 per cent tax relief on rental income
from property normally owner occupied coupled to the retention of tax relief
at the standard rate, provided the accommodation is registered with the
local authority as meeting certain quality standards.
These measures would facilitate financial adjustment at the micro level
without causing macro-level housing inflation. By making them retroactive,
the government might avoid financial pressures resulting from speculation in
the housing market as ERM-led adjustment took place.
The advantage to the government is that revenue foregone never existed; the
individual house owner is given an opportunity for self help; a private
rented sector might grow from the recessionary ashes; and, through housing
registration, tenants might be assured quality accommodation.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The feelgood factor: FT writers find UK economic gloom is
not countrywide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, MICHAEL CASSELL, PAUL CHEESERIGHT, ANGUS FOSTER and
DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enough of this gloom about UK industry. In a week of shaky sterling and
plunging markets, what we want is a bit of good news. Surely somebody, out
there somewhere, is doing well against the odds?
As it happens, quite a few people are. An Oxfordshire maker of up-market
lawn mowers more than doubled its sales in the year to end June. A Nuneaton
company which renovates old Land Rovers expects turnover to rise by a third
this year. A Midlands company which sells plastic buckets door to door
recently announced profits up by 75 per cent.
Granted, some of the lessons to be drawn from many recession-proof stories
are not entirely cheerful. It would appear that it pays not to employ
people. It also pays not to make anything yourself.
The principle is splendidly illustrated by Betterware, the seller of plastic
buckets. As the company's chief executive, Mr Andrew Cohen, remarks,
Betterware is a retailer without any shops. It is also a manufacturer
without any factories. Once it has designed its products, it has them made
by subcontractors. The sales force which then knocks on the nation's doors
is, of course, entirely self-employed and works on commission.
A more exotic instance is Thermocrete, a West Yorkshire company which
specialises in lining old or dilapidated chimneys to prevent seepages of
carbon monoxide. Its operators, who for some whimsical reason are kitted out
in top hats and tails, are employed by franchisees. Mr Allan Barnes,
Thermocrete's chairman, says business has never been better, partly because
the standstill in the housing market means people are spending more on their
present homes. Turnover in the year just ended grew by a quarter.
A more advanced example of the principle is Powerscreen International, a
Northern Irish producer of machines for crushing gravel. Powerscreen employs
no production workers. Instead, its factories in Northern Ireland and South
Wales contract out production to self-employed team leaders who recruit
teams of 20 apiece. The machines themselves are sold through distributors.
Perhaps the most cunning case of profiting by non-employment is Capita, the
London-based management consultancy. Among the chief exponents of hiving off
labour in the UK are central and local government. Capita's specialisation
is advising government on contracting out services to the private sector.
Since 1989, the company's pre-tax profits have gone from Pounds 1.5m to
Pounds 3.5m and turnover has tripled.
It is something of a relief to come across success stories which are more
straightforward. Countax, the Oxfordshire-based lawn mower manufacturer, has
had a splendidly wet summer. And recession or no, as Countax's managing
director, Mr Harry Handkammer, remarks, people have to mow the grass.
They are scarcely compelled to do so with one of Mr Handkammer's machines,
which sell for between Pounds 1,600 and Pounds 2,000. But Countax's success
dates from only two years ago, when recession was already on the horizon.
The company provided accessories for a maker of garden tractors. The
customer's sales dived and Countax nearly went under. It then turned to
designing and making its own machines, which it now turns out at the rate of
8,000 a year. Sales in the year just ended rose from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds
6.7m and this year are expected to reach Pounds 8m.
The reason given by Mr Handkammer is slightly at odds with the prevailing
climate. 'We have succeeded because we make the best product dealers can
sell. Customers get better value for their money, it's that simple.
Companies making bad products will do badly.'
This certainly seems borne out by the Scottish shirtmaker Hilditch &amp; Key,
whose shirts sell in New York at Dollars 195 each plus sales tax. Saks 5th
Avenue, the US department store, reports sales up 60 per cent in a year. The
secret, according to the Hilditch &amp; Key's chairman, Mr Michael Booth, is
quality and hard work in selling; though, he adds, discounting is so
widespread in the US that to get a product with a decent margin is worth a
lot to the retailer.
Then again, some companies selling cheap products do very nicely. The Land
Rover Centre at Nuneaton in the UK refurbishes old Land Rovers and sells
them for between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 6,000 apiece. Sales last year were
Pounds 150,000. This year they are expected to reach Pounds 200,000.
The owner and founder, Mr Phil Read, says he has never known it so busy. He
has lately been selling an average of 3.5 reconditioned Land Rovers a week.
A year ago it was one a week.
Mr Read provides a whole string of reasons for his success. 'We deal with a
section of the population which is just a little bit better off,' he says.
'People may have lowered their sights, but they're also sick and tired of
small second cars sitting in the drive.' Alternatively, he says, 'there's a
club cult thing - you drive along the road in a Land Rover and people are
always waving to you'. Or, more basically, 'it's my personality and
charisma'.
Some success stories may even be pointing the way out of recession.
Woolcombers Group, the Yorkshire wool processor which is planning to float
on the stock market next month, is working 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.
The encouraging general point is that the textiles industry can be a leading
indicator of recovery. It takes about 18 months to get wool from the sheep's
back on to the customer's. Wool cleaning is the first stage in that process,
so more throughput today means clothing manufacturers hope business will
pick up towards the end of 1993.
Companies have been wrong about that sort of thing before. In that case, one
final success story might prove more durable. Symonds' Cider &amp; English Wine,
a subsidiary of Bulmers, makes a cider with the intimidating title of
Scrumpy Jack. Two years ago, Scrumpy Jack was sold through 400 pubs in the
UK. It is now sold through 10,000. In that time, Symonds' output has
quintupled. Pre-tax profits went up 50 per cent last year.
Several reasons are suggested for this: in particular, the fact that UK
brewers have been obliged by the competition authorities to throw their pubs
open to competing brews. It may be tempting to think that there is a simpler
reason: that in these hard times, the population has taken to viewing the
world through a rustic haze of traditional English alcohol.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Too little, and perhaps too late: As the London conference
on Yugoslavia gets under way today, Judy Dempsey assesses the slim prospects
for peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As officials in London were putting the finishing touches to preparations
for the Yugoslavia peace conference, the people of Sarajevo yesterday
launched another desperate attempt to break through the four-month siege of
their city.
Today - when Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, and
Mr John Major, British prime minister, acting as president of the European
Community, open the conference - inhabitants from several other towns and
cities in Bosnia-Hercegovina, most notably the eastern town of Gorazde and
the northern city of Bihac, will be trapped inside Serb-imposed blockades.
As diplomats and politicians talk, fighting continues.
The question is whether the conference has the political will or means to
bring peace to the Balkan peninsula where there are no winners, only losers.
None of the republics has emerged unscathed. The tiny alpine republic of
Slovenia, invaded by the federal Yugoslav army in June 1991, can no longer
cope with the refugees fleeing from war-torn Bosnia. Nor can its small
economy thrive in the short term without finding new markets in western
Europe. More than 60 per cent of its trade was with its former Yugoslav
partners; telecommunications, road, and railways have been destroyed outside
its borders.
Independent Croatia is in worse shape. Not only is it home to more than
450,000 refugees, mostly from Bosnia, but a third of the republic's
territory is controlled by Serbs. Although the Serb-held areas formally have
the status of a UN protectorate, the likelihood of Zagreb regaining full
jurisdiction over Croatia remains slim.
Serbia, despite its territorial gains in Bosnia, can hardly claim any
victory in its war of expansionism. Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of the Serbs
in Bosnia, and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, rule over devastated
lands, their economies in ruin either through mismanagement or sanctions. In
Serbia itself, more than 500,000 refugees have placed the republic's
infrastructure under an insupportable burden. Above all, the Serbs are
virtually isolated on the diplomatic front, and humiliated. This humiliation
has almost suffocated what few democratic voices existed in the republic.
But while they have no power at the moment, some diplomatic support will
have to be extended to them if they are to shape the future of Serbian
political life.
Though everyone is a loser, the Bosnian Moslems have lost most. Unlike
Bosnia's Serbs or Croats, the Slav, Sunni Moslems have no ally in the former
Yugoslavia to protect them. Croatia and Serbia have capitalised on this
weakness by conspiring to divide Bosnia between them. Today, Croatia de
facto controls a swathe of territory in western Hercegovina, while Serbia
controls nearly 70 per cent of Bosnia, stretching from the east to the north
and across to Krajina, western Croatia.
For their part, the Moslems, who comprise more than 43 per cent of the 4.3m
population of Bosnia, have been sandwiched in a little area around Sarajevo.
Their attempt to take control of this land forms part of their efforts to
break through the Serb-imposed siege of Sarajevo.
The few liberal voices - academics, economists and journalists - in Croatia,
Serbia, Bosnia and in the other republics of the former Yugoslavia,
repeatedly argue that the plight of the Moslem population must take
precedence over other issues at the London conference.
They argue that without upholding Bosnia's present borders and restoring a
government which represents the three ethnic communities proportionally, the
international community risks fanning the flames of war into other parts of
Yugoslavia. This is because Macedonia, in the south, and the south-western
Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, share to some degree the same dilemma as
the Bosnian Moslems. Independent Macedonia, still unrecognised by the EC,
has no protector within the former Yugoslavia, nor have the ethnic Albanians
of Kosovo. Like the Moslems in Bosnia, who have appealed to the Islamic
countries for financial and military assistance, both might look outside to
defend themselves.
Fear of the conflict spreading provides impetus to the London conference's
attempt to get all the ethnic groups of the Balkans around the negotiating
table. But what practical steps towards ending the war can it take?
'The first thing western governments must do is to guarantee and recognise
the inviolability of borders within the former Yugoslavia,' said Mr Zarko
Puhovski, a sociology professor at Zagreb University. 'But there is no point
in doing this if we are not prepared to address the whole question of ethnic
and minority rights.'
Western diplomats suggest that the twin principles of inviolability of
borders and respect for ethnic rights would entail: Croatia and Serbia
renouncing all their territorial claims to Bosnia, and Serbia renouncing its
claims to Croatia.
That the Croat, Serb and Moslem communities in Bosnia, and the Serb minority
in Croatia, be granted ethnic and political autonomy, with institutions
reflecting the size of their respective populations. This means that any
future Bosnian government must be given back the territory seized by both
Croatia and by Serbia - at the moment, a principle which can be nothing more
than unrealistic. How this can be achieved, and how the tens of thousands of
refugees can be allowed back to Bosnia, may call for some military force, as
well as economic reconstruction aid from western governments for the
refugees who have no homes to which they can return.
Serbia restoring autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, which Mr
Milosevic snatched away in 1990.  If Serbia is demanding ethnic rights for
its minority in Croatia and Bosnia, it must extend the same principle to the
Albanians of Kosovo, to the Moslems of Sandjak in southern Serbia, and to
the Croat and Hungarian minorities in the Serb-controlled province of
Vojvodina.
In practice, implementing the twin principles will prove almost impossible
as long as the fighting continues. Moreover, the EC, and the UN have so far
shown that they are neither militarily, nor politically, prepared to protect
current borders, or to address the principle of minority rights. This
apparent unwillingness on the part of the west to act has deepened the
hatred between the ethnic communities.
EC diplomats, and military specialists in London for the conference, argue
that peace in the Balkans based on the two principles needs external
political, economic and military pressure from western governments to
succeed.
'Even if the conference talks about protecting borders, and protecting the
minorities, and closing down the vile detention camps, you have to set up
mechanisms, even military ones, for preventing the Serbs from continuing
their policy of ethnic cleansing, and holding on to the land they have
grabbed,' said Mr James Gow, a Yugoslav specialist at the Centre for Defence
Studies at King's College, London.
Dutch diplomats have no illusions about the tasks facing western
governments. 'We have to start from the premise that there are no democratic
institutions in most of the former republics which could help guarantee any
ethnic or minority rights,' a Dutch diplomat explained. 'The rule of law,
western rationalism, and ceasefire agreements, carry no weight among the men
in Bosnian countryside who are terrorising the innocent civilians.'
He said the liberal voices of the press in Serbia, except Vreme (the
Belgrade-based weekly) have been censored; Croat liberals are regarded as
traitors by the government when they demand rights for the ethnic Serbs in
Croatia; Serbs are pilloried for defending rights for the ethnic Albanians;
the media reinforces ethnic hatred and suspicion throughout the republics.
It seems impossible that the conference can contain or solve such a degree
of ethnic tension in the short term. Its critics have been vociferous in
denouncing its limitations. Yet despite current scepticism EC diplomats do
have a blueprint for establishing ethnic rights for all the ethnic
minorities throughout the former Yugoslavia, as well as guaranteeing the
inviolability of the current borders.
The document, the Treaty for the Convention, was discussed in The Hague on
November 5 last year during an earlier EC peace conference session. It
envisages, where necessary, the establishing of international monitors to
oversee the implementation of the twin principles. All the presidents of the
six republics signed, with the exception of Mr Milosevic, the linchpin of
any future agreement.
'I think we did have a basis for future negotiations. OK, we knew the
president of Croatia (Franjo Tudjman) could not be trusted. We were getting
used to the lying and the deceit, especially from the Serbian side. But I
still believe that this document did, and will, be used, in the future as a
plan upon which the status of the ethnic minorities can be based,' a senior
Dutch diplomat said.
'If we do not implement these principles, and more importantly, if we
recognise that Bosnia is finished, we will set a precedent for redrawing all
the borders agreed after 1945,' he said. He cited a few examples - the
borders between Romania and Moldova, Slovakia and Hungary, Hungary and
Transylvania - to show how a Third Balkan War would consume other parts of
Europe.
But will such principles be enough to persuade the Serbs in Bosnia to stop
the fighting? 'We have acted too little, too late,' an EC ambassador said.
'The EC went into Yugoslavia without any military force behind it. We could
have defended Sarajevo airport. I still believe a show of force could have
limited the killing. Now we are scrambling around.'
He added that the international community had nothing to show for all its
peace-keeping efforts in Yugoslavia. 'It is time the London conference
demonstrated we are now prepared to defend our principles. Otherwise, we
will become losers as well.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO AND a half years ago, Fernando Collor de Mello became the first
democratically elected president of Brazil to take office for 30 years. He
came to power in part on the strength of a promise to clean up the
corruption endemic in his country's political system. He offered the
prospect of breaking the mould of Brazilian politics. Today, that prospect
lies in ruins: Mr Collor, charged with corruption, may face a humiliating
impeachment by Congress unless he resigns.
To shake up the Brazilian system, Mr Collor had to confront powerful
entrenched interests - Brazil's political warlords and cossetted big
business - and to do so he needed to be beyond reproach himself. Lamentably,
he could not meet this test. A congressional inquiry has this week made a
strong case that the president was aware of corrupt practices among close
advisers, and benefited financially from them.
Whatever he does to try to preserve his hold on power, Mr Collor will never
be able to rebuild the trust he has lost. If he stays in power - his mandate
runs until March 1995 - it will inevitably be as a lame duck. At best,
policymaking would stagnate at a time when Brazil needs to embrace
aggressive fiscal and political reform. At worst, the efforts to unseat the
president would continue to dominate political life, bringing democracy into
further disrepute. The threat of a military coup must still be considered
slight, but if street protests against the president were to threaten
anarchy, that unpleasant possibility could not be ruled out. Military
government provided no answers for Brazil after the army's previous
takeovers in 1955 and 1964, and it offers even less of a solution today.
Reform programme
The Collor presidency has not been an unmitigated disaster. He has begun the
economic and fiscal reform which Brazil needs to resume growth, including a
significant abolition of import and other government controls and a lowering
of tariffs. The reform programme undoubtedly could and should have gone
further, but it has already engendered a genuine sense of change among
enterprises in Brazil.
However, reform no longer depends on President Collor. The current economic
team, led by economy minister Marcilio Marques Moreira, is committed to
continuing change - particularly to sorting out Brazil's chaotic fiscal
situation. Without that, financial support from the International Monetary
Fund will remain in doubt; as will the debt restructuring deal now being
negotiated with the international banks. There is no reason why Mr Moreira's
team should not be able to operate under a replacement president - even
under the current vice-president, Mr Itamar Franco, whose rhetoric in the
past has been hostile to economic reform.
Divert attention
The practical difficulties of building a reform-minded political coalition
in Brazil should not be underestimated. However, there is - even in the
Brazilian legislature - a growing sense that the system has to change. At
the very least, the prospects for reform without Mr Collor would be no less
bad than they are with him.
By insisting on hanging on to office, Mr Collor would also divert attention
from what would otherwise be the central political issue in the coming
months: reform of the 1988 constitution that has rendered the country
virtually ungovernable. A referendum is to be held in which voters will have
a choice of changing the political system - for example, to a parliamentary
government. What is more, Congress will be able to vote next year on a range
of changes to the constitution - which for example guarantees the jobs of
federal government workers - by simple majority rather than by the
two-thirds normally required. A consensus needs to be built to effect
suitable change.
In the meantime, the importance of preserving constitutional order in Brazil
is paramount. An impeachment may become a drawn-out process. But if Mr
Collor refuses to resign, then it must be allowed to take its course,
without interference from any quarter. The president has squandered, through
weakness or avarice, a great opportunity to serve his people. He would best
serve their interests now by resigning and allowing a constitutional
handover of power.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Cost challenge for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD of German industry is starting to look ruffled. Pessimists have
been forecasting for years that high labour costs, extensive subsidies and
market rigidities would eventually undermine many of the country's
advantages as an industrial powerhouse. During western Germany's
reunification-induced growth spurt between 1989 and 1991, it seemed as
though the pessimists had been proved wrong. Now, however, the western part
of the country is in a period of economic stagnation, while the recovery in
the east seems temporarily to have come to a halt.
Some fundamental difficulties affecting Germany's industrial structure have
worsened during the past two years. Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he will
fight the 1994 general election with the campaign slogan Standort
Deutschland - safegarding Germany's standing as an industrial base. He has
read the diagnosis, but has yet to find a cure.
The Bundesbank's tight monetary policy has hitherto had its chief impact
among Germany's neighbours, but the spores of recession are now blowing back
across Germany's borders. A series of announcements of job cuts by some of
Germany's largest corporations - Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Hoesch, BMW and,
last week, Siemens-Nixdorf - has indicated how retrenchment may be on the
way. Rising domestic costs, together with the need for a physical presence
closer to foreign markets, have already led to a sharp increase in corporate
investment abroad. Last year, German companies invested a net DM29bn outside
Germany; foreign companies' capital investment in Germany was only DM1.9bn.
If the US currency remains at DM1.40, the incentive will grow for companies
to transfer manufacturing offshore.
Limited influence
Much of the problem lies in production costs. During 1979-88, Germany
achieved the third-smallest increase in unit labour costs of any member of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last year, it
slid down to ninth in the table. In 1992, according to the OECD's
projections, it will fall to 16th place. Wage rises in industry during the
last two years - above all, in east Germany - have been too high for the
nation's health. On this, the government has only limited influence. Mr
Kohl's administration should, however, do all it can to encourage those
realistic sections of the German trade union movement which are pondering
the option of longer working hours and pay cuts in companies facing
particular economic difficulties.
Financial hand-outs
One area where Mr Kohl does carry direct responsibility is in the
proliferation of subsidies, above all for east Germany. The Bundesbank
calculates that overall public sector financial hand-outs rose 70 per cent
between 1989 and 1992. Many of these subsidies are supporting consumption
rather than investment. They contribute to the malfunctioning of the market
economy in both east and west. Additionally, the government has not done
enough to cut the excessive share of non-wage costs - in particular,
companies' social security contributions - in the overall burdens on
employers. These make up 45 per cent of industry's overall labour costs. In
one important example, the government must press on with its latest efforts
to reduce health spending by DM11bn a year.
Overshadowing all else have been policy errors over German unity. The
government has failed to put the financing of unification on to a sound
footing. Rather than using the opportunity of unity to prise open the more
protected parts of the German economy, the federal republic has exported its
solid but rigid economic system to the east. Financial transfers from west
to east of around DM100bn a year will probably be necessary until the end of
the decade to fulfil Mr Kohl's promise of a 'flourishing landscape' in the
east. Organising this resource shift without hampering its productive
capacity is certainly within Germany's grasp. It would, however, be ironic
if, in order to escape the country's self-generated cost pressures,
industry's main reaction to Germany's territorial enlargement was to move
increasing slices of manufacturing to cheaper and more productive sites
abroad.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: The devaluation of all values - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIGION may be set for a resurrection in our schools but it is still
anathema to the television companies. The BBC has whittled down its coverage
to little more than the Thora Hird Hymnal, while ITV trusts to the Harry
Secombe Songbook to ease viewers into Eternity. But if the Sabbath is a
no-go area for God, the schedules are keen to ensure that there is a flow of
thoughtful, uplifting, sobering programmes on offer on Sunday evenings to
prepare the population for the week ahead.
Last Sunday was no exception. On Channel Four there was The Real Thing,
which pretends 'to look at religious belief in a post-Modern world'.
(Post-modern is one of those lovely buzz phrases which means little but
suggests that the user is way ahead of the game). Anyway this programme
seems well designed to satisfy Dissenters. On BBC, Everyman gave us the
harrowing story of Jason, four and dying, which concentrated the mind on the
transience of life to the satisfaction of the Orthodox, while ITV came up
with a repeat of The Monarchy which, as a hierarchical institution with
mystical powers, successfully replaced organised religion in the lives of
the people until it fell into schism.
The Real Thing was infuriating. It was obviously prepared by robots with
attitude. Narrators Geoffrey Palmer and Zoe Wanamaker endowed the script
with all the reverence of Holy Writ: every line was a computer-speak
aphorism. In apology for the words, the screen was busy with arbitrary
images.
The basic message was that science had done away with absolute truths, so a
South American Indian fertility ritual, based around the beheading of a
fretwork crocodile, was just as relevant as our rational attitude to life.
It's all horses for courses. Just to ram home the point that we westerners
can get up to some pretty suspect myth-making of our own there was film of a
Hitler rally. But hold on - if all rituals are judgment-free that means that
as long as the Sieg Heil-ing Nazis believed in their play-acting that should
be OK, too.
The programme worked in that it found me constantly saying 'Hold on', but
the supercilious condescension of the experts, including Professor Bernard
Williams of Oxford University, was ultimately too much to bear. Our Western
values may be dubious, but the rest of the world seems anxious enough to
embrace them, giving up face tattoos for Sony Walkmans. The Noble Savage is
as out-dated as Modernism.
The irrelevance of the The Real Thing was pinpointed an hour earlier in The
Living Planet. David Attenborough showed remarkable film of Inuit (Eskimos)
tracking and killing a polar bear and eating its raw flesh. They then built
a snow igloo that was cosy enough for a young child to happily frolic in
naked. It was a way of life unchanged for two millenia. Then came the
Attenborough pay-off: 'That film was shot 20 years ago'. Their traditional
way of life is now history. The Real Thing is in danger of trying to make
bricks with non-existent straw.
There was no obvious religious feeling in The Real Thing, but it throbbed
gently throughout Everyman. The attitude of the parents and the hospice
staff, as they tried to make Jason's brief life worthwhile, was exemplary.
Suddenly there was a homily, pronounced with no religious undercurrent but
strangely transcendental in its meaning.
A nurse who had cared for many terminally ill children said that there came
a time when, instead of congratulating the child for his grit in getting
through the day, parents should start to thank him for being such a treasure
and let him know that he could go now. She said the children accepted, even
welcomed, the change. Jason had the liveliest of younger sisters: he seemed
to be waiting for her to walk before he died. Tamsin Day-Lewis's film
suggested that the briefest, most tragic, life could give a meaning to
existence.
Mark Redhead's six part survey of The Monarchy could hardly be more happily
co-incidental. It is a bit worthy, with a succession of predictable talking
heads - Lord St John of Fawsley for the defence; John Griggs on the muted
attack - but the prosaic pace made its under-stated facts seem that much
more extraordinary.
The media have been excavating the monarchy for 20 years now, but have
apparently only scraped the surface of the institution - for example, the
fact that minor royals, like Princess Michael of Kent, curtsy good night to
premier league players like Princess Margaret even when there is no one
around to observe them. And the Prince of Wales is equally deferential when
greeting the Queen - after their secretaries have fixed up a meeting.
The programme forcefully pointed out that all the Queen's chief advisers
come from a closely knit group of aristocratic families, and that a
re-incarnated Queen Victoria would find few changes inside the royal
parlour. All the apparent movement of recent years has been window dressing.
You began to understand the strain put on outsiders who marry into the Firm.
* * * So farewell Out, Channel 4's Gay and Lesbian programme which has
brightened up so many Wednesday evenings. It went out with a double helping
last week - a gritty piece on the travails of German transvestites, then
some mildly erotic movies on Thursday, which would presumably have caused
consternation had the participants been heterosexual.
Out is a victim of a short-sighted economy drive. Out had a style and
panache all its own, unsurprising from a sector of society which cares
greatly for appearances and attitudes. It was self-righteous when it
confronted gay politics; achingly funny when it turned the camera on
subjects that heterosexuals would find embarrassing, such as body hair; and
arcanely topical when investigating matters of style, such as the problems
of gays who like to dress like skinheads, traditionally enthusiastic queer
bashers.
Out was out about everything, not excluding the conflict which often exists
between Gays and Lesbians. A conceived common foe has forced them into
uneasy partnership, like the ill-suited Burgess and MacLean. Gays obviously
enjoyed speaking out on this matter: how their friendly clubs become
menacing arenas when the dungareed and tattooed Feminist thought-police
among Lesbians join the party. The Gays' only means of defence apparently is
to set up an insistent whisper of 'fish, fish'. Odd.
Having been bereft of my own favourite soap since Compact, I had high hopes
of Eldorado. It began well - low ratings and dire reviews are usually the
birth pangs of a monster hit - but I am rapidly becoming disillusioned. Why
are all the men such absolute bastards - complete wimps like Bunny, or music
hall villains like Marcus? The only nice one is gay Freddie.
Why does the multi-million, specially built, villa complex in Spain look
like the back lot at Shepperton? The atmosphere is more Latvia than Latin.
Where is the sun; where are the natives? Where do they all come from and
what are they all doing there? Why do they all talk like Blind Date
panellists? The only decent thing in it is Fizz (played by Kathy Pitkin),
who not only acts all the other younger members of the cast off the screen
but who also looks like someone you might see on the playa at Torremolinos.
When she goes, I go.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: Opera double bill - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A double-bill with a combined cast of two: when the new festival director at
Edinburgh has come from the world of opera, it is ironic that his first
festival should be so parsimonious in the provision of operatic fare. The
festival is into its second week and this performance at the King's Theatre
is the nearest that the visitor seeking culture will yet have come to a
staged opera.
Doubtless there comes a point where the hungry man is grateful for any
morsel that is thrown his way. It may not matter that this pair of
one-person operas - one by Cimarosa, the other by Poulenc - barely requires
any sort of staging at all. The novelty of putting them together is probably
enough to carry the evening in itself. But, even combined, they are hardly
able to satisfy an appetite for real opera.
The first was Cimarosa's Il maestro di cappella, an under-spiced little hors
d'oeuvre. The orchestra is on stage and is being rehearsed by the
singer/conductor. Violins are asked to play their part first, then violas,
then oboes and so on. Some amusement is caused when the players get their
parts wrong, but the jokes wear thin the second time round and it is only
the professionalism of Claudio Desderi, who has made a speciality of this
piece as singer and conductor, that carries it off.
There is rather more to Poulenc's La Voix humaine, although that, too, has
always seemed to me an unsatisfying work. A desire to get the music to
mirror the neurotic chat of 'Elle', a woman near suicide on the phone to the
lover who has jilted her, results in a score of disconnected comments and
asides, which fail to build into a single, cumulative statement.
The opera stands or falls with its solo artist. In Edinburgh, Elisabeth
Soderstrom showed that, in physical terms at least, she can still give a
devastating performance of Elle.
As we know from her Janacek heroines, there is nobody to equal Soderstrom in
the portrayal of the modern woman. The forced smile, the nervous lighting of
a cigarette, the sleeping pills, the affectionate cradling of the phone: all
caught poor Elle, a rag-bag of 20th-century neuroses, to perfection. The
timing and dramatic awareness remain inspirational.
With Elle's couch wisely placed in front of the orchestra (and not behind,
as at the Queen Elizabeth Hall some years ago) Soderstrom was able to make
herself heard easily enough, although the voice is audibly difficult to
control these days.
Richard Armstrong directed the Scottish Chamber Orchestra with more drama
than sensuality, the stage acoustics at the King's Theatre also being on the
dry side for this lush piece.
It was rumoured that the second performance on Monday was to be Soderstrom's
farewell to the stage. If true, she has departed with her customary sense of
style.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: European Community Youth Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community Youth Orchestra has been in existence for 14 years,
drawing its members from music colleges and conservatoires across the
community and coming together twice yearly for rehearsals and tours. Out of
its ranks have grown the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the Gustav Mahler
Jugendorchester, as well as a host of smaller groups.
From the beginning, the ECYO's standards have been astonishingly high, and
its roster of conductors matches that of any orchestra in the world  - from
Abbado (who was the first artistic director) and Karajan to Bernstein, Solti
and Haitink.
The current tour is shared between Carlo Maria Giulini and Mstislav
Rostropovich. Giulini conducted performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
in Switzerland and the Low Countries, while Rostropovich's concerts take him
from Luxembourg to Britain to Greece and back to France and Italy.
His two programmes consist of works by the composers with whom he has been
most closely associated as cellist and conductor, Britten, Prokofiev and
Shostakovich. The Britten is the War Requiem, which the ECYO brought to
Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Monday. The soloists were Makvala Kasrashvili,
Ian Caley and David Wilson-Johnson, with the London Symphony Chorus, the St
Michael's Singers and the boy choristers of Coventry Cathedral.
It was a bold, thrilling performance, full of grandeur and drama, starkly
characterised by Rostropovich. He concentrated his efforts entirely on the
chorus and main orchestra, recruiting Christopher Bell to direct the chamber
ensemble and male soloists.
There were a few problems of continuity; in the second half of the requiem,
always difficult to sustain after the fury of the Dies Irae has passed, the
performance had to ride some awkward gear changes. Invariably, Rostropovich
was able to raise the emotional temperature in the noisiest passages but
nevertheless the impression this time was of an artful patchwork, almost
formulaic in its use of the Wilfred Owen poems to undercut the blandishments
of the Latin mass. The very best versions of the War Requiem manage to
disguise that weakness entirely.
Ms Kasrashvili's wide vibrato and fearsome attack were well matched to
soprano lines conceived by Britten for the Slavonic timbre of Galina
Vishnevskaya, Rostropovich's wife. Caley's thin, reedy tenor was more
pleasing in duet than in the solo settings, but Wilson-Johnson was
magnificent, concentrating attention on every word, judging the nuances of
the text perfectly, wringing out their irony and anguish.
Both male soloists were placed well to the right of the Symphony Hall
platform, and revealed an unexpected directional bias in the acoustics: when
Wilson-Johnson in particular sang straight ahead his voice appeared blurred;
only when he turned slightly towards the centre did it snap into sharp
focus. Against that blemish however, must be set the wonderful handling of
the choral sound, absolutely distinct from triple piano to the loudest
forte, and the wealth of luminous detail in the orchestral textures.
* * * Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony was the main work in the ECYO's Prom
on Saturday, a serious, intense account which was a fine illustration of the
way in which Rostropovich's approach as a conductor has settled and matured.
It is not damning with faint praise to describe the Eleventh as the best of
Shostakovich's neglected symphonies; it was written to celebrate the events
of 1905 in St Petersburg when the Tsar's troops fired on unarmed
demonstrators, and no doubt its socialist realism has told against it in
some quarters. Leaving aside the programme, though, it stands as a coherent
symphonic structure in its own right - four hefty movements built around
fragments of political songs, with a grave funeral march at its core, and a
finale of urgent drama.
The ECYO conveyed it magnificently - the orchestra's brass section was
outstanding here and in the Britten - and provided the accompaniment for a
startling performance of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. The soloist was
Martha Argerich on her most electrifying form, defying the conductor and
orchestra to outdo her in vividness and attack. That they failed to meet the
challenge was no disgrace at all; this was playing of a quality that few
living pianists could approach in this work.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: Two CP Taylor plays - Edinburgh International Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT kind of playwright was CP Taylor? One who required excellent and
sympathetic direction and performances, it would appear from this Edinburgh
Festival. Without those, little of his work is standing the test of time.
This second week of the festival has produced two more of Taylor's plays.
Though both are more absorbing than either The Ballachulish Beat or Walter
last week, they are heightening the impression that, in terms of
craftsmanship, exposition and characterisation, Taylor was a likeable,
humane, satirical but inadequate dramatist.
Operation Elvis, in morning or afternoon performances at the Corn Exchange,
is an example of Taylor's work for children. Because it is also about
children, it becomes watchable for adults too. 10-year-old Malcolm, the
child of a selfish and silly mother whose mind is solely on the men in her
life, insists that he is Elvis Presley; sings his songs, wears his jacket.
When, however, Malcolm meets and strikes up a friendship with Michelle, who
has cerebral palsy, he becomes so absorbed in helping her that he forgets
all about his Elvis obsession.
The play itself is thin, schematic and sentimental, and its final line -
'I'm Malcolm] I'm Malcolm]' - is crude. Yet for much of its duration you are
held, thanks to first-rate performances by Andy Milarvie and Annalu Waller
(Michelle), both making their professional debuts.
Milarvie gives Malcolm energy, ingenuous charm and openness; Waller's
squawks, flops and heaves all convey perfectly the eloquence that only
Malcolm perceives.
The Black and White Minstrels (premiered in 1972 at the Traverse) is much
funnier than this under-cast King's Head Theatre production demonstrates,
yet has its flaws too. Half its comedy depends on the way its characters do
not converse so much as conduct separate monologues that only occasionally
interleave.
One woman talks of which man she wants to go to bed with that night, one man
talks of his problems with prose creativity and another man yells about the
other man's political incorrectness.
This is not so amusing when it happens in every scene, and it is less
amusing when you have just seen it in several other CP Taylor plays. Still,
the idea of The Black and White Minstrels is a hoot. Cyril, a leftwing,
politically correct writer, and his wife Gil are involved in a wife-swapping
quartet each weekend with Harry and Pat. Cyril, however, is distracted by
the pressures of this set-up, by financial problems, and by his guilty
suspicion that his hostile Nigerian lodger is exerting voodoo spells to bung
up his creative flow.
Pat and Harry are not only rabidly leftwing, randy, and selfish but also
inanely blind to these traits in themselves. The situation is worthy of
Malcolm Bradbury or David Lodge.
The play wins laughs but not guffaws. The role of Gil is ungratefully
written. Several farce moments are mistimed. The four lead characters are so
cast that you do not realise Cyril and Pat are meant to be the two
best-looking until the lines say so. Only Jason Isaacs, as Cyril, has the
skill and pacing to create a character at once convincing and yet absurd.
The Black and White Minstrels continues at the Church Hill Theatre until
August 29; Operation Elvis at the Corn Exchange until August 27

Eldorado (BBC 1, 7.00) already seems to have been running forever, getting
through plot lines with the profligacy of a Sun King. If, like me, you have
wondered why so many Brits are clustered together on the Costa del Sol,
there is hard evidence in Coast of Dreams (Channel 4, 9.00) which follows
some real ex-pats who have forsaken the UK for a living in Spain.
Among them is Mike, once a joiner in Southend, who now works 16-hour shifts
preparing 200 roast beef dinners for British tourists. This is the real face
of Eldorado.
It is 23 years since the Rolling Stones' totally spaced-out guitarist Brian
Jones was drowned, and Mick Jagger mourned him by wearing a dress and
reciting Shelley's Adonais in front of the thousands in Hyde Park. Film of
the event features in Mojo Working (Channel 4, 11.15).
Earlier on BBC2 and Radio 3 at 7.30, the oldest orchestra in Russia, the St
Petersburg Philharmonic, plays romantic music at the Proms - Berlioz,
Sibelius and Tchaikovsky.
In Business (Radio 4 at 8.45) examines the impact of the recession on three
companies and asks 'experts' how long the agony will continue.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Management: Mist at the end of the tunnel - A look at
Eurotunnel's preparations for turning itself into a railway operator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can picture the scene. It is an autumn morning in 1993 and the first
Eurotunnel shuttles ever to pass under the Channel in public service are
about to set off from the terminals on the British and French coasts, jammed
to the gunwhales with dignitaries.
At precisely 11.00, the starting signal is given, the train doors whoosh
shut, the crowds let out a cheer, and . . . nothing happens. There has been
a points failure somewhere in the tunnel, the signals have turned to red,
and the shuttle trains are left stuck in the platforms as the embarrassment
remorselessly mounts.
Of course, it will never happen. And yet . . . could it? What is to say that
Eurotunnel will turn out to be any good at running trains if and when the
tunnel opens, as scheduled, late next year?
If anything, the odds look stacked against it. After all, Eurotunnel's main
purpose until now has been financing and managing one of the world's biggest
construction projects. The management skills appropriate to that task appear
to have little in common with those needed to run a railway. Sometime
between now and the tunnel's opening the company must undergo an
extraordinary transformation.
Eurotunnel, inevitably, sees things rather differently. It is wrong, it
says, to imagine a day when the project team finishes its work, walks out
the gates, and hands over the keys to a bunch of newly-recruited railway
operatives with a cheery: 'Bonne chance, mes braves.'
In fact, transport already forms one of the three prongs of Eurotunnel's
organisational structure, alongside project management and finance. In
staffing terms, it is also very large, accounting for nearly half the
company's 1,000 employees.
Head of transport is Alain Bertrand, managing director, operations. Formerly
manager of the south-east region of SNCF, the French national railway, he
joined Eurotunnel in January 1987.
Bertrand's first task was to form a small group of people with transport
experience to advise the project team on the suitability of the transport
systems they were devising, both from an operational and a commercial point
of view.
Since then, as the tunnel's opening date has grown nearer, so has the need
to recruit the people who are going to manage the operation of the shuttle
trains, the terminals, the signalling and the tracks; and in parallel, those
who are going to market the shuttle services to the public.
Like Bertrand, many of the most senior transport managers - half of them
English, half French - come directly from the transport industry. Peter
Dyke, operations director, comes from BAA, the former British Airports
Authority; Andre Pascal, engineering director, comes from RATP, the Paris
transport authority; and Christopher Garnett, commercial director, comes
from Sealink Stena Line, the cross-Channel ferry operator.
Below them, the recruitment sources vary. Some people are coming from
outside, but others - for example, signal engineers, track engineers, cable
engineers and communications engineers - are transferring from Eurotunnel's
project team, where they are currently overseeing the installation of the
transport systems by Transmanche-Link, the contractors.
One obvious benefit of recruiting from this source is that the people who
install the systems know them inside out. As Bertrand puts it, if he has any
trouble with his signalling system, he will turn to his chief signalling
engineer and say: 'Look, you procured this thing. Now sort it out.'
Other recruits are coming from TML itself. For example, many of the
highly-skilled mechanical and electrical engineers formerly employed on
TML's tunnel-boring machines have transferred to Eurotunnel's transport
division. And when work on the tunnel is finished, a large proportion of
Eurotunnel's 300 shuttle train drivers will be recruited from among the
drivers of TML's works trains.
So a good deal of expertise has been lined up for the transport team. Even
so, there is still a long way to go before recruitment is complete. By the
time the transport system opens next year, some 2,000 people will be needed
to operate it, maintain it and sell its services.
'What we have here,' says Bertrand, 'is a nucleus of operators - the people
who will start the commissioning and testing of the systems. As for the rank
and file - the people who will take your money at the toll booths, the train
crews and so on - it would be completely silly to recruit them now. But
their supervisors are here, because they are the ones who are drafting the
procedures, who are familiarising themselves with the equipment and with the
method of operation; and they will recruit their people when the time
comes.'
The trick for Eurotunnel is to get the timing right. It has to be sure that
enough fully-trained people are in place to run the system when it opens;
but on the other hand, it does not want people standing idle in the run-up
to the opening.
According to Bertrand, this need not happen. The build-up to the full
complement will be a gradual process. As more people are taken on, they will
be fully employed learning procedures and undergoing training (in use of the
French language, as well as technical matters). As the opening date draws
closer and delivery of the shuttle trains begins, they will start testing
and commissioning the equipment.
By the time the tunnel opens to the public, it will have been tested for
months, with employees running the shuttles as ghost trains or acting as
surrogate passengers. Theoretically, at least, most of the technical faults
should by then have been eradicated. In any event, the pressure will be
relatively light at first because delays to the opening of the tunnel have
pushed the opening date into the low season.
The danger is that once the tunnel has gone smoothly into public service,
the skilled people will become bored and wander off. Bertrand plays down the
risk: there will be enough people like himself, he says, who have witnessed
the project's birth and want to see it through its years of infancy.
And what of Eurotunnel's chief executive, Sir Alastair Morton? He says it
will be down to Bertrand to run the transport operation. 'I'm neither a
retailer nor a transportation operator nor a service company manager,' he
says.
'I've undertaken to see the tunnel through any start-up difficulties before
I go, but only as the chairman of the executive committee of the board: in
other words, in a full-time executive role, but in the boardroom rather than
in day-to-day management.'
Once the tunnel is over its start-up difficulties, he says - in 1994 or 1995
 -he envisages stepping down to a non-executive role. And after that: 'I'll
be taking a very long holiday - if I live that long.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Everyone's losing their
marbles - Haig Simonian describes the furore surrounding one of the world's
most famous quarries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the marble quarries high above Carrara in Tuscany, where Michelangelo
chose the slabs for his future masterpieces, an almighty row has broken out.
Like hundreds of other squabbles between industry and environmentalists, it
has driven a wedge between those concerned about pollution and the landscape
and others more preoccupied with profits and peoples' livelihoods.
But the battle between the marble quarriers of Carrara, on whom the town's
economy largely depends, and the local council, supported by the Tuscan
regional administration, cuts much deeper than the gashes in the mountains
from which marble has been extracted over the centuries and which are now at
the heart of the rumpus.
Under plans to develop the local Apuan park, the name for the area which
covers the mountains above Carrara and embraces most of the quarries,
industrialists fear their businesses are at risk. Three high-altitude
quarries have already closed owing to the enforcement of rules banning
excavation above 1,200 metres. More could follow, they warn.
For many locals, not just in the marble business, the quarries, sawmills and
associated processing facilities which dominate the landscape are more
intrinisic to Carrara, its history and surroundings, than any attempts to
set up an industry-free zone in the hills. But for others, the park
represents the first serious attempt by the authorities to check the
unbridled expansion of the quarries since their origins.
The business of quarrying the lightly grained white stone, for which Carrara
is famous, has certainly left its mark. From a distance, especially in
winter, visitors regularly mistake the huge white gashes along the local
stretch of the Appenines, for snow. Only when they approach on roads like
the narrow, twisty lane which leads up to the village of Colonnata above
Carrara, do they realise that what they are seeing are vast white slices
gorged out of the face of the rock.
Elsewhere, the quarrying is less immediately striking, as at the disused
workings which litter the area. Often, they are all that is left of
centuries of labour cutting hundreds of feet into the mountain, only to be
abandoned when a vein has run out, or the stone has become too difficult to
extract commercially. All around are piles of debris, testifying to the fact
that often less than 10 per cent of the stone extracted is suitable for
sale.
For Simonetta Cattani Lazzareschi, head of the Carrara Industrialists'
Association, the quarries are a thing of beauty. 'Look,' she says, pointing
to the workings above the churchyard at Colonnata, 'have you ever seen
anything so splendid?'
Lazzareschi, the only woman to head an Industrialists' Association in Italy,
is not a lady to be crossed in a hurry. Her strong features betray the
traits of the Greek and Arab craftsmen who, she says, were first brought
into the region by the Romans to work the stone.
Perceptions of beauty are somewhat different at Carrara town hall, where
Alberto Pincione is mayor. The marble-cladding of the modern, two-storey
building highlights the trade's importance for the town, especially now that
so much of the heavy public-sector industry brought into the area by
Mussolini in the late 1920s has closed down, leaving 6,000 unemployed.
'No one wants to close the quarries,' he says. 'But they have to observe the
rules on protecting the landscape and maintaining safety standards'.
Both are touchy subjects within the left-leaning council, dominated until
recently by the Communist Party. 'There have been 44 deaths in the quarries
since 1977, and almost as many serious injuries,' says Vittorio Prayer, a
local journalist. His fingers quickly find the page in a specialised medical
magazine on industrial injuries showing a gruesome colour photograph of a
huge marble block, one side spattered with blood.
The quarrel now raging over the implications of the park is as complex as
might be expected in a one-industry town, where the trade is dominated by a
handful of aggressively independent entrepreneurial families which have,
until recently, been left largely to themselves.
The quarriers claim the park, first mooted in 1975, poses a more serious
threat to their livelihoods than even the depression of the late 1920s,
which prompted Mussolini to develop many of the now defunct alternative
sources of employment in the region.
Since then, the number of people working in the quarries has fallen as new
technology has replaced manual labour and the highly fragmented quarries
have been rationalised into the hands of relatively few families and big
companies.
Only about 1,900 people now work in quarrying, compared with around 14,000
at the beginning of the century. However, Lazzareschi reckons about 1,000
jobs hang on every one occupied in the mountains.
The valleys and plain below the city echo to the repetitive grinding of
hundreds of sawmills operating around the clock to cut huge blocks of marble
into thin slices for cladding skyscrapers, making table tops and even
gravestones. Around a quarter of the world's stone cutting facilites are in
Carrara, according to the Industrialists' Association.
The quarry owners fear that if the park one day receives national, rather
than regional, status, all quarrying will have to stop. 'The rules governing
national parks in Italy prohibit excavation,' says Lazzareschi. 'Given the
poor financial state of the Tuscany region, the authorities are bound to try
to shift the burden for the park to the state. That means we would close.'
The demise of quarrying would also threaten the substantial tourist business
which has developed in its wake. The quarries and exposed peaks may not be
aesthetically appealing to all, but they are often breathtaking and stand as
historical monuments in their own right.
'Closure is crazy. It would put us all out of business,' says Vannucci
Venanzio, the owner of a small restaurant in Colonnata that lives off the
marble and tourist trades.
But according to Pincione: 'No one is talking about closing anything. But do
you really call what has been done to the hillsides beautiful? It wouldn't
be allowed elsewhere in Europe.' Under present rules, the quarry-owners have
almost free rein over their sites, for which they pay a token rent, under
concessions dating back to 1751.
The council, which will this year make around L4.2bn (Pounds 2m) from a
special tax on the amount of stone quarried, sees its role in enforcing the
environmental and safety rules which have been introduced since the 1980s
but not always observed. 'Theoretically, the quarries should follow precise
rules on how they cut into a hillside, not to change its shape without
permission. And there should be regulations on cleaning up afterwards,' says
Prayer. The briefest visit to the region demonstrates otherwise.
The park, which advanced one step further last month with the appointment of
a new management board, has now become the focal point for the wider dispute
over future regulation. Although not yet a threat, its creation and the
likely rise in bureaucracy it will entail could obstruct the quarries'
expansion, particularly as new stone-cutting technology has accelerated the
rate of excavation.
Meawnhile, the underlying issue of exerting control over an industry which
is of immense economic and cultural importance to the region but which may
have grown accustomed to being left to itself in the past, remains
unresolved.
'Environmental legislation has increased steadily,' says one resident, who
has followed the growing conflict closely. 'And rules now cover every part
of the business, including the sawmills, which pollute local rivers with
marble powder and other chemicals for treating and polishing stone.'
Behind the fighting talk on both sides, there is undoubtedly room for
compromise. It is almost inconceivable that anyone on Carrara's council
would dream of closing the quarries, on which the town so heavily relies.
Nor are the quarry owners quite the shameless exploiters some of their
critics claim. But so far, their positions have not met.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Management: The pop star lifestyle of a busy banker - The
diary of a Deutsche Bank boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Germany there are few more prestigious jobs than being a main board
director - a Vorstand - of one of the big banks. Most prestigious of all is
to be a Vorstand of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank.
There are thirteen of these individuals, who tower above the German business
establishment, and sit on the supervisory boards of its largest industrial
companies.
In Germany they are treated like pop stars. When they appear in public
together they are mobbed by photographers. When they go abroad, they go as
unofficial ambassadors for Germany, living symbols of its post-war economic
success.
Getting to meet a Deutsche Bank Vorstand can be difficult. Rolf Breuer,
54-year-old head of securities and asset management at the bank and a
Vorstand since 1985, says his diary is booked up until early 1994, meetings
scheduled for every hour of every working day, from 8.30 am to 7 pm.
How does he manage his workload? He sits on the board of around 60
companies. He is responsible for the bank's securities activities, and for
its business in the Stuttgart region and in the Near and Middle East. He
also finds time to promote Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial
centre, to sit on a committee for comic opera, and he is treasurer of the
International Bach Academy in Stuttgart.
His personal staff consists of only five people - two secretaries, two
personal assistants and a chauffeur. Pre-planning is what allows him to cope
with the workload:
'You have to rely on your associates,' he says, 'you can't do all these
things in too much detail. That isn't your job - what you should do is
organise your work in advance so that you can be sure that things are under
your control.'
Breuer's commitments can be mapped out well in advance. Every Tuesday the
Deutsche Bank holds a board meeting at which the bank decides on its
strategy. The dates of the board meetings of the 60 or so companies with
which Breuer is associated can also be inked into the diary months ahead of
time. Likewise with overseas visits and official functions.
It is the job of his two secretaries to help Breuer with the unexpected:
shuffling his commitments. Weekdays can always be expanded by meeting over
breakfast or dinner, although often several evenings a week are taken up
with functions.
He reserves one day of the weekend for office work, preparing himself for
the Tuesday board meeting, but also coping with what could not be dealt with
during the week.
His commitment to work is total. During the four weeks holiday he takes
every year he reads the Financial Times and the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung and remains in touch with the office.
Although he has one free day a week when he plays golf with friends who have
nothing to do with the bank, he says he never switches off. 'Unfortunately I
am always contactable,' he says, 'much to the distress of my wife'.
Given the magnitude of the job, there is little scope for private life. What
there is of it is circumscribed by the need for tight security, a need
brought home to Breuer and colleagues in December 1989 when Alfred
Herrhausen, the bank's visionary chief executive, was assassinated by
terrorists.
Unlike some senior German businessmen, Breuer is not himself armed, but his
bodyguards are. His house is watched by guards and protected by
sophisticated electronic surveillance equipment. 'Of course the family
suffers,' Breuer admits. 'I do not have enough time for my family. I can't
help this - and fortunately they are nice enough not to mind.'
Ironically, for a job which requires so much planning, Breuer counsels that
it is impossible to plan to get on to the main board.
'If you start at the bottom of an organisation you can make a calculation
about what sort of level you are likely to reach through being ambitious and
capable,' he says.
'To make it further than that you need a lot of luck. If you happen to be
the right age when a vacancy on the main board comes along, then you might
get the job. By the time you are fifty, you are too old, no matter how good
you are.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Japan's electric rubbish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hum of electric rubbish trucks is becoming a familiar sound to the
residents of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. There are only four of them at the
moment, but the city council's environment bureau hopes to raise the number
to 30 before long.
What is unusual about the trucks is that their batteries are charged up
using power generated by the incineration plant to which they deliver their
rubbish.
The plant, one of five large incinerators which consume Yokohama's vast
rubbish output, uses its heat to drive a 12MW steam turbine. (Some
electricity also goes to run a nearby old people's home and the remainder is
sold to the local electric utility.)
The trucks themselves have the capacity to carry 1.75 tonnes of rubbish. But
the drawback is the batteries. Each truck has 26 of them weighing the better
part of a tonne, and until the weight can be brought down there is a limit
to the trucks' possibilities, according to Hiromasa Hayashi, who is in
charge of development.
The Hokubu incinerator plant was designed to be as self-contained and
environment-friendly as possible.
The main plant is almost completely air-tight. The only large entrance - the
one through which the rubbish trucks come and go - is also the air intake
for the furnaces. A constant inrush of air prevents unpleasant smells from
escaping.
The main chamber is a vast space-age hall with grabber cranes which load
rubbish into the three furnaces.
The ash produced at the other end is used for land reclamation in the
harbour. The stack is subject to strict emission controls.
Hokubu processes 1m tonnes of rubbish a year and employs 98 workers. The
plant is only eight years old, but Suzumu Ichinokawa, the plant manager,
doubts that the council would be able to site any more plants close to the
city, despite all the efforts to make them acceptable.
'It's very hard to get such plants built now because local people don't like
them,' he explains

FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Courting the agents of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is environmental improvement really worth the effort for business?
Frequently not. It is expensive, tiresome and does little in the way of
immediate returns. Yet given that environmental improvement is a fact of
life - even a condition of business - most companies will have to come to
terms with it in the end. The challenge is in finding the commercially most
suitable way forward.
A management report* from the Centre for Exploitation of Science and
Technology (Cest), the government and industry-funded research group, looks
at these questions in a constructive light.
It addresses many of the problems which inhibit businesses when it comes to
dealing with environmental matters.
Cest's experience has shown that environmental opportunities are usually not
obvious to those who might gain. The reasons are:
A wider range of stakeholders need to be involved in exploiting the
opportunity than most companies are used to: for example, public interest
groups.
The payback often comes in the medium term, and commitment cannot be
justified solely against short-term objectives.
Companies have to interact with different constituencies in order to
generate the necessary understanding and influence.
Cest's answer is that businesses should look for opportunities in the growth
of environmental concerns, and should reduce their own uncertainties by
getting to know - and trying to influence - agents of change.
Companies must also appreciate the growing role that new technologies will
play, and learn to understand that there are social values and processes at
work, which they will have to take into account.
As purchasers of materials, disposers of waste and manufacturers of products
with potential environmental liabilities, they must build systematic
relationships with other companies.

FT  26 AUG 92 / 'Sea ape' theory finds friends: British Association for the
Advancement of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AQUATIC ape theory that many of the features distinguishing humans from
primates were acquired 5m years ago when our species was living in the Afar
Sea, off the east coast of Africa, found few dissenters at the meeting.
Ms Elaine Morgan, who says she has been cold-shouldered by the scientific
community because she has no formal scientific qualifications, gave a
presentation on the theory published by the late Professor Alister Hardy in
1960.
She was drawn to the idea after it was featured in Dr Desmond Morris's 1967
book The Naked Ape. Since then she has fought to get Prof Hardy's ideas
accepted by anthropologists after advocating them in her controversial book,
Descent of Woman, published in 1972.
According to the sea ape theory, humans learned to stand on legs simply to
keep their heads above water. It holds that babies can swim at birth because
this reflex is natural to a species that has at some time lived in the sea
and that thick body hair was lost because storing fat under the skin is a
better way to keep warm - and afloat.
Mr Chris Knight, a paleo-anthropologist at the University of East London,
said: 'If Elaine is right, 90 per cent of anthropologists are wrong, and
they certainly aren't going to admit it. In my view, they have no choice but
to concede, and that will happen within the next five to 10 years at most.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Oceans' untapped potential stressed: British Association for
the Advancement of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OCEANS hold the key to supplying the world with energy during the next
century, the meeting heard.
Mr Ian Fells, professor of energy conversion at the University of Newcastle
upon Tyne, pointed out that the energy potential of the oceans 'has hardly
been tapped and represents an invaluable resource'. He suggested the
contributions that the oceans could make include:
Temperature differences between the warm surface of the tropical seas and
the cold waters beneath can drive heat engines in ocean thermal energy
conversion (Otec) plants. Floating Otec units weighing several thousand
tonnes and generating 20MW of power have been designed to 'graze' over the
oceans, Prof Fells said, identifying high thermal gradients to operate their
fluid turbines.
The energy of the winds blowing across the oceans can be tapped directly
through coastal wind turbines - or indirectly through the waves they whip
up.
Tidal power could make a large contribution. The proposed Severn Barrage,
with a cost estimated at Pounds 9bn, could produce 6 per cent of the UK's
electricity. But as Prof Fells pointed out, it 'would not be economic at the
high rates of return demanded by the City' without a special environmental
subsidy. A related but more speculative proposal is to harness the energy of
ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream.
Huge biomass farms could be established at coastal sites to grow algae for
energy. Experimental algae farms already exist in California.
The oceans contain large quantities of uranium which could be extracted to
fuel nuclear power stations if supplies from conventional uranium mines
become scarce. 'If tidal power stations are built, a uranium extraction
plant could be incorporated in the design,' Prof Fells said.
Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of
nuclear stations in England and Wales, said nuclear power 'clearly has an
essential role to play' in meeting future electricity demand while holding
down the emissions of carbon dioxide. He proposed a 50:50 split between new
nuclear and renewable energy sources over the next few decades.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Telecoms boost predicted: British Association For The
Advancement Of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE WILL be able to send voice, video and text around the world for the
price of a local telephone call in the next century and video-conferencing
systems will make 90 per cent of business travel unnecessary, the British
Association meeting in Southampton heard yesterday.
The predictions came from a panel of opto-electronics specialists, who said
that they were not indulging in flights of fancy but reflecting the progress
over the past five years in fibre-optic technology.
Professor Peter Cochrane, of British Telecom Laboratories, Martlesham, said
that a single glass strand as thin as a human hair can carry information
equivalent to billions of telephone conversations over thousands of miles.
He said: 'Optical communications provide us with an infinite capability to
communicate.'
The key to this is the erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA), invented at
Southampton University in 1987 and now being exploited worldwide. Professor
David Payne of Southampton University said: 'Commercial EDFAs are now
offered by more than 30 companies, which must be close to a record for
development of such a new technology.'
EDFAs intensify light signals automatically as they shoot down the optical
fibres, removing the need to install expensive electronic amplifiers at
intervals.
'These developments will shift the bulk of future international
telecommunications traffic from satellites to undersea fibre routes,' said
Prof Payne. 'The development of the EDFA has removed a barrier which
promises to allow optical telecommunications finally to reach its full
potential.'
Part of that potential lies in face-to-face communications that are much
cheaper and more realistic than today's video-conferencing systems. Prof
Cochrane said: 'We're not just talking about a videophone.'
He predicted that early next century optical fibre networks will extend to
every home and business in the UK. Copper cable will be replaced entirely;
radio and microwave systems - both ground and satellite based - will be
reserved for mobile communications.
Now that the telecommunications transmission problem has essentially been
solved, he said, the greatest technical obstacle is to develop computer
systems capable of switching and managing the large amounts of information
expected to flow through the fibre-optic networks of the next century.
Several speakers predicted that the much-discussed replacement of commuting
and business travel by telecommunications would then happen on a large
scale.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Tec chief warns on cuts to budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUALITY of training for school-leavers and unemployed adults may have to
be sacrificed and some of the smallest Training and Enterprise Councils
could close if there are further cuts to their budgets, a senior Tec
representative warned yesterday.
The forecast was the strongest public statement yet from Mr Edward Roberts,
chairman of G10, the group of 10 Tec chairmen who represent to the
government the concerns of Tecs, the employer-led bodies which administer
training schemes in England and Wales.
Earlier this summer Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, warned Tecs
that their budgets for training could be cut in this year's public
expenditure survey.
Tecs then warned the government privately of the possible adverse effects of
cuts to their training budgets, which last year were cut in real terms. G10
has recently been getting feedback from the other Tec chairmen, who have
been in initial consultations over their spending priorities with the
Department of Employment.
Many chairmen have said that even the maintenance of funding at current
levels will not enable Tecs to meet the growing demand for training
programmes for young people and rising numbers of unemployed adults.
Tecs fear that if the skills of the unemployed are not improved the UK will
not be in a position to take best advantage of any economic upturn.
Mr Edwards said: 'This is the time for government and industry to invest
further in the single most important national resource, our people.
'Tec boards are not prepared to see the Employment Department budget for
training and enterprise reduced without full consideration of the wider
alternatives.'

<TEXT>
BRITISH science is declining in relation to the rest of the world, it was
agreed at the meeting, Clive Cookson writes.
Mr Robert Jackson, junior minister responsible for science, said there was
'a certain inevitability' about the fall as other countries developed.
He denied there was a brain drain. 'Statistics supplied by the universities
show that at every level there is a net inflow (of scientists) into the UK,'
Mr Jackson said.
Dr David Pegg, head of the Medical Research Council's cryobiology unit -
which studies the biology of organisms below their normal temperature  -
said that after the MRC's halt in its funding a leading member is to
emigrate. Dr Michael Taylor will set up an Institute of Cryomedicine - the
study of medicine in freezing temperatures - in Pittsburgh, in the US.
However, Mr David Pendlebury, of the US Institute for Scientific
Information, said the frequency with which UK research was cited worldwide
showed the long-term decline in the impact of British science might 'be
starting to level off'.

MALARIA IS becoming resistant to all known drugs, Dr Bridget Ogilvie,
director of Wellcome Trust, warned.
Evidence gathered over 10 years by a team of scientists based in Thailand
and funded by Wellcome Trust demonstrates that anti-malarial drugs are
working less effectively in Thai patients. This is because the malarial
parasites are mutating and becoming resistant to drugs.
The scientists predict that many malarial cases will be untreatable within
five years, leading to millions of deaths. Drug-resistant malaria is already
widespread in Saharan Africa. Even quinine, an anti-malarial used for over
500 years, is failing.
'I am confident these results are correct. They show a progressive and
frightening diminution in the efficacy of the drugs, and it's difficult to
interest drug companies into developing new drugs because the research is so
expensive,' Dr Ogilvie said.
One approach towards developing a therapy was outlined by Dr Adrian Hill, a
Wellcome research fellow based in Oxford, who studies the way nature copes
with malaria.
The body's immune system protects against malaria - cells invaded by
malarial parasites become tagged with digested portions of the parasite
called peptides, labelling them as infected and targeting them for
destruction.
Dr Hill said that it was hoped to have in the next five years a vaccine
based on a specific peptide 'which will give useful, if not complete,
protection'.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Ford plant to build engines for Jaguar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the troubled UK luxury-car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to have
its new range of V8 engines built at the Ford engine plant at Bridgend,
south Wales, with an investment of more than Pounds 100m.
Building the engines at Ford's main UK engine plant, rather than at a new
Jaguar facility in the west Midlands, will be the biggest step yet by the US
carmaker to integrate Jaguar into its operations.
Jaguar makes its current 3.2-litre and 4.0-litre 6-cylinder engines and
5.3-litre V12 engines at its outdated engine plant at Radford, Coventry,
which has a workforce of about 850. The company said yesterday it would
continue to make engines at Radford at least until the end of the decade.
It added that building the engines at Bridgend rather than near its research
and development operations at Whitley, Coventry, would save about Pounds
15m.
Production of the new generation Jaguar engines is expected to begin in
1995-96, with up to 50,000 engines a year.
Ford has invested heavily at Bridgend, where it has built a Pounds 300m
plant for its new Zeta multi-valve engines. These are fitted in the
Escort/Orion and will be used in the replacement car for the present Sierra
to be launched early next year.
Jaguar was taken over by Ford for Pounds 1.56bn in late 1989, and the new V8
engine range will form an important part of its ambitious product plan for
the second half of the 1990s.
The development programme is aimed at boosting output by the end of the
decade to more than 100,000 cars a year, which would quadruple last year's
depressed level.
The plan, which is expected to involve a capital investment of more than
Pounds 1bn, centres on the development of three new model ranges, code-named
X100, X200 and X300, as well as the development of the new engine family.
Jaguar's strategy for the 1990s includes:
A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, codenamed the X300, to be launched in
1994.
A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to
be launched in 1996 and featuring the Bridgend-built engine. Development of
the new engine family, first as a V8 - code-named AJ26 - for launch in 1996,
and later in V6 form and possibly as a V12.
The crucial launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty saloon, codenamed
the X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. Jaguar hopes that
this car will enable it to more than double its annual production from
50,000 to 70,000 for the other car ranges to 100,000 to 150,000.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Offer of a sovereign for Queen Mary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping group, has offered to pay one
sovereign for the Queen Mary, the lossmaking liner moored as a tourist
attraction in California, Tim Burt writes.
The group wants to return the ship to Southampton to be used as an upmarket
hotel, conference centre and casino.
Sea Containers says the offer is realistic because the former flagship of
the Cunard shipping line is almost worthless. Its offer is one of 18 being
considered by the city of Long Beach, which paid Cunard Dollars 3.45m for
the Queen Mary in 1967 after it was taken out of service. The city has spent
Dollars 66m refurbishing the vessel.
One Japanese consortium is offering Dollars 23m (Pounds 11.5m) for the Queen
Mary conditional on it being made seaworthy by the Long Beach Naval
Shipyard.
Sea Containers has asked Long Beach to allow it to match any rival bid and
has paid a Dollars 100,000 deposit. Under its proposals, the ship would be
towed to a shipyard in the Far East where it would be refitted before being
returned to Southampton.
The project is backed by the city council and Associated British Ports which
has agreed to provide a berth at a nominal rent in Southampton Docks. Total
costs of the project are estimated at Dollars 30m.
Long Beach decided to sell the ship after Walt Disney Entertainment, the
latest operator, decided not to renew its lease.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Lib Dems urge shift on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EARLY move for sterling to the narrow bands of the exchange rate
mechanism, perhaps at a lower central rate than the current level, was
suggested yesterday by the Liberal Democrats as part of a package to relieve
the plight of the pound.
Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, attacked Labour's stance on
the state of the economy, saying that the basis for the European
co-ordination which it had been calling for would not exist before the
French referendum on Maastricht. He agreed with Mr Peter Shore, a former
Labour cabinet minister, that Labour was really calling for devaluation in
saying that it opposed any rise in interest rates whatever happened to the
pound.
He urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to take a tougher line with the
Tory backbench MPs who were broadcasting their views that there should be a
cut in interest rates to help the domestic economy. He warned that the
prospects of a rise in interest rates would continue to grow unless Mr Major
found ways of improving confidence in the UK economy, such as selective
intervention to help the construction industry.
Mr Beith said that the criterion for any realignment within the ERM must be
that it would result in greater confidence in sterling. He argued that
although a move for sterling to the narrow bands below the central rate
would appear to be devaluation, provided it were coupled with independence
for the Bank of England on interest rates and a British commitment to
European monetary union it could still lead to enhanced rather than reduced
confidence in sterling.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Car imports surge breaks trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTOR industry exports have begun to falter, while imports are again
climbing rapidly, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Kevin Done writes.
Export earnings for automotive products stagnated in the second quarter of
this year at Pounds 2.87bn following a 6 per cent year-on-year increase in
the first quarter.
By contrast, the value of imported automotive goods jumped by 18 per cent in
the second quarter to Pounds 3.7bn following a 12 per cent year-on-year
increase in the first three months.
As a result, the overall motor-industry trade deficit in the second quarter
more than tripled to Pounds 834m compared with the corresponding period a
year ago, while the deficit in the first half more than doubled to Pounds
1.37bn.
The rapid deterioration of the motor industry's foreign-trade performance in
1992 reverses the marked improvement of recent years. In the final three
months of 1991 the industry achieved the short-lived breakthrough of
recording a quarterly trade surplus for the first time since the early
1980s.
The value and volume of imports of new cars jumped by 20 per cent in the
second quarter from the same period a year ago, in spite of the absence of
any recovery in UK demand for new vehicles, with the value of car imports
totalling Pounds 1.85bn.
The surge in car imports has coincided with a serious reversal in the trend
of UK exports of new cars in the second quarter, with a 9 per cent fall in
value to Pounds 959m from the same period a year ago. This reversed a 3 per
cent year-on-year rise in the first three months.
The decline in the volume of car exports in the second quarter was even more
acute than the drop in value, with a year-on-year fall of 18 per cent. The
volume of car shipments in the first half at 289,833 was 11 per cent lower
than a year ago.
Figures released by the motor industry yesterday show that Ford, the UK
new-car market leader, gained ground modestly in the first 20 days of
August, the most important sales month for new cars.
Registrations of new Ford cars rose by 2.7 per cent to 68,000, while overall
new-car registrations increased by only 0.9 per cent to 290,550.
Vauxhall, which is in second place, suffered a 2.4 per cent fall in sales to
45,000.
Rover was overtaken by the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen,
and has fallen into fourth place with a 3.3 per cent drop in sales volume.
It captured 11.2 per cent of sales of new cars compared with 12.2 per cent
by the Peugeot group.
The Citroen marque has emerged as the star performer with a 31.2 per cent
jump in sales to capture a share of 4.8 per cent.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Builders complain to OFT over plasterboard prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDERS have complained to the Office of Fair Trading about increases in
plasterboard prices, alleging possible collusion between suppliers.
Recession-hit companies in London, south-west England and the Yorkshire area
fear that large rises in the cost of such a basic material, due to take
effect at the end of this month, could turn low-priced long-term contracts
into lossmakers.
Reductions in discounts, announced this summer by BPB Industries, the
country's largest supplier, are expected to raise plasterboard prices on
average by about 10 per cent. BPB has a 65 per cent share of the UK market.
Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany which, together with BPB,
supply virtually all the plasterboard sold in the UK, are expected to raise
prices by similar amounts.
The three companies were until recently locked in a bitter European price
war.
Mr Dennis Maiden, director-general of the Federation of Master Builders
which represents 20,400 building companies, has asked the OFT to investigate
the latest increases. This follow complaints from members that plasterboard
prices in some areas could rise by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.
BPB said yesterday that price increases, depending upon previous local
discounts, could range from 7 per cent to 20 per cent but would average
about 10 per cent.
It is the second increase to be announced by one of the big three
manufacturers. At the begining of this year Knauf unveiled a rise in British
prices of about 8 per cent.
Mr John Maxwell, BPB's finance director, yesterday estimated that only about
half of this earlier increase, which had been followed by the other
manufacturers, had stuck.
He said: 'Plasterboard prices had fallen by more than 50 per cent since 1987
as a result of the price war. Prices, even with the latest increases, will
still be more than 40 per cent lower than they were five years ago and 30
per cent lower than in 1990.
'There has been no collusion. If other manufacturers decide to follow our
lead it is because they need to increase margins after years of selling at a
loss or break-even.'
The Federation of Master Builders said that increases would hurt small and
medium-sized companies which would be unable to negotiate as big a discount
as larger groups. It said many companies already were operating on contract
margins which did little more than cover overheads.
The federation said: 'Although the increases have yet to come into effect,
we believe that there may have been a degree of collusion between the three
manufacturers which clearly are going to increase prices in line with each
other.'
The OFT said yesterday that it had received a complaint from the federation
and would monitor the situation.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Institute of Directors sees sharp fall in economic
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFIDENCE IN Britain's economic prospects has plunged in the past two
months, according to the Institute of Directors.
The institute's latest survey of business opinion, published today, shows
that only 13 per cent of company directors are more optimistic about the
economy, against 50 per cent in response to the same question in June. But
the institute says directors tend to be less gloomy about prospects for
their own companies than for the whole economy. A third remain optimistic
about the outlook for their businesses, while the number of companies doing
badly is the lowest for 16 months. According to the 325 directors replying
to the survey, two thirds of companies are doing well - a level that has
been constant for 18 months.
The institute concludes that the pattern reflects a crisis of confidence
much more than of substance. Business volume and orders have remained steady
this month while the upward trend in investment - concentrated on machinery
and equipment - has continued.
The institute says that the main concern among directors is insufficient
demand for products, whereas cashflow had been identified as the biggest
problem earlier in the summer - suggesting that a recovery might then have
been under way.
Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the institute, said the survey 'shows a
great gulf between, on the one hand, directors' perception of the economy
and their business prospects and, on the other, the actual performance of
their companies.
'What we have at present is stable business performance but at a low level
of economic activity. The situation is fragile and a crisis of confidence
could easily be translated into a real downturn.' The Finance and Leasing
Association yesterday reported a 1 per cent increase during the second
quarter of the year over the first quarter in consumer lending and business
finance, David Barchard writes.
However, the association said the rise in new consumer-sector lending was in
line with the same period of 1991 and did not reflect a return of consumer
confidence.
Total consumer credit loans reached Pounds 16.9bn and total business finance
sector lending Pounds 38.7bn. Motor vehicle finance dropped by 1.3 per cent
to Pounds 11.6bn. New lending to the consumer sector rose by 5 per cent to
Pounds 2.5bn, largely as a result of a 12 per cent rise in unsecured
personal loans and a 9 per cent rise in borrowing on store cards.

FT  26 AUG 92 / 18% jump in visitors to Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of visitors to Northern Ireland increased by 18 per cent to
263,000 last year, the province's tourist board said yesterday.
Mr Hugh O'Neill, board chairman, said the numbers had more than doubled over
three years but the government target was for more than 400,000
holidaymakers by 1994.
Self-catering, bed and breakfast accommodation and touring caravan and
camping sites reported big increases in business, although hotel occupancy
fell by 1 per cent.
The board's annual report says that holidaymakers are spending less because
of the recession and the domestic market is weak.
There was also a disappointing level of visitors from the US but Mr O'Neill
said: 'We nevertheless believe that 1992 will be the best ever year for
overseas visitors and for tourism revenue.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / London store to run creche
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERTY, the London department store, is to operate the first creche in the
West End for the children of shoppers. The creche will be an experiment for
next Monday's bank holiday, and could become permanent if it is a commercial
success.
Liberty said it wanted to test demand from shoppers. 'This is quite a
grown-up shop. The china and glass department, with its low-level shelves,
would be a particular nightmare with a toddler in a buggy,' it said
yesterday.
The store, which has a predominantly female clientele, said the increase in
the number of working mothers was likely to mean that a creche would be
popular. If the creche is set up on a permanent basis it will also be open
to Liberty's staff.
Out-of-town shopping centres and stores such as the Swedish furniture chain
Ikea have children's areas, but there are none in the West End.
With a sense of British priorities, the Knightsbridge store Harrods used to
have kennels for the dogs of shoppers but has never had a creche. There are
no longer facilities for customers to park their poodles but the store has
introduced loos for fathers and babies as well as mothers and babies, said
Harrods.
The Liberty creche will be run by an outside agency called Creche on the
Move at a cost to the store of about Pounds 500 for the day. Six qualified
staff will provide care, free to parents, for up to 30 children at a time
aged between two and 10. Children will only be allowed to stay for an hour.
The limit is intended to prevent parents leaving their children and shopping
elsewhere.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Funds still leaving building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY CONTINUED to drain out of building society accounts in July because of
competition from National Savings. The societies suffered a net outflow of
Pounds 325m, up from Pounds 314m in June.
The figure was one of the worst for the industry since September 1986 when
it suffered an outflow of Pounds 673m as savers withdrew money to take part
in the flotation of TSB.
However, the July outflow was not as bad as the industry had feared. The
societies had forecast an outflow of Pounds 450m to Pounds 500m for the
month.
They fared better towards the end of the month, after the government had
lowered rates on the National Savings First Option Bond, which was
introduced in the first week of July.
Interest on the bond had outstripped the societies' rates and two weeks
after it was introduced the government cut the gross interest rate from
10.34 per cent to 9.67 per cent.
Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association,
warned that the societies still expected poor inflows of savings in the next
few months.
Societies still face strong competition from National Savings, and the final
call on regional electricity company shareholders next month is also
expected to hit building society savings.
Mr Boleat said: 'To an extent the pressure has eased but I would not feel
too happy in saying that it has gone away.'
In spite of the outflow, the total volume of savings held with building
societies has risen by about Pounds 8bn since the start of the year because
of accrued interest.
There was a slight increase in mortgage lending in July, but the societies
say they believe that this may have only been a temporary burst in the weeks
before the ending on August 19 of the stamp-duty exemption on house sales of
less than Pounds 250,000.
Gross mortgage advances rose to Pounds 3.74bn from Pounds 3.19bn in June,
while net new commitments were 7 per cent up on June at Pounds 3.44bn. Both
figures were below the levels of lending in July 1991.
The association warned yesterday that the housing market could now fall back
with the return of stamp duty at its previous level.
Mr Boleat said: 'The effects of this artificial boost to the market may well
be reversed over the next few months. The low level of commitments
outstanding does not augur well for the near-term prospects for the housing
market.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Middle classes fuel student rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE large increase in student numbers over the past three decades has been
almost entirely drawn from the middle classes, according to research
published by the National Commission on Education.
A research paper issued by the commission, an independent think tank, shows
that the proportion of students from working-class backgrounds going to
higher education has scarcely shifted since 1963.
The paper's author, Professor AH Halsey, of Nuffield College, Oxford, said:
'This is cold comfort for those who seek the classless society.'
He says that fears in the 1960s that the expansion of higher education -
from 216,000 students in 1963 to more than 1m in 1990 - would mean a
dilution of standards were unfounded. The average A-level achievement of
entrants to higher education rose markedly between 1976 and 1984 and has
fallen only slightly since then.
However, the expansion has affected the lecturer/student ratio, which has
declined from 1:8 in 1970 to 1:11.6 last year.
Prof Halsey concludes that Britain is on the road to an American-style
system, where higher education embraces all post-secondary schooling. But,
'plans for funding the new expansion remain vague'.

FT  26 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexico links with new trade zone - A
framework pact for Central America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO and the five Central American republics have signed a framework free
trade agreement preparing the way for free trade in the region by the end of
1996.
The framework accord provides common guidelines for the bilateral treaties
that the six countries - Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica - are negotiating, enabling the respective agreements to fold
into a common free trade pact by the end of 1996. The goal of 1996 was
decided by six heads of state in Mexico last year, but might still be
extended.
The agreement marks a remarkable change in a region that for more than two
decades has been torn by civil war, or split by bitter ideological
differences. All five Central American presidents are democratically
elected, keen on Central American political and economic integration, and
together with Mexico, are pursuing orthodox, pro-free trade economic
reforms.
The overwhelming view in the region - from the former rebels in El Salvador
to (most) rightists in Guatemala - is that the area's deep poverty and
political instability are best countered through economic reform sponsored
by the IMF and World Bank, rather than by revolutionary change or military
repression. The average Central American earns about Dollars 2 a day.
The agreement comes just as the Mexican government has concluded
negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the
US and Canada. Mexican trade officials are currently meeting their
counterparts from Colombia and Venezuela to make progress on their intended
trade pact.
Nafta provides terms for other countries to join the trade area, and
optimists still hope that Latin America's array of trade agreements will
eventually implode into a continent-wide free trade area, stretching from
Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Last year Mexico and Chile signed a free trade
agreement, while Brazil, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay intend to
form a common market by 1995.
The proposed Central American trade pact may exclude certain sensitive
sectors, such as sugar, as was the case in the Mexico-Chile free trade
agreement. The framework agreement gives longer protection to the
less-developed countries in Central America, a sign of Mexico's desire to
play the statesman, and turn itself into a regional power.
Mexico and Costa Rica are already well advanced on their pact, which could
be wrapped up by the end of the year.
Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have agreed in principle to begin free
trade in goods and financial services by 1993, and to form a common market
by 1995. President Rafael Callejas of Honduras has said that the three
countries plan to co-ordinate monetary and fiscal policies, and finance
trade deficits with each other.
The three Northern Central American countries have promoted a Central
American parliament to pave the way for Central American political
integration.
The main aim of all Central American countries is to increase their trade
with each other from the abysmal levels of the 1980s. The proportion of
Central America exports to the region of the total fell from 20 per cent in
1982 to 14.4 per cent in 1990, as war and debt default took their toll on
commercial relations and light industry. Honduras, flanked on three sides by
El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, sent just 4 per cent of its exports to
Central America in 1990.
Still, the room for expansion is limited by the similarity of many of their
exports - agricultural commodities, such as coffee, cotton, bananas and
sugar, still form the bulk of the region's exports. While non-traditional
exports are growing - particularly in textiles and yarn goods - these, too,
are similar across the isthmus.
Further, many Central Americans are fretting that Mexico's preferential
access to the US will divert trade from the isthmus to Mexico. Nafta will
give Mexico a decisive edge over Central America in textile exports since it
scraps US quotas and tariff on Mexican textile exports, and requires that
textile goods are produced from yarn made in a Nafta country to be eligible
for preferential treatment.
Similarly, the US will eventually scrap quotas and tariffs on Mexico's sugar
exports - which, potentially, will displace Central America's sugar exports.
The hope is that one day the Central American countries will be granted full
tariff-free access to the US market, and the countries have clubbed together
in part to show a common front. In the meantime they will at least have full
access to the Mexican market, which, if Nafta is passed by the US Congress,
is projected to expand rapidly.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 300-400 UK companies are this week examining whether planned projects
in Russia will win export credit insurance protection, aware that less than
one in 10 is likely to win support.
Industrialists welcomed news that Britain is to resume credit cover for
contracts in Russia. A Pounds 280m credit line for the former Soviet
republics, announced in January, has been blocked while the IMF has
negotiated an economic restructuring programme with the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has written to 300
companies and their bankers giving guidelines on what projects would win
support. Only those meeting the guidelines are invited to apply for cover.
The ECGD said priority would go to projects self-financing in hard currency,
involving continuing management support from the UK exporter, and having
appropriate backing from the Russian government. Projects worth Dollars
20m-Dollars 100m would be preferred.
Britain's Crown Agents have been appointed, on World Bank recommendation, to
advise Russia on a Dollars 350m programme to import urgently needed farm,
health, transport and energy equipment.

<TEXT>
THE former Soviet republic of Tajikistan is enlisting Canadian help to print
its currency, under a pact with the Ottawa-based Canadian Bank Note Company
(CBNC) to build a banknote printing plant.
CBNC, which will build the plant in a joint venture with the central Asian
state, hopes that it will be working within a year, and that it will
eventually export banknotes to other former Soviet republics, the Middle
East and Asia.
The deal highlights fierce competition among western banknote manufacturers
for opportunities in those former Soviet states leaving the rouble zone.
In the most important order to date, CBNC, which prints banknotes for Canada
and Caribbean, Middle East and South American countries, has agreed to print
1.5bn notes of the new Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia. This CDollars 36m
(Pounds 15.2m) order was backed by a CDollars 50m Canadian government credit
line.
Among the Baltic states, Estonia has introduced its own currency, the kroon,
printed by the UK-based De La Rue, the world's biggest security printer, and
US Banknote, the biggest US security printer.
Giesecke &amp; Devrient, the Munich company which prints 50 per cent of the
Bundesbank's D-Marks, has won an order for Latvia's new currency, as has US
Banknote for Lithuania. Mr Michel Aime, managing director of the Paris-based
Oberthur banknote printing group, confirmed they were seeking orders from
former east bloc states. 'The biggest problem is the financing.'
Among executives of De La Rue Giori, the 50 per cent-owned Swiss-based
subsidiary of De La Rue, assigned to market its capabilities with the
National Bank of Ukraine last year was Mr Maxime Mitterrand, nephew of
France's President Francois Mitterrand. Mr Mitterrand is no longer employed
by De La Rue Giori.

<TEXT>
THE US Export-Import Bank will begin its first disbursement of loans to
Russia in a signing ceremony tomorrow, according to Mr Eugene Lawson, the
bank's vice-chairman, writes Nancy Dunne.
All but one of the seven deals, worth a total Dollars 102m, were originally
contracted with the former Soviet Union. Loans have been held up by the
'extremely cautious' policies of Vnesheconombank, the Russian trade bank.
Because it has the responsibility for the old Soviet debt, it has moved
'prudently' before approving new deals, said Mr Lawson.
The signing will cap a busy month for Eximbank. Recent Eximbank deals
providing financing for US sales to Latin America, include:
Two new guarantee facilities and one renewal of a guarantee totalling almost
Dollars 70m for the sale of goods and equipment to Mexico.
A loan guarantee supporting a Dollars 74.3m sale of equipment and
engineering services to Corpoven, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela.
A Dollars 17.4m guarantee for the sale of a turbine generator set to Empresa
Colombiana de Petroleos, the state-owned oil company of Colombia.
A Dollars 21m guarantee of credit to finance the sale of US capital goods
and services to Argentine customers of the Banco de Galicia of Buenos Aires.
It has also approved its third 'bundling' facility to finance Dollars 57.3m
of goods and services to India. Bundling involves a large number of US
suppliers and numerous buyers. Eximbank provides a guarantee; the lending
bank can hold the credits or bundle them to support one large security issue
which can be floated in the capital markets.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Obligations of European ERM
members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the European exchange rate mechanism are obliged to intervene in
foreign exchange markets to support currencies above their agreed floors
during European trading hours, writes Emma Tucker.
This means that unlike the dollar, ERM currencies have a guaranteed floor
beyond which the market cannot push them. If, for example, the pound or lira
were to hit their floors, the UK and Italian central banks would move in
with open bids to buy the currency at that rate, thereby guaranteeing a sale
for foreign exchange dealers. In practice central banks are likely to take
action before their currencies reach their outer limits.
Yesterday the lira and sterling moved within fractions of their floors but
moved back up before the Bank of England and the Bank of Italy were obliged
to intervene.
The obligation to intervene means countries may have to draw on their
reserves, sometimes very heavily. The European monetary system provides for
a very short term financing facility (VSTF) under which unlimited credit is
automatically available to finance intervention.
Another option is to raise short term interest rates. The system also
provides for realignments in which currencies may be devalued or revalued
but the presumption is that such a move is a last resort. Realignments must
be agreed between all EMS members.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Central banks losing the fight
over the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE are worrying days for the world's central bankers. For the past six
weeks, they have been steadily losing the fight to stop the fall of the US
dollar against the D-Mark.
They have tried to control the dollar by intervening in the foreign exchange
markets, buying the US dollar for D-Marks to try to hold its exchange rate.
But this tested method of controlling the market has failed.
'I have to go back a long way to remember a time when central bank
intervention has collapsed so miserably,' said Mr Julian Simmonds, head of
foreign exchange dealing at Citibank in London.
Since the mid-1980s, intervention has been effective in controlling markets.
Dealers are wary of central banks, knowing they have far larger foreign
currency reserves than most investors, but five interventions since July 20
have failed to turn the dollar.
'Their intervention has proved ineffective and even counter-productive,'
said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in London.
There are several reasons:
The markets believe there is lack of co-ordination among G7 members over
monetary policy.
Intervention is most likely to work when it reflects clear changes in
monetary policy and interest rate movements. In 1985, the Fed managed to
prevent the dollar rising too high against the D-Mark by buying small
quantities of dollars on the foreign exchanges.
The current situation is different. The world's central banks are
intervening against the grain of monetary policy, because there is a
differential of 6.75 percentage points between US and German short term
rates.
Dealers believe that intervention is being poorly co-ordinated on a
technical level because of these discrepancies in monetary policy.
The market is uncertain about Bundesbank commitment to support the dollar.
By buying dollars in intervention operations, the German central bank puts
large numbers of D-Marks into circulation. That upsets its key goal,
containment of monetary growth.
Interventions have run into technical difficulties because the market is not
sufficiently short of dollars, even though the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate
is plummeting.
A successful intervention should 'squeeze' the market like contracting
elastic. First, the market sells dollars, pushing the dollar/D-Mark exchange
rate down. Central banks then reverse the exchange rate trend, and dealers
rush to buy for fear that it will be more expensive to do so if they delay.
One necessary element is that the markets be taken by surprise. However,
since the end of July, dealers have been expecting intervention and held on
to some dollars. The central banks cannot therefore trigger a rush in the
opposite direction.
'The central banks have not frightened the market, they have anaesthetised
it,' says Mr MacKinnon.
The US central bank could argue that it has never intended to reverse the
dollar's decline, knowing this is impossible. Instead, their policy may be
to slow the dollar's fall, ensuring that the decline does not turn into a
rout.
This view is underlined by the modest level of intervention. At the
beginning of 1989, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations spent
Dollars 3bn in one week to support the dollar against the Japanese yen in a
successful operation. The central banks have spent that much in the last six
weeks.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: ERM hit by weak dollar and high
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE combination of the dollar's fall and high European interest rates brings
a series of sharp dilemmas for the governments and central banks running the
European monetary system. Not only in the UK, but also Germany, France and
Italy, the pressures are on the rise.
The German Bundesbank, whose tight monetary policies represent one of the
root causes of the strains in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), faces a
more difficult predicament than is often supposed.
The weak dollar, by reducing the competitiveness of German exporters,
represents a further depressing influence on the west German economy,
starting to flag after three years of buoyancy.
While sales to the US account for only 7 per cent of total German exports,
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew estimates German industry's total exposure to the dollar
is about 15 per cent, including other dollar-linked markets.
Mr Richard Reid, an economist with UBS in Frankfurt, says the Bundesbank
might well accept the need for more companies to produce abroad as the price
for inflationary success at home.
Another analyst, concerned about the effect of the dollar's weakness is Mr
Thomas Mayer, a Frankfurt-based economist at Goldman Sachs. 'This puts an
enormous squeeze on the German export industry ..it also increases the risk
that the German economy will fall into recession in 1993.' Worries like this
accounted for a further fall in German share prices yesterday, with
export-oriented stocks leading the decline. In Frankfurt, the DAX share
index lost nearly 2 per cent, bringing it to the lowest level since
February, 1991.
Fears of economic downturn will raise pressure on the Bundesbank to cut
interest rates this autumn sooner than it currently wants to. On the other
hand, if it maintains its tough interest rate stance, the Bundesbank may end
up provoking heavy speculative currency inflows into Germany which would
counteract its efforts to damp money supply growth.
If sterling or the lira fall to their ERM floor, the Bundesbank is obliged,
along with central banks of the weak currencies, to sell D-Marks to maintain
parities.
The close link between the ERM turbulence and the September 20 vote brings
particular problems for the French finance ministry. The currency unrest
could scarcely have come at a worse time for the French government, anxious
to paint a picture of economic and political stability during the run-up to
the referendum.
The government knows that its standing could be damaged if monetary
pressures cause it to change its economic policy, either by raising interest
rates or devaluing the franc within the ERM.
If the French government was forced to raise interest rates to protect the
franc, this year's economic growth would almost certainly fall short of the
2 per cent forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
None the less, the dollar's decline could still have an effect on the
electorate by adding to worries about the economic outlook.
French companies have fared well on the export front so far this year.
However exports could flag if the dollar remains at current levels.
In Italy, the government's options in response to ERM pressures are even
narrower than in France. Italy's new administration seems ready to watch the
lira lose ground against the D-Mark, even if the exchange rate is widely
taken as a barometer of the country's economic health.
The government appears to be making a distinction between adverse currency
movements which affect the lira alone, and those which are part of a general
trend, as at present.
Last month, the Bank of Italy moved quickly to raise the discount rate in
two stages to 13.75 per cent when the lira came under immense speculative
pressure.
By contrast, the lira's current plunge is conceived as part of a much wider
problem based on the gap between German and US interest rates. As long as
the lira is not singled out for particular attack on the foreign exchanges,
the government seems willing to put the onus on the Germans to act.
Should speculative attention turn specifically against the lira, then a
further rise is inevitable.

FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Bank of England battles the fear
of devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN if Britain's efforts to prop up the pound succeed over the next few
days without a politically damaging rise in interest rates, it faces a long
battle to remove fears about a devaluation from the financial markets.
Partly explaining the pound's slide against a strong D-Mark - it finished
last night in London at DM2.7875, its lowest close yet in the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and less than 1 pfennig above its floor - is
the dollar's fragility.
The markets are also worried that a 'no' vote in the September 20 referendum
in France on Maastricht might lead to large selling of the weaker ERM
currencies, including the lira as well as the pound.
Another key factor is persistent doubts in financial markets about whether
Britain might devalue the pound by leaving the ERM. That decision might be
forced on Britain should public disquiet grow at the economic effects of
maintaining high UK interest rates, now at 10 per cent, as a result of
continuing ERM membership.
Although the UK government has repeatedly stressed its resolve to keep the
pound within its existing ERM band, the pressures on Britain to bring down
interest rates are particularly strong. The UK is suffering its longest
peacetime recession since the 1930s, with little recovery in sight.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at New York investment group Salomon
Brothers, said: 'The markets doubt whether the economic costs of high
short-term interest rates in the UK are sustainable politically.'
Mr Steve Hannah, research head at IBJ International, securities wing of the
Japanese bank, said the UK had a 'special credibility problem' about its ERM
commitment that did not apply to other members.
Doubts in financial markets about Britain's resolve in sticking to the ERM
are apparent in the UK's high long-term interest rates, as measured by
yields on 10-year government bonds, relative to those for most other ERM
nations.
In the past three months, the difference between 10-year interest rates on
UK and German bonds has increased from about 1 percentage point to about 1.3
percentage points. In other words, the 'risk premium' demanded by financial
markets for holding sterling securities as opposed to those denominated in
D-Marks has worsened, indicating a heightened perception of devaluation.
Mr Philip Tyson, a bond analyst at the London office of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
the Swiss bank, said: 'Whatever the government might say about not wanting a
devaluation, it has to earn its credibility with the markets and that will
inevitably take some time.'
Supporting Mr Tyson's interpretation is the view that the Treasury and the
Bank of England are preparing for a prolonged struggle to stave off the
pressure on sterling. The Bank's action in failing to intervene publicly to
buy sterling, which would almost certainly boost its value, can be explained
by its keenness to keep the measure in reserve.
For the time being, the Bank and the Treasury appear to be hoping that
recent intervention by central banks in buying dollars for D-Marks has taken
the sting out of the rise of the German currency, and has reduced its effect
on depressing sterling.
It is a dangerous game, however. Market observers yesterday commented that
the Bank might have done better several days ago to seize the initiative and
intervene to support sterling, leaving investors in no doubt about the UK's
willingness to maintain its value.
The markets are divided about what course of action is correct. Mr Peter
Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, London investment bank, said:
'The Bank is moving forward (to defend the pound) in stages. The attack on
sterling might have got past the first line of defence, but there are still
plenty of trenches to breach.'
Mr Tyson of UBS has a different opinion: 'The effort to earn credibility is
not an easy one. We could find that sentiment about sterling is so poor that
even if Britain raised interest rates immediately by a full percentage
point, this is not enough to keep the currency above its ERM floor.'

IRAQ appears to have removed all fixed-wing warplanes and some attack
helicopters from southern Iraq in advance of allied plans to shoot down such
aircraft which fly in the region, the US Defence Department said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Bob Hall, the Pentagon spokesman, said Iraqi fixed-wing warplanes had
been removed 'in the last few days' from the area south of the 32nd
parallel, where the Iraqi military has been attacking Shia Moslems. He
refused to discuss details of the planned 'no-fly zone' expected to be
announced by President George Bush this week.
Meanwhile a US admiral said Iraqi warplanes which defy a 'no-fly zone' would
probably be shot down on sight without warning.
'I would guess that if the scenario plays out the way it is envisaged now,
they would be given an adequate warning by diplomatic notice not to fly in
that particular area,' Rear-Admiral Brent Bennitt told reporters on the
aircraft carrier USS Independence. 'To me that would be sufficient warning.
. . I wouldn't anticipate any warning shots.'

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS including Citibank and Bank of America contravened the guidelines of
India's central bank by using investment management schemes as deposit
substitutes, according to an official report on the Rs35bn (Pounds 630m)
Bombay securities scandal published yesterday.
The report, from a committee appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
and headed by Mr R. Janakiraman, tackled subjects including the portfolio
management schemes which were marketed by banks particularly to public
sector companies with surplus cash.
The committee said that while banks offering portfolio management schemes
had, in their documentation, broadly conformed to RBI guidelines, the
schemes were used as deposit substitutes. Clients believed they would be
entitled to higher rates of interest without any risk, for short-term
deposits.
Under Indian regulations, funds placed with banks under portfolio management
schemes have to remain with them for at least a year. However, several banks
offered facilities for so-called 'ready-forward' or repurchase transactions.
Securities, bonds and units were sold to clients on a ready basis and
repurchased after the specified period, assuring the client a guaranteed
rate of return with no risk.
The committee said that almost 90 per cent of the total investments made out
of funds of portfolio management schemes (PMS) were accounted for by three
banks: Citibank, accounting for Rs12.98bn, or 55.73 per cent of the
investment, Canfina Mutual fund accounting for 19.4 per cent and Syndicate
Bank accounting for 14.48 per cent.
According to the report, Citibank has argued that there was no violation,
since the transactions were through portfolio management scheme funds kept
by clients, and RBI restrictions on ready forward transactions did not apply
to these funds.
The Janakiraman committee said it would further examine the matter, but 'it
does illustrate the dangers involved in the use of portfolio management
scheme funds to bypass RBI guidelines in general'.
Between April 1 last year and May 31 this year Citibank, one of the major
participants in the securities market, entered into ready forward
transactions for an aggregate value of Rs59.72bn.
Bank of America, according to the report, undertook nearly a thousand 'off
the books' transactions, totalling Rs69.54bn, offering more than double
market rates of interest, for periods of 15 to 60 days.
Standard Chartered, the British bank, which has been hit by the financial
scandal, operated a scheme called Corporate Cash Deployment Services. Funds
received and outstanding under the scheme at March 31 this year were about
Rs7bn at its Bombay branch alone.
The committee has said the Joint Parliamentary Committee appointed to
investigate the scandal would fix responsibility for the malpractices.

THE substantial differences between Arab and Israeli negotiators re-emerged
yesterday, after the first round of talks in Washington on Monday, which had
been marked by what all sides described as a distinct improvement in
atmosphere.
The Jordanian and Syrian delegations said they were particularly encouraged
by Israel's willingness to discuss UN Resolutions 242 and 338 'in all their
aspects'. These two resolutions assert the principle of Israel exchanging
Arab land occupied in the 1967 war in return for a comprehensive peace.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, foreign
minister, have affirmed Israel's commitment to the resolutions. But Mr Rabin
stressed yesterday that Syria had not been given any document or specific
proposals pledging a withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
His comment appeared to qualify an earlier statement by Mr Peres yesterday
that Israel was ready for territorial compromise on the Golan. However, even
this was rejected out of hand by Syria yesterday, before negotiators began
their second round of talks.
Tishrin, the official Damascus daily newspaper, insisted no compromise was
possible on Resolution 242 and demanded full withdrawal by Israel. 'Peace
cannot be achieved through a deal or a partial settlement. There is no
alternative to real peace which gives the Arabs back their occupied land,'
the newspaper said.
The Syrian team said on Monday that if Israel conceded the principle of a
full withdrawal, all matters could be open to discussion.
During five previous rounds of negotiations, Israel, under the hardline
former government headed by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, would not even discuss
territorial compromise.
Similar differences over the interpretation of 242 will emerge as the
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians move on to substantive
issues in the next four weeks. Israel has already warned that a Palestinian
self-governing authority in the occupied West Bank and Gaza can have only an
administrative function.
The Palestinians want a full legislative body. The aim of both sides is to
agree the form of an elected Palestinian body to administer the areas from
which the Israeli army will withdraw, pending final talks within three years
on a lasting solution for the occupied areas.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Hopes high for international chemical weapons treaty: An
improbable legacy from Saddam Hussein is the end of 24 years of talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL draft of an international treaty outlawing chemical weapons will
be presented to negotiators for approval today, 24 years after talks began
in the 39-member United Nations Disarmament Conference in Geneva. For this
belated achievement the world can perhaps thank President Saddam Hussein.
Iraq's threat to use chemical weapons against allied forces in the 1991 Gulf
war - having already done so against Iranian soldiers and Iraqi Kurds -
turned the spotlight on this fearsome form of warfare. More important, it
convinced the US that chemical weapons were of no military value, even for
reprisal against a chemical attack.
Shortly afterwards, the Bush administration dropped its controversial
insistence on retaining a small weapons stockpile and the right to retaliate
in kind until all nations suspected of possessing toxic arms had endorsed
the pact. This change of stance paved the way for completion of the treaty.
The draft 190-page accord goes far beyond the 1925 Geneva Protocol which
forbids use, but not possession, of toxic arms. The proposed treaty will
prohibit development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical
weapons, and require the destruction of existing stocks and production
facilities within 10 years of coming into force.
The treaty also bars the use of herbicides and other toxic chemicals 'as a
method of warfare', although it allows non-toxic chemicals such as tear gas,
which cause temporary disablement, to be used for riot control.
Compliance will be policed by an international secretariat based in The
Hague, under the direction of a 41-member executive council. The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, with up to 1,000 staff
and an annual budget of Dollars 150m-Dollars 180m, will verify destruction
programmes, inspect all military facilities and civilian plants producing
chemicals that could be used for armaments, and carry out routine monitoring
and random checks on other civilian chemical installations.
Countries suspected of cheating will be subject to short-notice challenge
inspections, though obviously frivolous challenges will be thrown out if
three-quarters of the executive council agree.
These provisions attempt to strike a balance between effective verification
and protection of military and commercial secrets. Washington backed off
from its original demand for challenge inspections 'any place, any time'
because the defence department did not want inspectors snooping around
sensitive military installations pretending to look for chemical weapons.
While countries will not be able to bar inspectors from a site altogether, a
procedure known as 'managed access' will allow them to shroud equipment,
hide documents, shut down computers, even restrict individual inspectors to
different parts of the site.
Western diplomats claim this will adequately protect secrets unrelated to
chemical weapons while still enabling inspectors to detect the 'clear
signatures' of toxic arms and equipment.
'The treaty adequately protects legitimate national security interests while
maintaining the ability to detect militarily significant cheating,' says Mr
Stephen Ledogar, head of the US disarmament delegation in Geneva.
A country will have at least 12 hours' notice of the challenged site before
the inspection team arrives at the airport or frontier. It must transport
the team to the site within 36 hours but, if it contests the site
boundaries, a further 72 hours may elapse before the team can enter.
However, Mr Adolf von Wagner, chairman of the Disarmament Conference's Ad
Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons, says it would be impossible to 'clean' a
site within five days, especially since everything going in or out must be
accounted for.
So far, only the US and Russia, of the half a dozen countries thought to
have militarily useable chemical weapons stocks, have declared possession.
Iraq's stocks of mustard gas and nerve agents are being destroyed by UN
experts. Diplomats in Geneva believe that up to 20 other nations may have
facilities capable of production or abandoned weapons on their territory.
Countries must not only pay for eliminating their chemical weapons and
facilities, but the verification costs as well. Other expenses of the
inspectorate will be met by members according to the UN contribution scale.
The US, which calculates that incinerating its 30,000-ton stockpile could
cost Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn, has also agreed to foot part of the bill for
destroying the 40,000 tons of Russian weapons. Even so, the problems of
getting a destruction programme under way mean Russia will almost certainly
have to invoke treaty provisions allowing an extra five years to complete
the task.
A number of developing countries, notably Pakistan, China, Iran and
Indonesia, continue to argue that the inspection regime is too stringent,
intrusive and open to abuse. But they are not expected to block the treaty,
either in today's meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee or in next week's plenary
session of the Disarmament Conference which must forward the text to the UN
General Assembly in New York.
Approval by the assembly, probably in December, will be followed by a formal
signing ceremony in Paris early in 1993 and the treaty will come into force
two years later, provided 65 nations have ratified it.
Western nations are optimistic that the treaty, the most ambitious
multilateral disarmament pact ever attempted, will eventually command
near-universal adherence. Political and moral pressure will be reinforced by
economic leverage. Countries which refuse to join will face curbs on their
chemicals trade.
More than 50 nations, including all members of the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe have said they will sign the treaty in Paris.
Diplomats expect Middle East countries to join as part of broader security
deals emerging from current regional peace negotiations.

FT  26 AUG 92 / NTT share sell-off postponed
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government announced yesterday that it would postpone the sale
of a tranche of shares of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the former
state-owned telecommunications company, in order to avoid depressing the
Tokyo stock market.
The recent slide in NTT shares, prompted by fears that the additional
tranche would depress the stock price, has helped drag down the market in
the past few weeks. The Tokyo market remains vulnerable, although the Nikkei
average has rebounded from its six-year low reached last week following a
government announcement to support the country's ailing banks.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said plans to offer the remaining
government-held NTT shares during the two years to March 1994 had been
suspended. 'The negative impact could be large on the market,' he said. The
government, which still owns two thirds of NTT, was forced to postpone
planned sales of 500,000 shares last fiscal year because of a sluggish
market.
The decision means the government, which hoped to use revenue from NTT
shares to help fund public works projects, will need to find other means. Mr
Hata said the Finance Ministry was considering issuing construction bonds to
get funds.
Mr Hata said the share price of NTT, which rose as high as Y3.18m (Pounds
12,800) in 1987 and has rebounded from its record low of Y453,000 (Pounds
1,823) reached earlier this month, was a 'symbol' stock on the Tokyo market,
adding that it was important to remove negative factors depressing its share
price.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Bank of Japan issues grim report: Warning of slowdown lends
support to rumours of cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan yesterday issued one of its gloomiest economic reports
yet, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and the likelihood of a
prolonged reduction in industrial activity.
Although the report draws no policy implications, it appears consistent with
a recent spate of rumours that the central bank is preparing another cut in
interest rates, perhaps in conjunction with a package of government
emergency economic measures to be announced on Friday.
Newspaper reports said yesterday that the ruling Liberal Democratic party
had decided to approve more than Y8,000bn (Pounds 32bn) in extra fiscal
spending, compared with a range of Y6,000bn to Y8,000bn originally under
consideration.
The central bank last reduced the official discount rate by half a point to
3.25 per cent at the end of July.
The tone of the bank's report was borne out by a report from the Japan
Department Stores' Association, which said sales in July dropped by 2.2 per
cent, the fifth consecutive month of year-on-year declines. The falls
included a 2.4 per cent drop in men's clothing sales, 11.8 per cent in
furniture sales and 12 per cent in consumer electronics.
In addition to sluggish consumer spending, the central bank cited declining
capital goods shipments, declining capacity utilisation, the accumulation of
capital stock and a decline in corporate profits. Perhaps most worrying, the
bank said the declines in industrial production had failed to clear
inventories, because of the unexpected weakness in demand.
'Inventory adjustments have generally been in a lull, and ongoing severe
production restraint will probably be prolonged in most industries,' the
bank said.
Although the bank did not predict when inventories would reach normal
levels, many private economists believe this may not happen until spring.
Meanwhile, Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers'
Association of Japan, said the banking industry was expected to finalise
details by the end of the year on a plan to create a corporation that would
buy property from banks being held as collateral for non-performing loans.
The banks' capital base and profitability have been severely undermined by
the burden of non-performing loans, which analysts estimate estimated at
Y25,000bn to Y30,000bn. It is feared the banks would be unable to support
any potential recovery in the economy unless a means can be found to clear
balance sheets of bad assets. The market for land in Japan, however, is
extremely sluggish.
Mr Wakai, who is also president of Mitsubishi Bank, said it was unclear how
such a corporation would be funded, and there remained thorny issues such as
how to assess the value of land purchased.
He said, however, that banks should find a way to fund the plan themselves,
rather than rely on government money.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Cabinet approves Emperor's visit to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPEROR Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan are to pay an official visit to
China in October to mark the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
diplomatic relations between China and Japan.
The visit, approved by the Japanese cabinet yesterday morning after months
of national debate, promises to be rich in historical as well as
contemporary political significance.
Relations between China and Japan go back 2,000 years, but this will be the
first visit by a Japanese head of state to China.
Approval of the visit comes after repeated invitations from the Chinese, and
marks something of a diplomatic coup for them, as it will further ease the
isolation imposed on them after the suppression of democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
The visit is fiercely opposed by right-wing nationalists in Japan, who fear
China will use the visit for its own political purposes and may try to get
the Emperor to apologise for Japan's behaviour during the war or press for
war reparations.
A Foreign Ministry official, however, said: 'The Emperor is not going to
China to apologise.' The visit is to promote friendship and goodwill.
Nonetheless, anti-Japanese sentiment among Chinese stemming from the
brutality of Japanese troops during the war remains strong, and the imperial
family is still linked symbolically to the events of that period. The
Emperor will not find it easy to summon words expressing sincere regret that
will please both his Chinese hosts and critics at home, many of whom believe
Japan was not responsible for the war.
The Foreign Ministry official said the government was responsible for the
Emperor's remarks during the visit. He admitted, however, that the issue was
highly political and would be subject to careful consultation between the
prime minister's office and the palace.
Approval of the visit reflects a fundamental Japanese policy of trying to
engage the Chinese in regional diplomacy rather than trying to isolate the
country.
'Good relations between China and Japan should contribute to peace and
stability in Asia and the world,' the official said. 'It is wrong to drive
China toward the road to isolation.'

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fragile economic background to South Africa's political transition
process was yesterday underlined by Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve
Bank, the country's central bank.
Speaking at the bank's annual general meeting in Pretoria, Dr Stals
described the past year as one of 'frustration and disappointment'. The
country had experienced a deepening of the longest recession since 1945  -
real gross domestic product fell at annualised rates of 2 and 2.5 per cent
in the first and second quarters of 1992.
Despite the weak state of the economy Dr Stals resisted calls to relax
monetary policy in order to boost the economy. He also rejected pleas to
devalue the rand, as endorsed last week by the Old Mutual, the country's
largest insurer.
Dr Stals also said the country could only enjoy lower nominal interest rates
when inflation had been brought down. Inflation, which has exceeded 10 per
cent a year for 20 years, is now running at 15.1 per cent, according to the
June consumer price index.
'The reduction of the inflation rate must remain a policy priority, even in
the present subdued economy,' he said.
Acknowledging that serious problems of poverty, unemployment and a declining
standard of living would be exacerbated by another year of contraction -
1992 will be the sixth year of decline since 1982 - Dr Stals commented:
'Neither the cause of, nor the solution to this dilemma, should be looked
for in monetary policy.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Chileans learn costs of popular capitalism: An unforeseen
legal loophole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THEORY, Mr Victor Canete should be a rich man. As a technician in
Chilectra Metropolitana, Chile's biggest power distribution company, he was
encouraged to buy shares when it was privatised in 1985.
Like most of his colleagues Mr Canete joined a new legion of popular
capitalists by dipping into his severance pay fund to take part in the
government's share offer to Chilectra employees.
But in 1987 Chilectra's general manager, Mr Jose Yuraszeck, and other
executives devised a way of gaining control of the government's last
remaining stake in the company. They persuaded employees to swap their
shares for 'ownership rights' in two investment societies - known as
'Chispitas 1 and 2' - controlled by Chilectra executives. The shares were
used as collateral against bank loans that
allowed the executives to buy a controlling stake in the company.
Chilectra and its holding company Enersis have grown through diversification
and a series of astute acquisitions. Profits have grown exponentially and
their shares are hot favourites on Santiago's buoyant stock exchange.
Yet Chilectra's employees, who helped jump-start the privatisation programme
in Chile when its success was less than certain, have seen only a fraction
of this bonanza.
Their share of Enersis' profits has gone to repay the Chispitas bank loans
used to finance acquisitions.
Mr Marcelo Brito, Enersis's financial director, says employees were warned
their participation in Chispitas would be a long-term investment. He says
employees have received 30 per cent of the dividends due - which last year
amounted to about three months' pay.
But some employees believed they were duped into exchanging a highly liquid
asset - Chilectra shares - for theoretical ownership rights in investment
societies they do not control.
'Our shares are trapped. We cannot appoint nor dismiss Chispita directors
and we have no say in their investment decisions,' says Mr Canete, now
president of one of the Chilectra unions.
Employees can only sell their 'ownership quotas' to other employees of the
Enersis holding. These are internally traded at a deep discount to their
asset value.
Mr Canete says most employees want their shareholding to be translated into
a real say in the running of the company. Failing that they want the
Chispitas wound up to enable them to cash in on the real value of their
investments.
Enersis' executives are members of an emerging group in Chile's small
business community who control former state-owned companies without actually
owning them.
Chile's privatisation programme was halted after the return of democracy in
1990. Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister, says the sale of state
companies 'lacked transparency'. But the new government has not probed
alleged irregularities, despite the fact that many Chileans feel aggrieved
by the way companies were sold under the military regime.
At Soquimich, the world's biggest iodine producer, employees originally
received shares in lieu of productivity bonuses.
The workers formed an investment company, Pampa Calichera, which built up a
20 per cent stake in Soquimich. The investment company became the target of
two rival takeover bids, one led by Mr Eduardo Bobenreith, a former general
manager. He lost to the company's present executives, who used a company
called Inversiones Oro Blanco.
The workers were persuaded - some union leaders say forced - into exchanging
their shares in their own investment company for cash and shares in
management-controlled Oro Blanco. Both Mr Bobenreith and Oro Blanco were
made to pay heavy fines by Chile's securities watchdog for breaching
takeover regulations but by then the takeover had been accomplished.
The privatisation of Iansa, a huge agri-industrial complex supplying 80 per
cent of Chile's sugar, was launched with an employee share-ownership scheme
and a share offer to sugar beet farmers. Together they formed an investment
company, Campos Chilenos, that became embroiled in a bitter takeover battle.
The struggle pitted Campos Chilenos against French sugar trader Sucres et
Denrees (Sucden) and a subsidiary of Continental Bank of Chicago, which
together held a majority stake in the sugar monopoly. Two years of law
suits, injunctions and fierce boardroom battles paralysed the company.
Iansa's profits plunged, as did its share price and that of Campos Chilenos.
Sucden and Chicago Continental gave up the battle at the end of 1991.
Campos Chilenos, unlike the Chispitas, is traded on the stock exchange so
employees were free to buy and sell their shares. However, some employees
still believe they were used as pawns in a corporate power game: fewer than
half of the company's employees now retain shares and employees no longer
control the company.
The proliferation of closed investment societies as vehicles for corporate
control exploits a loophole in Chilean company law. Closed
societies are accountable only to their members and fall outside the
jurisdiction of the Chilean securities commission. Nevertheless, the
loophole has begun to worry the authorities, as well as business leaders who
have resisted the temptation offered by this legal twilight zone.
In the US, companies can obtain tax advantages if they promote employee
share-ownership programmes (Esops). But according to Mr Guillermo Morales, a
Chilean lawyer who worked with Esops in Chicago, these schemes come with
important safeguards to prevent them becoming sitting ducks for predators.
'US companies acknowledge that share ownership changes the contractual
relationship between the company and its employees,' says Mr Morales.
'Chilean labour law is ill-suited to deal with this new relationship.'
Mr Morales also believes that Chilean employees lack the sophistication of
their counterparts in the US. They are often unaware of their rights, fear
victimisation, and lack good legal counsel.
'There is a huge gulf between the paternalism that still governs industrial
relations in Chile and the move to create a modern capital market with a
broad ownership base.'
For Latin American and east European countries currently pushing through
privatisation programmes, the Chilean experience points to the need for
effective legislation to protect the rights of individual shareholders, lest
executive control makes a travesty of the notion of popular capitalism.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Clinton seeks to clarify record on military service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bill Clinton, the Democratic party's presidential candidate, yesterday
sought 'to set the record straight' on one of the more profound question
marks over his character, his avoidance of military service during the
Vietnam war.
Addressing an ex-servicemen's convention in Chicago only hours after
President George Bush had given a speech from the same podium, Mr Clinton
said he was relieved he did not have to join the military 'not because I
didn't want to serve my country, but because I believed so strongly that our
policy in Vietnam was wrong'.
He repeated the circumstances in 1969 which drew him away from the military;
that, while studying at Oxford, he had contemplated joining the reserves,
changed his mind, entered the draft lottery and drew a number low enough to
ensure he would never be called up.
He then said, to applause, that he respected the right of his audience not
to vote for him as he had not served, but hoped 'you will cast your vote
looking towards the future rather than remaining fixed to the problems of
the past'.
In his speech, devoted mostly to his foreign policy record and his
commitment to a strong national defence, Mr Bush had only said of his
military service in the second world war that 'I was scared, but I was
willing'. This followed an earlier statement released by his campaign
accusing Mr Clinton of 'inconsistencies' in his presentation of how he had
avoided military service.
Both candidates were warmly received, which must have gratified Mr Clinton
in particular given the conservative nature of the American Legion. He said
he would have gone to Vietnam if ordered and that he honoured, then and now,
those who went.
Staking out the generational divide between himself and Mr Bush, he said it
was 'perhaps inevitable' this year and in elections to come that people
should ask if someone who had never served in the military was fit to act as
the nation's commander-in-chief. He cited Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan as great commanders without personal
experience of military service.
Mr Clinton promised he would not shrink from using force to defend the
national interest. His proposed five-year defence budget was only 5 per cent
less than the president's but, he insisted, US forces needed to be
restructured to meet 'less predictable' post-cold war demands.
American consumer confidence this month fell to its lowest level since
March, according to the latest survey by the Conference Board, the business
research organisation.
Its widely watched index stood at 58.0 in August, down from a revised 61.2
in July. The base of 100 reflects 1985 levels of consumer confidence.
The director of research said the drop was moderate, but the continued sag
in consumer spirits was 'disconcerting'.

Thousands of students and union militants gathered in the commercial centre
of Rio de Janeiro last night dressed in black and shouting 'Out with
corruption. Out with Collor'. Office workers in surrounding buildings threw
shredded paper out of windows to show their support. Other mass
demonstrations were under way in state capitals across the country.
Students, trade unionists, lawyers, intellectuals and politicians calling
for Mr Collor's resignation took part in earlier protests in Sao Paulo, the
country's largest city where up to 500,000 had gathered, and Belo Horizonte,
the third largest city.
Leading intellectuals have issued a manifesto accusing the president of
'breaching the moral and legal limits of his mandate'. Mr Luis Antonio
Fleury, the influential governor of Sao Paulo, demanded the president's
impeachment.
But Mr Collor summoned his entire cabinet to the presidency last night for
an emergency meeting at which he repeated his determination to stay in
office. Afterwards Mr Celio Borja, law minister, said that all ministers had
signed a declaration affirming they would remain in their posts until the
crisis was over.
The 200-page congressional report broadcast live to the nation on Monday
contained nothing that had not previously surfaced in press reports since
investigations began in May, when Mr Collor's younger brother accused him of
corruption. But the report by a 22-member commission was the first official
confirmation of allegations.
It was unsparing in its criticism, accusing Mr Collor of profiting from a
huge corruption racket by his former close friend and campaign treasurer, Mr
Paulo Cesar Farias, and of 'failing in his constitutional duty to uphold
moral standards'.
Congressional discussion on the report began yesterday afternoon and the
commission will vote today on whether to approve its conclusions. There is
little doubt it will be approved, as 13 members have already confirmed their
backing. This will open the way to impeachment proceedings, for which a
two-thirds majority in Congress is necessary, and a possible criminal
investigation.
Mr Collor continues to insist the report was 'political'. He is expected to
produce a counter-report asserting his innocence and laying all the blame on
Mr Farias.
His aides are also planning legal challenges to the report on the grounds
that the commission had no right to investigate the president. The inquiry
was set up to examine Mr Farias' activities.
Mr Collor spent yesterday closeted with pro-government political leaders in
an attempt to ensure the 168 votes necessary to withstand impeachment
proceedings. Government officials claim they have 209 votes but this may be
jeopardised if the Democratic Social party (PDS) withdraws its 44 votes of
support for the government.
Mr Paulo Maluf, PDS president, has already said he is in favour of
impeachment.
Most politicians are keen to avoid a lengthy impeachment and hope public
protests will force Mr Collor to quit.
The economy remains paralysed with inflation running at 23 per cent a month.
Mr Carlos Langoni, a former central bank governor, said: 'If Collor stays on
now, inflation will rise and there is no way the government will be able to
manage the economic situation.'

<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, threw the country's
struggling equities market into turmoil yesterday with a confusing statement
about government action to smooth sharp fluctuations in share prices, writes
John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The minister, addressing a conference of financial executives on Monday,
said money raised from privatisations would in future be ploughed back into
the capital markets.
Asked for an explanation, a top government official said yesterday: 'The
proposal is to put proceeds from privatisations back into the market through
a partially state-owned institution that would intervene to stop prices
going up too far or falling too far.'
The suggestion appeared not only to be ill-defined but to run counter to
government efforts to deregulate the economy. One market operator said:
'Nobody can understand exactly what he is proposing.'

AMERICAN consumer confidence this month fell to its lowest level since
March, according to the latest survey by the Conference Board, the business
research organisation, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Its widely watched index stood at 58.0 in August, down from a revised 61.2
in July. The base of 100 reflects 1985 levels of consumer confidence.
The director of research said the drop was moderate, but the continued sag
in consumer spirits was 'disconcerting'.
Recent surveys have suggested that business confidence is far higher than
that of consumers. The Conference Board's business confidence index is at
its highest level since 1984, while the Dun and Bradstreet analysis of
business expectations is now at its highest level in three years.
With the election less than 10 weeks away, the lack of consumer optimism
concerns the Bush re-election campaign.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Big cuts in Danish spending proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S minority government yesterday proposed heavy spending cuts in a
draft 1993 state budget designed to reduce deficits and keep the country's
economic revival on course.
It unveiled a budget with a DKr33.9bn (Pounds 3.1bn) deficit, lower than the
expected shortfall for 1992 of DKr38.3bn. The budget, proposing savings of
DKr7.5bn to leave real expenditure unchanged, is likely to face a stormy
passage in political negotiations this autumn.
While the ruling centre-right government is bent on austerity, left-wing and
centrist opposition parties say they want increased public spending to get
the more than 300,000 unemployed people in Denmark back to work.
In his budget statement, the finance minister, Mr Henning Dyremose, said the
balance of payments surplus was expected to rise to DKr23.5bn next year from
an estimated DKr21bn surplus this year.
But two problems for the Danish economy were high unemployment and the large
state budget deficit. The government forecasts that unemployment at the end
of 1992 will be around 10.25 per cent, dropping to 10 per cent in 1993.
'The state budget deficit has as yet shown no sign of falling, hence the
need for austerity policies. . . . We must pursue policies to stabilise the
Danish economy and prevent overseas confidence in Denmark from further
declining due to our as yet unclarified position on Europe following the
'no' to Maastricht in the June referendum,' Mr Dyremose said.
Appealing for support for tight austerity policies, to get the state budget
back into surplus, he called for privatisation, rationalisation and
efficiency programmes, coupled with reductions in state subsidies to
industry and commerce and benefits to the unemployed.
'Unemployment is still far too high, it is of major importance to make
lasting cuts in the huge jobless rate,' the minister said.

FT  26 AUG 92 / New racist clash erupts as German politicians quarrel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE clashed with right-wing extremists for a fourth successive night in
Rostock at the end of a day in which federal and state leaders quarrelled
over who was ultimately responsible for the racist attacks in the east
German Baltic port.
More than a thousand police reinforcements had been rushed to the city to
try to head off the threats of renewed violence. Although most immigrants
have been evacuated, several hundred youths outside a refugee centre hurled
pieces of pavement and firebombs, at police who responded with water cannon
and tear gas. At least two cars were set on fire.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in his first public comment on the riots, said
outbreaks of violence against foreigners would be 'confronted with the
utmost legal firmness and strictness'. He dismissed charges that the
violence was typical for east Germany, the poorer part of the united
country.
Meanwhile, the federal constitutional protection agency in Cologne said it
feared the weekend riots, in which almost 300 asylum-seekers were driven out
of a Rostock hostel, would prompt violence elsewhere.
Although an instant poll showed 86 per cent of Germans against attacks on
foreigners, only 200 people turned out in Rostock yesterday evening for a
'solidarity' rally. Another poll, to be published tomorrow, showed Mr Kohl's
Christian Democrat party has lost up to half its support in the east since
federal elections in December 1990.
In Bonn, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, Mr Kohl's right-hand man, said Rostock had
been over-burdened because too many asylum-seekers had been housed in the
town's main collection centre. He called on the local authorities and police
in future to avoid 'shortcomings' which had done nothing to convince people
of the state's ability to cope.
He appeared to be referring to Monday night's resumption of the riots in
which a mob broke into an apartment block and set several flats alight while
police stood by. The police had been unaware that between 60 and 100
Vietnamese were still inside.
Mr Schauble, speaking after a meeting of coalition leaders, condemned the
violence, called for peaceful cohabitation, and added that east Germany
would have to continue to take its quota of asylum-seekers.
He also welcomed the opposition Social Democrats' (SPD) apparent acceptance
of the need for constitutional change. An SPD summit at the weekend reversed
its long-standing policy, saying the flow of asylum seekers had to be
'braked and controlled', and agreeing to constitutional changes 'if
necessary'.
Mr Gerd Wartenberg, SPD interior policy spokesman, claimed Mr Rudolf
Seiters, interior minister, was at fault for housing refugees in Rostock.
The minister countered by claiming the SPD had blocked solutions to the
asylum problem for years.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mr Berndt Seite, state prime minister, denied
responsibility for the worst example of racist violence since similar events
in Hoyerswerda, Lower Saxony, almost a year ago.
According to federal officials, 288 violent attacks by right-wingers have
occurred so far this year. Nine people have been killed, compared with three
in the whole of 1991.

background to the country's refugee crisis

<TEXT>
PERSONS persecuted on political grounds shall enjoy the right to asylum: 11
words in Germany's inadequate constitution, liberally interpreted by
politicians, exploited by thousands of poor foreigners looking for a new
life, and scorned by blood-hungry yobs and Nazis old and new, brought mass
violence to the streets of Rostock at the weekend.
The fear and the likelihood is that such scenes will be repeated elsewhere
in the coming weeks and months; most likely in the east.
The weekend beatings and burnings which spilled over into Monday night - a
magnified reflection of the extreme right's offensive in Hoyerswerda,
Saxony, almost exactly a year ago - stirred shame and recrimination in equal
measure among politicians yesterday.
The violence, cheered by mobs of 'respectable' locals in the apartment
blocks around the besieged asylum hostel in the Lichtenhagen suburb, also
sharpened the desire to find a solution.
By grim coincidence, while the alleged radio-equipped 'organisers' of the
battle were on their way to Rostock from Berlin, Hamburg and other
inner-city spawning grounds of the far-right, Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of
the opposition Social Democrats, was preparing to stand his party's asylum
policy on its head.
Ringing through the ifs and buts of his weekend declaration came unequivocal
acceptance that the uncontrolled flow of asylum-seekers - 233,000 in the
first seven months of this year, compared with 256,000 during 1991 and
193,000 in 1990 - had to be stopped.
After years of refusal, the party leadership was prepared to countenance
constitutional change.
The 'ideologues' in Bonn had, after all, heard the voices of grass-roots
party leaders in the hundreds of SPD-controlled local and state governments
who have daily to house, feed, process and protect asylum claimants, a
senior Christian Democrat leader said.
Chancellor-candidate Mr Engholm insisted yesterday that he was not trying to
protect his career.
'This concerns the political reaction to current problems which need to be
dealt with,' he said.
One of the problems now in need of treatment has been current since the
adoption of the constitution in 1949. Although the 11-word paragraph laying
down the basic law on asylum seems clear enough, implementation has been
conditioned (by hitherto common consent) by Germany's xenophobic and
genocidal past.
In practice, anyone asking for asylum at the border is allowed in. After
examination of each case, sometimes lasting months, fewer than 5 per cent of
applicants are approved.
The fact that there are almost 6m foreigners living and working in the
federal republic, most for 10 years and more, is often cited to support
frequent claims from Bonn politicians that Germany is 'foreigner-friendly'.
But most came originally to enjoy better living standards at Germany's
convenience. Many were invited as 'guest workers', to dig coal and labour in
service jobs spurned by Germans.
Now, in the words of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, people coming in
search of a better life 'abuse' the asylum laws. Now, in the words of the
extreme right-wing German People's Union, 'Das Boot ist voll (The boat is
full).'
The recent sudden upsurge in asylum-seekers is exerting unmanageable
pressures on local budgets and generating uncontainable social forces,
exacerbated by hard-core neo-Nazis and hooligans, especially in unemployment
hot-spots in east German towns. The influx of ethnic Germans from the former
Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe (250,000 last year) has added
to the strains.
Eastern local authorities, lacking funds to provide other accommodation,
tend to house their asylum-seeker quotas in heavily populated areas.
Protection, such as it is, comes from inexperienced police, mostly new
recruits who have inherited the mantle of popular hatred handed down by
their communist predecessors.
Official jobless figures in such places range around 20 per cent, but
estates such as Lichtenhagen house up to another 30 per cent one-time
workers, pensioned off into early retirement or 'employed' on non-productive
fill-in projects funded by Bonn until real jobs can be found.
Now, with recession looming over the western economy and no sign of a
resurgence in industrial ruins in the east, the prospect of real jobs is
fading - like Chancellor Helmut Kohl's vision of a 'blooming landscape' in
the former GDR - into the far distance.
A much more tangible possibility is recession, rising unemployment, and
mounting social and political disorder. After last weekend's events Bonn may
act quickly to slow the flow of immigrants and skim away some of the surface
tensions. The risk is that in the process it will expose the underlying
roots of dissent. A country still divided economically, socially and
mentally - with or without its sad traffic in bemused economic refugees -
will continue to provide a bountiful feeding ground for extremists.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Where Community went wrong: Mistakes were made, but
EC-established principles will hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision by Lord Carrington to step down yesterday formally ends
Europe's attempt to negotiate on its own a solution to the conflict in its
Balkan backyard.
As the baton passes to the wider international conference convened in London
today, the EC can only be judged to have failed in its first effort at
international peacemaking. This failure has underscored how difficult it is
for the 12 to co-operate in foreign policy; but it is not solely an EC
failure.
Moreover, any eventual settlement in the region will not stray far from the
principles Lord Carrington and the EC have established over the past year.
The EC made serious mistakes. Initially, it insisted on maintaining
Yugoslavia's federal structure, which may have given the Serbs licence to
wage war on the first republics to depart, Slovenia and Croatia. By
succumbing to German pressure for early recognition of the breakaway states,
the Community frittered away the only diplomatic ace it held.
As Lord Carrington himself warned in December, premature recognition of
Croatia - with a third of its territory in Serb hands - would 'light a
powder trail' to Bosnia. And so it proved, once recognition, rather than a
lasting solution, was established as the international goal, and the
ethnically intertwined Bosnians were thrown back on a rump Yugoslavia
dominated by the Serbs.
No other international body or country could, or was trying to, do better,
until the UN moved slowly on board during last winter's suspension of the
Carrington process. But the EC's shortcomings are no less evident for that.
There are three overriding reasons for its failure.
The EC is a civil power defending its external frontiers through Nato. It
gradually developed foreign policy co-operation from 1970. But the collapse
of the eastern bloc has left a vacuum in Europe and *something in here (HP)
*
requires the EC to assume some of the duties of a superpower. A common
foreign policy in embryo, with no defence arm, is unsuited to this task.
The Maastricht treaty establishes a common foreign and security policy (but
still largely requiring the unanimity of the 12), and posits a future
European defence dimension, based on the Western European Union. But the
Yugoslav crisis arrived first and Maastricht still hangs in the balance.
Some EC members (France, Spain, the UK) were worried about the impact of
Yugoslavia on their own minorities. The Community's post-war success at
consensual supranational management equipped it poorly to respond to the
re-emergence of historical, ethnic-based conflicts.
EC officials, particularly in their early dealings with the Yugoslav crisis,
seemed almost unable to comprehend what such conflicts, a forgotten relic of
western Europe's own past. When forced to remember, France recalled its
Serbian links, and Germany its Croatian ones; the crucial Franco-German axis
which carries the EC forward did not work.
The international community as a whole has no clear practice on the right to
self-determination of aspirants to statehood, nor on how to protect national
minorities.
Lord Carrington's peace effort did make some progress here. It established
that neither internal nor international frontiers can be changed by force in
the process of establishing new nations, and that minority rights within
them must be guaranteed internationally. Whatever the precise solution is in
ex-Yugoslavia, and whenever it comes, there will be no getting away from
these two principles.
All participants in the conflict have at some time assented to these
principles - and virtually all have ignored them in practice.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, in French radio and
newspaper interviews before today's conference calls for 'a credible
perspective of military intervention: we must prepare such a force in order
not to have to use it.'
After the past year's imbroglio, however, EC diplomats do not see this on
the cards. Rather, they foresee tighter sanctions against Serbia, armed
escorts to aid convoys and a continuing search for political solutions while
the fighting goes on - a Carrington tactic.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Oil export bribes for Russian managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN officials and oil managers have taken more than Dollars 100m (Pounds
50.2m) in bribes for irregular exports of the country's most precious
natural resource in the first half of this year alone, anti-corruption
officials said yesterday.
Colonel Vyacheslav Soltaganov, head of the Interior Ministry's economic
crime department, said new-style trading companies were paying bribes of
Dollars 2 a tonne of oil to facilitate the unlicensed export of petroleum
products.
Such practices, which could affect about 10 per cent of Russia's oil
exports, were particularly rampant in Tyumen, Russia's richest oil-producing
area.
Col Soltaganov said Rosnefteproduct, the biggest state oil-refining company,
was under investigation for irregular sales to former Soviet republics which
resulted in parts of Russia being starved of oil products.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, head of the government's anti-corruption commission,
said small-scale rackets at individual petrol stations, usually the focus of
public indignation, often diverted attention from swindles at higher levels.
But a crackdown on one such case in the town of Surgut in Tyumen region
helped uncover a case of local oil enterprise managers selling oil at half
the fixed state price to 'commercial structures'. These new-style businesses
in turn paid kickbacks to the managers, who were in effect working for them.
Mr Gurtovoi also said that managers at Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, the biggest
oil and gas enterprise in the Tyumen district of Nizhnevartovsk, were under
investigation after 1.5m tonnes of oil were found to have been put aside for
unofficial sales.
These cases are only the tip of the iceberg of Russian oil corruption. A
prime cause of the corruption is the continuation of controls on the
domestic oil price to protect industry and agriculture.
Officials said Russia's lack of proper borders with the former Soviet
republics made smuggling difficult to police, with oil frequently being
shipped across to the Baltic republics and then re-exported for hard
currency.
The Russian government's anti-corruption commission has been placed directly
under Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, to free it from political
pressures.
Mr Gurtovoi said the commission, which would remain funded by the
government, would find it easier, for instance, to investigate the Economics
Ministry, under whose tutelage he has been under until now.

FT  26 AUG 92 / All sides in Bosnia suspected Carrington equally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Carrington's resignation yesterday as chairman of the European
Community-sponsored peace conference heralds what may be the end of his
active involvement in the Yugoslav peace process.
Many diplomats believed the former British foreign secretary, who in 1979
chaired the Lancaster House Conference which led to the end of the Rhodesian
war and the emergence of Zimbabwe, could crack the Balkan problem. Instead,
the Balkan conflict conquered Lord Carrington.
As a Briton he was viewed with suspicion by the Croats. On the one hand, the
government in Zagreb saw him as a representative of the traditional
pro-Serbian stance of the British establishment. Croatia's President Franjo
Tudjman resented his persistence in insisting that the ethnic rights of the
Serb minority had to be protected in an independent Croatia even as its
historic port city of Dubrovnik was being bombarded.
But the Serbs did not like Lord Carrington either, particularly when the EC
bowed to German pressure in recognising Croatia's independence in January
1992, before any political settlement was reached on dissolving Yugoslavia.
'Carrington was always criticised. Croatia and Serbia did not see that
Carrington was not the EC. He could only make recommendations to it,' said
one British official.
The criticism of Lord Carrington intensified after the talks in Lisbon in
March which in effect established the basis for a constitutional settlement
for the future of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Bosnia's Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban and backed by Mr Tudjman, and Bosnia's
Serbs, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic and backed by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, agreed to the plan, which envisaged the establishment of cantons
in Bosnia.
Although Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic accepted the plan, the Moslems
 -43 per cent of the republic's 4.3m people - believed the cantonisation
process would lead eventually to the creation of ethnically homogenous
regions in a republic which until recently was an ethnic patchwork.
'Were this plan to be realised, Croatia and Serbia could easily annex Croat-
and Serb-inhabited territories of our country,' a senior Bosnian official
said. 'Had the Moslems stuck to the plan, we might have avoided war in
Bosnia,' an EC official involved in the negotiations on Bosnia said.
From March onwards, Bosnia's Moslems became increasingly suspicious of Lord
Carrington, believing he was intent on 'morally equating' all sides in the
war in Bosnia.
'That was not what he was trying to do,' said a UK official. 'The point is
that Carrington had to talk to all sides in the war. He could not afford to
close the door on any one side, because if he did, it would be more
difficult to bring them back again to the negotiating table.'
But the gap between the bloody fighting on the ground in Sarajevo, and the
world of gilded diplomacy in European capitals, infuriated the city's
besieged inhabitants. 'There were many times that we were being asked to sit
at a table as our republic was being bombarded by those sitting at that
table as well. There is no room for moral equations in this war,' said a
Bosnian foreign ministry official.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / Bosnia to present plan for autonomy and ethnic rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian government will today present a set of proposals to the London
conference aimed at restoring the republic's civil and democratic
structures.
The plan, unveiled yesterday by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign
minister, will be based on a decentralised and secular system, and would
grant the three ethnic communities a wide degree of autonomy and ethnic
rights.
But Mr Silajdzic said his government would not accept any system which would
turn Bosnia into ethnically pure cantons.
The plan entails establishing at least four regions in Bosnia, with
administrative centres in Sarajevo, the capital; Mostar in western
Hercegovina (western Bosnia); Banja Luka in the north; and Tuzla in the
east. These would be based on full equality of 'citizens and ethnic
communities', he said.
However, before any such proposals are negotiated, Mr Silajdzic insisted
that the fighting and the ethnic cleansing must stop. Failure to end the
aggression and ethnic violence in Bosnia will radicalise the political
situation throughout Europe, he warned.
He also warned that if the international community would 'not offer
protection to communities facing genocide, Bosnia should be exempted from
the United Nations arms embargo.'
'No one has the right not to intervene to stop aggression, genocide and
ethnic cleansing and at the same time deny weapons,' he said. 'We ask for
air cover to protect civilians and weapons to defend ourselves on the
ground.' Mr Silajdzic's call for the international community either to help
Bosnia protect and rebuild its shattered multi-ethnic communities, or to
allow it to defend itself, was rejected by Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of
the unrecognised rump Yugoslav republic of Serbia and Montenegro.
Mr Panic said he condemned nationalist 'madness' and 'ethnic cleansing' and
would put forward five 'practical and realisable first steps' to prevent
ethnic conflict spreading from Bosnia to Kosovo and other parts of the
Balkan peninsula.
These included guarantees of safe delivery of relief supplies to Sarajevo, a
pledge to stop 'ethnic cleansing', and Red Cross supervision of prison
camps.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Sweden's markets still nervous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S money markets remained nervous yesterday amid continuing
uncertainty over the country's economic future, as the general share index
fell 2.3 per cent and short-term interest rates rose further.
This followed a 4 per cent plunge in share values on what Swedes have
already called 'black Monday' and a jump in market interest rates. However,
there was no public reaction yesterday from the government.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, insists that there is no crisis and
no reason why the cabinet should change its medium-term strategy to reassure
the markets.
Market analysts remain convinced that the current uncertainties will remain
unless the non-socialist minority coalition can demonstrate that it can
secure a majority in parliament to push through its existing cuts programme
and any other necessary unpopular measures.
Yesterday Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the main opposition Social
Democrats, said his party was willing to co-operate with the government in
creating a broad economic policy to deal with the country's rising
unemployment, huge budget deficit and high interest rates but that Mr Carl
Bildt, the prime minister, would have to drop any further plans to cut
taxes.

FT  26 AUG 92 / D-Mark at new highs as bonds and equities fall: Concern over
European union adds to rate rise fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN that the move towards European economic and monetary union may grind
to a halt sent the D-Mark to fresh highs yesterday and triggered another
large fall in bonds and equities across Europe.
The stronger D-Mark led to new strains on the dollar and weaker currencies
in the European exchange rate mechanism, increasing expectations of interest
rate rises in Europe, particularly the UK and Italy.
A senior US official said in Washington that action by Germany was necessary
to end the instability in the currency markets. He said US policy had been
'consistent for months' in urging the Bundesbank to reduce its high
short-term interest rates, which had encouraged more funds into the D-Mark.
The instability on world markets will be discussed tomorrow in Paris at a
meeting of finance ministry officials from the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations - US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, UK and Canada.
A French opinion poll yesterday indicated a No vote in next month's
referendum on ratification of the Maastricht treaty, which would block moves
towards EMU and undermine investor confidence in the European exchange rate
mechanism. This could lead to large selling of fragile currencies such as
the pound and the Italian lira.
At one stage yesterday, sterling dropped to within half a pfennig of its ERM
floor of DM2.778. It finished in London at its lowest ERM close, at
DM2.7875, down 1 1/4 pfennigs. The lira brushed its floor against the German
currency, before closing at L764.3.
In New York, sterling was trading at DM2.788 at the close, while the lira
was quoted at L764.
Early today sterling was trading at DM2.79 shortly after Japanese markets
opened, with the lira at L764.15.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
discussed the pound's weakness at a one-hour meeting. Officials said the
government would continue to defend the pound by whatever means were
necessary.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, repeated Labour's call for
government action. Speaking after a meeting of senior shadow ministers at Mr
John Smith's Edinburgh home, he said the government had failed to raise
confidence or convince the country of an early revival in the economy.
'The government is doing nothing because it doesn't know what to do,' he
said.
Fears that European currencies will need to be supported by a rise in
interest rates again took a toll on equity markets. In London, the FT-SE 100
index of leading shares came back from a 50-point fall to close 30.1 down at
2,281.0. This followed a 54-point decline on Monday. The fall in London
prices reflected concern on the money markets that a rise in base rates, now
at 10 per cent, was imminent. Sterling cash dealers priced in a one-point
rise in base rates. Two-month forward contracts in sterling were offered at
the same price as the currency's ERM floor.
Gloom about the economy was not confined to London. In Frankfurt, the DAX
index fell 2 per cent to its lowest close since February last year. In
Paris, prices fell 1.3 per cent, to an eight-month low, while bond markets
also suffered with UK gilts losing about half a point.
The dollar held its ground in early US trading, but fell sharply after
reports of lower-than-expected confidence among US consumers. The US
currency fell to a low of DM1.3940, but recovered to close at DM1.4000 in
London and DM1.40225 in New York. It opened in Tokyo today at DM1.40325.
In Washington, a senior US official said the dollar was not 'in a crisis
situation'. He refused to rule out further large intervention by the world's
central banks to prop up the dollar, following five such actions in the past
month. He said: 'We have weapons at our disposal, but the market is a very
significant force.'
The official sounded a note of optimism on the possibility of an easing in
German monetary policy. 'At some point, we're going to get there,' he said,
noting the slowing of the German economy and the recent cuts in inflation.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Carrington resigns as EC peace envoy to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Carrington resigned yesterday as the European Community's peace
mediator in the Yugoslav conflict on the eve of today's opening of the
EC-United Nations conference in London on the former republic's future.
His departure, indicating the failure of his year-long peace mission, served
as a grim reminder of the obstacles to ending the feuding between Serbs,
Croats and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current EC president, is
proposing that Lord Owen - like Lord Carrington a former British foreign
secretary - take his place.
The nomination was expected to be discussed at a meeting of EC foreign
ministers last night. But the choice of the often controversial former
leader of the UK's now-defunct Social Democratic Party might encounter
opposition from some of Britain's EC partners. Last month, Mr Major publicly
rejected a call from Lord Owen for military action against the Bosnian Serbs
to stop human rights abuses.
British officials made clear that there was no likelihood of the London
conference - chaired by Mr Major and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general - bringing an immediate end to the conflict.
Fighting has intensified ahead of the conference, with Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital, yesterday suffering its heaviest mortar and artillery fire in more
than a month. Four UN peacekeeping troops and the BBC television reporter
Martin Bell were wounded by shrapnel.
British officials stressed that the conference was just the start of a fresh
chapter in the peace process, intended to act as a 'turning point' and to
build new diplomatic machinery that might achieve a lasting settlement.
This process will be directed by a central strategy committee, initially
planned to be chaired by Lord Carrington and Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US
secretary of state and the UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia.
The committee will oversee the work of six steering groups to be appointed
today that will form the focal points for long-term negotiations in Geneva.
The six subsidiary committees will deal separately with the war in Bosnia,
rights of the ethnic minorities, economic issues, states seeking successor
status to the former Yugoslavia, humanitarian questions and
confidence-building measures.
Western diplomats conceded that it was as yet unclear how the conference
could stop the fighting in Bosnia, the deportation of people from the
republic and the Serbs' bombardment and siege of Sarajevo and other Bosnian
towns and cities.
But it was made clear that factions which failed to observe minimum
standards of 'civilised behaviour' would face toughened sanctions imposed by
a united international community.
Although Serbia has repeatedly denied involvement in the war in Bosnia, a
British official said that many countries rejected Belgrade's claims.
Nonetheless, direct military intervention was again ruled out as this would
jeopardise the UN's peace-keeping and aid efforts.
UK officials stressed, however, that the conference would tackle 'most
urgently' such issues as detention camps, 'ethnic cleansing' and the plight
of tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees.
Separately, British and US officials insisted that any partition of Bosnia
was 'quite out of the question', since it was opposed by at least one of the
three interested groups involved.

FT  26 AUG 92 / French split on Maastricht, polls suggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP erosion in French support for the Maastricht treaty was shown
yesterday in four opinion polls - one of which for the first time indicated
a No vote in next month's referendum.
Opposition to the treaty among the French, traditionally staunch backers of
European union, has been growing throughout the summer. A No vote in the
September 20 referendum would be a crushing blow for the treaty, a blueprint
for closer European Community unity.
The poll which showed a 51 per cent vote against the treaty - carried out by
BVA for Paris-Match magazine and the Antenne 2/FR3 television network -
pushed the country's stock market to a new low for the year.
The other three polls showed a narrow vote in favour.
A negative result would be damaging to France's Socialist government, which
has been leading the pro-Maastricht campaign.
It would also be a personal blow for President Francois Mitterrand who
launched the referendum in June, confident that France would deliver a
resounding Yes vote to revitalise the cause of European union following the
rejection of the treaty by Danish voters.
Early last month, when he set the date for the referendum, the polls
indicated about 60 per cent support among the French people for the treaty.
Yesterday's BVA poll suggests that the Yes vote has fallen from 56 per cent
in late July, when it conducted its last survey, to 49 per cent. BVA's polls
have a margin of error of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.
Among the polls showing a vote in favour, one commissioned from IFOP by
L'Express magazine found 51 per cent intending to vote Yes. A poll by Sofres
for Le Figaro newspaper showed the same 51-49 vote in favour of the treaty,
while a survey by Louis Harris for VSD magazine, gauged the Yes faction at
52 per cent.
The government is now trying to regenerate its lacklustre campaign in time
for next week's return to work after the end of the summer holiday.
Last week Mr Jack Lang, the arts and education minister, was drafted in to
lead its campaign effort.
Mr Lang has since announced a series of media appearances by prominent
politicians, including Mr Mitterrand, who will appear next Thursday in a
television debate against Mr Philippe Seguin, a prominent anti-Maastricht
campaigner.

FT  26 AUG 92 / British Gas cuts prices 2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday cut its prices to 18m domestic and small business
consumers by 2 per cent from October - the second reduction in three months
 -in spite of recording a Pounds 82m current cost loss for the second
quarter.
Announcing its first results since calling in the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to carry out a comprehensive review of the UK gas market, British
Gas warned that 500 more jobs would be lost as part of its existing
cost-cutting programme by the end of 1992. This would bring the year's total
to 1,500.
The price cut follows a 3 per cent reduction in July. Mr Cedric Brown, newly
appointed chief executive, said British Gas had indicated in March a cut of
up to 5 per cent might be possible, but had delayed until it knew the result
of the general election.
Subsequent inflation forecasts had allowed it to make the full 5 per cent
cut in two stages.
Ofgas, the industry regulator, said the move vindicated its call earlier
this year for substantial cuts, and the continuing pressure it had put on
the company. British Gas agreed a formula with Ofgas last year limiting
price rises to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation.
Mr John Dorken, deputy director general of Ofgas, said he hoped the cut
'indicates British Gas is at last beginning to take its responsibilities
towards its monopoly customers seriously'.
British Gas said the combined cuts would mean a saving of nearly Pounds 27 a
year for a three-bedroom semi-detached house with gas central heating, or
Pounds 36 for a four or five-bedroom house.
It blamed exceptionally warm weather, recession and increasing competition
for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 82m on a current cost basis in the three months
to June 30. In the same period last year, it reported a Pounds 183m profit.
Mr Brown warned that despite the pressure on margins, further cost-cutting
in addition to that already planned would be difficult until the results of
the MMC inquiry were known.
Speaking at his first press conference since becoming chief executive, he
promised a policy of 'frankness and honesty' and conceded that perceptions
of British Gas as bureaucratic and resistant to change 'may be based on some
reality'.

FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy selling of Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEGATIVE recommendation and heavy selling sent British Steel to its lowest
level since the shares were floated at 110p in December 1988. The stock
dipped below 50p for the first time to close 2 1/2 off at 49p on unusually
heavy turnover of 32m shares.
County NatWest repeated its short-term sell advice, which argues that the
dividend will be cut to 3p and that for sufficient yield the shares need to
fall to 45p. Analyst Mr Sandy Morris said: 'If the UK were forced to raise
interest rates, one of the companies most badly hit would be British Steel.'
The securities house acted on behalf of a UK seller who wanted to offload
more than 15m shares. County sold the stock in London at 47 1/2 p a share
and found a buyer in New York, where investors are apparently prepared to
take a much longer view and like the company's asset value.
Shortly before the market closed, another large block of shares - 8.1m  -
was traded in London at 43p. The low price of the late trade suggested one
half of a tax-related 'bed-and-breakfast' deal.
GrandMet setback
A warning from Grand Metropolitan that profits would be flat this year sent
the shares into hasty retreat. The focus of the brewing and food group's
worries lies in its US operations, namely the loss-making Pearl Vision
optician chain and the Jolly Green Giant food division.
The latter, which contributes a third of GrandMet's US food revenue, has
been badly hit by the US's second consecutive record harvest, which has
depressed sweet corn prices. Business in its UK public houses, predominantly
based in the south-east, has also been suffering.
Analysts immediately downgraded the group, most moving from the Pounds 1bn
level to around Pounds 950m, although criticism was tempered by GrandMet's
decision to pay an increased dividend. 'Sustaining profits in this type of
market and raising the dividend will not look so bad once the results season
gets into gear,' said Mr Geoff Collyer at County NatWest. 'They may come
back into favour on that.' He has moved to a short-term hold but remains a
long-term buyer.
The shares, down 43 at one stage, recovered to 379p for a loss of 33 on the
day. Turnover was a hefty 12m.
Recs bought
Another solid performance from the regional electricity stocks (Recs) was
underpinned by the continuing move by institutional investors out of the
Electricity Package, which ceases to be traded on September 4, and into
selected Recs.
Yesterday it was the turn of the second-line Recs to attract institutional
interest as Credit Lyonnais Laing decided they looked cheap and likely to
outperform in the short-term. Seeboard gained 10 to 325p and Manweb 11 to
358p, while the Package rose 27 to Pounds 3310.
Gas disappoints
A second-quarter loss, a slightly disappointing interim dividend and a
warning that full-year profits will be well below last year's triggered
sustained selling of British Gas. The stock finished 5 1/2 lower at 237 1/2
p, having touched 236p. Turnover reached 11.5m, well above usual levels.
Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court said: 'British Gas is facing a
particularly nasty margin squeeze at present, with gas prices falling and
costs rising sharply.' Following the figures, Smith reduced its current year
estimate from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 1bn and shaved its dividend forecast
from 14.25p to 14p.
Other analysts, however, suggested the market had been too optimistic on the
interim payment, with Ms Christine Baker at Nomura noting that the dividend
'still represents a real rate of increase' and the shares 'remain attractive
in the context of the nervous state of the equity market'.
National Westminster Bank was easily the worst performer in a generally
resilient banks sector yesterday. The stock weakened to 301p before closing
13 down at 302p amid hints that the bank may reveal more details of some of
its bad debts in a routine report to the US Stock Exchange Commission.
Composite insurers were under further pressure, still unsettled by fears of
a rise in domestic interest rates and, to a much lesser extent, worries
about Hurricane Andrew, which has caused severe damage in Florida.
Sun Alliance was heavily sold late in the session, sliding to 214p before
stabilising to end a net 7 weaker at 217 1/2 p. Turnover reached a hefty
6.8m.
Turnover of 14m in BP was substantially swollen by a late trade of 6.2m
shares transacted at 178p; the deal was thought to have represented a
bed-and-breakfast, or tax-related, trade.
Interim results from Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronics, were in line
with market expectations, but sentiment was unsettled by worries about the
outlook for the full year and the chances of the group paying the final
dividend. The shares dropped to 128p before closing 34 off at 133p.
Carlton Communications slid 20 to 541p on fears of vulnerability to a weak
dollar.
ECC Group was also affected by dollar weakness and further depressed by talk
of analysts downgrading full-year profits forecasts for the company after
half-year results next month. The shares fell 30 to 450p.
Conglomerate Hanson was beginning to look oversold yesterday and the shares
picked up a penny against the market trend to close at 186 1/2 p.
Shares in hotel group Forte crumbled after Sodexho, the French catering
group, denied press reports that it was about to buy Forte's Gardner
Merchant subsidiary. Forte was off 10 at one point but recovered to 127p to
leave a decline of 3.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Barclays rewrites its PR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the latest of the big clearing banks to shake up its public relations
team, Barclays Bank has restored the job of polishing up its battered image
to a couple of career bankers. Terry Jones, 47, has been appointed group
communications director and Geoffrey Kelly, 55, has been made group public
relations director.
James Poole, Barclays' head of corporate affairs, is leaving when his
contract expires shortly, and the bank has decided to restructure its
communications staff and recruit from within rather than hire another
outside pr expert.
Jones, who joined Barclays in 1982 and is European director, will have
overall responsibility for the group's public relations, investor relations
and employee communications.
Kelly, currently corporate communications director at BZW, the investment
banking arm, will have direct responsibility for the group's public
relations functions, and will be Poole's effective replacement. Although he
will report to Jones, on corporate communications issues he will report
directly to Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chief executive.
Of the two new faces, Kelly is the better known. He joined Martins Bank -
acquired by Barclays in 1969 - almost 40 years ago and has been dealing with
the media for much of the time since then. When he was seconded to the
information division of the CBI in the early 1980's, it looked as if he was
being groomed for the top job on his return to the bank. But Barclays hired
Poole and Kelly was moved sideways to BZW.
In March, National Westminster Bank brought in S G Warburg's Simon Lewis as
director of corporate affairs. And it remains to be seen who HSBC Holdings
will pick as its London pr chief following its acquisition of Midland Bank
last month.
*****
A Frankfurt-born American of Russian parentage is to lead HOLIDAY INN's
drive to find new franchisees in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Before joining Holiday Inn, Reas Kondraschow spent 16 years with Burger
King, now owned by Grand Metropolitan. His last job at Burger King was as
vice-president of franchise sales and development.
Franchising will be particularly important if Holiday Inn is to achieve its
European goal of extending its network from 127 hotels today to 200 by the
mid-1990s. Of the existing hotels, 70 per cent are franchise operations. The
company hopes to increase the proportion to 80 per cent.

Henry Pohl, formerly senior vice-president international of Fox Video in Los
Angeles, has been appointed finance and business affairs director of
POLYGRAM VIDEO INTERNATIONAL. Nadia Ostacchini, formerly international
marketing manager, becomes marketing director.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Perfect pitch for the Associated Board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Morris (left), until last year a managing director of Hodder and
Stoughton, is taking over as chief executive of the Associated Board of the
Royal Schools of Music (AB) from the beginning of next year. He succeeds
Ronald Smith, a former County of Avon schools music inspector, who will have
been in the job 10 years when he retires at the age of 64.
'We were looking for someone who combined a rather greater commercial
experience with a deep and genuine musical interest' says Sir John Burgh, AB
chairman. A charitable body, the AB sets music exams in the UK and overseas,
and now has an annual turnover close to Pounds 12m. With his unusually
varied career, Morris, 47, tunes in well with the Board's requirements.
A qualified solicitor, who spent five years in corporate finance at S G
Warburg, he moved in 1979 to Hodder, the independent book publisher with a
line in popular fiction including Jeffrey Archer and Stephen King. He rose
to become joint managing director in 1989, responsible however for the
educational and academic publishing side. He left last June - three months
after a major wave of redundancies at Hodder - saying he felt he had
'reached a ceiling'. Hodder is still run by direct descendants of the Hodder
family; Philip Attenborough is chairman and his brother Michael was the
other md when Morris was there.
Also a professionally trained operatic bass, the AB's future boss has been
on the council of Kent Opera, and 3 years ago co-founded Almaviva Opera,
which introduces children to classical opera. Hence his interest in
'becoming the chief executive of something that had an educational purpose'.
The AB made considerable strides under Smith's stewardship - including
expanding the number of pupils taking exams and broadening the range of
instruments examined. Morris wants to build on a new training and advisory
side, as well as to expand abroad - particularly in America, where, in
contrast to the success in South East Asia for instance, the Board has yet
to make its mark.

FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Selling programmes hit share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER turmoil in curren-cies, fuelled by conflicting Maastricht opinion
polls in France, prompted increased selling pressure in UK equities
yesterday. Share prices were hit by a series of trading programmes,
including one very large programme heavily weighted to the sell side and
operated by a leading UK investment bank. A final blow came when a US
brokerage sold the Footsie futures contract heavily.
The FT-SE Index plunged by more than 50 points to the day's low of 2,260.6
as sterling fell within  1/2 pfennig of its permitted ERM floor. However,
the market rallied as the trading day drew to a close without any sign of
the full-point rise in UK base rates now widely feared on the London stock
market.
The index was finally 30.1 down at 2,281, the lowest closing level since
February 1991 - although it traded as low as 2,294 only a month ago. Traders
drew little comfort from the late recovery, which reflected the shortage of
stock in a market where marketmakers are keeping positions as tight as
possible.
Several dealers said the market's loss would have been greater had it been
possible to sell stock in the size offered by some institutions. Dealers at
the marketmaking firms are sticking rigidly to the bargain sizes shown on
the Seaq screens and brokers found great difficulty in offloading larger
deals.
Nevertheless, Seaq volume jumped to 537.7m shares from the 382m of the
previous session. Monday's Seaq total brought retail business worth a mere
Pounds 666.6m but yesterday's retail total is expected to be higher.
Equities opened lower against a background of continued worry over sterling
and weak performances from share prices in Tokyo and New York. But London
steadied at first, to show a fall of under seven points on the Footsie, in
spite of a heavy fall in Grand Metropolitan following a boardroom statement.
Share prices fell steeply just before lunch when the heavy selling programme
from a London investment bank hit the trading screens. Substantial blocks of
shares were sold, ranging from dollar-influenced issues to domestic building
and construction shares, which are particularly sensitive to base rate
worries.
Losses increased as the pound crumbled in the face of a French opinion poll
suggesting a 51 per cent 'no' vote against the Maastricht treaty, although
it was soon followed by disclosure of a second poll indicating the same
percentage for a 'yes' vote.
Two more, smaller, trading programmes were identified and the trading
screens reported sizeable deals in, among many others, British Steel, Glaxo,
Tarmac and J. Sainsbury.
The stock market finished on a gloomy note, with analysts looking nervously
over their shoulders at the Footsie 2,100 mark.
Some believe that even this benchmark could be challenged if the UK
authorities are obliged to raise base rates by a full point in order to
defend sterling in the ERM range.

FT  26 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSY trading in the futures market yesterday was once again dominated by
currency and interest rate concerns, writes Christopher Price.
The September contract on the FT-SE Index opened weakly at 2,306 as
independent traders figured large on the selling side. However, a squeeze
developed and, soon after the opening, September moved forward, reaching the
day's high of 2,314 by 10am.
By this time, however, traders' minds were again focused on sterling, the
dollar and the D-Mark, and the effect on UK base rates. As pressure on the
pound mounted, the market began to slide, accentuated in late-morning
trading by a big sell programme by BZW.
Further events combined to maintain the downward pressure: a weak Wall
Street, a French opinion poll on Maastricht, and a large sell order executed
by US broking house Salomon Brothers. September hit 2,256, its low of the
session, late in the day's trading, but rallied towards the end. It finished
at 2,285, down 31 points from the previous close and around a 5-point
premium to its fair value of 5.5. Turnover was 17,139 lots.
In traded options, volume reached 41,335 contracts, of which 15,957 were in
the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Firmer bond prices help to
steady Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AIDED BY a broadly stable dollar and a rally in bond prices, US stock
markets held their ground yesterday after four days of heavy losses, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.05 at 3,232.22,
having pulled back from an early 18-point decline. The more broadly based
Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, eventually finishing 0.89
firmer on the day at 411.61, but the American SE composite ended 1.38 off at
379.52 and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.17 at 554.22. Turnover on the New
York SE came to 203m shares.
The main influence on equity sentiment remained the dollar, and its effect
on bond prices. After an early decline, the US currency managed to hold its
ground above DM1.40.
The lack of another dollar debacle boosted bond prices. With the rise in
bond yields halted, stock market sentiment improved, and after some early
losses triggered by computer sell programs, share prices climbed steadily
back to positive territory in the morning.
The day's only economic news, a fall in the Conference Board's consumer
confidence survey for August, was brushed aside, even though the data
suggested that the economy will remain sluggish for the rest of the summer
and probably longer.
Car manufacturers were heavily traded as the latest auto sales figures came
out. General Motors eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 in turnover of 4.4m
shares and Chrysler softened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 in volume of
1.9m - both were expected to report lower mid-August car sales but higher
truck sales. Ford, however, added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 40 1/8 on news of
a 28 per cent improvement in car sales.
Two ADRs stood out: Telefonos de Mexico fell initially - as investors
reacted to a decline in Mexican stocks on Monday - but recovered to end
Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 43 5/8 on turnover of 2.7m; and UK
food group Grand Metropolitan dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 30 after the
company filed for a Dollars 600m issue of fixed-rate debt sec-urities and
said 1992 pre-tax profits would be in line with a year ago.
Insurers, heavily sold on Monday, remained a feature in the wake of the
hurricane in south Florida which by yesterday afternoon was threatening to
inflict heavy damage on the Louisiana coast and the city of New Orleans.
Aetna edged Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 38 5/8 , Cigna eased Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 50 7/8 , Travelers firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20 3/4 and
Geico improved Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 .
Deere &amp; Co shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 after the agricultural
equipment manufacturer posted fiscal third-quarter net income of just 12
cents a share, down from 41 cents a share earned a year ago. The company
also warned that the outlook for the rest of the year was uncertain.
Canada
THE FORTUNES of the US dollar kept Toronto stocks on a tight string during
the day before the market closed slightly weaker after moderate trading. The
TSE 300 index slipped 5.0 to 3,375.8 and declines outpaced advances by 282
to 241 after volume of 25.9m shares valued at CDollars 250.8m.
Gold shares gave back about half of Monday's 2.4 per cent index gain, losing
1.23 per cent.
Sears Canada said it will issue 10.5m common shares at CDollars 7.25 each,
with Sears Roebuck agreeing to subscribe for one-half of the issue. The
stock was off CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 7 1/8 on about 2.6m shares traded.
Bank of Montreal, CDollars  1/4 firmer at CDollars 45 3/4, reported higher
third-quarter and nine-month earnings.

FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French poll adds to
continental gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLL indicating that France could scupper the Maastricht Treaty added to
the gloom on continental bourses, writes our Markets Staff.
PARIS opened the new account slightly firmer, supported by an uptick in the
bond market. But trading became increasingly volatile following the release
of the first poll to show a majority of French voters, albeit a narrow 51
per cent, would reject the Maastricht Treaty.
The CAC-40 index fell as low as 1,640.94 before closing down 21.99 at
1,667.72 in turnover of FFr2.08bn. Polls published later in the day were
narrowly in favour of Maastricht.
Dealers said many blue chips were being swayed by the heavy arbitrage
between the cash and futures market. LVMH descended to FFr3,481 before
ending up FFr6 at FFr3,588 while UAP recovered from FFr330 to close FFr12.50
down at 344.40.
But they also witnessed genuine selling by fund managers wanting to lighten
their positions in France, especially in shares which looked vulnerable from
a technical point of view.
The biggest faller was Poliet which went limit down on its first trading day
in its new form, on news that Paribas had been left with 70 per cent of the
building materials company. The stock ended FFr35 or 11.9 per cent down at
FFr260 with just 6,625 shares traded.
Elf drew some comfort from its interim results, announced after the close on
Monday, losing FFr2.10 to FFr307.70.
FRANKFURT closed at its lowest level since February 1991 as the DAX index
shed 29.83 or 2 per cent to 1,468.91 after a midsession fall in the FAZ
index of 10.27 to 583.01. Turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3.9bn on Monday.
There was agreement among analysts that the market was locked into a
negative mood and was not responding to any good news. Linde, which reported
an increase in first half pre-tax profits after the close on Monday and
forecast improved full-year earnings, lost DM21 or 3 per cent to DM688.
Bayer's interim results, which were also better than anticipated, failed to
make a bigger impact: while its shares traded up DM1.90 in the pre bourse,
they closed down 10 pfg at DM255.70.
Other chemical stocks lost ground ahead of their results: Hoechst, reporting
today, shed DM3.80 to DM228 and BASF fell DM2.70 to DM211.20.
Metallgesellschaft saw one of the steepest falls of the day, down DM20.20 or
6.6 per cent to DM286.50, mainly due to the weak dollar.
MILAN fell further as the lira weakened and fears that smaller brokers were
in trouble persisted in the market. 'We are being attacked on all fronts,'
said one dealer. The Comit index fell 5.13 to 394.93 in turnover estimated
at L40bn after Monday's thin L38.2bn.
The mark was fixed at a new record high of L764.25 at the fixing, and the
Bank of Italy was forced to intervene in support of the lira.
ZURICH lost ground but was more resilient than other markets. The SMI index
fell 18.2 to 1,709.7 in moderate turnover.
Ciba-Geigy bearers managed a better day than most, falling SFr2 to SFr624 as
sentiment remained positive after last week's results.
AMSTERDAM resisted a steep fall with the CBS Tendency index losing 0.9 to
106.9. Dollar-sensitive stocks saw some of the steepest declines with
Unilever Fl 2.30 weaker at Fl 176.60, Akzo dropping Fl 1.30 to Fl 142.00 and
Elsevier shedding Fl 2.90 to Fl 104.10.
Pakhoed and Van Ommeren, the storage and transport groups, fell heavily
after reporting disappointing half-year figures. Pakhoed lost Fl 3.20 or 8.6
per cent to Fl 34.00 while Van Ommeren tumbled Fl 2.90 or 8.4 per cent to Fl
31.50.
KNP, the paper manufacturer, rose 30 cents to Fl 37.00 ahead of today's
first-half results. Another highlight was Hagemeyer, the trading group, up
Fl 4.00 or 3 per cent at Fl 129.50 on a 25 per cent increase in earnings for
the first six months.
STOCKHOLM continued to slide as domestic interest rates kept climbing. The
Affarsvarlden General index fell 17.9 or 2.4 per cent to 732.3 in moderate
turnover of SKr483m.
Astra's stronger-than-expected half-year results came too late to support
its shares. The B shares dropped SKr13 to SKr484.
OSLO fell on uncertainty over the fate of Uni Storebrand and high Norwegian
interest rates. The all-share index closed 5.16 lower at 300.04 in turnover
of some NKr285m.
HELSINKI was burdened by falling forestry shares. The sector's index fell
8.3 per cent on a pessimistic forecast for the industry while the HEX index
lost 4.5 per cent to a new low of 579.8.
BRUSSELS's Bel-20 index lost 16.70 or 1.5 per cent to 1,068.42 in turnover
of BFr1.1bn. Electrabel gained BFr20 to BFr4,810.
MADRID's general index fell 1.94 to 205.66 in turnover estimated at a low
Pta5.6bn. Vallehermoso, the property group, lost a further Pta50 or 5.5 per
cent to Pta850, after touching an intraday year's low of Pta811.

five-day winning streak

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average declined for the first time in five trading days on
profit-taking and short selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average, which had rallied more than 2,300 points during the
past four days, lost 247.19 at 16,380.77, after registering a day's high of
16,823.67 and low of 16,322.26.
Volume contracted to 400m shares from Monday's 570m, while declines led
advances by 561 to 358, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks slipped 18.25 to 1,276.84, and in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 1.93 to 1,041.98.
Traders said some investors were becoming wary of the sharp rise in the
index, and had refrained from further buying.
Domestic institutional investors were seen purchasing in small lots, while
some short-sellers were covering positions. 'There may be more buying to be
seen since only about 30 to 40 per cent of the short positions seem to have
been covered,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Comments by government officials failed to encourage sentiment. Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the finance minister, denied the possibility of the creation of a
joint stock purchasing entity, as proposed by a business federation.
Remarks by officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and cabinet
members also seemed to suggest that the authorities were at odds over the
issue of government bonds to provide additional funding to boost the
economy.
Green Cross, a medium-sized pharmaceutical company, was the most active
issue of the day, climbing by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,280. The stock
has gained for five consecutive days on reports that its anti-Aids drug will
enter clinical trials in the US.
Banks retreated on profit-taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank shed Y80 to Y1,660
and Mitsubishi Bank Y180 to Y2,000. Credit ratings of both banks were
lowered yesterday by Moody's Investor Services.
Nippon Housing Loan added Y75 at Y476, although other property-related
stocks declined, with Mitsui Fudosan losing Y20 to Y979 and Mitsubishi
Estate Y22 to Y925.
High-technology issues saw profit-taking, Hitachi weakening Y16 to Y803 and
Fujitsu Y14 to Y583. Victor dropped Y73 to Y751 on reports that the company
would lower its forecasts for the year.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 175.64 to 18,043.52 in volume of
20.6m shares.
Roundup
THE weaker dollar and Wall Street's fall unsettled the region's markets
yesterday.
HONG KONG declined in late trading as European institutions sold blue chips.
The Hang Seng index dipped 99.44, or 1.8 per cent, to 5,291.49 in turnover
of HKDollars 2.6bn.
HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 47.75 on continued fears that
it may announce a provision to cover its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the
troubled property group.
Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 49 on news that forged
share certificates had been seized in the US.
SEOUL advanced for the third consecutive session, the composite index
appreciating 10.77 to 494.50. The Securities Stabilisation Fund again
intervened, buying Won5bn worth of equities.
MANILA was upset by weakness in Philippine National Bank, which lost 12.50
pesos to 272.50 pesos as investors continued to react negatively to the
government's appointment of a new board of directors. The composite index
closed 15.26 down at 1,440.45 in combined turnover of 188.6m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR was disrupted by a computer failure during the last hour of
trading and the composite index provisionally finished 4.29 lower at 561.27.
Telekom, which was expected to release disappointing interim earnings after
the close, was 60 cents weaker at MDollars 12.90 just before the computer
malfunction.
TAIWAN's weighted index receded 34.30 to 3,816.38, while turnover increased
to TDollars 21.8bn from TDollars 19.2bn.
BANGKOK concentrated on speculative stocks as the SET index declined 2.35 to
754.48 in low turnover of Bt7bn.
NEW ZEALAND saw lacklustre trading and the NZSE-40 capital index finished
3.98 easier at 1,476.26 in turnover of some NZDollars 11.1m.

FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Australian budget gives cold comfort to
equities - A weak economic recovery and international trade fears have
depressed sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a budget-led rally in Australian shares have been disappointed this
week as the Australian Stock Exchange All Ordinaries Index once again
slipped back towards 1,500.
For investors, it was a disappointing response to the Labor government's
ninth budget, delivered on August 18, which outlined plans to pump an
ADollars 4.6bn (USDollars 3.3bn) stimulus into the economy over the next two
years.
Instead of rising on the news, the All Ordinaries fell from 1,549 ruling
immediately before the announcement to a 14-month low of 1,517.3 by last
night, suggesting the proposed spending was fully reflected in pre-budget
share prices.
The nervousness in the market reflects concern over Australia's weak
recovery from recession, together with the effects of bad economic news in
the US, the UK and Japan, which tend to set the tone for the Australian
market.
Sentiment has also been depressed by the apparently increasing risk of
failure in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt), which could seriously damage Australia's important rural industries.
These factors have combined to cut short three promising rallies over the
last 12 months, culminating in the last peak in May, when the All Ordinaries
climbed to within a few points of the psychologically important 1,700
barrier.
Many brokers continue to believe that substantial upside potential exists in
the market, given that the index remains some 34 per cent below its high of
2,300, reached just before the global stock markets crash in October 1987.
However, much will depend on the current results season, when investors will
be looking for signs of an end to the recessionary squeeze on profits which
caused a flood of red ink in the previous two results periods.
Early indications have been encouraging. Mining companies such as Placer
Pacific and Newcrest have reported improved earnings, Alcan Australia, the
aluminium group, said it had reduced losses, and Coca-Cola Amatil, the soft
drinks and food manufacturer, raised net profits by a solid 19 per cent.
Most attention, however, will be on the results of bigger companies which
suffered reverses at this stage last year. These include Brambles and TNT,
the transport groups, CRA, Western Mining and other miners, Broken Hill
Proprietary, the mining, energy and steel group, Pacific Dunlop, the
diversified industrial concern, CSR, the sugar and building products group,
Burns Philp, the diversified food producer and trader, and Foster's, the
world's fourth largest brewer.
In particular, the market will be looking closely at the results of the four
quoted banks, all of which reported lower profits last year. Investors will
be hoping for signs of an end to the series of property writedowns which
have dogged the banks since 1990.
Over the longer term, the market will be watching for evidence that the
substantial stimulus administered to the economy by the government is
helping to expand the economy in line with the relatively conservative
budget forecast of 3 per cent over the 12 months to next July.
Growth in gross domestic product was a disappointing 0.6 per cent in the
three months to the end of March, but most of the indicators are now
pointing in the right direction, and most economists believe that activity
picked up further in the quarter to the end of June.
The rural sector will also benefit from the continued decline of the
Australian dollar, which fell to nearly 70 US cents earlier this week before
being pushed back above 71 cents by intervention from the Reserve Bank of
Australia.
Nevertheless, confidence remains in short supply, and is likely to be
further weakened if the All Ordinaries Index slips below 1,500 in the coming
weeks. As in most of the previous 12 months, Australia remains a market for
the brave.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Papua New Guinea gold mine to
reopen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TROUBLED alluvial gold mine at Mount Kare in Papua New Guinea is to
reopen following the completeion of a deal between CRA, the majority
shareholder, and Placer Pacific, operator of the nearby Porgera mine.
Mount Kare, located in PNG's rugged highlands, was closed in January after
an attack by gunmen who destroyed equipment and caused damage estimated at
more than USDollars 1m.
Placer Pacific said that Placer Niugini, its Papua New Guinean subsidiary,
would operate the Mount Kare mine on behalf of CRA, which owns 51 per cent
of the alluvial rights, and local landowners, who own 49 per cent. CRA will
lend about Dollars 1.5m to finance the recommencement of mining, it added.
The deal replaces an earlier agreement under which CRA planned to sell all
but 12.75 per cent of the alluvial rights and 25 per cent of its hard rock
prospecting rights in the surrounding area.
Placer said that the first gold from the reopened mine would be produced in
early September. It expected Placer to take about three months to bring the
mine back to full production.
Mt Kare is capable of producing up to 25,000 troy ounces of gold a year from
alluvial mining, compared with more than 1m ounces a year at Porgera, one of
Papua New Guinea's biggest mines.
The Australian government yesterday cleared the way for development to go
ahead at an ADollars 290m (Pounds 104m) zinc, lead and silver mine planned
by MIM at Macarthur River in the Northern Territory.
The Macarthur River scheme is the first major project to be processed
through a fast-track approval procedure introduced by the government earlier
this year to shorten the lead time between the discovery and development of
mineral deposits.
Mr Laurie Brereton, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, said the
mine had been approved on the recommendation of the Foreign Investment
Review Board, following a review of proposed participation by four Japanese
companies.
Mr Brereton said that the approval represented a 'showpiece for what the new
facilitation arrangements are all about'. The government also said that it
would fast-track proposals put forward by Zapotan for a gold mine at Mount
Todd in the Northern Territory.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian output forecast to
fall by 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S GOLD production will fall by about 8 per cent this year from the
record level in 1991, the first drop in output for six years, suggests
Metals Economics Group, the Halifax, Nova Scotia-based think-tank.
It says production reached 4.981m troy ounces last year, very slightly ahead
of the 4.957m ounces in 1990. Canada's gold output had previously been
rising very strongly since 1985, at which time it was only 2.1m ounces.
The number of Canadian gold mines fell from 73 in 1990 to 70 last year and
MEG says the total will be down to 55 this year.
The most productive three mines are all in the Hemlo area of Ontario:
International Corona/Teck's Williams mine (518,703 ounces); Hemlo's Golden
Giant (443,438 ounces); and Teck/International Corona's David Bell (283,128
ounces).
Together they contributed about 25 per cent of 1991 Canadian production but
their total output fell by about 100,000 ounces from 1990. MEG estimates
that production from these three mines will fall by another 100,000 ounces
this year.
Ontario produced 2.4m ounces of gold last year, down from 2.6m ounces and
its output is forecast to be 2.3m this year. Quebec, Canada's second-largest
producer, saw production up from 1.25m ounces to 1.46m ounces last year but
it is predicted to slip to 1.4m in 1992.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US tariff deal revives Mexican
sugar hopes - An effective common market should give a tremendous boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO AND the US have agreed to form an effective common market in the
sugar sector, which should be a tremendous boost to Mexico's ailing sugar
sector but worrying news for present exporters to the US.
The as yet undisclosed policy change forms part of the completed text of the
North American Free trade Agreement, which negotiators have concluded but
still has to be approved by the US congress. The US has agreed to allow
Mexico unlimited access to its sugar market after 15 years; Mexico in return
has promised to set the same tariff on sugar imports as the US by the sixth
year.
While Mexico has made no explicit commitment to co-ordinate its tariff-free
quotas of sugar imports with the US, the spirit of the agreement is that
sugar producers in Mexico will face same prices as in the US. Mexico will
manage quotas to ensure this happens smoothly, says one official involved in
the negotiations. The only debate in Mexico is whether prices should be
encouraged to converge in the first or sixth year.
In the US raw sugar sells for 21 to 22 cents a lb, compared with 17 to 18
cents in Mexico.
Under the terms of Nafta Mexico is promised its current quota of 7,258
tonnes in the first six years, or 25,000 tonnes if it is a net exporter in
two successive years. In the seventh year the quota is increased to 150,000
tonnes, to increase by 10 per cent annually until the 15th year, when all
controls are to be eliminated. If Mexico is a net exporter for two
successive years after the seventh year, the quota is removed. The tariff
quota of 16 cents a lb is reduced by 15 per cent over the first six years,
and then to zero over the next nine.
Mr Julio Escandon of the consultancy Eximco, who represented the Mexican
sugar private sector in the negotiations, says that by raising domestic
sugar prices, Nafta will encourage Mexico to become a net sugar exporter
once again.
Next year he expects sugar production to be 3.7m tonnes, compared with
consumption in 1992 of 4.2m tonnes. But, he says, with US prices, Mexico
could be producing 4.5m tonnes a year within three years.
The relatively liberal - sugar producers say anarchic - import policy of the
Mexican government explains part, although not all, of the dire situation of
the sugar producers and the recent decline in production. The Mexican
government and sugar traders imported about 2.6m tonnes in 1990 and 1991,
while the domestic sugar deficit was just 1.2m tonnes over the same period.
Mr Jose Pinto, who manages four sugar mills, shares Mr Escandon's optimism,
describing Nafta as 'an opportunity for Mexico to be a large producer of
sugar in the medium term, if domestic sugar policy is correct.'
Higher sugar prices will let Mexico's sugar mill owners earn profits to
invest in upgrading technology, and encourage farmers to turn land over to
sugar cane production. The stability and security offered by Nafta will
encourage long-term investment hitherto put off by uncertainty and the
gyrations of government policy over past years.
Mexico relies exclusively on sugar-cane rather than sugar beet, has a
perfect tropical climate in parts and wages about a tenth of those in the US
 -all of which makes it a much more efficient producer of sugar than its
highly protected northern neighbour. In ten years Mr Pinto reckons Mexico's
production could be 6m tonnes.
Mexico was a net sugar exporter from 1954 to 1975, and from 1985 to 1988.
But in 1989 the government began to privatise the sugar mills, almost all of
which it owned, and simultaneously to dismantle the protection offered to
the heavily-undercapitalised industry. On top of that, two corrupt officials
in the government sugar agency imported massive amounts of sugar and, by
fiddling the invoices, walked off with a small fortune. A warrant has been
issued for their arrest but they are still at large.
The result has been huge losses among sugar mill owners - one reason why the
Mexican government was so quick to embrace the protectionist terms of the
Nafta text on sugar.
If the industry recovers to become a net exporter the first to suffer will
be other countries that export to the US. At present the US imports about
1.5m tonnes of its sugar, but were Mexico to fill this gap the quota offered
to other countries would have to fall. For political reasons the US would
probably spare the Caribbean from cuts, but more distant producers might
lose out.
In the longer term, US sugar producers could also suffer. If Mexico becomes
a net exporter sugar prices in the US are likely to fall as North American
production outstrips demand. In this case the marginal producers in the
North American market, that is the inefficient US mills, would have to
close.

taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STAVANGER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH CARBON taxes to protect the environment were called for yesterday by
the Norwegian prime minister.
'They may not be popular, but they are necessary,' Mrs Gro Harlem Bruntland
told the biennial Offshore Northern Seas oil and gas conference in
Stavanger.
Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are responsible
for the so-called greenhouse effect, which scientists say causes global
warming and threatens the flooding of coastal areas.
Norway, which produces more than 2m barrels of oil per day, has responded to
this threat by introducing carbon taxes which have made its petrol among the
dearest in the world. But other oil producing countries have claimed such
taxes only contribute to the state revenues of rich, oil-consuming countries
while reducing the earnings of developing countries dependent on oil
exports.
Environmental legislation was one of the imponderables that Mr David Simon,
BP group chief executive and deputy chairman, told the conference were
threatening further destabilisation of the oil sector. Others were
dissatisfaction within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
with the current quota system and a desire among those countries to expand
downstream operations and to reintegrate production and distribution.
The oil industry would be forced to respond to new instability and change in
order to restore profitability so as to attract fresh capital from
investors, he said. It would have to find ways of absorbing operations costs
and expanding profit margins to justify continued investment.

Currency factors were still the main influence on BASE METAL trading on the
LME. However there were signs that the cheapness of the metals in European
and Far East local currency terms (because of the dollar's weakness) was
attracting some consumer interest. This underpinned most of the metals when
they staged an opening dip and saw them gradually advance over the day,
although copper fell back in the last few minutes of trading. The rises
triggered dealer short covering and some speculative interest although
investors were still wary of any sudden currency fluctuation. Three-month
TIN maintained its midday break through previous resistance above Dollars
6,850 a tonne, at one stage reaching Dollars 6,915. GOLD encountered
resistance in the Dollars 342 area as the dollar slid on news that a French
opinion poll on Maastricht showed the No vote at 51 per cent and the Yes at
49 per cent. Dealers said gold would have to push though Dollars 342.80 a
troy ounce in order to trigger short covering by US funds. There was some
concern that the Australian central bank might fail to defend its currency,
triggering forward gold sales by local mines attempting to lock in higher
prices.

FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia set to climb copper
output league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA WILL be catapulted into third place among the western world copper
producers by a USDollars 545m scheme to boost annual output at the
Ertzberg-Grasberg mines in the highlands of Irian Jaya to 1bn lb or 454,000
tonnes.
Not only will the mines produce more than 6 per cent of the world's mined
copper requirements, the project will also place Freeport McMoRan Copper and
Gold, which owns them, among the very few companies with gold output above
1m troy ounces a year. The expansion will boost gold production to between
1.2m and 1.5m troy ounces.
Freeport said yesterday the project would be completed by the middle of 1996
and, as its cash reserves would be about Dollars 400m by the end of this
year, it would mainly be financed from its own resources.
The Ertzberg-Grasberg mines have been under constant expansion since 1989. A
Dollars 504m scheme which lifted ore processed from 20,000 to 57,000 tonnes
a day had scarcely been completed before a further expansion to 66,000
tonnes was announced. The Indonesian company, which is 74.2 per cent owned
by Freeport McMoRan, the New Orleans-based natural resources group, said
yesterday that the expansion to 66,000 tonnes should be completed in the
second half of 1993 at a cost of Dollars 90m.
The cost of the proposed expansion to 90,000 tonnes of ore a day does not
not include about Dollars 175m for infrastructure work because Freeport
expects to sell some of the houses and shops to be included.
Mr George Mealey, president of Freeport Copper, said that based on present
reserves, the mines would have a 23-year life at a 90,000 tonnes-a-day rate.
However, an aggressive exploration programme is continuing and the company
expected to find much more copper and gold nearby.
The expansion programme still has to be approved by the Indonesian
government and is subject to an environmental impact assessment. However, if
it is completed, it will put Indonesia ahead of Zambia, which mined about
423,000 tonnes of copper last year, as the world's third-largest producer
(but still well behind Chile, 1.8m tonnes, and the US, 1.7m tonnes).

FT  26 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Drought decimates Romanian
harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORST drought since 1947 has hit key Romanian agricultural areas,
threatening a shortfall of 2.5m tonnes of wheat. The government believes it
can ensure supplies only until the end of January.
Mr Petre Marculescu, the minister of agriculture has refused to disclose
crop estimates, but admits that 38 per cent of the maize crop has already
been affected and has declared crop calamities in Constanta and Tulcea, two
of the country's most fertile counties.
The drought could hardly come at a worse time. With Romanian agriculture
severely dislocated by the transition to a market economy and plantings of
barley and wheat well down on last year, Romania was already set to import
record amounts of grain. By the end of June, the country, which prior to
communist rule was one of Europe's richest agricultural nations, had already
imported 1.16m tonnes of wheat.
Bread shortages are already evident. In four counties in the north and west,
rationing has begun, while in many regional towns long queues have developed
outside private shops despite prices three or four times higher than in the
state sector.
The shortages, coupled with rising unemployment, are adding to growing
tension ahead of next month's general election, causing the government to
rethink a second round of subsidy cuts on basic foods and electricity agreed
with the International Monetary Fund as part of the country's economic
reforms and due on September 1
With an austerity budget in place and currency reserves low the country is
likely to have major difficulties paying for additional food imports through
the winter months.
A month-long drought has seriously affected 11m hectares (27m acres) of
crops in South China and reduced drinking water supplies for 20m people, the
official Farmers Daily said.
Rainfall in parts of South China is as much as 90 per cent below normal, it
said.
The drought extends through almost every one of the country's major grain
producers, affecting even Sichuan and Guizhou in the south-west. The daily
said there was some hope of a little rain in part of the affected area in

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Time to shine as an individual - The
'unbundling' of the electricity shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE next two weeks, Pounds 1.4bn worth of shares in the 12 regional
electricity companies will be under review as institutional investors
consider how best to 'unbundle' their package of shares, which ceases to
trade on the Stock Exchange on September 4.
The move will mark a shake-up in the market for electricity shares as the
institutions, which up to now have not had to focus on individual
performances to a great degree, are forced to consider the fundamentals of
the different Recs and decide which stocks they wish to be in.
The package was the government's method of allowing institutions to invest
in the electricity flotation in December 1990, through holding just one
stock, while also giving the sector an initial boost of liquidity. Only
retail investors were allowed to buy individual Rec shares at the flotation.
Each package consists of 1,000 shares, drawn from the 12 Recs and weighted
in terms of each of the companies' market capitalisation on the day of
flotation. Institutions liked the package - 44 per cent of shares were
apportioned this way - because it gave them a spread of investments in an
homogenous industry where detailed financial information was limited and
while holding just one unit.
Unbundling of the package had gathered pace over the last 6 months as the
deadline has approached and fund managers have begun to gather more
information about individual Recs. However, with over 16 per cent of Rec
shares still contained in package form, the next fortnight will see active
trading in the sector.
Institutions have two alternatives. The first, and most popular, is to sell
the packages to brokers operating a buy-back scheme. They then break up the
package and sell the institutions an equivalent value of shares in
individual Recs. This has the commercial advantage that the investor will
receive a slightly better price from selling the package as a whole than
from selling the shares of the individual Recs separately.
The other route for package holders is that after the September 4 cut-off
date, the certificate ceases to trade and 11 days later becomes worthless.
The registrar will then forward individual certificates for the 12
companies' shares to the holder. Few institutions are likely to follow this
route, simply because their funds are based on monitoring a limited number
of investments.
The performance of individual Rec shares against the package price over the
last 6 months gives some indication of which companies the institutions are
favouring.
Norweb appears to have benefited most from the package unbundling. This
appears to have not so much to do with the financial performances of the
company than the perceived positive view among institutions over its
management and strategy. Partly because of the institutional interest, the
company has the lowest historic yield - 5.4 per cent against the package's
5.8 per cent - among the Recs.
'The amount of attention paid to financial detail by fund managers is
surprisingly small,' says Mr Chris Rowland at BZW. 'So other issues, like
management style and strategy, are becoming important.' For the same
reasons, unbundling has not favoured Manweb, Eastern and London, where
worries about diversification into generation and retailing among others
have made fund managers nervous.
However, different companies are attracting different types of funds. For
example, unit trust funds wanting short-term income are migrating towards
high yielding stocks such as Northern and East Midland. Other fund managers
are worried about liquidity and will only consider the more liquid, ie
larger stocks, such as Eastern, London and Yorkshire.
Mr Rowland believes that the biggest single investment issue facing fund
managers is how individual companies will fare from the 1994 regulatory
review which will be the first of significance since privatisation.
It will set new values for 'x', which is an important component of the Recs'
pricing structures. 'Companies with a high rate of return could be penalised
with a tighter x factor. It will also mean that they will need high dividend
cover.'
He is advising clients to look at companies with lower returns and good
cover such as London, Seeboard and South West. However, Mr Tim Anker at
Smith New Court rates Southern, Midland and Norweb, arguing that the quality
of management together with their positions in relation to regulation mark
them out as potential outperformers.

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Dissidents seek to oust Simpsons board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of disaffected shareholders in Simpsons of Cornhill, owners of the
famous City eating house, yesterday announced plans to oust the board at an
extraordinary meeting.
The dissidents, led by Mr Robert Klapp - former chairman of Select
Appointments - want to take control of the company amid claims that its
existing directors have missed investment opportunities in the restaurant
trade.
Moves to replace the Nottingham-based management team were announced ahead
of a separate EGM tomorrow where shareholders will vote on resolutions
calling for the appointment of two directors from the dissident group.
Mr Klapp's group claims the board at Simpsons, which also owns the Jamaica
Inn and the Dell'Ugo and Palio restaurants, is out of touch with tough
trading conditions in the London catering trade.
The dissidents hope to force a second EGM following recent share
transactions which could leave them short of the majority stake necessary to
force through their resolutions.
Up to 40 per cent of the shares are thought to be controlled by the rebel
group, but it is unclear whether they can rely on a 10 per cent stake
purchased last week by Mountjoy, an offshore company registered in the Turk
and Caicos Islands.
Mr Paul Reece, managing director of Simpsons, yesterday claimed that Mr
Klapp had sold 50 per cent of his shares to Mountjoy, diluting the
dissidents' chances of success.
'A second EGM would be a waste of the company's time,' he added. 'These
people have no experience of our industry.'
The dissident group, however, said: 'We are hopeful of further support from
recent share buyers who are not currently on the share register.
'We will be writing to all shareholders in the next few days to let them
know of our plans.'

FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Porth loss at Pounds 1.84m in unseasonal
half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Porth Group, the USM-quoted Christmas decorations manufacturer, reported a
deficit of Pounds 1.84m pre-tax in its seasonally unfavourable half year to
June 30.
The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 1.82m at the same stage of
1991, was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 292,000 (Pounds
105,000) to cover restructuring costs.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 2.76m (Pounds 2.47m). Interest payable,
reflecting the proceeds of last year's rights issue, fell to Pounds 180,000
(Pounds 423,000).
Losses per share were reduced to 9.6p (20.76p).

<TEXT>
Sumit, which provides development and venture capital to unquoted companies,
announced a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 111,000 to Pounds
33,000 in the half year to June 30.
Net asset value per share at June 30 amounted to 92p (115p) or 97p (114p)
fully diluted.
After-tax profits declined to Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 77,000) for earnings per
share of 0.3p (1.1p) and again there is no interim dividend.
Mr Simon Sharp, chairman, said shareholders were aware of the change in
ownership of the manager, Sumit Equity Ventures, and he believed the
affiliation with Schroder Venture Advisers would enhance the quality of the
dealflow.

</HEADLINE>

DC Cook Holdings, the USM-quoted operator of car dealerships and petrol
stations, returned to the black in the year to April 30 with pre-tax profits
of Pounds 121,000 compared with losses of Pounds 1.48m.
There were profits of Pounds 107,000 at the halfway stage.
The result was achieved on turnover of Pounds 108m (Pounds 123m) and was
after an exceptional Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 607,000) charge and interest
payments of Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 3.02m).
Mr Derek Cook, chairman, said the UK property division produced
'particularly disappointing' results while the motor division exceeded
expectations with a substantial increase in operating profits.
The performance of Norfolk Espana, the group's Spanish roadside property
development company, was better than expected and contributed Pounds 865,000
to operating prof-its.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.08p (0.43p losses) basic and 1.11p (0.15p)
fully diluted. A final dividend of 0.3p is proposed for a total of 0.5p
(1p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With no improvement in trading conditions through the second six months,
Darby Group, a USM-quoted maker of specialist glass products, suffered a
fall in profits from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 285,000 pre-tax for the year to
February 28.
Earnings declined to 2.51p (9.31p) and a reduced final dividend of 0.8p
(2.1p) cuts the total by 1.3p to 2p.
Certain expenses deferred at the half way stage associated with Darby
(France) were not considered appropriate, given continued difficulties in
the French market, and were charged against profits for the full year.
Directors said the charge was the main reason that full year profits were
lower than the Pounds 406,000 announced at mid-year.
Helped by acquisitions, sales for 1991-92 rose from Pounds 15.12m to Pounds
17.87m. Interest charges accounted for Pounds 797,000 (Pounds 249,000).

Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, who arranged intensive

Turkish-Cypriots want more than 29 per cent of the island in a federated
state that would have political equality with a Greek-Cypriot federated
state in a single sovereign, secular Cyprus republic.

Russia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN wheat shipments to Russia will resume shortly, the Canadian Wheat
Board says, after assurances of payment by the Russians.
The board halted shipments a week ago, saying Russia had exceeded a CDollars
1.5bn (650m) Canadian line of credit by CDollars 100m.
Now the board says a 'modest' interim payment has been received and the
Russians have provided a plan to deal with payment arrears. Russia is in the
first year of a five year contract to buy 25m tonnes of Canadian wheat worth
CDollars 3.5bn at current prices.
Statistics Canada says Canadian farmers planted much more wheat this year
but the harvest will be far from a record. Because of cool wet weather
output is estimated at 29.9m tonnes for 1992, down 6 per cent from 1991.
Oats production will be up sharply and barley down. The estimates are in
line with those of the private United Grain Growers as of the end of July.
The grain harvest of the Commonwealth of Independent States will rise to
175m tonnes in 1992, from 154.7m in 1991, the Interfax news agency said,
citing figures from the CIS statistics office, reports Reuter from Moscow.
On Friday, President Boris Yeltsin said Russia's grain harvest was forecast
at 103m tonnes in 1992, after 89.1m tonnes in 1991.
'US experts say the harvest will be 98m tonnes, we say it will be 103m,' Mr
Yeltsin told a news conference. Previous forecasts have put the 1992 Russian
harvest at about 98m tonnes although some predictions put it as low as 93m.
Drought has cut yields sharply in many parts of Russia.
Ukraine officials recently forecast a total grain harvest of 43m tonnes, 5m
more than last year.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk trade fails to agree
manufacturing price scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK MILK Marketing Board and the Dairy Trade Federation have failed to
agree on a new way of pricing milk for manufacturing.
The scheme, which was endorsed by both the Agriculture Ministry and the EC,
aimed to end the much criticised system under which the MMB sets 24
different price levels according how the milk is used. The new system - due
to be introduced next Tuesday  - had already been delayed earlier this year.
'New Ways of Buying Milk', as the scheme was known, would have priced milk
for manufacturing according to its supply profile, with a premium being
charged for regular deliveries. However, defying the laws of economics, the
higher prices were set under the scheme the greater the demand for milk
would have been.
The MMB said that at one price level annual demand would have exceeded
supply by over 1bn litres, or 22 per cent. This was partly because the UK is
not self-sufficient in milk and production is restricted by EC milk quotas.
But the DTF said its members would demand more milk at higher prices in
order to reduce their unit costs when making dairy products.
The National Farmer's Union said yesterday it was very disappointed that the
MMB scheme was not going forward. 'New Ways' would have led to better prices
for dairy farmers, but with a return to the end-use system the prospects of
better returns had diminished.
The MMB, which is planning to turn itself into a voluntary co-operative by

FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea faces crisis after
Russian withdrawal

THE INDIAN tea industry is facing a crisis following the disappearance of
Russian buyers from the country's tea auction centres. The withdrawal has
been caused by the Russians exhausting the technical credit of Dollars 32m
extended by the Indian federal government earlier this year.
'Without the Russians the bottom will soon be falling out of the Indian tea
market,' said Mr HP Barooah, chairman of Indian Tea Association. Under the
trade protocol, Russia is supposed to buy 65m kg of Indian tea in the
current year but so far it has bought only 16m kg.
Russia will need another at least Dollars 100m worth of technical credits to
procure the remaining amount and the beleaguered Indian industry has made a
representation to the federal government for an immediate release of Dollars
20m so that its buyers can return to the auctions.
Mr Hiteswar Saikia, chief minister of the largest tea growing state of
Assam, is reported to have urged Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance
minister, to come to the rescue of the tea industry by giving Russia further
technical credits, but New Delhi is unrelenting. It has made it clear that
further release of technical credit will have to await Russia giving oil and
petroleum lubricants to India as part of the barter arrangement.
Mr Barooah said the setback to tea exports had already forced gardens in
south India, Cachar, Terai and Dooars to sell tea at below the cost of
production. The same would soon be happening to the Assam gardens, he added.
In view of the severe resource constraint, the Russians, who in the past
used to buy medium and superior grades of teas, have this year been
purchasing lower value teas, said Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the
brokers.
The tea association set an export target of 188m kg for the current year on
the assumption that Russia would lift the agreed quantity of 65m kg and the
other constituents of CIS would import about 10m kg.
While there is great uncertainty about export to Russia, India hopes to be
able to step up tea sales elsewhere, in Iran, Poland and Egypt, for example.
But these markets, according to Mr Barooah, are no substitute for Russia in
the short term. Last year, India exported 104.5m kg of tea to the Soviet
Union, more than 80 per cent of that going to Russia.
According to Mr Barooah, even though India will be harvesting a lower crop
of about 715m kg in 1992, compared with 742m kg last year, the industry will
not find it easy to dispose of the crop because of the poor Russian buying.
In the long run, however, there remains immense scope for stepping up
domestic consumption of tea. Annual consumption of tea in India is about 600
grammes a head, compared with about 3 kg in the UK.
Sri Lankan tea production fell by 41.4m kg in the first half of this year,
nearly 50 per cent of the world crop reduction, writes Mervyn de Silva in
Colombo. World production in the January-June period fell by 86m kg, says
Forbes and Walker, a leading local broker.
Production in India and Kenya, Sri Lanka's main competitors also dropped, by
23.4m kg and 12.5m kg respectively, but Sri Lanka's fall of just over 20 per
cent is the highest of all major producers.
Only Bangladesh and Tanzania registered increases in the period.
'The prolonged drought hit our tea industry hard,' said a plantation
ministry official. While production has dropped, prices have improved,
however.
'The slump and more especially, the Russian demand have influenced prices,'
said a leading Colombo broker, who pointed out that 'each time the Russians
were present at auctions in the past three months, our tea fetched better
prices'.

PHELPS DODGE of the US and Sumitomo Metal Mining of Japan were late
yesterday signing a Dollars 1.5bn contract to develop one of the biggest
mining projects of Chile's recent history: the Candelaria copper and gold
deposit in the Atacama desert.
Mr Douglas Yearley, Phelps Dodge's executive president, and his counterpart,
Mr Akihiko Shinozaki of Sumitomo Metal Mining, were in Santiago yesterday to
sign the foreign investment contract with the government of Chile.
The Candelaria deposit was discovered by Phelps Dodge in 1987, and Sumitomo
has taken a 20 per cent stake in the project. It has proven reserves of 400m
tonnes, with an average ore grade of 1.1 per cent copper and 0.26 grams per
tonne of gold. The reserves are expected to last for 34 years.
Phelps Dodge and Sumitomo plan to invest an initial Dollars 500m to strip
the mine and build a concentrator plant. Candelaria will enter production in
1995 with an output of 400,000 tonnes of copper concentrates (a semi-refined
product containing about 30 per cent copper) and 80,000 ounces of gold a
year.
The foreign investment contract of Dollars 1.5bn is expected to cover the
34-year life of the mine.
Mr Tom Foster, Phelps Dodge's vice-president, said the company was
finalising the financial package for Candelaria. Japanese copper smelters
will be putting up some of the money in exchange for supply contracts on
Candelaria's future production; Japan's Export-Import Bank is arranging
project financing, and Phelps Dodge and Sumitomo will complete the package
with their own capital.
Candelaria is the second major copper mine to be developed by foreign
investors after Escondida, the giant deposit owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ
and a group of Japanese smelters led by Mitsubishi.

The dollar's plunge to successive lows against the D-mark pushed GOLD higher
on the London bullion market, but the gains were limited by reported
producer selling on Comex and the sharp losses over the past two weeks. Some
short covering emerged after a large early buying order in Europe, but
dealers said gold's attraction as a safe haven from the collapsing dollar
was dented by the recent sell-off by US funds, and capital was mainly moving
to the Swiss franc.  The turmoil in the currency markets kept BASE METAL
trading on the LME quiet as traders tried to keep their exposure to a
minimum. 'Investors won't commit themselves while there is the danger a
sudden currency move will wipe out a profit or trigger a stop loss order
within seconds,' one trader said. Overall dollar metal prices moved higher
and sterling quotations eased. New York COTTON futures remained sharply up
at midday amid concerns of unfavourable weather for the Delta from Hurricane
Andrew which is heading toward the Gulf of Mexico. Fears that the hurricane
might damage Louisiana and Florida SUGAR prices kept the New York futures
market firm.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon market back in the pink
 -Norway's clearance sale has restored balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR farmed salmon is set to outstrip supply, according to Mr Ingo
Skulason, managing director of Aquastar Norway, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BP Nutrition.
Aquastar last year was enlisted by a consortium of Norwegian banks to
dispose of a 37,500-tonne mountain of frozen salmon, representing a fifth of
Norway's annual production, following last November's bankruptcy of the
Norwegian fish farmers' sales organisation. Norway's salmon farmers produce
about half of total Atlantic salmon supplies. The salmon mountain was
amassed as a result overproduction and led to a world glut and a plunge in
prices. Mr Skulason said recently that all but 2,000 tonnes had been sold
outside the European Community at a prices between NKr20 and NKr40 (Pounds
1.80 and Pounds 3.60) a kilogram, yielding gross sales of an estimated
Pounds 100m.
'With the exception of December, when sales were made at about NKr20 a
kilogram, the project has been a success,' he said. 'The situation demanded
disposal of the stock in a controlled way outside EC markets. It was crucial
to avoid dumping charges, stabilise the market and reduce the turbulence
surrounding the matter,' Aquastar explained. The idea was that Aquastar
could make use of BP Nutrition's international trading network to market the
salmon in a way that avoided violation of Norway's trade policy.
To handle the project, Aquastar established a separate unit as a limited
liability company in Stavanger, of which Mr Skulason, head of Aquastar
Europe, was appointed managing director.
It was also in Aquastar's interest to undertake the task in such a way as to
provide a basis for profitability, stability and growth of the European fish
farming industry. More than 30 countries in eastern Europe and the Far East
purchased the salmon, which was sold at prices far above earlier
expectations.
'We believe we have succeeded in this big challenge because we had to sell
the frozen salmon during low season when prices are normally weaker and we
were prohibited from selling in the EC,' Mr Skulason said. He explained that
because of the success of the operation, the Norwegian government would be
able to recoup a NKr400m non-interest bearing loan provided through the
consortium of banks to establish the marketing enterprise. Bank losses would
also be minimised.
According to Mr Skulason, however, demand for farmed salmon will outstrip
supply by the end of this year despite a rise in prices, which have averaged
between NKr48 and NKr50 a kilogram in recent weeks, compared with NKr30 to
NKr35 in April and May. He forecast a worldwide deficit of some 30,000
tonnes in 1992, growing to to about 51,000 tonnes in 1993. Mr Skulason bases
his projections on a number of factors including 'market psychology'.
'The market knows that nearly all of the frozen salmon mountain has been
sold, so there is no reason for further speculation about the mountain and
its possible affect on market prices, and there are long production lead
times preventing farmers from rapidly increasing supply,' he explained.
He added that because of the operation's success, stability had been created
in the market, fuelling optimism about its future development.
In recent years, demand for farmed salmon has increased by 20 to 30 per cent
annually, but production exceeded demand. However, with emergence of new
markets like southern Europe and with the current high level of prices, Mr
Skulason sees at least a two-year window for the salmon-farming industry to
yield good profits.
By comparison, European demand in 1989 was 146,000 tonnes compared with
production of 168,000. There was over-production of about 48,000 tonnes in
1990 and 45,000 tonnes in 1991.
In Europe, Aquastar has offices in Belgium, Britain, Spain and Norway but
sees opportunities for European expansion during the next few years. It said
it was rapidly developing internationally into a well-known trade name and
believed that it was set to become a major supplier to branded producers,
multiple retailers and in the seafood industry for repackaging for various
points of sale.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries tumble in wake of dollar's
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the second consecutive trading day US Treasury securities fell across
the board in the wake of a sharply declining dollar.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/8 at 97
27/32 , yielding 7.425 per cent. The two-year note was also notably weaker,
down  9/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 4.215 per cent. Selling was particularly
heavy in the intermediate sector, with the 10-year bond down a full point at
97 27/32 to yield 6.666 per cent.
Despite central bank intervention to support it, the dollar has fallen to
new all-time lows against the D-Mark in the past two days. That decline has
upset bond markets, because a lower dollar reduces the chances of another
interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, it raises the possibility of
higher inflation from more costly imports and it also makes US assets less
attractive to foreign investors.
Political uncertainty also continues to worry bond markets. After last
week's Republican convention President Bush has made up lost ground in the
polls but the unpredictable outlook has made Treasury investors cautious
about buying government securities.
THE EUROPEAN government bond markets were dominated by currency concerns
yesterday as the dollar's fall served to heighten tensions in the exchange
rate mechanism of the European monetary system.
Concerted central bank intervention failed to provide much support for the
US currency, leading to a strengthening of the D-Mark and a weakening of
sterling and lira. As a result, the UK and Italian bond markets suffered
sharp falls while German government bonds rose as investors were drawn into
strong D-Mark assets.
UK government bonds fell as much as a point on fears that sterling's
weakness could force a base rate rise and worries about a large gilts
auction on Wednesday.
Sterling's close, near the bottom of its EMS band, and rises in money market
rates, depressed prices across the yield curve. The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due
1997 dropped  5/8 to 96 23/32 to yield 9.64 per cent while the 9 per cent
gilt due 2008 fell  23/32 to 98 1/4 , with a yield of 9.12 per cent. In
active futures trading, the Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.2l7 to
96.05.
Dealers said prices were also adjusted for Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn new gilt
issue and would have fallen in spite of sterling's troubles. Some traders
said price falls meant the auction would be more attractive, although others
said overall market gloom would drag prices further downward.
Among the other European markets, weakness in the lira contributed to the
half-point fall in the Italian government bond market yesterday. The futures
contract fell from its opening of 93.20 to a low of 92.68 before ending the
day at about 92.80.
German government bonds closed higher in quiet trading helped by weakness in
the dollar and the Treasury market, and sharp falls in German equities.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.85 and closed just short of its
high for the day at about 88.15. Some dealers said the strength of the
D-Mark was attracting some buyers looking for price gains if there is an EMS
realignment.
August inflation figures for North Rhine Westphalia were as expected,
showing prices up 3.4 per cent in the month to mid-August compared with 3.3
per cent in July. Other states are reporting figures for August over the
next few days.
Dealers reported some switching out of French government bonds into German
government paper because of the strength of the D-Mark. The yield on the
French 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 rose from 9.05 per cent at the opening
to 9.11 per cent by late afternoon. The 10-year French-German yield spread
moved from 109 basis points to more than 120 basis points.
Dutch bonds ended little closed and sentiment was helped in late trading by
news of a better-than-expected tap sale. The state finance agency said it
raised Fl 2.5bn on the first day of sales for its 8.25 per cent bond due
2007.
JAPANESE government bonds closed higher, in spite of a continued rally on
the Tokyo stock market, on further hopes of interest rate cuts and a
stronger yen.
The benchmark No 129 bond opened with a 4.785 per cent yield and firmed
throughout the day to close at 4.715 per cent, before easing to 4.73 per
cent in line with a weaker US Treasury market.
The No 145 bond continued to rally in anticipation of becoming the benchmark
issue in September, closing at a yield of 4.885 per cent compared with
Friday's close of 4.945 per cent.
The Nikkei stock index rose for the fourth consecutive session, adding
411.08 points to close at 16,627.96. But bond dealers said the Nikkei's
rally looked vulnerable.

THE Chicago Board of Trade has postponed the September 25 launch of a
homeowners' insurance futures contract, the first derivative instrument
based on insurance.
Instead, the contract will be launched at the end of the year, in
conjunction with so-called catastrophic insurance futures and options,
designed to hedge underwriting risk associated with unexpected disasters.
The homeowners' contracts had met with some scepticism from the insurance
industry, on the grounds that they would duplicate the function of
reinsurance.
The catastrophic contracts will be based on quarterly insured catastrophic
losses across the US and in three regions (eastern, mid-western and
western).

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkish municipality given
BBB debt rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greater Ankara Municipality has been assigned an implied long-term debt
rating of BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's, opening the way for the Turkish
municipality to borrow in the international capital markets.
Ankara has previously issued private placements in the German and Japanese
markets, but has not yet launched public bonds.
The move is part of a broader trend for the decentralisation of funding,
which is likely to lead other municipalities, in Turkey and elsewhere, to
seek ratings in order to gain access to international markets.
For example, S&amp;P, the US rating agency, is in discussions with several
Spanish municipalities over potential debt ratings. In the last few months,
both Barcelona and Madrid have issued debt in the Japanese market, and
Seville is expected to follow suit.
'Ankara's investment grade rating will clearly enhance its access to
international markets,' said Mr Charles Hulac, a manager in the corporate
credits department of Nomura International.
The implied rating is the same as for the Republic of Turkey, based on
support provided to the city by the central government, the state's active
involvement in monitoring Ankara's borrowing and investment programmes, the
health and stability of the city's economy and its solid financial
performance over the past several years.
In the past, Turkish municipalities have been funded largely by transfers
from central government. However, the large costs of much-needed
improvements to infrastructure in cities such as Ankara has encouraged a
diversification of financing sources.
'An ambitious infrastructure development programme, including a subway and
light rail system and various urban renewal projects, will increase the
city's debt burden during the next few years,' S&amp;P said.

FT  25 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Base rate fears prompt heavy setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK EQUITIES yesterday suff-ered their biggest daily setback since the failed
Soviet coup a year ago, as renewed falls in the US dollar and sterling
fuelled both global economic worries and fears that UK base rates might have
to be raised to protect the pound.
The FT-SE Index dropped 54.6 points, or 2.3 per cent, as shares in
international dollar earners and domestic interest rate-related UK companies
fell heavily. However, trading volume remained moderate and most of the
damage to share prices reflected marking down operations at the opening of
the market.
The Footsie was 45 points down at the first calculation of the day and
extended the loss to 59.7 after Wall Street opened sharply weaker, to record
a day's low of 2,306.0. The stock market, however, steadied as the pound
rallied after moving dangerously close to its ERM floor and Wall Street also
edged off its early low to show a decline of 13 Dow points in UK hours.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,311.1, with the day's loss of
54.6 just exceeding daily falls recorded earlier this year, notably the
51.5-point loss chalked up in mid-July when one UK building society raised
mortgage rates.
Seaq volume of 383.7m shares yesterday compared with 436.9m on Friday. On
August 19 last year, the Footsie fell by 80.5 (or 3.1 per cent) as London
reacted to the attempted coup in the former Soviet Union.
The continued recovery in the Tokyo market was ignored in London. A widening
in the UK trade deficit to Pounds 934m in July, hardly encouraging for
sterling, was almost lost in the general rush of bearish factors on the
first day of the new equity trading account.
With the City of London braced for further pressure on the dollar and, via
the foreign exchange cross-rates, the pound, share prices were marked down
by marketmakers who did not wait for sellers to arrive. Both marketmakers
and retail investors were inclined to act in stock index futures rather than
in underlying equities, which were often difficult markets.
London shared in the general setback across European bourses as dollar
weakness took effect. But the downturn in the UK market took in substantial
losses in shares which would suffer immediately if UK base rates have to be
raised to protect sterling's position in the ERM network.
Thus, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, stores and building issues all came in for
severe losses. These groups of stocks have traded somewhat erratically in
recent weeks as currency and interest rate factors have ebbed and flowed,
and share prices have become highly volatile.
Equity strategists could find little reason for confidence until the outlook
for sterling and UK interest rates becomes more clear. An attempt at a
modest rally at midsession was wiped out when a UK trading house implemented
a large sell programme across the range of the market. London-based
securities houses have suffered heavy losses since the pound began its
latest slide last week. Trading books are now severely squeezed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEADY performance from sterling and the absence of any move in UK
interest rates helped calm the futures market in strong trading yesterday,
writes Christopher Price.
The FT-SE contract for September delivery opened sharply down at 2,317 but
then rallied as sterling held up and fears over a rise in base rates
receded. This sentiment continued to drive the contract forward until 10am,
when September reached its best level of the day of 2,340.
From there, it began to drift away as first the weak gilts market and then
poor UK trade figures undermined the contract.
In the afternoon, a faltering dollar forewarned of a negative opening on
Wall Street which further unhinged September. By mid-afternoon, the contract
reached its low point of 2,310, before rallying towards the close. It
finished at 2,316, down 58 from Friday's close and at a 2 1/2 -point premium
to fair value of around 5 1/2 . Volume was a healthy 12,269 lots.
Lacklustre turnover in traded options saw 23,847 contracts dealt, 14.057 of
which were in the FT-SE option. Hanson was the top traded stock option on
916 lots, followed by Barclays on 824 and Commercial Union on 571.

Wall Street
US STOCK markets yesterday added to last Friday's sharp losses as further
declines in bond prices and the dollar continued to upset equity investors,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.93 at 3,228.17,
not far off its low for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 fell 4.13 to 410.72, while the American SE composite lost 3.41 to
380.90 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 8.31 to 555.39.
Declines on the New York SE outpaced rises by 1,500 to 391, but turnover was
fairly light at 165.7m shares.
In spite of further intervention by the Federal Reserve, the dollar fell
yesterday to DM1.40, its lowest-ever level against the D-Mark.
The weak dollar has undermined bond markets, where the yield on the 30-year
bond has inched back up towards 7.5 per cent, because investors believe that
the lower US currency reduces the chances for another interest rate
reduction by the Federal Reserve.
The same concerns have troubled equity investors, who have reacted
negatively to the rise in bond yields, which they fear could hinder the
economy's ability to stage a solid recovery from the recession. Stock market
sentiment was also damaged by news that Salomon Brothers, the big securities
house, had reduced the stock portion of its asset allocation model because
of political uncertainty and the weak dollar.
Insurance companies were lower in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's assault on
South Florida. Investors sold in anticipation of big insurance payouts
because of the hurricane damage, leaving Cigna down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars
51, Travelers Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 20 5/8 , Aetna Dollars 1 cheaper
at Dollars 39 and Geico Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 57 1/8 .
LSI Logic slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 after announcing plans to
take a restructuring charge of Dollars 95 to Dollars 100m in the third
quarter, which would result in a loss of more than Dollars 100m, or Dollars
2 a share.
Daxor, traded on the American SE, plunged Dollars 2 to Dollars 6 5/8 on news
that Ressimo was no longer interested in buying the company, which operates
a blood and human sperm bank.
On the Nasdaq market, the big computer and biotech stocks were lower, with
Apple off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 43 1/4 and Amgen Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at
Dollars 62 1/4 .
Northeast Bancorp rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 8 5/8 on rumours that the
company was up for sale. Chase Manhattan, Fleet Financial, Bank of Boston
and First Fidelity were all touted as possible buyers.
Canada
TORONTO stocks shrugged off an historic agreement that could end years of
wrangling over the Canadian constitution with the lack of enthusiasm typical
of Monday. The market instead focused on the slumping US dollar to end
moderately lower.
The TSE 300 index shed 9.5 to 3,380.8 and declines led advances by 303 to
204 after volume of 23.7m shares.
Bank shares continued to see profit-taking, following National Bank of
Canada's disappointing third-quarter earnings announced late last Thursday.
The other leading banks begin reporting their earnings for the period today.

FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Dollar speeds up European decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The downward trend on European equity markets is gathering pace as the
weakness in the dollar and sterling, and fears of higher interest rates in
the UK, undermine investor confidence.
Mr Gary Dugan, European strategist at Baring Securities, believes that worse
is to come before investors can hope for any sort of recovery. He expects a
further fall of between 5 to 10 per cent before European markets reach
support levels and buyers are tempted back into the market.
In retrospect, it has been poor second-quarter results from blue chip
companies across Europe, and particularly from Germany, that has triggered
the decline, he says. Further evidence of weakness in Germany is expected
this week when two chemical companies report their interims.
Baring is forecasting that BASF will show a 35 per cent drop in
second-quarter earnings from the year-ago period, while it estimates a 22
per cent fall in Hoescht's figures.
On the other hand, research by Mr Joe Rooney, European strategist at James
Capel, suggests that not all cyclical stocks have been damaged by the
deepening economic recession. Since January 1991, Akzo, Rhone Poulenc and
Ciba-Geigy have outperformed other European chemical issues in local
currency terms, which supports the case that fund managers are being very
selective.
Nevertheless, he remains cautious about the chances for a turnround this
year. 'I think we will continue to see downgradings of companies across
Europe throughout this year, and until people are confident that interest
rates will come down, things look set to remain as they are,' he says.
The weakness of the dollar was one, but by no means the most important,
factor which affected sentiment last week. The publication of new opinion
polls in France indicating that a 'yes' vote in the September referendum on
the Maastricht treaty was less than certain not only upset the Paris equity
market but also caused unrest to spread to other bourses.
Unfounded fears that Germany might be forced to raise its Lombard rate added
to the negative mood, while Hafnia's suspension of payments mid-week weighed
on the share prices of a number of leading institutions with stakes in the
Danish insurer.
The European segment of the FT-Actuaries World index only showed a slight
fall on the week, helped by technical rallies in Austria and Italy after
their steep declines during the summer. However, excluding the UK, the index
has dropped 2.5 per cent in the August month and is more than 8 per cent
down on the quarter.
The world index was nearly 2 per cent stronger on the week as Japan pulled
out of its recent slide. Other world markets remained mixed last week, with
the best performance coming from Japan as it responded to the government's
measures aimed at supporting equities. But Tokyo's rebound has done little
to encourage markets in the Pacific Rim.

FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei's 2.5% gain fails
to encourage Pacific Rim
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES extended their gains on continued short-covering and bargain
hunting, and the Nikkei average ended a volatile session with a rise of 2.5
per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average added 411.08 at 16,627.96. The index fell to the day's
low of 16,166.40 in the morning but later broke above the 17,000 mark,
reaching 17,182.96. Some of the share price gains were trimmed in the last
hour of trading as investors grew cautious about the pace of the rise.
Volume jumped to 570m shares from Friday's 417m, surpasssing 500m for the
first time since June 12. Rises outnumbered declines by 830 to 121, with 69
issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 43.39
to 1,295.09, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index receded 12.25 to
1,053.50.
Speculation that a reduction in the country's official discount rate would
be announced at the end of the week, and continued optimism in the wake of
the government's emergency economic package, spurred activity.
Although the Nikkei index breached an important technical level, not all
investors have been able to keep up with the sharp reversal in sentiment.
'The speed with which things have moved during the last few days have made
it most difficult for fund managers,' said Mr Nick Cant at Baring
Securities. The Nikkei has rallied 16.2 per cent since last week's
announcement of emergency measures to help the ailing banking system,
Foreign investors were seen buying financial issues. Tokio Marine &amp; Fire put
on Y20 to Y1,200.
Short-sellers bought back Nippon Housing Loan, the home-loan company facing
financial restructuring due to problem loans. It was the most active issue
of the day, rising Y80 to Y401.
Other stocks which were also subject to speculative short-selling last week
strengthened, with Okamoto improving Y110 to Y1,190 and Daikyo, the
condominium developer, moving up Y80 to Y820.
Banks also made firm gains, with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y120 to
Y2,280 and Sakura Bank Y170 to Y1,300.
Sony, however, fell Y30 to Y4,040 on profit-taking and Nissan Motor lost Y4
to Y588.
In Osaka, the OSE average surged 714.53 to 18,219.16 in volume of 24.9m
shares. The index rose above 18,000 for the first time since July 23.
Roundup
WALL STREET'S fall on Friday had more influence on Pacific Rim markets than
yesterday's rise in Tokyo.
HONG KONG weakened on US-China trade dispute fears and worries that blue
chip companies will announce disappointing half-time results. The Hang Seng
index finished 118.46, or 2.2 per cent, off at 5,390.93, exaggerated by the
thin turnover of HKDollars 1.96bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 2.62bn.
HSBC Holdings, which reports its interims today, was down 75 cents at
HKDollars 49.75 on expectations that the bank may announce a provision to
cover its exposure to Canadian property developer Olympia &amp; York. Wharf
Holdings retreated 80 cents to HKDollars 14 on fears of poor results being
reported tomorrow.
SEOUL was lifted by news of long-anticipated market-boosting measures and
South Korea's signing of diplomatic ties with China. The composite index
climbed 12.12 to 483.73.
The Finance Ministry said institutions would be encouraged to buy Won3.4
trillion worth of equities and the Securities Stabilisation Fund would be
required to raise Won500bn for buying equities.
AUSTRALIA closed lower, the All Ordinaries index losing 19.8 to 1,539.5.
National turnover was halved by a 5 1/2 -hour breakdown in the dealing
system which wiped out morning business. Only 64.9m shares worth ADollars
115m changed hands.
TAIWAN focused on smaller stocks as the weighted index rose 27.87 to
3,850.68, but turnover contracted to TDollars 19.17bn from Saturday's
TDollars 23.4bn.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index dipped 3.98 to 1,476.26 in turnover of
NZDollars 11.1m. Weakness in Fletcher Challenge, down 3 cents at NZDollars
2.41, was partially offset by Telecom, up 2 cents at NZDollars 2.31.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index shed 16.54 to 1,330.77 in volume
of 22.77m shares, and in KUALA LUMPUR, the composite index ended 2.10 down
at 565.56.
MANILA fell in reaction to Wall Street and on continued investor aversion to
the new board of Philippine National Bank. The composite index slipped 19.41
to 1,455.71.

FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on currency,
corporate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weak dollar, fears of poor interim results and more bad news from
Scandinavia kept the downward pressure on continental bourses, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT began the week with further declines across the board. The
chemical sector was particularly weak as investors sold in anticipation of
disappointing first-half results. The FAZ index lost 4.78 to 593.28 at
midsession while the DAX index fell 21.28 or 1.4 per cent to 1,498.74, its
lowest close since August 1991. German shares extended their decline in the
post-bourse with the index estimated to have fallen a further 1.3 per cent.
Turnover was unavailable.
Hoechst, which shed DM7.90 to DM231.80, was also affected by the dollar's
weakness because of its US exposure; Bayer fell DM7.80 to DM255.80 and BASF
finished the session down DM4.30 to DM213.90. Specialty chemical stocks also
fell, with Schering dropping DM14.50 to DM689.50 and Henkel DM15 lower at
DM575.
Reports that the cartel office may take action against banks for paying low
interest rates on savings accounts weighed on the sector. Deutsche Bank lost
DM5 to DM611, Dresdner Bank was down DM5.80 at DM319.20 and Commerzbank
slipped DM4 to DM219.
PARIS dropped 3.1 per cent as selling on the last day of the account pushed
the CAC-40 index down by 54.47 to 1,689.71 in turnover of FFr2bn. Dealers
expect a technical rebound today.
Euro Disney dropped FFr5.25 or 7.1 per cent to FFr68.25, as bad sentiment
towards the stock persisted following a broker sell note last week. There
were also fears that the theme park operator will not pay a dividend on 1992
results.
UAP lost FFr17.10 to FFr356.90 on worries about the consequences of its
stake in Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer. The stock also fell following
a report from James Capel underweighting the French insurance sector.
Elf fell FFr6.40 to FFr309.80 ahead of its interim results which were were
announced after the close. The drop in net profit to FFr3.34bn from
FFr5.22bn in the year-ago period came in at the lower end of forecasts.
MILAN fell as the lira slid further against the mark. Rumours of brokers in
difficulty also weighed on sentiment. The Comit index fell 6.06 to 400.06 in
turnover estimated at L50bn after Friday's L46.3bn.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the state-controlled bank which surged last week
on rumours of a private sector takeover bid, dropped L87 or 3.4 per cent to
L2,438 as the speculative fizz evaporated.
OSLO plunged 5.9 per cent, following the suspension of shares in the
troubled insurer, Uni Storebrand. The all-share index fell 19.14 to 305.20,
its lowest level since November 1988, in thin turnover of NKr153m.
Uni Storebrand shares, which closed at an all-time low of NKr13.30 on
Friday, were suspended as the company tried to secure new capital.
STOCKHOLM plunged 4 per cent as domestic interest rates continued to rise.
The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 31.6 to 750.2, its lowest close since
February 1988, in turnover of SKr486m after SKr382m.
Skandia dropped SKr6 or 8.8 per cent to SKr62 on news that Uni Storebrand,
which owns 28.3 per cent of the Swedish company, had been suspended.
COPENHAGEN's KFX index fell 1.90 to a new all-time low of 77.16 in busy
trading.
ZURICH fell sharply as the SMI index lost 41.3 or 2.3 per cent to 1,726.9.
The chemical sector took its cue from Frankfurt with Ciba-Geigy registered
shares down SFr16 to SFr631 and Roche certificates SFr80 weaker at SFr3,290.
Nestle was one of the day's biggest losers, its bearers down SFr110 or 1.2
per cent to SFr9,020, but off the day's low of SFr8,960.
AMSTERDAM followed neighbouring markets lower as the CBS Tendency index
closed down 3.7 or 3.3 per cent at 107.8, but volume remained thin.
DSM and Akzo lost Fl 2.30 and FL 3.80 respectively to Fl 100.30 and FL
143.30 while Royal Dutch was down Fl 4.70 to Fl 141.00. Daf saw one of the
day's biggest falls, losing Fl 1.90 or 10.6 per cent to Fl 16.00.
BRUSSELS lost further ground with Banque Bruxelles Lambert off BFr230 or 7
per cent at BFr3,070 and Delhaize down BFr59 to BFr1,486. The Bel-20 index
lost 28.30 or 2.5 per cent to 1,085.12 in turnover estimated at BFr900m.
MADRID's general index closed down 2.64 at 207.60 in turnover of Pta7bn.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar defies more intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell below DM1.40 against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday, in spite of concerted central bank intervention in both European
and North American trading, writes James Blitz.
There was no firm underpinning to the US currency at the end of an intense
day of trading on the foreign exchange markets. Fifteen central banks
carried out five rounds of intervention in roughly the same volumes that
have been seen in recent weeks. But the dollar fell victim to heavy selling,
even though it had lost more than 7 pfennigs in a week.
By the European close, the dollar was at DM1.4035. more than 3 pfennigs down
on the day. A measure of its weakness was that sterling rose above the
Dollars 2 level against the US currency for the first time since February
1991, in spite of the pound's intrinsic weakness. Sterling finished at
Dollars 1.9945, up nearly 5 cents. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.4015
and the pound was at Dollars 1.9940.
Dealers had different views as to where the dollar/D-Mark rate is heading
now. Mr Aki Karayannis, a senior dealer at Lehman Bros in London, thinks the
selling has been overdone and the currency will bottom out soon. 'It is a
mistake to get caught up with the selling now,' he said.
Some dealers said the dollar could easily test lower levels in forthcoming
days. Mr David Kern, chief economist at NatWest Bank, commented: 'Short of
changing interest rates, there is little the central banks can now do to
help the dollar.'
European central banks and the US Federal Reserve started to intervene in
the London morning yesterday, buying dollars at DM1.4215, but that level
could not be held.
One reason for the lack of success is that they were intervening in very
small volumes of around Dollars 1bn a day. By contrast, the spot desk in
dollar/D-Mark business at a large London bank might expect to see a Dollars
3bn turnover each day.
Mr Avinash Persaud, chief currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
London, suggested that the central banks believe they cannot really turn the
dollar, and are only making a token gesture. 'Central banks will want to
ensure that there is an orderly fall that does not excessively disrupt world
stock markets.'
In the European Monetary System, sterling and the Italian lira remained
under intense pressure, but looked at times as though they might have
decoupled themselves from the dollar's fall.
The pound closed firmer on the day at DM2.80, even though the Bank of
England did not support sterling through intervention or an interest rate
rise. The lira ended in London at L762.1, holding close to a record low
against the D-Mark. In later New York trading, it was touching L764,
dangerously near its L765 ERM floor.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures collapse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES IN the sterling cash and futures markets virtually discounted a 1
percentage-point rise in UK base rates yesterday, but the Bank of England
did not sway under calls for a tightening of monetary policy.
Pressure on both the US dollar and the pound triggered intense activity in
both the futures and cash markets. The September contract lost 35 basis
points from its previous close, finishing at 89.20. The December contract
fell 26 basis points to close at 89.26. Theoretically, the September price
suggests that three-month money will be at 10.8 per cent in one month's
time. Total volume for the contracts was high, at nearly 73,000 lots
combined.
The rise in sterling cash rates was slowed in the morning by concerted
central bank intervention on the foreign exchanges. However, the new expense
of money was clear by the day's end. Everything from three-month money out
to one-year was offered at 10 13/16 per cent, up from 10 1/2 per cent on
Friday night.
According to one clearing bank dealer, the rise in one-month money to 10
7/16 per cent on the offered side may prove to be the most imporant rate
change of the day. He argued that if this stays at the same level, clearing
banks will put the Bank of England under pressure to signal a base rate
change.
The Bank of England left its shorter dated dealing rates unchanged at 9 7/8
per cent, and took out most of the Pounds 2.1bn shortage using a repurchase
agreement (repo) at the established rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
However, there was a slight tightening of rates in Bands 3 and 4. These were
moved up to spreads of 9 3/4 per cent to 9 7/8 per cent in Band 3, and 9 per
cent to 9 7/8 per cent in Band 4. Dealers interpreted the change as a purely
technical move. They believe that the Bank routinely matches changes in
period rates.
One dealer said it would be perfectly possible for a discount house to make
a turn by borrowing money at the newly raised rates in Bands 3 and 4, and
lending it out at the new costs for 3-month money.
In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 2m in Band 1 Bank bills, Pounds
257m in Band 2, Pounds 3m in Band 3, Pounds 163m in Band 4 and Pounds 1.2bn
in the 'repo'. The forecast was revised to Pounds 2bn and there was late
assistance of Pounds 30m.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pollution threat to US smelters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY TWO US smelters would be able to meet tighter pollution regulations
proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, according to a study by
the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation.
It also concludes that 'some base metals producers, particularly in North
America and Europe, simply will not survive the sort of tightening of
environmental laws that is being proposed and the tough legislation that is
being enacted'.
The study suggests that in Chile smelters face bills totalling about Dollars
900m if they are to meet the government's new regulations to limit sulphur
dioxide emissions.
It says France's tough Plan National pour l'Environment also proposes huge
reductions of sulphur dioxide emissions by the year 2000.
'In Germany, unless former East German base metal plants and mines come into
compliance with West German environmental laws by October this year, they
will have to close down,' says Mr Simon Hobson, an executive director of
MMRS and one of the authors of the study.
He says there are eight pieces of European Community legislation concerning
the environment and metals production that are either at the discussion or
implementation stage. Tightening environmental standards have already forced
closures: MMRS points to among other examples the shut-down of Billiton's
secondary (scrap) lead smelter (35,000 tonnes a year) at Arnhem in the
Netherlands while in Spain Metaleurop's Cartagena primary lead smelter
(85,000 tonnes) and Ercosa's secondary copper smelter (30,000 tonnes) have
closed.
MMRS suggests that the US mining and metals industry is under the most
intense pressure because of the resources available to environmental groups.
The top ten environmental organisations there, headed by the Nature
Conservancy, have 8m members and a combined annual budget of more than
Dollars 253m. Another eight US environmental groups have an additional
membership of about 6.5m and collect annual dues of over Dollars 110m.
The study shows that the US Environmental Protection Agency, under the terms
of a new Clean Air Act, is pressing for permitted emissions of sulphur
dioxide from smelters to be reduced by more than three quarters to only 0.75
parts per million (ppm) monitored over five-minute intervals.
It says only RTZ Corporation's proposed new copper smelter at its Kennecott
subsidiary's Bingham Canyon mine and Cyprus Minerals new furnace at Miami,
Arizona, based on the Australian Isasmelt process, could meet such stringent
standards.
'It is an example of a proposed law which does not take account of standards
base metals producers can reasonably meet but is designed to combat what the
EPA and pressure groups believe may be public health risks,' says Mr Hobson.
The American Mining Congress, which represents the US mining industry, is
fighting this legislation. In the US there are 14 pieces of environmental
law, regulations and guidelines which are to be changed very shortly, some
very radically, says MMRS.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Deutsche Finance adds DM500m tranche to
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market was depressed by weak government bond
markets as the dollar hit an all-time low against the D-Mark yesterday.
Deutsche Finance, an arm of Deutsche Bank, added a further DM500m tranche to
a recent DM500m five-year issue. The deal was aimed at German and Swiss
retail investors, and was expected to be comfortably placed through
Deutsche's retail network.
Elsewhere, Banco Quilmes, Argentina's fourth largest private bank, launched
its first Eurobond offering, a Dollars 20m two-year deal arranged by
Chemical Investment Bank.
The Bank of Scotland has arranged two programmes, one for Euro-notes and one
for notes in the US private placement market under rule 144a.
Turkish banks, seeking to lower the cost of their funds and increase
liquidity in financial markets, have turned their eyes to asset-backed
securities  - a new instrument defined in a capital markets decree last
month, Reuter reports.
Privately owned Interbank last week inaugurated the first asset-backed
security with a TL4.25bn offer based on its leasing receivables. The issue,
between one and 10-month maturities bearing a net annual interest rate of
72.36 per cent, was sold out on the first day of the offer.
Key one-year bank deposit rates are around 70 per cent to 74 per cent and
three-month repurchase agreements can currently earn 73 per cent.
Pamukbank will today launch the first TL100bn part of a planned TL2,000bn
securitisation backed by consumer credits and mortgages. The three-month
paper will bear 67.13 per cent interest against 62 per cent Pamukbank offers
on deposits.
Leading high-street bank Yapi ve Kredi will securitise an entire TL1,000bn
consumer credit portfolio next month.
Mr Yaman Asikoglu, head of Turkey's Capital Markets Board, said export
receivables of companies and credit sales by debt-ridden state-enterprises
would also be eligible for securitisation. Asset-backed securities are
mainly expected to replace bank deposits and become a new vehicle to
increase liquidity in Turkish financial markets by recycling idle loans and
thus easing deposit interest rates.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Portugal tempts foreign
investors
</HEADLINE>

PORTUGAL'S government bond market has seen a sharp rally in the last
fortnight, helped by two cuts in the intervention rate and the Bank of
Portugal's plan to lift all capital controls by the end of the year.
The rally in fixed rate and floating rate bonds has been driven by domestic
players, but dealers believe the recent moves could help to entice some
foreigners back into Portugal's high-yielding debt instruments.
The Bank of Portugal cut its intervention rate for lending to commercial
banks by three-quarters of a point to 17 per cent on August 12, and then by
a further point to 16 per cent a week later on August 19. Dealers believe
that further rate cuts are on the cards: 'We've had indications from the
central bank that the intervention rate could be down to around 13 per cent
by the end of the year,' said Mr Alex Mitcheson-Smith, analyst at Paribas
Capital Markets.
The reduction in interest rates sparked a surge in Portuguese domestic fixed
rate bonds.
Although foreign investors are allowed to buy fixed rate Portuguese bonds,
the market is rather illiquid and  - according to dealers  - not very
attractive to foreign investors because they have to pay a 20 per cent
withholding tax of which a maximum of 10 per cent is reimbursed. As a
result, foreigners can obtain higher net yields from Italian and Spanish
bonds at present.
In addition to lower interest rates in Portugal, dealers are keen to see the
lifting of controls on capital as promised by the Central Bank earlier this
month.
The first step, on August 31, is the abolition of the requirement for
Portuguese companies which borrow in foreign currencies to deposit the
equivalent of 25 per cent of the amount in escudos with the Bank of Portugal
in an interest-free deposit.
However, of more relevance to foreign investors is the plan to allow
non-residents to buy floating rate government bonds (known as Fips) with
effect from October 31. In addition, they will be allowed full access to
Portugal's domestic money market with effect from December 31.
Foreign investors were avid buyers of Fips in early 1991, but in July 1991
the Bank of Portugal banned foreigners from buying these high-yielding
instruments because it was concerned about the speculative inflows of
capital.
News that foreigners will be allowed once again to buy Fips lifted bond
prices. Yields on five-year Fips have fallen from 17 per cent before the
announcement to about 15 per cent at the end of last week in anticipation of
demand from foreigners.
While dealers are pleased with the recent moves they warn that many foreign
investors are wary about the high-yielding markets at present because of
uncertainty over the future of the Maastricht Treaty on European economic
and monetary union.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Recession forces Dollars 95m
shake-up at Maytag

MAYTAG, the fourth biggest US domestic appliance maker, yesterday predicted
a 33 per cent drop in underlying third-quarter earnings and said it would
take a pre-tax Dollars 95m restructuring charge to cover reorganisation in
Europe and the US.
Mr Leonard Hadley, chief executive, blamed the erosion in earnings on
'continued losses in Europe, extra start up costs associated with the new
dishwasher facility and the new Magic Chef ranges'.
He said the group was also hurt by 'the stalled US economic recovery and
fierce competition in the appliance and floor care industries both here and
abroad'.
Although analysts had expected a slowdown from Maytag's strong first-quarter
growth, yesterday's announcement surprised Wall Street. The shares were
halted in the morning and when trading resumed in the early afternoon they
fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 7/8 .
In the 1991 third quarter, Maytag earned 23 cents a share and most analysts
had expected earnings of about 27 cents in the same period of this year.
The company's balance sheet has been weakened by a string of large
acquisitions in the 1980s, including Magic Chef in a Dollars 736m stock swap
and Hoover for Dollars 961m in cash and stock, which significantly increased
its debt burden. In addition, Maytag has been hit by the impact of the
recession on the appliance industry.
In a move to conserve cash, the company cut its dividend in February, 1991
for the first time since 1946. Mr Hadley said the reorganisation was 'an
investment in our future, and we expect to recover the charge in
approximately three years through improved earnings'. The company said its
Hoover operations have been losing money, largely because of excess capacity
and the deterioration of economic conditions in the UK and other European
countries.
'In the past two years, we have implemented significant cost reduction
activities throughout our Hoover Europe operations,' Mr Hadley said, 'but
further reorganisation is necessary. Over-capacity is prevalent in
manufacturing throughout Europe, and Hoover is no exception.'
He added that the reorganisation would be aimed at reducing production
capacity and streamlining sales, marketing, administrative and distribution
operations in Europe.
In the US, Maytag plans to consolidate the sales, marketing and most
financial and information systems functions of its Magic Chef division into
its Jenn-Air division. Its Hoover operations in North America will also be
involved in the reorganisation.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Japanese life insurers warned of
challenges

JAPANESE life insurers face significant challenges to their financial
strength this decade, warns Moody's Investment Service, the US credit rating
agency.
It points to deteriorating asset quality and higher yields on maturing
policies.
The problems of Japanese life insurers come as Japanese financial
institutions are being forced to cope with the aggressive growth of the
1980s.
The agency said the ratings of Japanese life insurance companies were under
downward pressure in the longer term.
In the light of this Moody's said it was reviewing the financial strength
rating of three leading life insurers, Meiji Mutual Life Insurance, Sumitomo
Life Insurance, and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance, for possible downgrades
from their current ratings of Aaa.
The sharp fall in the stock market has had an impact on insurers since the
unrealised gains on their stock holdings, which served as buffers by
absorbing losses on investments, has declined sharply. This has led them to
cut sharply the level of new investments in high-risk products. The life
insurance companies also have significant exposure to the faltering domestic
property market, through loans to corporations and non-bank financial
institutions.
In addition to their problems in the 1980s, life insurers have increased
investments in foreign securities and real estate, making portfolios
vulnerable to foreign currency movements.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: TWA agrees plan for
reorganisation with creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR

<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines, the debt-burdened carrier operating under Chapter 11
of the US bankruptcy code, yesterday said it had reached agreements in
principal with its creditors and all of its employees on a stand-alone
reorganisation plan, paving the way for the airline to emerge from
bankruptcy protection.
A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) cautioned, however,
that 'to my knowledge, TWA's announcement is premature. I doubt there's any
ink on paper right now'.
According to the airline, ALPA, along with the International Association of
Machinists and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants have agreed
to provide unprecedented three-year wage, benefit and work rule concessions
in exchange for a 45 per cent stake in the reorganised airline.
Creditors would receive 55 per cent of the equity in the reorganised
airline, as well as debt securities and preferred stock. Mr Carl Icahn,
TWA's owner, would inject Dollars 200m in cash and would cancel more than
Dollars 170m in face debt. He would also cede control of the airline.
'Eliminating Carl Icahn and his senior management team and replacing them
with a professional airline management team committed to TWA's long-term
viability was one of our pre-conditions to any agreement,' said the ALPA
spokesman, 'and that does not appear to be one of the outstanding issues'.
An important sticking point appears to be the unprotected portion of the
pilots' pension fund. TWA's pension plan is believed to be underfunded by
about Dollars 1bn, and the unprotected portion of the pilots' pension fund
is about Dollars 232m.
Another outstanding issue is the pilots' demand for job protection if there
is a further asset sale.
Once an agreement is reached with union representatives, it would still need
membership ratification by the rank and file of each union. It would also
need bankruptcy court approval. However, 'I think getting the agreement
would be an enormous first step,' the ALPA spokesman said.
