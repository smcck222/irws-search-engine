SAMANCOR, the integrated chrome and manganese ore and alloys producer in the
Gencor group, saw earnings fall by 23.5 per cent in the year to June on the
back of weak international commodity markets. The result was, however,
better than market expectations. .
Pre-tax income dropped to R384.4m (Dollars 138.9m) from R567.4m, including a
decline in net interest received to R49.3m from R110.8m. Attributable income
fell to R277.1m from R362.2m.
Turnover rose to R2.06bn from R1.81bn in 1991, but R449m of this increase
came from the acquisition of Middelburg Steel and Alloys' (MS&amp;A) ferrochrome
operations, the chromite assets of the Rand Mines group and the Manganese
Metal Company (MMC). The remaining turnover was actually 11 per cent down on
1991.
Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said if conditions in world commodity
markets did not improve, the group would be 'hard pressed to maintain the
earnings announced.' Accordingly the overall dividend was being cut to 90
cents per share from 110 cents per share. Earnings per share fell to 151
cents from 216 cents.
He added that the highlight of the company's performance was its improved
cash position, with cash resources rising by R165m to R267m during the
second half of the year following a three-month closure of production
capacity.
He said this had been achieved despite the fact that Samancor had paid more
than R300m in cash for its interests in the Columbus stainless steel joint
venture and MMC.
He defended the decision to close capacity saying it had been a successful
attempt to generate cash, not an effort to squeeze supply.

COAL &amp; Allied, the Australian coal mining company, yesterday said net
profits fell by ADollars 10m to ADollars 49m (USDollars 35m) in the year to
end-June, on turnover down 4.3 per cent to ADollars 615m.
The group, 38 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian mining group, said it
expected a flat profit performance over the next 18 months, but forecast an
increase in Asian demand after 1994.
Mr Tony Haraldson, chief executive, said South Korea, Taiwan and Japan were
experiencing high growth in power demand, and would need to increase
generating capacity.
In line with the optimistic long-term outlook, Coal &amp; Allied maintained the
final dividend at 35 cents, making a fully franked total of 60 cents for the
year, unchanged from the previous year.
Production increased to a record 11m tonnes from 10.5m tonnes in the
previous year, but sales fell slightly to 11.1m tonnes from 11.5m tonnes.
Coal &amp; Allied shares closed unchanged at ADollars 9.39 on the Australian
Stock Exchange. CRA closed 30 cents lower at ADollars 12.50.
Amcor, the Australian packaging group, yesterday said it would pay ADollars
273m (USDollars 196m) for Leigh Mardon, a packaging, communications and
printing company with operations in Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Leigh Mardon was sold by Coca-Cola Amatil for ADollars 260m two years ago to
a consortium of senior managers and financial institutions led by SBC
Dominguez Barry Capital Partners.
Amcor said it would finance the acquisition largely from its cash reserve of
about ADollars 200m, which includes ADollars 177m from the sale in July of
its 8.5 per cent shareholding in Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport
and distribution group.
Mr Stan Wallis, Amcor managing director, said Leigh Mardon's forecast sales
of nearly ADollars 300m this year would shore up the group's 'strong flow of
earnings' in Australia.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Costly flying lesson for the
Argentines - John Barham and Peter Bruce examines the part renationalisation
of Aerolneas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Argentina's first privatisation could hardly have come at a
worse moment.
Last month, Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, announced the
state was taking back 28 per cent of Aerolneas Argentinas, raising its stake
in the national airline to 33 per cent.
Less than two years ago it sold 85 per cent of the company to a consortium
led by Spain's Iberia for Dollars 810m.
The Aerolneas flop casts a long shadow over the government's privatisation
policies as it gears up to sell nearly all its state companies before the
end of the year.
The affair also raises questions about Iberia's expansion strategy of
acquiring privatised Latin American airlines. As well as 30 per cent of
Aerolneas, Iberia owns stakes in airlines in Chile, the Dominican Republic
and Venezuela.
A day after the partial renationalisation of Aerolneas came the European
Community's approval for a Spanish government injection of Dollars 1.26bn
into Iberia, which has accumulated pre-tax losses of Dollars 1.07bn since
1990.
The losses were mainly caused by fleet expansion and a downturn in tourist
flights to Spain, but empire-building in South America hardly helped the
bottom line. Nonetheless, Iberia may still bid for more Latin airlines.
The Aerolneas privatisation was flawed from the start. Iberia was the only
bidder for the company. Its local allies were a group of businessmen which
included a funfair proprietor and the owner of Austral, Argentina's only
other main airline.
The sale contract was signed in the dead of night after being repeatedly
renegotiated and amended, leading to confusion over the text's meaning.
Although the government won a high price for the airline, it placed a heavy
financial strain on the buyers, especially the under-capitalised local
investors. Initially it did not allow them to sell, lease or even use
Aerolneas aircraft as collateral for bank loans.
Still, the buyers managed to finance the acquisition with debt, rather than
through a debt-equity swap with foreign creditor banks. Soon, all but two
Argentine investors abandoned the consortium, leaving 21 per cent of
Aerolneas in the hands of three Spanish banks and an anonymous Argentine
living in Spain.
Among those forced out was Mr Enrique Pescarmona, formerly a majority
shareholder of Austral. He had used his Austral shares  - itself privatised
a few years earlier  - to pay for his Aerolneas shares. The result is that
Aerolneas now fully owns Austral, giving it a virtual monopoly over domestic
air transport.
Then the consortium began arguing with the government over the sale price
and payment terms as its debt load overstretched its finances.
At almost every turn, the government made concessions. But in the end it
still had to take back the shares of the insolvent Argentine buyers. Mr
Horacio Liendo, chief government negotiator, says that when the government
took back their shares, the consortium still owed it Dollars 90m.
The government took up new equity issued by Aerolneas but left unsubscribed
by the Argentine investors, by cancelling Dollars 21.7m of that debt.
Aerolneas will issue more shares worth more than Dollars 145m this year.
Instead of paying cash, the government will maintain its 33 per cent stake
by cancelling the remaining Dollars 61.8m in debt. The deal will preserve
the value of the government's original 5 per cent holding in the company,
whose net worth has shrunk to Dollars 380m from Dollars 623m.
Mr Amadeo Riva, the company's Argentine president, says the endless
arguments prevented him from concentrating on running the airline.
He says that persistently rising costs and overstaffing are the main
problems at Aerolneas.
Mr Liendo says rescuing Aerolneas  - rather than allowing it to crash, or
scrapping the privatisation and starting from scratch  - protected the value
of the government's shareholding. However, the Aerolneas precedent could
make it harder to resist rescuing privatised companies that run into trouble
in the future.
Once again, the government is the main shareholder in Aerolneas. The
government does not plan to manage Aerolneas, but wants to recruit
professional managers to take its five seats on the 12-member board.
As well as its 33 per cent share, the government also represents the
employees who hold 10 per cent of the company. Mr Liendo says 'the board
will be selected with the same rigour as American Airlines or British
Airways. We will look for the best people in the business'.
The hope is that Aerolneas will become profitable, making it easier to
attract buyers for the unwanted 52 per cent of the company held by the
government and the banks.
That will not be easy: not only is the industry in trouble internationally,
but Aerolneas has not made a profit in its recent history.
The Aerolneas affair risks bringing privatisation into disrepute in
Argentina, and just almost the entire public sector is being privatised.
Mr Cavallo was not responsible for privatising Aerolneas and has taken a
more studied approach to future sales. He says 'we have learned from the
case of Aerolneas companies to continue improving the privatisation process
and avoid repeating mistakes'.

AMCOR, the Australian packaging group, yesterday said it would pay ADollars

Leigh Mardon was sold by Coca-Cola Amatil for ADollars 260m two years ago to

However, the acquisition will also provide a substantial boost to Amcor's
plans to expand its Asian packaging materials business.
Mr Ian Wilson, a director of SBC Dominguez Barry, said the consortium had
achieved 'a satisfactory return' on its investment in Leigh Mardon, in spite
of the difficult economic environment. Amcor shares closed seven cents lower
at ADollars 7.61 before the acquisition was announced.

FUJIAN Enterprises, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has purchased 10 per
cent of Allied Group, a company under investigation by the Hong Kong
government for its share dealings.
Fujian Enterprises, which paid HKDollars 126.5m (USDollars 16.4m) for the
230m shares in Allied, is owned by the provincial government of Fujian, a
province located on the south coast of China.
The company acquired the shares from the family trust of Mr Lee Ming Tee,
the chairman of Allied Group. His trust subscribed for 230m shares to
rebuild his holding.
Mr Zhou Huiyuan, chairman of Fujian Enterprises, said his company would
consider acquiring a further 10 per cent of Allied Group.
The investigation into Allied Group and four other companies associated with
Mr Lee is expected to take about six months.
Allied Group has investments in Fujian in a shrimp feedmill and an eel
processing plant.
It also is the developer of a golf course in the province.

SOUTH China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading
English-language newspaper, yesterday reported a 9.3 per cent rise in
profits to HKDollars 531.7m (USDollars 68.8m) from HKDollars 486.4m in the
year to June 30, writes Simon Holberton.
Profits for the company, which is 51 per cent owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation, were struck on a 14 per cent growth in turnover to
HKDollars 921.6m from HKDollars 807.5m.
Directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share  - up 15 per cent
on a year ago  - which, with the 17 cents paid at the interim stage makes 30
cents for the year.
South China Morning Post also publishes magazines and books. Last December
it paid HKDollars 30m for Wah Kiu Yat Po, a Chinese language daily paper.
Far East Consortium International, a Hong Kong property development and
flour mill group, said final profit jumped 31 per cent in the year to March
31 to HKDollars 161m, in spite of a modest fall in turnover.
Turnover was down to HKDollars 364m from HKDollars 393m, a 7.4 per cent
fall. The final dividend was an unchanged 8 cents.

NIKON will pay Honeywell, the US controls group, Dollars 45m to settle a
lawsuit involving the Japanese camera maker's use of patented auto-focus
technology, according to a report filed with Japan's Ministry of Finance,
AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The Nikon-Honeywell agreement covers the Japanese camera maker's use of the
patented technology in cameras from March 1986 through to March this year.
For the ensuing period, Nikon will pay an undisclosed amount in royalties
until the respective expirations of the patents.
Honeywell brought the suit on March 3 against Nikon and several other
photographic equipment manufacturers.
Japan's Canon, in a related but separate move, reported last week that it
had reached agreement with Honeywell to settle their legal dispute. The two
companies declined to comment on the details, but the pact is reported to
involve the cross-licensing of products, positioning Canon to make a profit
in the long run.
Mr Shigeo Ono, Nikon's managing director, said the sparsity of overlap
between his company's and Honeywell's business activities precluded such an
arrangement.

Moody's of challenges ahead

<TEXT>
JAPANESE life insurers face significant challenges to their financial
strength this decade, warns Moody's Investment Service, the US credit rating
agency. It points to deteriorating asset quality and higher yields on
maturing policies.
The problems of Japanese life insurers, once among the most formidable
investors in the domestic and international markets, come as Japanese
financial institutions are being forced to cope with the aggressive growth
of the 1980s.
The agency said the ratings of Japanese life insurance companies were under
downward pressure in the longer term.
In the light of this Moody's said it was reviewing the financial strength
rating of three leading life insurers, Meiji Mutual Life Insurance, Sumitomo
Life Insurance, and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance, for possible downgrades
from their current ratings of Aaa.
The sharp fall in the stock market has had an impact on insurers since the
unrealised gains on their stock holdings, which served as buffers by
absorbing losses on investments, has declined sharply.
This has led them to cut sharply the level of new investments in high-risk
products, such as stocks and foreign securities.
The life insurance companies also have significant exposure to the faltering
domestic property market, through loans to corporations and non-bank
financial institutions.
In addition to their problems in the 1980s, life insurers have increased
investments in foreign securities and real estate, making portfolios
vulnerable to foreign currency movements.
The deterioration of asset quality also comes as the companies face
redemptions of the investment type insurance products with higher yields.
Moody's estimates that some Y10,000bn (Dollars 79.2bn) of investment type
products sold in the 1980s, will mature between this year and 1996. It says
that while the life insurance companies have significant liquidity and cash
flow, large fund withdrawals will squeeze profitability.
The life assurance industry, one of the country's most tightly regulated
financial sectors, also faces pressure from the deregulation.

<TEXT>
LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, yesterday reported a 3.1
per cent rise in pre-tax profits during the first half of 1992 to DM243m
(Dollars 152m) and said it expected another satisfactory result for the full
year.
Group turnover during the period rose by 12.5 per cent to DM3.5bn and Linde
said the figure for all of 1992 should be at least 10 per cent higher than
in 1991. Orders were up by 7.2 per cent to DM3.7bn, with the backlog at the
end of June totalling DM5.8bn, 11 per cent above the level at the start of
the year.
In the group's biggest division, materials handling, turnover eased by 1.4
per cent in the first half to DM1.55bn. Linde said domestic demand remained
strong, but some foreign markets weakened.
The company has announced plans to buy control of an Italian company in this
sector, Fiat OM Carrelli Elevatori, which has a turnover of DM319m and
employs 1,150 people.
Linde's industrial plant operation registered a 29 per cent rise in turnover
to DM516m, despite weak investment activity in the chemical and
petrochemical sectors. Sales of refrigeration systems were 13 per cent
higher at DM408m, with a 36 per cent jump in industrial gas turnover to
DM983m, partly reflecting the purchase of a majority stake in Hoek Loos, a
Dutch gas company.
Linde said its investments this year would be about DM800m compared with
DM711m in 1991.
HAKO, the electronics retailer, lost DM13.9m in the first half of 1992,
compared with a loss of DM22m in the previous corresponding half, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Hans Kompernass, management board chairman, said the loss from operations
and restructuring measures was DM12.7m. The remaining loss came from
write-downs in the value of shares and dollars held.

STAD Rotterdam, the medium-sized Dutch insurance group which is heavily
dependent on the domestic market, yesterday reported first-half net profit
up 3.9 per cent to Fl 42.5m (Dollars 26.23m) from Fl 40.9m.
Group income rose 7 per cent to Fl 1.3bn from Fl 1.2bn and earnings per
share stood virtually unchanged at Fl 1.61 against an adjusted Fl 1.60 for
the same period a year earlier.
Stad Rotterdam suffered from more frequent and expensive claims in the
non-life sector, largely from motor-ists.
The group expects an 'adjustment' in premium rates will be necessary during
the second half. Despite difficult conditions, Stad Rotterdam generated
higher business volume and reported a 7.1 per cent advance in premium income
to Fl 447.2m.
Profit in non-life operations fell by 4.2 per cent to Fl 16.6m. The
situation in motor insurance is not expected to improve before next year.
In the life insurance sector, premium income advanced 2.9 per cent to Fl
530.7m, but profit climbed 9.6 per cent to Fl 19.3m.
Income from investments was up 14 per cent to Fl 324.4m, and the group also
reported an upturn in profitable mortgage business. Stad Rotterdam
reiterated its caution that 1992 earnings per share will be unchanged from
the Fl 3.44 of last year.

POHJOLA, Finland's biggest insurance group, suffered an operating loss of
FM105m (Dollars 26.2m) in the first half of the year, it reported yesterday.
It made a FM1m profit for the same period of 1991. Net investment income
dropped to FM234m from FM317m.
The group said it would make a further loss this year. It blamed its
first-half deficit on 'the unfavourable development of foreign and domestic
credit insurance, unrealised losses on investments and the still low level
of realised gains'.
The group is affected by the wider Nordic insurance company crisis that has
hit Uni Storebrand and Hafnia Holdings. With a 10 per cent stake in Skandia,
Sweden's severely troubled insurance conglomerate, Pohjola faces further
uncertainty in the coming months.

<TEXT>
ELF AQUITAINE, the state-controlled French oil group, yesterday added to the
gloom in France's corporate sector by announcing a 23 per cent fall in
recurring net income to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 676m) in the first half of 1992
from FFr4.3bn in the same period in 1991.
The fall reflects the depressed tone of the stream of first-half results
from French companies.
Elf announced its interim results after the market closed and its share
price slipped by just FFr6.4 to FFr309.8 during the day.
The company, one of the first candidates for the French government's partial
privatisation programme with the FFr2.08bn sale of 2.3 per cent of its
shares, was hit in the first half by the general climate of economic
uncertainty, together with the weakness of the US dollar and of refined oil
prices.
Group sales rose to FFr98.86bn from FFr92.73bn but operating income slipped
to FFr7.91bn from FFr9.87bn (including an exceptional profit of FFr1.01bn on
the sale of Esys).
Earnings per share fell to FFr13 from FFr21.
The strongest area of activity was exploration and production where
operating income rose to FFr5.06bn from FFr4.54bn, chiefly because of an
increase in crude oil production sold and a reduction in exploration
expenses.
The only other division to muster an increase in income was human health
with a rise to FFr916m from FFr721m.
The refining division saw operating income fall to FFr580m from FFr2.69bn
(including the Esys profit), reflecting the reduction in margins from the
artificially high levels during the Gulf war in the first quarter of last
year.
Chemicals also suffered from a fall in margins, but limited the fall in
income to FFr1.31bn from FFr1.86bn. The eliminations division reported a
reduction in income to FFr43m from FFr53m.

TRYGG-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday reported a 24 per
cent drop in operating profit for the first half of the year to SKr894m
(Dollars 170m), down from SKr1.17bn for the same period of 1991.
But at the same time its subsidiary, the Gota financial group, announced a
huge SKr1.11bn loss for the same period, compared with a SKr807m deficit for
the first six months of last year.
After a SKr969m injection from a financial insurance package created by
Trygg-Hansa this summer to save Gota from collapse, the loss was much less
than the SKr2.08bn it would otherwise have been. Gota Bank suffered a
SKr884m financial loss in the first half compared with SKr689m for the same
period of 1991.
In its property and casualty insurance business Trygg-Hansa SPP increased
its income from premiums to SKr3.85bn from SKr3.58bn. Insurance claims
increased by 16 per cent to SKr3.14bn from SKr2.71bn due mainly to higher
losses in reinsurance but also to a large business volume.
Operating expenses amounted to SKr1.008bn, up from SKr979m. The operating
profit amounted to SKr647m, down from SKr1.499bn for the first six months of
last year. The fall was blamed on falling share prices.
The main difficulty for the insurance company will continue to lie with Gota
which it took into ownership this summer and which forms part of its banking
and finance operations.
From the end of last June Gota has been a subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa SPP and
its financial results will be consolidated.
Credit losses have been much larger than those sustained by other Swedish
banks but with Trygg-Hansa SPP's support it looks in better shape to weather
the storm than other commercial banks.
The value of Trygg-Hansa SPP's real estate portfolio declined by 5 per cent
in the first six months to SKr159m.
Earlier this month Trygg-Hansa SPP announced a new share issue of not more
than SKr2.525bn at SKr36 per share with the subscription period running from
September 14 to October 13.

FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: French results present gloomy
picture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRENCH companies continued yesterday to report lacklustre sales figures with
a number of industrial groups, including Compagnie de Navigation Mixte,
reporting flat or falling sales for the first half of the year.
Navigation Mixte, which has interests in finance, food and aeronautics, saw
its sales muster a negligible increase of less than 1 per cent to FFr8.71bn
(Dollars 1.74bn) in the first six months of 1992 from FFr8.63bn in the same
period of 1991. This means its interim turnover fell below inflation, now
running at an annual rate of around 3 per cent in France.
During the half Navigation Mixte, in common with many other French
companies, was affected by the sluggish state of France's economy. Low
inflation has helped French exporters to win back market share in the
international sphere, but their domestic market has been depressed by the
high cost of borrowing which has curbed industrial investment and dented
consumer confidence.
The CAC 40 Index, which has fallen sharply recently due to the dollar's
decline and nervousness about the outcome of next month's Maastricht
referendum, as well as the poor interim results, yesterday fell again by
3.12 per cent to reach its lowest level so far this year of 1,680.
Several other French groups yesterday disclosed disappointing interim
turnover figures. Gerland, the clothing company acquired by BP France,
announced a 2.3 per cent fall in turnover to FFr1.96bn in the first half.
Guyomarch, the food and agricultural products group, saw sales fall by 1.8
per cent to FFr3.42bn in the first six months of the year.
Metrologie International, the specialist information company which had
warned the stock market it expected a FFr60m interim loss this year,
reported an 18.1 per cent reduction in first-half sales to FFr1.74bn. Nord
Est, one of the holding companies associated with the Paribas banking group,
made sales of FFr1.93bn in the first half of 1992, after making several
disposals since last year.

first half

RABOBANK, the co-operative bank with strong roots in the Dutch agro-business
sector, yesterday reported a modest 2.6 per cent rise in first-half net
profit, marking a further slowdown in growth.
Net profit advanced to Fl 544m (Dollars 340m) from the Fl 530m reported for
the same period last year.
The Netherlands' second-largest bank, Rabobank forecasts full-year profit
will rise only 'slightly' over the Fl 2.18bn level reported for 1991, with
higher funding costs putting profit margins and interest income under
further pressure.
Total income rose 7.3 per cent to Fl 3.47bn. The rise in costs was 8.6 per
cent to Fl 2.29bn, primarily due to previously agreed pay settlements in the
banking sector.
Helped by higher volumes and income from commissions, profit for the six
months advanced by 4.8 per cent to Fl 1.17bn, a result directors described
as 'satisfactory' in light of moderate economic growth and unfavourable
interest rate developments.
Lending to the private sector rose by Fl 5bn during the first half to reach
Fl 142.7bn, and Rabobank expects 'a lower but still not insignificant
expansion in the business volume' for the rest of the year.
The bank put its balance sheet total at the end of June at Fl 224bn, against
Fl 217bn at the end of 1991.

ATLAS COPCO, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 32 per cent increase in profits (after financial items) for the
first half of the year to SKr603m (Dollars 115m) from SKr458 for the same
period of 1991.
Sales climbed by 5 per cent at the same time to SKr7.87bn from SKr7.50bn,
while orders rose by 4 per cent to SKr8.57bn from SKr8.24bn. Operating
profit increased by 32 per cent to SKr669m from SKr505m.
Earnings per share increased to SKr17.45 from SKr13.60, a rise of 28 per
cent.
The return on capital employed over the past 12 months was 14.3 per cent, up
from 12.9 per cent, and on shareholders equity 9.8 per cent from 7.8 per
cent.
The company reaffirmed an earlier forecast of an improvement in annual
profits.
It added that an increase in orders was expected as a result of its
acquisition of AEG's power tools operation from January 1 this year.
Despite its strong performance, Atlas Copco said the market for its
industrial products continued to be weak with a slight reduction in orders
in Germany, which is now its single largest market.
There was a marginal improvement in the US but in Asia the sales trend
remained strong although a slow down in demand was noticed in Japan and
South Korea.

FT  25 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar earners suffer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUGS group Glaxo was one of many big dollar earning stocks to lead the
London market down yesterday. The shares dropped 29 to 701p on turnover of
2.8m, and marketmakers said that around 20p of the fall represented the
tumble in the dollar over the weekend.
When dealing in Glaxo American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)  - the US
equivalent of shares  - ended on Friday night they stood at Dollars 27 3/4 .
One ADR represents two shares and so the equivalent UK price was around
720p. As trading in London began yesterday morning the slide in the dollar
meant that the equivalent UK share price had fallen to around 700p.
The effect is compounded by Glaxo's earnings profile. The group derives 40
per cent of turnover and around half of its profits from North America. On
September 10, it is expected to announce full-year results to end-June of
around Pounds 1.4bn.
Other dollar earners with ADR listings which were affected yesterday
included Reuters, down 27 at 1017p, ICI, 23 cheaper at 1089p, and Hanson
(deriving around half its earnings from the US), off 5 at 185 1/2 p
ex-dividend, an 18-month low.
Redland worries
A market preoccupied with worries about the security of dividends, after
recent cuts in payments by companies such as BP and Sedgwick, settled on
Redland as another stock in danger of reducing its dividend for 1993.
The chances of a 20 per cent cut in Redland's payment were highlighted by
Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker, and saw Redland shares fall to 374p before
a late rally left them a net 22 off at 381p. Turnover was a healthy 1.1m
shares.
Mr Robin Hardy, building materials analyst at Panmure, cited 'thin earnings
cover and the poor outlook in the UK' for the pessimistic stance on
Redland's dividend prospects. He also noted that the shares had performed
very strongly relative to the rest of the sector since its takeover of
Steetley, the brick manufacturer, earlier this year.
Other building analysts, however, adopted an opposite view to Panmure. In a
20-page research document Goldman Sachs described Redland as 'attractively
priced', adding that, should a recovery in the UK be further delayed, the
broad geological spread of its activities and strong financial position
restrict the downside.
Forte hints
Hints that Forte's negotiations to sell its Gardner Merchant subsidiary may
be entering a crucial stage gathered force, with some sources close to the
company indicating that an announcement was likely 'sooner rather than
later'.
Negotiations to sell Gardner and the airport catering businesses broke down
two months ago when Forte decided the Pounds 425m offer from Compass Group
was too low. The collapse of the talks hit Forte shares badly and sentiment
was further undermined by stock market criticism of the board's handling of
the situation. The shares improved 3 to 130p yesterday.
The threat of huge insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew, which was
hitting the coast of Florida as London markets closed, and worries about a
possible increase in UK interest rates left the composite insurers in
disarray.
Analysts estimated that damage to Florida alone could reach as much as
Dollars 6bn, and that if the hurricane extended to Texas and Louisiana then
the damages bill would almost certainly top Dollars 10bn and could possibly
reach Dollars 20bn.
Royal weakened 18 to 145p and General Accident 8 to 417p, but Guardian Royal
later rebounded to close only a shade off at 129p on the day.
Dealers were surprised at the resilience of most of the leading oil shares
which, in spite of the dependence on dollar earnings, outperformed the wider
market. Shell Transport was an exception, sliding 15 to 452p, with
specialists saying the stock had held up well as other oils plummeted
earlier this year. BP, still feeling the effects of another negative blast
from UK broking houses, lost 5 more to 185p.
Specialist metals refiner Johnson Matthey was one of the very few bright
spots in the UK yesterday, responding to a bounce in the Japanese stock
market. Japan is a big investor in platinum and Matthey is the world's
largest platinum marketing group. The shares firmed 2 to 385p.
Dollar-earning SmithKline Beecham held up well in light of the plunging US
currency. Analysts said the company had hedged itself effectively against
currency fluctuations. The 'A' shares dipped 7 to 454p and the units, which
tend to represent US interest, finished only 3 cheaper at 412p.
Water and electricity shares continued to benefit from their perceived
defensive qualities. Among waters, Northhumbrian put on 2 to 500p, Severn
Trent 3 to 422p and South West a penny to 424p.
Electricity shares also gained interest from institutions trading out of the
Electricity Package, which ceases to be traded on September 4, and into
selected electricity stocks. Midland gained 3 to 338p, Norweb 4 to 361p and
Southern 7 to 335p. The package declined 12 to 3283p.
George Wimpey suffered in an unhappy building sector, with a leading UK
broker turning bearish ahead of the interims. Worries about post-results
profits downgrades and the stock's recent outperformance left the shares
closing 13 lower at 99p.
A rumour that Bass was negotiating to buy a 25 per cent stake in a Dutch
hotel group further undermined the shares in an already weak drinks sector.
The stock retreated 19 to 502p.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton was heavily traded, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to
be active. The shares lost 5 to 207p on turnover of 8.7m.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Treasury urged to give Pounds 2bn salvation injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury should consider injecting Pounds 2bn into the economy to lift
output and employment over the next year, the National Institute review
says, Peter Marsh writes.
This call from one of Britain's leading economic think tanks will add to
pressure on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to use government measures to
hasten a recovery.
According to the institute, policies such as an increase in public-sector
capital spending or a temporary reduction in value added tax would help to
head off the possibility of a 'protracted recession'.
It adds: 'Demonstration of the willingness and the ability to intervene in
this way would help to rebuild the confidence of industry, and also to help
reconcile public opinion to the constraint of continued exchange rate
mechanism membership.'
The institute supports Mr Lamont's refusal to consider a devaluation of
sterling within the ERM, a measure some government critics believe would
permit a large cut in interest rates and so help an upturn.
'We do not accept the argument that recovery is possible only if interest
rates are cut sharply, or only if the pound is devalued,' the institute
says.
Among measures suggested by the institute to buoy the economy are loans to
housing associations and other housing bodies to increase the supply of
rented homes, and the deferral of tax payments by companies.
To keep neutral the overall effect on government borrowing, the institute
says the Pounds 2bn injection into the economy this financial year should be
countered by moves to tighten fiscal policy by an equivalent amount during
the two succeeding years.
In the absence of moves of this sort, the research body says the outlook is
gloomy. On current policies the economy will contract 0.5 per cent this
year, after a 2.5 per cent fall last year. Boosting demand through a Pounds
2bn fiscal package would increase output by 0.75 of a percentage point this
year, the institute says.
With an imminent reduction in Germany's high borrowing rates unlikely, the
scope for a cut in the UK's 10 per cent base rates during the rest of the
year is 'minimal'. Export growth will be constrained by the weak
international economy.
Consumer spending will remain depressed, partly because of the effects of
the large fall in personal wealth triggered by reductions in house prices.
Real net housing wealth - the value of the housing stock less outstanding
mortgage debt - fell 24 per cent between the peak in the third quarter of
1989 and the first quarter of this year.
As for next year, the institute expects a modest recovery with output rising
by 1.7 per cent, though unemployment will continue to rise to 3m by the
final quarter. Headline inflation as measured by the retail prices index is
likely to decline to 3.6 per cent by the end of this year and 2.8 per cent
by the end of 1993.
Over the next year, the outlook for spending by companies may 'now be rather
brighter' than for spending by consumers, the institute says. Many
businesses are benefiting from higher productivity among employees sparked
by lower wage inflation, together with a reduction in debts. However,
business investment is expected to remain depressed, with capital spending
by manufacturers likely to fall more than 9 per cent this year, and remain
flat next year.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tough task ahead for Lep chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the questions asked of Mr David James, right, at yesterday's Lep EGM,
was whether he would have time for the onerous task he had taken on, bearing
in mind his other chairmanships at Davies &amp; Newman and Eagle Trust, writes
Jane Fuller.
Part of his reply was that 'I probably work not less than an 80-hour week.'
His fees at Lep are Pounds 35,000 a month.
Altogether, the professional charges for the restructuring amounted to
Pounds 10.3m, which Mr James acknowledged might be 'a hard pill to swallow'
for shareholders.
They will have a chance to consider the 1991 accounts at another
extraordinary meeting, once the finalised figures have been signed off by
accountants Touche Ross.
Mr James mentioned that the new board would be reviewing the accounts from
previous years.
There was an 'enormous amount of investigative work' to do to see whether
any of the losses might be recovered. He had brought in a small team of new
executives, who were on subsidiary boards.
Two new non-executive directors would be appointed shortly.
Of the directors facing shareholders with him yesterday, Mr Michael Kirkman,
second from left, was re-elected at the brief annual meeting that followed
the EGM.
Also pictured, from left, are Mr Philip Hampton, a non-executive who was not
standing for re-election, Mr John East, finance director since December
1988, and Mr Peter Percival, company secretary since May 1978.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Yeoman postpones shareholder votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEOMAN Investment Trust has postponed for a week the shareholder votes on
plans to extend the life of the split capital trust until 1999.
The votes were deferred when it became clear that Orion Insurance, which
owns 24.1 per cent of the income shares, intended to vote against the
proposals, thus ensuring defeat for the board's plans.
Orion said it was unhappy about the level of capital cover on the revamped
income shares.
It was also concerned about the effect of corporate dividend cuts on the
trust's income stream.
Attempts will be made this week to try to place Orion's shares in the
market, before the extraordinary meetings resume on September 2.
Majorities of 75 per cent of income and capital shareholders are needed to
pass the resolutions.
Yeoman was due to be wound up this year.
Instead, under the proposals, capital shareholders were offered the chance
to convert their shares into zero dividend preference shares; up to 70 per
cent of the latter could then be realised for cash.
Income shareholders were not offered a cash exit.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels group, said Sodexho, the French catering company, has
expressed an interest in buying Gardner Merchant, its contract catering
subsidiary, writes Michael Skapinker.
The UK group said the French company was one of several which had approached
it to discuss acquiring Gardner Merchant but that negotiations were some way
from completion. Talks aimed at selling Forte's contract catering business
to Compass Group of the UK and ARA Services of the US broke down last month
when the two sides failed to agree on a price.
Mr Rocco Forte, chief executive, said he would like to sell Gardner Merchant
while retaining Forte Airport Services, which provides in-flight catering
for airlines.
He has said he would eventually like to see the airline catering business
floated, with Forte retaining a stake.

<TEXT>
BIRKBY'S fully underwritten Pounds 6m rights issue has been completed with
valid acceptances being received in respect of 1.02m shares, or 15.2 per
cent.
This included 1m shares for which Birkby, until June a private company into
which Finlan Group reversed, had received from Finlan shareholders. Some
5.71m shares will be allocated to the sub-underwriters.
Finlan was a property and building materials group. Birkby is a rental group
providing managed workspace, vehicle hire and instalment credit to small
businesses in the M62 corridor.
Mr William Cran, chief executive, said the rights proceeds would eliminate
group borrowings, including Finlan's Pounds 425,000 debt to FennoScandia
Bank, and provide working capital.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace Engineering pushed into the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPACE Engineering incurred a pre-tax loss in the year to April 30 as
exceptional rationalisation and redundancy costs of Pounds 981,000 partially
offset reduced administration expenses and interest charges.
The Wiltshire-based company's continuing activities  - it is now
concentrating on the electronics and aerospace sectors  - incurred a loss of
Pounds 64,000 against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.24m last time.
Discontinued activities produced a reduced deficit of Pounds 166,000.
Losses per share were 0.39p (earnings of 4.38p). A final dividend of 0.5p
(1.56p) is recommended, making a total of 1p (3.12p).
The figures were in line with warnings that the second half was unlikely to
show any improvement on the loss-making first six months, and the share
price doubled to 10p yesterday.
'We are still experiencing recession in most of our markets and cannot
predict the timing of any economic recovery,' said Mr John Davis, chairman.
'It seems unlikely that there will be any overall improvement in the
economic environment in 1992.'
The loss-making John Curran business has been sold, leading to a reduction
in borrowings of Pounds 585,000. Group borrowings overall have been cut by
Pounds 1.9m.
Following the failure of attempts to find buyers for the VFP Fluid Power,
VNE (Nuclear) and Ray Technologies companies, and the better performance
turned in by these subsidiaries in the second half, they will now be
amalgamated into one operating company on a single site.
Extraordinary costs of Pounds 1.28m related to the sale and closure of

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Stock Exchange keeps close watch on
Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange is keeping a close watch on events at Alliance Resources,
the oil and gas company which faces a winding up order from its former
broker, Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.
A letter signed by Mr John O'Brien just five days before he became chairman
of the London-listed company in May, sets out proposals for an eventual
all-paper bid by Alliance for the unlisted Manx Petroleum. The letter
describes an offer of 11 Alliance shares for every Manx share.
Mr O'Brien wrote the letter in his capacity as managing director of Manx,
the resource company which is chaired by entrepreneur Mr Algy Cluff.
The letter also sets out terms for a Dollars 200,000 (Pounds 105,000) loan
to Alliance, and arranges for monthly management fees of Pounds 10,000 to be
paid to Manx. These fees are to be paid in arrears beginning in April 1993,
according to the letter. The document also proposes a capital reorganisation
to enable Alliance to issue more shares.
The Stock Exchange is believed to be aware of the contents of the letter,
and the fact that the details were not made known to shareholders. However,
since Mr O'Brien was not a director of Alliance when the letter was written,
the company has not violated the Class Four rule. This requires that
transactions between connected parties be disclosed to shareholders and
possibly be subject to their prior approval.
The Stock Exchange is believed to have had extensive discussions with
Alliance and its current brokers, Shepards, over the conduct of future
transactions between the two companies.
Should any offer for Manx eventually be made, a Class Four circular and an
extraordinary meeting could be required.
Alliance, formerly a Canadian company called United North American
Resources, came to the London market in March 1991 with a capitalisation of
Pounds 8.8m. The shares were floated at 40p. It is in dispute with Gilbert
Eliott over fees arising from the flotation. The broker has lodged a
petition to wind Alliance up, failing payment of the fees.
Alliance operates oil and gas assets in Louisiana, but has been unable to
develop them fully after incurring debts in its flotation. Manx, which was
spawned by Cluff Resources and operates from Cluff's offices, claims a 5 per
cent interest in a gas licence in the Netherlands as its main asset.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Epwin moves ahead with 7% advance to Pounds
1.31m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EPWIN GROUP, the maker of PVC-u windows and doors, 'is a business with
stamina', said Mr Jim Rawson, chairman, as he revealed a 7 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992.
Profits of Pounds 1.31m (Pounds 1.23m) were struck on turnover 4 per cent up
at Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 19.7m), though last time's pre-tax line included a
Pounds 200,000 provision to cover the design, marketing and development
costs of a new window for sale to the new build market.
Currently this market accounts for almost no turnover at Epwin and Mr Rawson
said the company 'had gone out on a bit of a limb financially' with the new
product. However, he added that two of the top 10 house builders were giving
it trials.
The profits rise was spread across the group's other two markets  - home
improvements and the public sector  - which account for 80 and 20 per cent
of turnover respectively.
Mr Rawson said that the latter market had had 'a good run' in the late-1980s
before the introduction of poll tax, but that 'it was now falling off a
bit'.
Plastiseal, a rival in this market, went into receivership last week.
In home improvements, the group gained market share and held its prices. In
March, it moved up to the main market and launched a successful Pounds 5.4m
rights issue to fund the initial tranche of the Pounds 9.9m planned capital
expenditure for 1992-93.
Mr Rawson said that there was no recovery forecast for 1992 and that in
value terms the market fell 14 per cent in 1991.
The interim dividend is held at 2.1p, payable from earnings per share
slightly lower at 5p (5.2p) reflecting the increased capital.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lionheart bucks trend with advance to
Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE impact of recession on the home improvements and DIY sectors and
discounting by multiple retailers, Lionheart raised pre-tax profits from
Pounds 768,000 to Pounds 1.1m for the six months to June 30.
'Our three main businesses of home improvements and DIY, housewares and
retail systems have all been profitable in the first half,' said Mr Paul
Lever, executive chairman.
'Provided the normal seasonal up-turn in trade materialises from September
through to November, I expect a continuing improvement during the rest of
1992.'
Following a return to the dividend list in April after a three year absence
for reconstruction, there will be an interim of 0.2p.
Sales were ahead at Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 11m), against Pounds 32.3m for the
last full year.
The re-organisation of the housewares division is now nearly complete,
following the purchase of Croydex, the bathroom and household products
company, from Hanson for Pounds 7.7m a year ago.
Earnings per share came out at 0.48p (0.57p).

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tomkins chief salary hoisted to near Pounds
1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GREG Hutchings, chief executive of Tomkins, the industrial conglomerate,
had his pay hoisted 54 per cent to Pounds 995,000 in the year to May 2,
according to the annual accounts published yesterday.
Mr Hutchings defended the increase which was significantly larger than the
18 per cent rise in full year profits to Pounds 132m.
He said 'I am judged continually by results which are in the interests of
shareholders; if there is nothing for the shareholders there is nothing for
management.'
Mr Hutchings said there were no service contracts for any of the managers,
making it clear that the group would not put up with poor performance.
The main reason for Mr Hutchings' biggest ever pay award was the increase in
incentive compensation  - calculated by the increase in share price,
earnings per share and dividend  - which rose from Pounds 203,000 to Pounds
492,000.
'Its been a very good year for us which has obviously benefited me. One
shareholder has already congratulated me on my salary increase.'
With more than 70 per cent of profits and sales in the US, Mr Hutchings said
he was keen to make a UK acquisition which was beginning to look a more
realistic objective as the recession continued.
'It is interesting that the share prices of many UK companies have come back
to more realistic levels over the past few months.
'The price of some of the companies we are looking at still need to fall a
bit but there are now more opportunities'.
Ideally, he wants to make his enterprise 40 per cent UK, 40 per cent US and
20 per cent from the rest of the world, which implies sizeable acquisitions.
However, he made it clear that he would not be rushed into a big UK
acquisition.
'We have been lucky enough to generate sufficient cash not to need an
acquisition. If we had been forced to do one in the UK six months ago we
would now look pretty stupid.'
Tomkins has not made any substantial acquisitions since it bought Philips
Industries of the US in 1990. Mr Hutchings said it does not need another
sizeable acquisition to meet its target of out-performing the UK market in
earnings per share growth.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Beverley proposing capital restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEVERLEY GROUP has announced proposals for a capital reorganisation to
enable it to pay dividends.
In April, under its old Petrocon name, it failed to acquire James Wilkes, a
rival engineering group, in a hostile Pounds 35m bid.
In its recently published 1991 accounts, Beverley, which was acquired by
Petrocon in March for Pounds 2.68m, revealed a deficit on the profit and
loss account reserves of some Pounds 6.68m making dividend payments
impossible until future profits had paid off the shortfall.
To rectify this, the board has proposed reducing the share capital and
writing off the share premium account. This will result in a small reserve
of about Pounds 699,000 against which goodwill from future acquisitions can
be written off. The ability of the company to distribute this reserve will
be restricted by undertakings to the High Court.
Under the reorganisation, which is subject to shareholder approval at an
extraordinary meeting on September 15, existing shares of 12 1/2 p will be
sub-divided into one new ordinary of 7 1/2 p and one deferred of 5p.
Rights on the 7 1/2 p shares will be no different from those on the existing
shares, but they will be nominal on the deferred.
If the High Court allows, the deferred shares will then be cancelled  -
reducing the aggregate nominal value of the shares in issue from Pounds
4.35m to Pounds 2.61m  - and the Pounds 6.58m standing to the credit of the
share premium account written off.
After the cancellation of the deferred shares, there will be a Pounds
400,000 difference between the authorised and the issued ordinary share
capitals. At the EGM the board will seek approval to allot shares up to an
aggregate nominal amount of Pounds 130,000 until the annual meeting in 1993.
Yesterday Beverley's shares were unchanged at 10p.

FT  25 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Making management options crystal clear -
Tim Coone on the latest phase of Waterford's rationalisation proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOWN of Waterford in southern Ireland, was first known for its port
rather than its famous crystalware factory which, just a few years ago,
employed a third of the town's workforce.
The main road through the town, even today, leaves an overriding visual
impression of maritime bustle and cargo ships harnessed by hawsers to the
high street.
For the coachloads of foreign tourists though, the magnet for their
attention is the factory of Waterford Crystal, the troubled division of
Waterford Wedgwood, the Irish luxury crystal and ceramics manufacturer.
Last week the crystal division announced its fifth rationalisation plan in
as many years. The plan involves 500 redundancies by January from the 1,900
workforce, across-the-board wage cuts, and a five-year industrial peace
agreement. The redundancy scheme becomes compulsory next year. Rejection of
the plan by the trade unions could mean the death-knell for Waterford, one
of Ireland's best known companies and exporters.
At the height of the tourist season, there can be more visitors to the
factory in one day than there are people working in it. Now looking more
like a live exhibition in a museum, the glassblowers and cutters perform
their tasks impassively in front of silver-haired couples from the US,
excitable groups of gesticulating Italian teenagers, and wide-eyed Japanese
who ask their tour guides why men and not machines do these jobs.
Over in the office buildings Waterford's management team has been struggling
with the same question. Chronic cost problems have been developing for many
years but were masked in the late-1980s by the booming market for luxury
goods. The group's results were also helped by contributions from Wedgwood,
the English fine china maker it acquired for IPounds 260m in 1986.
But from that high point, life for the company has been far harder.
To bolster the group's finances in 1990, Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish
businessman, and Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, between them took a
29.9 per cent stake for IPounds 80m. And Waterford and Wedgwood were
separated into two virtually autonomous units.
Waterford Crystal has lost IPounds 66m in the past six years. Rising costs,
declining markets, and growing competition, exacerbated by the recession,
have gouged the company's balance sheet and forced a major reappraisal of
the company's future.
Some 1,000 of the workforce were laid off during 1987 and 1988, bringing
numbers down to 2,300. Then as further rationalisations and pay cuts were
planned in 1990, the employees revolted, ensuing in a bitter 14-week strike
which cost the company IPounds 10m. A voluntary redundancy scheme has seen a
further 400 go since then and short-time working was introduced in 1991.
A year ago the company introduced its new 'Marquis' range into the US market
and has had considerable success with it. Cut by machine in Germany and
Portugal, and made of lighter crystal than the traditional ranges made at
Waterford, it is marketed under the Waterford label but is cheaper and aimed
at the lower end of the market.
Losses have been trimmed substantially, falling to IPounds 1.2m last year.
But sales of the traditional lines have failed to pick up, necessitating
further restructuring.
Encouraged by its success with the 'Marquis' range, the company is now in
the process of introducing more stemware from Germany, partly
machine-manufactured, and which will substitute for some of the ranges
currently being produced at Waterford.
The redundancies and sourcing of stemware from outside Ireland has deeply
upset the trade union, although reaction on the shop floor is one of
resignation. 'We knew it was coming. It was just a matter of when,' said one
cutter who has worked 20 years for the company.
Fifteen to 20 years' service with the company is typical for most of the
glassblowers and cutters, all of whom have had to complete five-year
apprenticeships to gain their status as craftsmen. Most are middle-aged with
families and outstanding mortgages, and have few possibilities of finding
alternative employment.
Yet the onward march of technology and mass production techniques are making
their skills redundant. The replacement of ceramic cutting wheels with
diamond ones over the past two years for example has vastly increased
productivity. The present redundancy plan calls for a shedding of 180 of the
280 cutters' jobs.
The trade union, while recognising the problem, has not ruled out the
possibility of industrial action if the workforce decides to press for
better redundancy terms and job guarantees for the remaining 1,400
employees.
Mr Pat Fitzgerald, chairman of the factory's branch of the Amalgamated
Transport and General Workers' Union said: 'This is the fifth plan to save
the company. The trouble is we don't believe it is going to consolidate the
workforce at 1,400. The sourcing of stemware from Germany may end up in
further job losses. Come again in 18 months time, and we'll probably be down
to 900'. Mr Patrick Galvin, Waterford's chairman and chief executive, warned
last Friday that another strike would most likely finish the company.
Labour relations at Waterford Crystal have thus arrived at a showdown.
Acceptance of the new rationalisation plan by the workforce will give the
company a new lease of life, although it is becoming increasingly apparent
that lower-cost manufacture abroad will steadily displace production at
Waterford.
Market research has shown that most customers do not identify the brand name
with Ireland. Production could therefore be gradually moved to a country of
lower labour costs, such as parts of eastern Europe where there is already a
tradition of crystal manufacture, without affecting the brand image. This
would seem to be a logical and probable strategy, perhaps eventually only
retaining a much-reduced core of craftsmen to supply products for the most
up-market segments.
Sensing this to be the case, the union might prefer to opt for a radical
solution rather than a slow death of the factory by a thousand cuts. The
question then is could the company itself survive, shifting production of
its products to a foreign base in a much shorter period of time? Clearly
some tough negotiations lay ahead.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Banks move back to basics: David Barchard explains a retreat
from the marketing culture and a return to tradition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With his immaculate silver hair, designer suits, and smart Italian shoes, Mr
Don McCrickard. the TSB Group chief executive who resigned yesterday, always
seemed to belong more to Manhattan than to Lombard Street. A marketeer par
excellence, Mr McCrickard cut his teeth as a businessman in Procter &amp; Gamble
and American Express, rather than a provincial bank branch.
He devised the catchphrase 'That'll do nicely' which propelled the Amex
green card to market leadership in the 1970s and 1980s and the American
Express aura never deserted him. Under Mr McCrickard, TSB became 'The bank
that likes to say yes'.
When TSB's chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison announced yesterday that Mr
McCrickard was departing as TSB group chief executive after three years, it
was the latest of several signs that the UK clearing banks have jettisoned
the high-flown marketing culture to which they aspired during the 1980s boom
and are concentrating on the traditional business of managing the quality of
their assets, cutting costs, and widening margins.
Mr McCrickard's departure comes a few days after the resignation of the
other arch-marketeer in 1980s UK banking, Mr Kevin Gavaghan, the marketing
director of Midland Bank, the man who designed Midland's eye-catching
current accounts such as Vector and Meridian.
In Mr Gavaghan's heyday, Midland liked to think of itself as having closer
affinities to designer retailers, such as Sir Terence Conran's shops, than
to a traditional clearing bank. Today, like all the UK clearing banks,
Midland is extolling traditional banking skills such as the control of
lending procedures and setting charges at profitable levels.
'The banks and the building societies are suffering from a squeeze on their
margins which is forcing them all to reconsider their approach,' says Mr
John Cheese, marketing director of Barclays Bank.
Mr McCrickard has left his mark on TSB. Almost all the leading figures of
the pre-flotation regime were replaced by a new generation of McCrickard
appointees. A series of restructuring operations converted 70 fusty savings
banks and other companies into a clearly defined group, dominated by a
centralised retail bank.
However, hardly had TSB retail bank become more efficient than things
started to go seriously wrong at Hill Samuel, the loss-making merchant bank
which TSB had bought for Pounds 777m in 1987. Mr McCrickard admits some of
the responsibility was his.
In 1990 and 1991, Hill Samuel plunged into heavy losses as loans went sour.
As a result in 1991, losses of Pounds 419m at Hill Samuel dragged the group
into a humiliating pre-tax loss of Pounds 47m.
Another spate of executive departures accompanied the Hill Samuel losses. In
March 1990, the chief executive, Hamish Donaldson, was removed with almost
all his senior lieutenants. Of 70 directors, 15 were made redundant or took
early retirement.
The problems of Hill Samuel over the past year contrasted with a record of
steady profitability at TSB Retail Bank, run by Mr Peter Ellwood.
As the months passed, mutterings inside TSB Retail Bank have grown louder
that 'Group'  - shorthand for Mr McCrickard and others in the TSB head
office at Milk Street  - contributed little to the profit and loss account.
Mr Ellwood said yesterday that the retail bank and the group head office are
to be partially 'fused', involving yet another management reorganisation.
Yesterday he announced three priorities for TSB: to concentrate on
activities capable of generating a sustainable income; cut costs; and manage
risk better. He was speaking the language of bankers not marketeers.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Regulator rejects Uni rescue plan
</HEADLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSAL by the board of Uni Storebrand, the troubled insurer, for a
solution to the holding company's short-term liquidity crisis, was rejected
last night by Norway's Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission, the
finance regulator.
Uni's board has appealed to the finance ministry to overturn the regulator's
decision. A ruling from the ministry is expected by the time the Oslo bourse
opens today at 10am.
Uni's holding company has NKr3.6bn (Pounds 325m) in short-term loans
acquired to finance a NKr4.7bn purchase of a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia
Forsakrings AB, Sweden's biggest insurer. Some NKr1bn is due within the next
two weeks.
According to Mr Anders Echkoff, Uni chairman, the board proposed to sell on
commercial terms assets of the holding company, in the form of shares and
property, to two of the group's subsidiaries  - the international and
non-life insurance businesses.
The disposal included Skandia shares valued by Uni at between
NKr500-NKr600m. Mr Eckhoff said the Skandia shares were priced slightly over
yesterday's closing price of SKr62 on the Stockholm bourse.
The board's proposal was rejected by the BISC on the grounds that some of
the shares may be illiquid, Mr Echkoff said.
If the ministry does not back Uni's proposal, the company will be put under
the administration of the BISC  - which rejected the proposal in the first
place  - for being unable to meet its short-term debt obligations.
In this instance, the government would most certainly be forced to come up
with a solution to Uni's liquidity crisis - a move which it has sought to
avoid by leaving it to the company's board, owners and creditors.
Uni's creditors lost interest in helping the company when it became known
that there were some suggestions to break up the company and sell the life
insurance business to Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, which also has
financial problems.
Mr Echkoff said late last night that the proposal is the only alternative
that the board has to end the holding company's short-term liquidity
problems.

FT  25 AUG 92 / TSB Group replaces chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DON McCrickard is resigning as chief executive of TSB Group, to be
replaced by Mr Peter Ellwood, currently responsible for the group's retail
banking and insurance operations.
Mr McCrickard has faced criticism from past and present TSB employees in the
wake of the group's 1991 financial results, when it incurred a loss of
Pounds 47m. These losses stemmed from bad debt provisions totalling Pounds
432m on commercial loans made by its Hill Samuel subsidiary.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB's chairman, said Mr McCrickard would 'receive
compensation within the terms of his contract'. His annual pay, in a
three-year rolling contract, is Pounds 245,000, so compensation could
approach Pounds 750,000. In addition, Mr McCrickard has 655,000 shares under
option. At yesterday's TSB share price of 129p, unchanged on the day, the
options were showing a notional profit of approximately Pounds 20,000.
Sir Nicholas said there was 'no implication of criticism' in the
circumstances of Mr McCrickard's departure. He said that more than six
months ago he and Mr McCrickard had come to an understanding that 'the task
of the chief executive' was about to 'substantially change'. He added the
board approved the change three weeks ago.
Since TSB came to the stock market in 1986, almost every senior executive
has been replaced. Mr Ellwood said that his promotion to group chief
executive would lead to another management reshuffle, involving 'some
elements of fusion between head office in London and the retail bank's head
office in Birmingham'.
Sir Nicholas praised Mr McCrickard's achievements, which 'included radical
changes to the management structure of the group, the reversal of strategic
direction from a 'broadly based financial services group' . . . and
substantial changes to top management'.
But Sir Nicholas said Mr Ellwood  - whose expertise is in retail banking,
TSB's main business  - had become more suited to the role of group chief
executive, now the management structure has been simplified. Mr McCrickard
joined TSB in 1983 and became a group board director in 1987. In 1989, he
recruited Mr Ellwood from Barclaycard.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Bankers toughen stance on Efim loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN banks which lent to Efim, the Italian state holding company put into
voluntary liquidation last month, plan to demand full repayment of their
loans at their next meeting with the Italian Treasury.
Bankers representing the international banking syndicates in London stressed
their determination to press for full repayment of the loans on which Efim
defaulted when they meet representatives from the treasury and the Bank of
Italy next week.
However, it is clear each side is trying to play a strong hand ahead of the
talks. In Italy, reports have circulated that postponement of the meeting,
expected this week, stemmed partly from differences among foreign bank
creditors.
Japanese institutions are said to be particularly hawkish about full
repayment, but Italian officials say some US and UK banks are more flexible.
The Italian treasury announced earlier this month bonds would be issued to
cover Efim's borrowings. However, to the annoyance of the foreign banks,
interest rates on the bonds have been set below market levels.
Treasury officials have hinted they may be prepared to negotiate in the hope
of a compromise, but foreign banks said yesterday they wanted full
repayment.
'The banks want repayment in full as we don't want to suffer a loss in terms
of capital,' said one agent bank. 'We're not discussing a percentage loss,
we feel we should not take a loss at all.'
The five-year lira bonds would pay interest at 7.25 per cent annually, while
those in ecu would have a 4 per cent coupon.
One banker said: 'We're being offered an ecu bond paying 4 per cent whereas
under normal conditions a five-year ecu bond for Italy would be expected to
have a coupon of just over 8 per cent.'
The difference in interest rates between the bonds and market levels means
creditors will receive only about 80 per cent of the principal and interest
that would otherwise have been due.
Efim and its subsidiaries signed several syndicated borrowing facilities
with foreign banks. The wholly owned subsidiaries were able to borrow at
competitive rates on the strength of the Efim  - and hence Italian state  -
name, the bankers claim.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Rothschilds to inject fresh capital into Zurich bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS of Rothschild Bank in Zurich (RBZ) will inject new capital into
the bank following the discovery of larger loan losses than previously
reported.
Sources close to RBZ also confirmed yesterday that loans made by the bank to
companies in the troubled York Hannover property group led by Mr Karsten von
Wersebe infringed a Swiss Banking Commission regulation.
The regulation requires that no more than the equivalent of 20 per cent of a
bank's own capital be lent to a single creditor on an unsecured basis.
Some RBZ loans to York Hannover companies were secured, but the security
turned out to be without value.
The loans are believed to total Dollars 54m (Pounds 28m).
The source said that Mr Jurg Heer, a former RBZ senior executive who was
arrested in Zurich early this month on charges related to his conduct at the
bank, knew that the loans to these companies were being made, in essence, to
one group.
Last month, the bank revealed that a recent credit review had found that
some loans were not fully covered and so it quadrupled its annual provisions
in the year to March 31, 1992 to SFr99.8m (Pounds 39m).
It also dissolved its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves 'as a safety measure'.
The source would not reveal the level of the bank's capital or the amount of
the loans made to York Hannover companies.
He denied reports in Zurich that the total of RBZ's bad loans was in the
vicinity of SFr325m.
Even if all questionable loans turned out to be bad, the total would be
'considerably less' than that.
He acknowledged that the bad loans total was higher than the amount provided
for in the 1991-92 accounts, but it was less than the level of the bank's
total capital.
Nevertheless, new capital would soon be put in to the bank by its
shareholders, the source said.
A majority of the shares in RBZ is held by Rothschild Continuation, the
Swiss holding company which is controlled by the London Rothschild family.
The Paris Rothschild family and Mr Edmond de Rothschild of Geneva also hold
minority stakes.

<TEXT>
TRADING was suspended yesterday on the Oslo bourse in the shares and bonds
of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, following a collapse
in talks between the company, creditors and finance ministry officials.
The board was working last night to prevent the holding company falling
under the administration of the Banking, Insurance Securities Commission,
the finance regulator.
The suspension coincided with the disclosure that Uni's holding company is
suffering a liquidity crisis brought on by NKr3.6bn (Pounds 325m) in
short-term loans used to finance the company's failed raid on Skandia
Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. Uni last year paid NKr4.7bn for a
28.3 per cent stake in Skandia but efforts to force the Swedish insurer into
a pan-Nordic insurance alliance failed.
A Uni spokesman said yesterday the holding company had payments of 'some
several hundred million kroner' due to creditors this week and further
payments due in about two weeks.
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was briefed yesterday by Mr Sigbjoern
Johnsen, the finance minister, on Uni's financial problems. But, apart from
acknowledging hectic meetings at the weekend between Uni, finance ministry
officials and banks, the government has distanced itself from intervention.
It has said Uni's problems cannot be compared with last autumn's bank sector
crisis when the state transferred NKr6bn to prop up the banks.
The finance ministry said Uni's problems had to be solved by the company,
its owners and creditors and declined to comment further. During the weekend
the ministry sought to convince Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and
Sparebanken Nor to provide NKr500m each in loans to Uni. Talks are
understood to have broken down on the government's refusal to provide
guarantees for the loans.
Uni's board was meeting yesterday to determine its options to solve the
holding company's short-term liquidity problems which threaten plans for a
NKr2bn rights issue this year.
The company stressed yesterday the crisis in the holding company did not
affect the group's life insurance, non-life and international businesses.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Lep spells out its pattern of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEP Group, the freight forwarding and security concern, incurred large
losses partly because of a pattern of providing funding for new ventures
disproportionate to its share of the equity.
The catalogue of losses was spelt out to shareholders yesterday at an
extraordinary general meeting called to approve a financial rescue. Among
the unfortunate ventures were commercial property development in California,
garment companies in the US, Hungary and Malta, and a Tanzanian gold mine.
Often the group had only a minority stake, but a disproportionate liability
to provide financial support. Other losses ran to the duty payable on vodka
and cigarettes for Soviet soldiers in the former East Germany and the loss
on the sale of the company's Lear Jet.
The details of how Lep slid into more than Pounds 500m of net debt and
Pounds 109m of negative shareholders' funds were delivered by Mr David
James, chairman.
The rescue proposals, which entail about 25 banks swapping Pounds 180m of
debt for 85 per cent of the restructured company, were approved.
Last year Lep incurred a loss of Pounds 235.1m after Pounds 219.4m of
exceptional and extraordinary charges. The biggest write-off was the entire
US property portfolio, previously valued at Pounds 93.4m.
Mr James again warned shareholders that failure to approve the restructuring
proposals would lead to the group being wound up.
Among those who would suffer would be the 10,448 employees, trade creditors
owed tens of millions of pounds and the company's pensioners. The pension
fund's purchases of assets from the company had included an office called
Coombe Hill House. Its downward valuation had exposed the fund to a
potential deficit of about Pounds 6m had the company been wound up. Its
continuance left a deficit of less than Pounds 1m, which would be restored
over the next three years.
ADT, the security group which built up a 27 per cent stake in Lep and has
written off Pounds 65m as a consequence, abstained in the vote. Mr David
Hammond, its deputy chairman, suggested the banks should 'take more pain' as
they had not written off any money.

Yesterday's statement by Ofwat on the non-core activities of the water
companies will have come as little surprise to the market. The regulator
signalled his intention to tighten the rules in early May, and licence
changes proposed yesterday contain nothing nasty in the fine print. However,
the episode underlines Mr Byatt's determination to be tough on
cross-subsidies. Detailed scrutiny of transfer pricing and the dividends
flowing between the water companies and subsidiaries certainly imply a
greater reporting burden. The nagging concern is that the changes mark the
start of a more restrictive attitude towards non-core expansion and hence
contain the seeds of future conflict.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Arts: Life, near-death, sin and wickedness - Glasgow
Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ART Gallery and Museum, Kelvingrove, Glasgow, celebrates John Bellany's
50th birthday with a sumptuous exhibition entitled 'A Long Night's Journey
into Day' (until Sunday). Bellany has created his own legend from the time
when, as a student at the Edinburgh College of Art, he hung his paintings on
the railings outside the Royal Scottish Academy as a protest against the
prevailing stuffiness inside. His art and his life are inextricably bound
up, and he has acted out his life on the canvas as tempestuously as did Van
Gogh. The work is the man and vice versa.
The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first room consists of 18
oil paintings from the 1970s announcing the themes which have consumed him
throughout his life: sin and guilt, stemming from his strict Calvinist
upbringing, and man's innate wickedness, with which he was confronted on a
visit to Buchenwald in 1967.
In these paintings, Bellany's chief theatre of operation is the bed, upon
which birth, sex and death are enacted, usually by surrogates  - symbolic
creatures nearly all drawn from the sea, reflecting his childhood in the
fishing village of Port Seton, Lothian. Lobsters and skates perform
unnatural acts with a peculiar joylessness; a dog is ensconced in the lap of
a naked woman who sits on a sofa resembling a deliquescent lump of meat  -
shades of Francis Bacon. 'You're 30 Today, John' is a lugubrious comment on
la comedie humaine, the shrouded figure of the artist supported by a fish
and a monkey.
The next room is the kernel of the exhibition. By 1984 he had become
seriously ill, though he never ceased painting, sustained by his wife Helen,
whose calm strength is celebrated in an iconic portrait of a modern madonna.
By 1987 he shows himself holding a watch: time is clearly running out. The
following year he underwent a life-saving liver transplant. The watercolours
he painted of his post-operative self, oxygen-masked, tubed and stitched,
are emotionally raw and profoundly moving.
The third room is alight with optimism. 'You're 50 Today, John' epitomises
the distance travelled in the intervening 20 years. The man is substantial,
instead of shrinking, and saturated blues and oranges replace rancid greens
and yellows. Bellany affirms his faith in painting as a means of portraying
ultimate truths, aligning himself in the tradition of the Old Masters, such
as Rembrandt, Titian, Rubens and Delacroix, whom he has never ceased to
revere.
He returns in 1992 to his roots in Port Seton, reworking themes first
painted in the 1960s of fish gutting and curing, now celebrated in radiant
colours. A sardonic sense of humour, and a lively sense of the absurd,
redeems the lushness of the imagery from any danger of sentimentality.
Tony Cragg's sculpture is being exhibited at the Centre for Contemporary
Arts (ex Third Eye Centre) and at the Tramway. Cragg is probably the most
form-inventive sculptor working on the international scene and the scope and
variety is admirably demonstrated in the echoing barn-like space of the
Tramway.
The earlier pieces are reassuringly familiar  - the jostling, wall-mounted
crowd scene made from bits of coloured plastic of 1984, the hugely oversized
eyebath in cast iron of 1986, the bronze turnip-lantern heads, cast from
sugar beets (1987) and the elegant 'Minster,' a post-modern version of the
Towers of Trebizond, which graced the roof-terrace of the Hayward Gallery in
1987. Thereafter, we are towed along in the wake of his fertile imagination.
Cragg represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1988 and won the Turner
Prize in the same year; yet the vast majority of his exhibitions have been
outside the UK and Glasgow is the only venue for this show. Cragg's declared
aim is 'the creation of objects that do not exist in the natural or in the
functional world, which can reflect and transmit information and feelings
about the world and my own existence.' Preconceptions as to how we perceive
the world about us are thereby overturned.
There is no hierarchy of materials in Cragg's work. He is equally at home in
bronze, steel, glass, wood, stone and plastic, but in each case any
suggestion of the mimetic is undermined by a certain perversity in the use
of that material. 'Branching Form,' in steel, is like a diagram of blood
vessels in three dimensions; 'Bodicea,' in wood and steel, resembles a sea
slug heaving itself over an object on the sea bed.
He uses gigantism to make a pyramid of rubber stamps in steel, ironically
entitled 'Subcommittee', and a Sony Walkman evolves from a three-foot-square
block of black limestone, alternately shiny and matt, with all the knobs,
leads, grooves and batteries clearly delineated.
Though resolutely committed to modernism, Cragg can still indulge in
art-historical appropriation. 'Spyrogyra' is a spiral of spiked steel on
which are impaled a number of odd-shaped, sand-blasted bottles, a somewhat
threatening reference to Duchamp's 'Bottle Rack' of 1913. The difference
lies in the opposition of Cragg's carefully assembled piece and Duchamp's
cheeky 'found object,' presented as a work of art because it was declared to
be so by the artist.
Perhaps the most accessible pieces are the traditional bronzes, huge
distorted blow-ups of laboratory equipment yielding zoomorphic and
anthropomorphic associations which allow the viewer, as Cragg would like,
'to get involved with the sculpture.' The exhibition runs until September 6.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Arts: Janacek &amp; Rossini - Salzburg Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the House of the Dead, Janacek's last opera, can rarely have been
mounted so generously as by the Salzburg Festival this year. With Claudio
Abbado conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, Nicolai Ghiaurov  - as
Gorianchikov, the aristocratic prisoner in Dostoievsky's Siberian
convict-camp  - leads a cast with distinguished singer-actors even in very
brief roles. To name only a few: Barry McCauley, Philip Langridge as
Skuratov, Alexander Oliver, Heinz Zednik and Elzbieta Szmytka (the Serpetto
in Finta Giardiniera) as the boy Alyeya.
The huge stage of the Grosses Festspielhaus, Karajan's folie de grandeur, is
not an obvious venue for this intense but plotless little opera. Some
British colleagues complained that Eduardo Arroyo's bare sets  - a stark
prison compound with one gigantic tree (crowded with sinister black birds in
the final scene), a long, bleak beach for Act 2  - were too open and airy;
but perhaps that betrayed a British view of prisons. There is a lot of room
in Siberia: the horrors of the Dostoievsky camp had little to do with
space-shortages.
Correspondingly, and more controversially, Klaus Michael Gruber's production
proceeds in deadly calm. Physical brutality is at a minimum: even the
ghastly flogging of Gorianchikov on his arrival was reduced to two offstage
howls. There is little sense of pent-up communal violence. Instead, each
prisoner seems locked into his own private anguish.
That seems true enough both to Dostoievsky and to Janacek. The greater part
consists, indeed, in impassioned monologues  - reminiscent, grievous,
tortured or comic. Gruber gave them undistracted room. After McCauley's and
Langridge's sterling vignettes, Monte Pedersen crowned the opera with a
superbly sustained and beautiful account of Shishkov's wrenching narrative.
Clearly Abbado wanted this to be a lyrical House of the Dead above all.
In practice, there was one severe drawback: much of the audience could have
had only the vaguest idea of what the singers were on about. They sang in
the original Czech; surtitles for a multi-national audience would have been
impossible; the synopsis in the evening programme-book was wretchedly
inadequate, and there were no intervals between acts which could have let
German-speakers catch up with the libretto printed in the programme, or
others at least consult the confusing synopsis again.
A noble project, then, but not audience-friendly. There is a continuing
problem about programmes at Salzburg. The comprehensive, all-in
programme-book has much better synopses (and a fascinating essay on Janacek
by Milan Kundera, among others)  - but it is heavy and cumbersome, mostly in
German, costs the earth and has outdated cast-lists. As the leads in the
concert performances of Rossini's Tancredi in the Felsenreitschule, for
example, some of the audience will have thought they were hearing Marilyn
Horne and Edita Gruberova - who had walked out as the season began, to be
replaced by young Vesselina Kasarova and Nelly Miricioiu.
Salzburg really must adopt the Munich and Bayreuth habit of posting up the
actual cast-list for the evening. (If memory serves, they used to.)
Meanwhile, the Tancredi audience may have been underinformed, but not
disappointed. Miricioiu, now in the prime of her maturity, was an exquisite
Amenaide, full-voiced and imaginatively delicate as required. Her vocal art
is assured, her musicianship complete; and she played with the utmost
generosity to her young mezzo Tancredi.
The petite Kasarova is a creature of formidable promise, trumpet-voiced in
the heights and astonishingly powerful in the depths: her runs over two
octaves were terrific. (It was rotten luck that persistent church-bells from
somewhere nearby intruded upon her 'Di tanti palpiti'.) As Argirio, Donald
Kaasch wielded a Rossini tenor of bright timbre, with a useful cutting edge,
and a considerable sense of style; he must, however, learn to articulate
rapid scales before it is too late.
The bass-baritone David Pittsinger made a fine, stentorian sound as
Orbazzano, a further asset to the performance. Unlike Pinchas Steinberg's
conducting  - which was at best efficient, more often ponderous and
plonking, with a deplorable penchant for gross, un-Rossinian rallentandi at
the ends of numbers. He is down to conduct Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco next
Festival: why on earth?

FT  25 AUG 92 / Business Law: Hidden menace to land values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW MITSON and ANDREW WAITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That bug-bear of the property industry, registers of potentially
contaminated land, has resurfaced in a consultation paper which was issued
by the Department of the Environment on July 31.
The registers are to be maintained by local authorities under section 143 of
the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and will contain details of land which
is contaminated, or has been used for any specified industrial purpose which
may cause contamination. Under the new proposals the registers are now
likely to include far fewer sites than previously envisaged.
The government's original proposals, which emerged last year, were met with
howls of protest from the property sector and were eventually withdrawn.
Under those proposals, a property would have appeared on the registers if it
were currently or had at any time in the past been put to any one of a long
list of uses. That list included not only obvious polluting industries, such
as oil refineries and gas-works, but also less obvious candidates, such as
dry cleaners and demolition sites.
The result would have been the inclusion of a vast number of sites in the
registers, raising fears of widespread blight and a fall in property prices.
The government's initial response to these concerns was to point out that
inclusion on the registers would not mean that the property concerned was
necessarily contaminated, only that it might be contaminated due to its
previous use. That did not allay people's fears, however.
The new proposals issued by the Department of the Environment reveal
significant changes from the earlier consultation paper. There are three
major changes.
First, 'the list of contaminative uses has been reduced to those where there
is a very high probability that all land subject to those uses is
contaminated unless it has already been appropriately treated.'
According to the department's estimate, the registers are now likely to
cover only 10 to 15 per cent of the area affected by last year's
consultation paper.
The new list of contaminative uses comprises gas, coke, bitumen, lead, steel
and asbestos works, oil refineries, most chemical works, landfill sites,
waste incinerators, plants for the chemical treatment of waste and scrap
metal yards.
Those who have escaped the department's attentions on this occasion should
not take undue comfort as 'the government has it in mind to extend the list
of uses by further regulations in due course in the light of experience'.
The second key change from the earlier proposals is that local authorities
will be required to take reasonable steps to notify owners or occupiers of
their intention to include land on the registers before the entry is made.
That will give those persons affected sufficient time to make any objections
in an endeavour to convince the local authorities that particular sites
should be excluded.
An unsatisfactory aspect of this proposal is that no statutory appeal
machinery is provided. It is considered sufficient that owners affected can
take their cases to the local ombudsman or seek judicial review. However,
the local ombudsman can only deal with cases of maladministration and will
have no powers to direct that property be delisted.
Judicial review is equally inappropriate as it is intended as a means of
identifying flaws in the procedural processes adopted in reaching decisions
rather than in the merits of decisions themselves. In any event, the courts
are already overloaded with such cases. It would seem much more sensible to
appoint a special tribunal to deal with these cases, possibly comprising one
or more surveyors.
The third major difference is that the registers are to be split into two
parts, A and B. Part A will deal with land which has not been investigated
or treated. Part B will cover land which has been investigated and/or
treated for contamination. The existence and whereabouts of any available
reports will also be noted.
In other respects the proposals are similar to those issued last year. The
local authorities will not give any guarantee as to whether decontamination
work has been successful. Once a site has been entered on the register it
will not be possible to remove it.
Two reasons are given. First, factual information on the history of the site
will be required when a change of use is proposed in the future. Secondly,
contamination may have migrated from the site to adjacent areas. The owners
of those sites and regulatory authorities and developers will need to use
the registers to identify those sources of contamination.
However, many people are likely to find that aspect of the proposals
unsatisfactory. No doubt there will be demands for further thought to be
given to overcome this concern so that 'cleaned' sites do not remain
blighted.
The Department of the Environment hopes to have the new regulations in place
by the end of 1992, with a view to opening the registers to the public
around April 1994.
The registers are also regarded as 'part of a wider strategy to tackle the
country's legacy of contamination'. A programme of research is being carried
out aimed at providing further guidance on the assessment and treatment of
contaminated land. As a result, priorities for action will be drawn up.
What is not made clear is who is to pay for any remedial work carried out.
There already exists a wide range of provisions in different environmental
statutes under which polluters, owners or occupiers of the site may be
liable for the costs of clean-up, depending on which authority takes action,
under which legislation and under what circumstances.
The government should give serious consideration to rationalising the
current diverse legal provisions. A clear philosophy should be adopted as to
who is to be responsible for decontamination.
Should historic contamination which is not the fault of the present owner
(who may not have paid a reduced purchase price) be the responsibility of
the private or the public purse? The Department of Environment may be
groping towards answers to these questions, but if so, they are keeping
their thoughts to themselves for the present.
It is inevitable that the revised proposals will raise the question of
blight once again, even if not to the extent caused earlier. This is
something that the government will have to take seriously.
Although only a limited number of sites are to be included on the registers
in the near future, others will follow in due course. This is likely to have
an adverse impact on the property market at a time when it urgently needs a
boost.
If the economy continues in recession, there will be little money or
inclination to deal with pressing environmental concerns. For that reason,
the government must educate the public to understand that the real problem
is not the registers but existing land contamination.
What is abundantly clear is that the issue of contaminated land has come to
stay, with or without the proposed registers.
In almost all transactions involving the transfer of land, the question is
asked: is the land likely to be contaminated? If it is, the purchaser will
normally require a reduction in the purchase price, an assurance that the
vendor will pay for any necessary clean-up works or an indemnity against any
liabilities which may fall on the purchaser.
One of the principal difficulties at present is uncertainty over whether
potential liabilities for cleaning-up contaminated land are likely to
materialise. The answer can only be known when the government, in
conjunction with the authorities concerned, produces a clear policy
statement of its proposals for dealing with contaminated land.
Once clear policies and priorities are established, uncertainties will
disappear and the fear of blight will recede. For the time being, all
purchasers of land should beware.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Technology: A show called vested interest - A Swedish group
has come up with a digital HDTV standard that casts doubt on the EC's plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is in danger of falling behind the US and Japan in the emerging
market for high-definition television. While the prospects for the planned
European HDTV programme remain uncertain, the Japanese public broadcasting
corporation, NHK, has already started broadcasting weekly programmes in high
definition while the US has forged ahead with plans to introduce a digital
HDTV standard.
Now a Scandinavian group  - which includes the Swedish Broadcasting
Corporation, the Swedish Television Company, Swedish Telecom Radio and Telia
Research, the R&amp;D subsidiary of Swedish Telecom  - has been working on a
digital HDTV system that could cast further doubts on the wisdom of pursuing
a two-step gradual approach based on an analogue standard, known as Mac
(multiplexed analogue components).
The group has developed a prototype system for digital terrestrial HDTV
called HD-Divine (digital video narrow-band emission). The system, which was
demonstrated at the International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam last
month, has aroused considerable interest in the US as well as in Europe.
'This could very well mark the turning point in European thinking concerning
HDTV transmission,' commented George Waters, director of the European
Broadcasting Union's technical department.
But Per Appelquist, head of research and development at Swedish Television,
does not expect the HD-Divine standard to be adopted by the EC. 'It is
politically difficult for a Scandinavian system to be adopted in Europe,' he
says.
Having invested huge amounts of money and time on the Mac standard, European
consumer electronics companies, specifically Philips and Thomson, are
unlikely to want to adopt a different system.
While Philips and Thomson are both involved in developing digital systems,
through EC programmes such as Race (the EC's R&amp;D programme in advanced
telecommunications), they have relegated those developments to the back
burner and say they do not expect digital television to become a reality
until well into the 21st century.
Europe's plan for a step-by-step approach to improving TV picture quality
using a partly-analogue system has met with industry resistance.
Broadcasters are reluctant to invest the huge sums needed to adopt the
European standards and consumer appetite for expensive new electronics
products is at a particular low.
Unlike the EC's Mac standard, which would be introduced gradually, the move
to digital television proposed by the HD-Divine project would mean one big
leap forward to a completely new standard.
HD-Divine also differs from D2-Mac (the standard adopted for wide-screen
broadcasts) and HD-Mac (to be used for high-definition broadcasts) since it
was designed specifically for terrestrial broadcasts rather than for
satellite. This would make it less expensive for broadcasters to transmit
programmes and for viewers to receive them.
Like the analogue standard, digital HDTV offers clear, crisp pictures. But
it would also provide CD-quality sound and would make more efficient use of
channels.
The system developed by HD-Divine, for example, could increase the number of
channels to about 40 from the current four on the existing Pal standard for
terrestrial broadcasts. This is possible because the digital signals would
be constructed in such a way as to minimise the interference between
signals.
Although there are 44 UHF channels used for broadcasting on the Pal system,
they cannot all be used due to the possibility of signal interference
between one channel and another. By sending the signals over hundreds of
carriers, digital television can make use of so-called 'taboo channels',
which would normally need to be kept free to avoid interference.
Digital television could lead to further developments based on the capacity
of digital signals to hold vast amounts of information. For example,
multimedia applications which allow the viewer to manipulate the material on
the television screen is one possibility.
Instead of turning the channel to find a news programme, viewers could do a
'news search' in the same way that CD players offer a 'track search' to
receive information on what news programmes are being broadcast on what
channels, says Henry Price, head of engineering information at the BBC.
Since telecommunications and computers are also based on digital technology,
a digital television system would also allow easier access to these
communications systems.
If digital television offers so many advantages, why have European consumer
electronics manufacturers backed a partly-analogue system that is likely to
become obsolete?
The main reason is that digital technology is still considered to be many
years away. European manufacturers, feeling threatened by Japan's head-start
in HDTV, wanted a system that could be introduced in a relatively short
amount of time.
One of the main difficulties faced in developing a digital television system
is to compress a vast amount of information into digital signals. HD-Divine
has achieved this by doing away with 98 per cent of the information,
explains Appelquist.
This is possible because much of the data sent down the line are redundant.
If there are several picture frames in which the sky is blue, for example,
it is not necessary to keep sending the signal for a blue sky for each
successive frame. By using techniques which enable the receiving end to
'guess' the content of a subsequent picture on the basis of the previous
picture, the HD-Divine project has been able to reduce significantly the
amount of information that needs to be transmitted down the spectrum.
Another hurdle that needs to be overcome in digital terrestrial broadcasting
is multipath propagation  - or echoes which result from signals reflecting
off various obstacles along their path, such as buildings and bodies of
water.
Normally, in analogue systems, signals that are reflected in this way cause
'ghosts' which appear as white shadows on the television screen. This
happens because the reflected signal arrives later than the other signals
and is interpreted as an 'echo' to the main signal.
HD-Divine overcomes this problem by inserting what it calls a guard interval
between each of the data symbols. This ensures that the time interval
between signals is levelled out so that signals are read simultaneously.
After the successful demonstration in Amsterdam, the HD-Divine group has
already been approached by a number of parties interested in participating
in the project.
It is not looking to the EC for funding, as this would only lead to
unnecessary bureaucracy and inevitable delays, it says.
But digital television still faces stiff tests before it can be considered a
viable alternative to conventional TV. 'It shows enormous promise but a lot
of testing needs to be done,' says Price. Digital TV is probably possible in
a laboratory environment but more tests need to be carried out to see if it
works in a commercial environment.
'It will take eight to 10 years before digital TV standards are set. By that
time D2-Mac and HD-Mac will have firmly established themselves,' says a
Philips representative. Philips believes digital television is more suited
to mobile applications, such as portable televisions in the car and
'watchmen,' or plugless TV receivers.
However, the longer the European HDTV programme remains stalled, the greater
is the appeal of taking one big leap forward to an advanced television
system that not only looks further to the future but also addresses the
predominantly terrestrial audience in Europe.

Speaking

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the rising stars of the high-technology field, the grey hairs of
experience seldom command respect. Indeed, several of the most celebrated
achievers of the information age are remarkable for their youth.
Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computer at the tender age of 20. Bill Gates,
the software billionaire, is only 36 and Scott McNealy, the president of Sun
Microsystems, has turned 37.
Their companies, along with many others in growth segments of the computer
industry, are imbued with a culture that reflects the youth of their
founders. They are supremely confident and scorn the formality of more
mature businesses. While by no means all of their employees are fresh faced,
the average age is seldom much higher than that of the chief executive.
In part, the predominant role of young men in high-technology industries can
be explained by the fast pace of innovations that give young engineers, just
out of university with knowledge of leading-edge technology, an advantage
over their older colleagues whose formal education is rapidly outdated.
At its best, the youthful spirit of segments of the high-technology industry
gives them energy and drive. At its worst, however, the industry culture
harbours subtle age discrimination.
Too often, young executives will say that they have to avoid hiring
individuals with more than a few years' experience at an 'old line' computer
company, claiming that such people are likely to be stuck in their ways.
In effect, this limits the opportunities of those who in mid-career hope to
join a company with stronger growth prospects.
By not offering pension plans, companies can also effectively select only
those young enough, or rich enough, not to worry about retirement.
Nevertheless, experienced and older executives should play a valuable role
in young companies. In the US, for example, many venture capitalists have a
long career in high-technology behind them. Having recorded their own
achievements and made their own mistakes these veterans are well placed to
offer counsel to the next generation of industry entrepreneurs.
They also provide fledgling companies with valuable contacts, opening doors
that might otherwise be closed to newcomers.
In the UK, this valuable source of knowledge and experience is
less-frequently tapped. However, a new network of independent consultants
aims to make the talents of some of the industry's more senior, yet hardly
old, citizens available to companies.
CH Business Development, founded by Tim Wickes, a veteran of high-technology
marketing, has established a register of consultants for use by
information-technology users, suppliers and service companies.
'Two of the main qualifications that we look for in potential team members
is sound business experience in executive 'hot-seats', integrity and plenty
of 'grey hair',' says Wickes.
It is often easier for a managing director to accept advice from a seasoned
consultant than from a team of bright young business graduates, Wickes
suggests.
Robin Laidlaw, formerly director of information technology at British Gas,
is one of the management consultants on the CH list. 'Our approach,' he
explains, 'is to be an extension of the chief executive's office. Most chief
executives wish to review how their organisations should reflect such things
as technology changes. However, in today's demanding environment where the
day-to-day pressures are so great, there is often too little time for
adequate strategic thinking.'
Whether as a consultant, a venture capitalists or a non-executive director,
the older industry executive has much to offer. To ignore this source of
expertise would be a detriment to the entire computer industry.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicola Horlick, 31, (right) hired a year ago by Morgan Grenfell to beef up
its UK specialist pension fund management performance, has been promoted to
managing director of Morgan Grenfell Investment Management (MGIM), in charge
of the overall UK pension fund business. She replaces 46-year-old Neil
Dunford (left), who is moved to the new position of MGIM deputy chairman.
Morgan Grenfell's UK pension side has long trailed behind its highly
successful international investment management. 'The good people have always
wanted to go into international' observes Horlick, who was recruited from
Mercury Asset Management, where she had been in charge of the 'specialist'
team and Pounds 6.5bn of funds. Until now looking after the UK 'specialist',
or performance, side at Morgan (involving some Pounds 600m in client funds)
she now assumes responsibility for the standard 'balanced' funds as well,
and accounts worth a total of Pounds 5.3bn. 'I am here to get the balanced
side really going'.
Keith Percy, boss of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (encompassing both
international and UK fund management, of some Pounds 17bn) and chairman of
MGIM, claims 'the total UK performance is up a quartile since I joined two
years ago, but equity selection in the 'balanced' funds has still been
disappointing'. Looking for a more 'cohesive' management structure, he says
there had been 'three of four senior people below Dunford, and I felt one of
them should have the final say on investment matters.'
Horlick, a law graduate who came to the City by way of a year selling animal
feeds for her father's nascent business, has not looked back since joining
MAM - where 'she had a fantastic track record ' according to Percy. Mercury
has recently lost several people, including Leonard Licht, her former boss,
who went to the small fund management operation Jupiter Tyndall.
Countering the impression that Dunford - whose background is Schroders and
Scottish Widows - has been side-lined, Percy says he only did not give
Dunford the MGIM chairmanship because he wanted to avoid the industry
concluding he, Percy, was distancing himself from the UK business.

Spring Ram Corporation, the bathrooms and kitchens group, has recruited
three subsidiary directors from rival companies.
As the production director of Fordham Bathrooms, Alex Gemmell, 52, will
supervise the commissioning of a 550,000 sq ft bathroom factory at Bradford.
Gemmell was previously a production director with Armitage Shanks, part of
Blue Circle Industries.
The factory building is due to start this autumn and to be completed 18
months later. It will absorb the bulk of the Pounds 45m capital spending
that Spring Ram has scheduled for next year.
Fordham Bathrooms came into Spring Ram last year via an acquisition from
Hepworth, the building materials group. Bill Rooney, Spring Ram chairman,
said Fordham's main thrust would be to sell into the builders' merchant
sector of the bathrooms market.
Robin Trotter, 39, has been recruited from Carron Phoenix, the sink
subsidiary of the Swiss company Franke Holdings, to become managing director
of Astracast, Spring Ram's asterite sink company. He fills a vacancy created
by the recent appointment of Ron Farr to the main board.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A brief to beef up the
boardroom - Diane Summers says that non-executive directors have much to
offer small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The portentous phrase 'corporate governance' is not constantly on the lips
of every small business person. Recent debate on improving corporate
reporting and strengthening the roles of auditors and non-executive
directors has been conducted at a rarefied level and has concentrated on
listed companies.
Now, however, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (Cima) is
attempting to widen the debate and make it of more practical application.
Cima claims, in particular, that there are positive business advantages to
be gained from involving non-executive directors from the earliest stages of
a company's development.
The emphasis on policing  - safeguarding public interest  - has meant that
the non-executive director's other role, as a provider of independent
financial advice, has been obscured, argues the institute.
Cima says the non-executive director may be able to offer the growing
company:
Business advice based on experience and knowledge. The non-executive
director can provide an objective assessment of executive management so that
the best use can be made of existing staff. Financial expertise for
management purposes and to meet statutory requirements. Non-executive
directors can help ensure goods and services are costed and priced properly.
Checking effective credit control and 'strengthening the resolve of
executive management in the event of late payment', may also be a useful
function.
Non-executive directors can keep an eye, too, on the planning and submission
of regular returns, such as VAT, PAYE and National Insurance contributions.
Guidance on good management practice, personnel policies and compliance with
British and European standards and health and safety regulations.
'Guardianship' on issues such as pay and pensions. Non-executive directors
can help ensure management rewards are not at the expense of shareholders or
staff; that profit-related pay schemes have a defined range; that staff
working conditions and terms of service are of an acceptable standard and
that proper arrangements for pensions are made.
As far as the choice of non-executive directors is concerned, Cima advises
businesses to look at the overall balance of skills and experience of their
management teams and then attempt to fill the gaps.
A team of non-executive directors in a medium-sized or larger company could
have some or all of the following: a director well-versed in the
technological side of the mainstream business; at least one director who has
had wide experience of direction and leadership of a company; a director
with sales or marketing experience; a director with good City connections; a
qualified accountant or lawyer.
Independence is clearly essential. Proned, the body which promotes the role
of non-executive directors, has a code of practice which recommends that the
non-executive director should not have been employed in an executive
capacity for at least five years by the company on whose board he or she
sits.
Professional advisers acting as non-executive directors should not be
retained by the company on a continuing or regular basis, nor should
significant customers or suppliers become directors.

 -Training managers is the key to improving employee skills

Ian Went glows with pride as he describes how he stood up in front of his
staff and told them about Total Quality Management  - the practice which
stresses top quality in all an organisation's operations.
Went, who says the only certificate he holds is in swimming, is joint
managing director of L E Went, a London-based company which employs 45
people and supplies paint and equipment to the automotive industry.
Started in 1960 by Ian Went's father, L E Went is a classic small business
run by Ian and his brother John. Although the company had a good reputation
among its customers, it lacked the will to expand as its management were
more inclined to respond than to lead.
Companies like L E Went are among the main targets of government-led
training initiatives to improve the UK's skill base.
The drive to gain their interest in training is being led, with variable
success, by a confusing number of organisations. These include chambers of
commerce, Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), local enterprise agencies
and the Department of Trade and Industry.
According to Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of Trade, the
quality of much of this advice is 'too low', and the various agencies are
still failing to get their message across. Small businesses themselves say
the plethora of advice from the different agencies is muddling. But, getting
through to small businesses is seen by government as vital because these
companies do less training than larger ones. The latest Confederation of
British Industry's (CBI) Quarterly Survey says that companies of less than
200 employees do not expect to increase their spending on training over the
next year by as much as medium to large companies.
Similarly, a recent Department of Employment survey, Skill Needs In Britain,
shows fewer smaller companies have business plans and training budgets than
larger ones.
Ian Peters, deputy director of the CBI's small firms directorate, warns
against over-simplification in interpreting surveys. 'In some small
companies an employee can gain a lot more expertise on the job than it would
be possible in a larger business where there would be more formal training.'
There are several main reasons why small businesses fail to train. They
include:
Owner-managers often do not accept that they need training. But, according
to the CBI's small business council management, training is one of the two
key issues  - along with finance  - for small companies.
According to Peters, management training often has to come first because
unless the management itself is learning, it cannot adopt a professional
approach to the training of employees.
For both employers and employees it is difficult to find the time to train.
A recent survey by the Management Charter Initiative, a body seeking to
improve the training of managers, found this a greater impediment than the
money to fund training.
Small businesses, without the benefit of big human resource departments,
find it hard to select the right training of the right quality in a market
over-supplied with consultants and private providers of training.
It is in this area that Tecs and chambers of commerce and perhaps the
'first-stop shops' mooted by Heseltine should play an important part. The
latter, Heseltine intends, should be umbrella organisations bringing
together all the agencies that provide advice to business.
Events at L E Went over the past ten months bear out many of these themes.
Ian Went says the company had given little thought to government programmes
before customers started asking if the company had BS5750, the British
standard for quality management.
Went says: 'We asked our trade association how much it might cost us to get
the standard and it seemed very expensive. At the time we thought the health
of our business was good.
'Then a leaflet came through the letter box inviting us to a meeting at
Aztec, our local Tec. We went along because we thought Aztec might help us
with BS5750. The Aztec people, however, said they would not help us unless
we did their Business Change Programme.'
Aztec, like the other 81 Tecs in England and Wales, has responsibility for
delivering a variety of help to both new and existing small businesses. Its
training assistance spans several initiatives from basic help in setting up
and running a business to Investors in People (IIP), a Tec-led scheme where
companies' processes of training are assessed. Aztec's services for existing
businesses starts with a help line, free to all, and works up a ladder of
more intensive training options.
Aztec's Business Change Programme is its local interpretation of Business
Growth Training (BGT), a scheme available in all Tecs and similar to some
respects to the Department of Trade and Industry's Enterprise Initiative.
The latter pays half the cost of five to 15 days's consultancy in strategic
planning on topics including marketing, business planning and financial and
information systems. BGT is more holistic and focuses on the business as a
whole and its training and development needs.
The change at L E Went has been radical. 'You name it, we were doing it
wrong,' says Went. The company was growing, he says, but management was more
about 'fire-fighting' than taking a strategic overview and communicating
that to the staff. One unit was making a loss and there were few formal
quality control systems.
Change has started at the top. Ian Went has moved from managing one of the
outlets to becoming the company's operations director, while his brother,
who is joint managing director, has become sales director. One manager was
made redundant: 'It was the worst thing we had to do,' says Went.
All the managers have undergone training  - with one of the most important
spin offs, according to Went, being a new-found confidence. He says: 'Giving
presentations has given me confidence. I have had to become clearer in my
own mind about problems and their solutions. Before I may have identified a
problem but I didn't necessarily know how to go about dealing with it. The
consultants have helped there.'
With their assistance he has put in systems which measure the scale of back
orders, wrong deliveries, transit damage and vehicle damage. 'We want to get
everybody thinking about the quality of their service  - that includes
making the whole staff think of themselves as each other's customers,' says
Went. Staff training, in a small business where it is difficult to find time
off, has sometimes been done at weekends. So far L E Went has spent about
Pounds 9,500 on the consultancy, a sum that has been matched in grants by
Aztec. Went is keen to invest more as needs are identified.
'We have not got as far in changing things as we wanted but I am not upset
by that,' he says. 'We believe we have gone about changing things properly.
It is too early to see any impact on our finances but we do feel more able
to manage the recession.'

FT  25 AUG 92 / London traffic has speeded up, says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFFIC SPEEDS in inner London appear to have risen for the first time in
many years, according to the Department of Transport's annual survey of
traffic volumes and speeds in the capital published yesterday.
Provisional estimates show that speeds in inner London increased by about
1.5mph between 1989 and last year, against the trend of slowly falling
average speeds recorded since the survey began in 1968.
The daytime average is just over 12mph for inner London, though the figure
is rather lower in central London at just over 10mph.
Traffic levels appear to have remained the same during this period, after 13
years of average growth of 1 per cent a year.
The average traffic speed in the central area is uniform between 7am and
7pm, although there remain significant peaks in the volume of traffic in the
morning and evening rush hours.
The survey suggests that the constant average speed during the day is caused
by factors such as on-street parking keeping the speed between the rush
hours as low as the speed caused by heavy traffic at peak times.
About 70 per cent of vehicles parked on central London streets are
commercial, the survey says. The number of heavy-goods vehicles entering
London has declined since the completion of the M25, but light-goods traffic
has continued to grow rapidly through the late 1980s at an average of about
5 per cent a year.

FT  25 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Cost of capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If recent work by the National Institute is right, UK companies are far from
being bled dry by high real interest rates. As the chart shows, the overall
cost of debt and equity capital taken together has been remarkably stable
since the late 1980s and is not at present unduly high. The reason is clear:
equity capital remains cheap. Indeed, the risk premium over interbank
lending rates demanded by equity investors is currently around 2 per cent,
well below the long-term average.
Whether this state of affairs is sustainable is another matter. On past
evidence, the risk premium demanded by equity investors is generally low in
periods of low inflation. This could mean that the cost of equity capital
will stay down so long as high real interest rates deliver stable prices.
Yet high interest rates have often been part of a virtuous circle
encompassing stable prices and efficiency gains in industry leading to a
strong earnings recovery. The interim reporting season so far has been
notable for some deeply gloomy statements on the earnings outlook, and
tentative signs that companies in some sectors are starting to cut
productive capacity. It is far too early to predict that the virtuous circle
will turn vicious. But if the market concludes that high interest rates are
not on this occasion preparing the ground for an earnings recovery, logic
dictates that the risk premium and the cost of equity will rise. Investors
must hope that real interest rates can fall before this point is reached.

FT  25 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's trade figures would have worried the gilts market, had it been
prepared to look beyond the fate of the pound. As it was, all eyes were
focused on the foreign exchanges, where the weakness of sterling presents a
dilemma. Judging by real yields, gilts look attractive, especially with
inflation expected to fall further; as if to underline that point, UK
institutions were buying as prices fell yesterday. But investors have to
weigh against high yields the risk of a rise in base rates and the threat of
devaluation.
Should base rates rise, prices of short maturity gilts will fall as money
market rates rise, but long-dated gilts could do well, as determination to
defend the ERM parity is made manifest. However, if sterling is allowed to
drift, fear of devaluation will depress sentiment at the longer end;
international investors will not be seduced by real yields of 5 or 6 per
cent if they believe a 10 to 15 per cent fall in sterling is around the
corner. That worry will keep gilts in check until the French referendum on
Maastricht is out of the way.
Assuming the French say 'oui', the medium-term outlook for gilts is positive
and returns over the next year or so should be good. That said, investors
may be well advised to wait  - especially as the UK public spending round
will follow hard on the heels of the French vote. If opinion polls point
towards a French 'non', the yield premium which gilts currently enjoy over
German bunds will not be enough to protect them.

FT  25 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Down with the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone agrees that the dollar looks attractive on the basis of relative
purchasing power parities. Just about everyone also agrees, though, that in
the short term at least such measures are meaningless. As the US currency
dipped below DM1.40 for the first time yesterday, the fear for financial
markets and for the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic was that the
recent slide could all too easily turn into a free fall. On the evidence of
yesterday's half-hearted intervention, central bankers do not yet appear to
have the stomach for a fight. The combination of election year pressures in
the US and the Bundesbank's intransigence, moreover, means that any
immediate narrowing of the short term interest rate differential looks
highly unlikely.
The message was not lost on European equity markets yesterday, which fell 3
per cent as measured by the Eurotrack index of 100 leading companies. In
part the bearish mood reflects the dollar's commentary on the US economy,
and its impact on the already much downgraded earnings of Europe's big
chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The dollar's demise, however, also
exacerbates tensions within the ERM  - witness yesterday's French franc and
lira weakness  - further postponing the day when interest rates generally
can resume a downward path.
Given that a rise in UK rates remains in the balance, perhaps yesterday's
mere 2 per cent fall in the Footsie could be considered something of an
escape. Whereas last year's disappointment over UK corporate earnings growth
was compensated for by monetary easing, the market acknowledges that this
escape route seems to be firmly closed for the moment.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Rightwing riots test Bonn's policy on asylum-seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHTWING extremists clashed with police and set fire to a refugee hostel in
the east German city of Rostock last night, as violence against foreign
asylum-seekers erupted for the third night in a row.
The rioting, evoking memories of Nazi violence against Jews, has caused deep
embarrassment in Germany. 'These events are hurting Germany's image in the
world,' said Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, who flew to Rostock
for talks with the city's leaders.
About 200 asylum-seekers, mostly gypsies from Romania, were moved out of the
hostel yesterday afternoon under heavy police escort. But hours later
hundreds of young demonstrators threw fire-bombs at the building, setting
part of it ablaze.
Dozens of Vietnamese refugees were inside the building when the fire broke
out but were rescued, according to ZDF television. Police fought the crowd
with water cannons and tear gas in a repeat of clashes that shook the city
at the weekend. A throng of local residents watched the street battles, some
of them cheering the right-wing militants.
Police said extremists had driven to Rostock from Berlin, Hamburg and other
cities in convoys and had used radio to co-ordinate their attacks.
The violence, condemned by the Bonn government, has been spawned by a
growing feeling that Germany cannot afford to keep its door open to large
numbers of asylum-seekers, many seeking a more prosperous life rather than a
haven from political persecution.
Tension has been building up for weeks in Rostock, once Communist East
Germany's showcase city but now blighted by unemployment. Many harbour and
shipyard workers have lost their jobs and feel forgotten in the united
Germany. Deprivation and resentment have turned the area into fertile ground
for rightwing extremists' xenophobic message.
The lastest trouble also partly results from mishandling of the steady
stream of asylum-seekers. The hostel in Rostock-Lichtenberg, with just 300
places, could not cope with the numbers arriving. More than 100 people, many
of them Romanian gypsies, camped on a lawn opposite apartment blocks and
sanitary conditions became intolerable.
'People who camp out in front of other people's homes arouse aggression,'
said Mr Lothar Kupfer, a minister in the state government.
His conclusion was the same as that of a growing number of German
politicians, who fear a backlash from ordinary citizens in east and west.
'Germany must quickly bar the uncontrolled entry of foreigners,' he said.
At the weekend, the opposition SPD leadership, under pressure from state
authorities, announced an about-turn in their policy on asylum-seekers,
saying that immigration must be 'braked and controlled'.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Terms set for Yugoslav talks: Four-point 'code of behaviour'
calls for end to ethnic cleansing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED NATIONS and the European Community will ask all parties in the
war in the former Yugoslavia to accept four basic principles as a means of
negotiating a long-term solution to the crisis in the Balkans.
The principles, described by UK officials as a code of 'civilised
behaviour', will be presented at the UN/EC-sponsored peace conference which
opens in London tomorrow.
'All the parties in the former Yugoslavia will be asked not to take
territory by force, not to engage in ethnic cleansing, to respect borders
and to improve and then close all detention centres,' a UK official said.
But an EC diplomat said any attempt to place all sides in the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina on the same footing would be a 'grave mistake'.
'The conference is making a serious mistake if it thinks it can spread the
share of the blame evenly across all sides,' he said. 'The Bosnian people,
particularly the Moslems, have lost most in this miserable war. Croatia and
Serbia have tried to carve up Bosnia,' he added.
British officials said that the conference chairmen were not intending to
establish pre-conditions for attending. 'The point is we have to apply
pressure, even by further sanctions, as a means of ending this bloodshed and
preventing the war from spreading,' an official said.
The conference, which is expected to end on Friday, will be chaired jointly
by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, and Mr John Major in his
capacity as head of the EC presidency. Mr Major called the conference after
the collapse of last month's EC peace talks on the former Yugoslavia in
London.
But British and other EC officials yesterday held out little hope that the
conference would achieve any success  - at least in the short term. Mr
Boutros Ghali, who arrived in London last night, said: 'I believe we will
not solve the problem, but at least find the beginning of the solution.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said on BBC television that
the conference would back greater sanctions as a means of applying pressure
on Serbia to stop the war in Bosnia.
Japan, Russia, China, and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference will
also be represented at the talks, as will the US.
The presidents of the six republics of the former Yugoslavia will attend, as
well as Mr Milan Panic and Mr Dobrica Cosic, prime minister and president
respectively of the unrecognised Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia
and Montenegro.
Bosnian president Mr Alija Izetbegovic, who is expected in London tomorrow,
will put forward a comprehensive peace plan aimed at reconstituting the
government of the independent republic.
Meanwhile, in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, Bosnia's forces
continued their offensive aimed at taking the western, Serb-controlled part
of the city.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Lautro tells 13 life companies to withdraw adverts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO life assurance companies may have to refund money to policyholders who
bought one of their products based on what has been found to be misleading
advertising, the industry regulator Lautro said yesterday.
After reviewing the advertising for single premium with-profits bonds,
Lautro said it had ordered 13 companies  - more than half of the 22 that
sell the product  - to withdraw some advertising. Of the 13 companies, two
were told to write to clients in order to clarify the bond's
characteristics.
The bonds offer a fixed rate for a set term, typically 10 years, but with
some conditions. Some sales agents have marketed them as a higher-yielding
alternative to building society deposit accounts.
When it announced the review of the single premium bonds in April, Lautro
said clients who claimed  - after receiving the required clarification  -
that they bought the product under misleading circumstances might be
eligible for refunds.
Equity and Law is one of the two insurers that has been asked to contact
investors. Mr Duncan Kerr, chief actuary, said of the 20,000 policies sold
by his company, only 300 clients who bought the product after a direct-mail
campaign would need to receive clarifying letters. He said it was unclear
whether they would be entitled to refunds.
Equity and Law has roughly Pounds 300m of the bonds outstanding and Mr Kerr
said the company had withdrawn the product last week because it wanted a
more suitable mix of single-premium and annual premium business.
A spokesman for Sun Life, which has also ceased its sales of single-premium
with-profits bonds for the current year, said the company was one of those
that had been asked to withdraw advertising.
The spokesman said Lautro's concerns were 'minor' and concerned the way in
which building societies were characterised in the advertisements.
Prudential Insurance, the UK's largest purveyor of the product, said it had
not been asked change its advertising. It has sold more than Pounds
750m-worth of the product, under the title 'Prudence Bonds', since it
entered the market in April 1991.
However, last year Prudential twice made changes in its advertising after
conducting an internal review and discussing the modifications with Lautro.
In only two cases were refunds to policyholders required.
According to the Association of British Insurers, with-profits bonds made up
the biggest share of the Pounds 3.06bn in non-linked single-premium business
sold by insurers last year.
Lautro said there was no evidence that the product had been sold to people
for whom it was inappropriate.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Quality scheme is necessity not luxury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Diane Summers' ('Small businesses criticise quality scheme', August 21)
exposes the soft underbelly of British industry. The attitude that 'we
cannot afford to implement a quality scheme' displays negative thinking.
The correct attitude for any forward looking management should be 'we cannot
afford not to implement a quality scheme'.
The success of any quality scheme depends on senior managements' embracing
the concept of quality and creating a culture within their organisations
with which all employees identify.
A formal quality scheme, regularly reviewed to keep pace with changes in the
business, is simply the vehicle which allows the company to move towards
achieving its quality objectives, whether accredited to BS5750 or not.
Instead of concentrating on calculating the cost of establishing a quality
scheme, these managers should also calculate the cost of poor quality to
their businesses.
When the advantages that can accrue from a quality scheme are explained,
together with the effect on the bottom line, negative thinkers may undergo a
conversion.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Cost constraints prompt a continental shift: LSI's decision
to close its German plant shows the problems facing high-tech manufacturing
in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by LSI Logic, a US semiconductor maker, to close its
state-of-the-art plant in Germany, demonstrates the problems faced by
European manufacturers of high-technology, capital-intensive goods.
Balancing the superior productivity of Far East factories against the
advantages of 'local' manufacturing to serve the European market, LSI was
driven to an inevitable decision. The plant will be phased out over the next
six months with the loss of more than 250 jobs.
'We have agonised over this for years, probably much longer than we should
have,' says Mr Wilfred Corrigan, chairman and chief executive of the
company, based in Silicon Valley. It specialises in 'application specific
integrated circuits', chips tailored to meet the needs of individual
customers.
But in the end, says Mr Corrigan, 'we came to realise that our strategy of
local manufacturing, in Europe, the US and Japan to serve our major markets
was not going to work'.
LSI's retrenchment reflects rising concerns throughout the electronics
industry. Several other electronics manufacturers with plants in Europe have
expressed similar doubts about whether the costs of their operations offset
the benefits.
Although LSI's German plant is one of the most advanced semiconductor
assembly and test facilities in the world, low productivity has made it
uncompetitive in the global chip market (see chart).
'The German management is good and the workers are good. It is not their
fault,' says Mr Corrigan, who blames the decision to close on the relatively
high cost of operating in Europe. LSI would probably have had to close down
its European operation in whatever country it had been located, he adds.
LSI chose Bruanschweig, near Hanover, in 1985 as the site for its first
European 'assembly and test' plant. At the time, the company was committed
to a strategy of serving its principal markets with local manufacturing
plants in the US, Japan and Europe. Like other electronics manufacturers,
LSI was seeking the advantage of proximity to customers to achieve better
distribution and service.
LSI originally chose Germany as the site for its first European plant after
a lengthy evaluation of several European locations. Ultimately, the company
was lured to Germany by generous tax incentives and its highly skilled
workforce.
But the issue that led to the closure of the plant is common throughout
Europe. The problem, says Mr Corrigan, is that European labour practices,
and in several cases legislation, prevent round-the-clock operation of the
plant. With high capital costs for production equipment, the goal is to run
the plant non-stop. This is possible in Japan and the Far East, where plants
typically operate on a three shift system. In the US, LSI achieves non-stop
operation by having two shifts with workers putting in a 12-hour day.
In Europe, however, most plants are fully operational less than half of the
time. 'The net result is that in Europe you get 10 shifts per week versus 21
in the US, Japan or the Far East,' Mr Corrigan says.
'The cost of capital equipment is largely the same, wherever you operate,
but in Europe productivity of the plant is halved. No matter how efficient
you are, you cannot compete.'
According to Mr Corrigan, the principal difference is cultural. 'Our workers
in California like the 12-hour shift system  - they work three days one
week, four the next. They can avoid commuting in rush hour and it enables
working mothers, and that is most of our workers, to make regular
babysitting arrangements.'
Labour costs are a second factor. Total labour costs in Germany, including
pension and health contributions, are about Dollars 20 an hour compared with
less than Dollars 3 an hour in Hong Kong.
The rising value of the D-Mark against the dollar  - which has increased the
operating costs to the US company  - was the final factor. When LSI built
the plant in 1985 the D-Mark was at about Dollars 2.50. Now the German
currency has fallen to well below Dollars 1.50.
According to Mr Corrigan, the decision to close the plant does not signal a
lack of interest in the European market. Of total group sales of Dollars
698m (Pounds 357.9m) in 1991, 15 per cent came from Europe. LSI is a leading
supplier of application-specific integrated circuits to European
telecommunications equipment makers.
He acknowledges, however, that demand for LSI products in Europe has matched
expectations. 'The European computer industry has not expanded as we
anticipated. There is very little personal computer or computer workstation
manufacturing in Europe.'
EC trade policies designed to encourage European production of
semiconductors do little to change the economic equation.
'The market is not willing to pay (the added cost) for local production,' Mr
Corrigan observes. Despite 14 per cent EC import tariffs on semiconductor
devices made outside Europe, it is cheaper to produce them elsewhere, for
instance South Korea, Hong Kong or Malaysia.
The Pacific Rim economies, and in particular Japan, also enjoy an advantage
in the supply of sophisticated machinery for semiconductor production.
Simultaneous with its announcement that it would close its plant in Germany,
LSI also said that it would shift the bulk of its wafer fabrication
operations  - the process of etching circuits onto a silicon wafer  - from
the US to Japan. This decision demonstrates that in the US, as well as
Europe, certain, high-technology manufacturing processes may be coming under
threat.
Japanese labour rates are similar to those in the US but productivity is
higher, Mr Corrigan says. 'This is not because Japanese people work harder,
but because of the greater availability of automated semiconductor
production equipment,' he explains.
Output per hour per person at LSI's Japanese plant is twice as high as at
its US plant, Mr Corrigan says. 'And our new plant, currently under
construction in Japan in a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel, will be twice
as productive again.' With a fourfold improvement in productivity at stake,
the US plant was at too great a disadvantage.
By the mid-1990s, the cost of building semiconductor plants is expected to
more than double, to as much as Dollars 1bn, as the complexity of chip
manufacturing rises. Even the world's largest semiconductor companies will
not be able to afford many new plants, Mr Corrigan predicts.
In response, LSI's strategy is to form partnerships with other chip makers
to share the costs of new facilities. Already, Mr Corrigan says, he has
found 'no shortage of people willing to talk about the possibility'.
The output of the next generation of chip plants will be so large that
companies in the industry expect that only a few will be needed to meet
international demand for semiconductor chips.
The location of these plants is likely to be determined more by regional
productivity rates than by the size of local markets. As a result, LSI may
be just one of the high-technology manufacturers to give Europe the cold
shoulder.

However, it is not all doom and gloom. A fellow diner at London's Ritz Hotel
restaurant yesterday reports that the number of tables graced by the
presence of Scottish Life company actuaries was 18.18 per cent recurring,
which sounds better than two tables out of eleven. Admittedly, it was a bit
of a slow day at the Ritz, but if Scotland's actuaries can justify a table

While on the subject of adverts, the New Zealand Immigration Service has
been thrilled by the response to its latest bid to boost its population by
poaching settlers from the Old Country.
Last year New Zealand granted residence to just over a thousand cases from
the UK. After the first three weeks of its latest call for recruits, in a
Financial Times' advertisement, it has received four times that number in
phone calls alone.
The surprise is not so much that 27 per cent of the responses came from the
formerly prosperous south-east, but that so many FT readers are thinking of
chucking it all in. After all the NZ economy is only starting to show the
first glimmerings of revival after eight years.

Even if your name is CINVen and you are one of Europe's biggest venture

knows CINVen's address, let alone its phone number?
Backed by three of the biggest pension funds  - British Coal, British Rail
and Barclays Bank  - CINVen certainly has deep pockets. It invests over
Pounds 250m a year in unquoted investments and has not been shy to publicise
its prowess. 'If you'd like to know more, we'd like to know you', trill the

Perhaps, the advert is some sort of customer initiative test to weed out the

If only the dear old Trustee Savings Bank had been left to run itself rather
than be hijacked by lots of clever types from the City establishment, it
would not be in its present unhappy state.
Yesterday saw one new broom  - former Amex plastic card whiz Don McCrickard
 - be replaced at the helm by another new broom, Peter Ellwood, who made his
name at Barclaycard. McCrickard had been group chief executive for just over
two and a half years, while Ellwood has only been with the TSB for a shade
over three years.
However good or bad they are, neither has had long enough to prove
themselves. The revolving door at the top of the TSB is reminiscent of the
Midland Bank at the low point in its fortunes. Isn't it about time that the
TSB returned to its roots and hired some old-fashioned bankers. Better still
why not promote from within?

FT  25 AUG 92 / Observer: George tries a come-back
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask any American why George Steinbrenner is famous and no more than one in a
million would reply because he builds ships.
A handful might dimly recall that the foundation of his family fortune,
which has been leaking badly for several years, was the American
Shipbuilding Company, started by a great grand-father. But, until July 1990,
his name was indelibly associated with his ownership and often tyrannical
management of the most illustrious name in baseball, the New York Yankees.
Two years ago, Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball and a man whose own
job is now on the line, ordered Steinbrenner to relinquish his control over
the Yankees. It was not because he had fired 19 managers in 18 years  - and
rehired one of them five times  - but because of his association with a
known gambler. A few months later he also handed over the helm of his
shipyard to a retired vice admiral.
Gone, but coming back. A month ago, Vincent relaxed the ban. From next
season Steinbrenner can take control of the Yankees again, which might at
least make life interesting for what is now a third-rate side. Meanwhile,
Steinbrenner has had to resume command of his shipyard, following the death
of the admiral earlier this month. Its fortunes are at an even lower ebb
than those of his baseball team, and it may have to file for bankruptcy if
the US navy does not provide more money.
Whether Vincent is around to watch Steinbrenner's return to the dugout is
moot. He recently decreed that the Chicago Cubs should henceforth play in
the western division of the National League after a lifetime in the east.
The San Francisco Giants are to move to a swamp in Florida. The Seattle
Mariners are to be owned by the Japanese. In spite of ever increasing gates,
at least half the major league sides are said to be operating at a loss.
The owners, even without Steinbrenner, are restless and have summoned
Vincent to defend his stewardship of the national pastime. If Steinbrenner
behaves as he did in the past, he will probably hire Vincent as the next
manager of his shipyard.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SAM MCCALLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You revealed ('Small businesses criticise quality scheme', August 21)
that the latest NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small Businesses discovered that
many small businesses are, to say the least, disillusioned by the BS5750
quality scheme. Is this surprising when owner-managers of small businesses
are encouraged to believe that BS5750 certification is the Holy Grail that
solves all marketing problems?
BS5750 needs to be put into perspective. It is important as part of a
business's overall marketing strategy, as are product, price, place,
promotion and a number of other factors.
It is a business's market orientation which enables it to gain advantage
from opportunities identified and strategies developed.
As a business and management consultant, I would strongly advise
owner-managers to think twice about BS5750 and consider how it will fit into
their overall marketing strategy. If they have not reviewed their strategy,
they should do so before doing anything else.
Funding is available from the DTI, through its package of support, for 98

small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).

Sir, The most effective way to minimise the creative accounting described by
Terry Smith in his book, Accounting for Growth, is to charge corporation tax
based on a company's published accounts, as in Germany.
This point was explored by David Waller ('Germans draw line at two sets of
accounts', March 19). The Anglo-American world now has one set of accounts
for investors and another for the tax man.
There would need to be an adjustment period of about five years to change to
a single set of accounts. But a bonus would be more management attention to
real organic growth than to financial engineering.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Bottom holds on the Tokyo exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HENRY SCOTT-STOKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When the Tokyo Stock Exchange was last in difficult straits 27 years
ago, the method of support was direct intervention by the Bank of Japan.
This time, a range of indirect options have been preferred. The result has
been similar: the building in of a bottom. Said bottom was put in place by
Governor Yasushi Mieno of the BOJ with a few words to the press after the
market closed last Wednesday.
The market is not quite what Anglo-Saxons think stock markets ought to be.
It looks over-valued judging by one basic criterion  - the price/earnings
ratio  - but only if one makes no adjustment for cross-shareholdings. The
p/e ratios cited by Peter Martin ('Good buys, but a risky business', August
22-23) for Toyota Motor and others have to be reduced to almost half the
quoted levels, if one judges by the work of long-time resident pundits.
I suspect Mr Mieno's bottom will hold. As to individual stock quotations,
Martin perhaps stretched a point when he quoted some unidentified luminary
here as stating that 'there is no discipline of valuation in the (Tokyo)
market'. If so, how would one explain that certain Western fund managers
have done well over years, consistently so, while others have crumbled?
Indiscipline?

FT  25 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Waiting for the French
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUFF WORKS only so far in the tussle of wills between central banks and the
money markets. From time to time, the authorities have to put their monetary
policies where their mouths are. For Mr John Major, that time could be nigh.
The prime minister has repeatedly said that he is prepared to do whatever
may be necessary to maintain sterling's position within the ERM. With
sterling only a fraction above DM2.80 last night, he may have to prove it.
If market intervention were to be unsuccessful, proof could require a large
interest rate increase. Such an increase might, if sustained, turn recession
into slump.
Why might Mr Major have to punish the UK economy in this way? The reason is
simply that a fixed exchange rate means abiding by the actions of those who
care little for him or his country. The Bundesbank is set whole-heartedly on
disinflation; the Federal Reserve is little less enthusiastic about
reflation. With a small chance of any early reduction in the three-month
interest rate differential between the dollar and the D-Mark, now some 6 1/2
percentage points, selling dollars has appeared to be a one-way bet. The
result: the US currency touched an all-time low of DM1.3985 yesterday.
Treaty referendum
This leaves Mr Major and the hapless Mr Lamont in considerable difficulties.
But they will have to hold on, at least until after the September 20 French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Unfortunately, the French may then
deliver the worst possible result: an exiguous majority in favour of the
treaty. That would undermine the plausibility of the European Community's
planned journey to economic and monetary union, but not terminate it.
Moreover, the only sensible alternative to current European monetary
policies  - a D-Mark appreciation against most of the other European
currencies  - still seems unlikely, whatever the result.
The UK will remain with its lonely choice: in or out, with no compromise in
between. Mr Major insists that the UK will remain in, regardless. But
insistence cannot be enough on its own. The UK is locked in a vicious cycle
characteristic of imperfectly credible fixed exchange rate regimes: the more
adverse the economic circumstances, the more questionable the government's
commitment; the more questionable the commitment, the more the government
must reinforce it; and the more the government has to reinforce it, the more
adverse become the economic circumstances.
The effect of high interest rates in the short to medium term is not the
sole reason for the questioning. It may well be argued that persistent
current account deficits should not matter. If economic activity does not
matter, this is certainly true. But for electorates it normally does matter.
Trade deficit fears
Yesterday's balance of payments figures show that the volume of imports,
excluding oil and the erratic items, grew by 8 per cent in the year to the
three months ending in July, despite the recession. Over the same period
export volumes rose only 3 1/2 per cent. Worse, the growth of imports was
high across all categories of manufactures, with capital and intermediate
goods showing the smallest increase. The current account deficit, now a
little below 2 per cent of gross domestic product, could explode when growth
restarts.
The UK's trade performance raises questions about the chances for sustained
recovery. What is needed is a long period of improving competitiveness to
offset the reduced competitiveness against important trading partners
suffered by the UK between 1987 and 1991. Given the low rates of inflation
elsewhere, however, improved competitiveness will come slowly. Worse, the
low inflation needed for improved competitiveness will tend to raise real
interest rates and constrain domestic demand.
The government will, and must, abide by the rules it has embraced. But the
durability of its policy will be secured only by the acceptability of the
consequences. So far the consequences have been far more adverse, at least
for economic activity, than the government originally supposed. Yet what
makes any policy credible is not assertions by governments, however oft
repeated, but acceptability to electorates. The British electorate has been
forgiving once. It may not be a second time.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Present pain for future gain: European economists say the UK
has little choice but to hold its ground within the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government, facing the most serious sterling pressure since
joining the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990, was yesterday
battening down the currency hatches. Concerted central bank intervention to
limit the D-Mark's rise against the weak dollar staved off the immediate
risk of higher British interest rates. But, with the dollar closing in
London at just above DM1.40, the threat of a serious monetary crisis may
grow.
The message from Germany is uncompromising: Britain should stand firm. 'We
are seeing exaggerated speculative movements where everyone is moving into
the D-Mark,' Mr Axel Siedenberg, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in
Frankfurt, said yesterday. To show currency markets that it is serious about
combating inflation through the ERM discipline, he says the British
government will probably need to send a 'firm signal' by raising UK banks'
base rates from their current level of 10 per cent.
Whatever the outcome of the next few days, Britain will remain caught in the
crosswinds of an international currency storm whose causes, in both the US
and Europe, are largely beyond the UK's control. The US has been easing
monetary policy to try to end recession. On the other hand, the Bundesbank
 -which effectively sets the interest rate floor for the whole ERM area  -
is keeping interest rates high to counter the reunification-induced rise in
German inflation.
The foreign exchanges are also being buffeted by the latest opinion polls
showing increasing French opposition to the Maastricht treaty on European
political and monetary union. The currency markets believe a 'no' vote in
the French referendum next month would increase demand for the D-Mark  - and
thus heighten disruption in the ERM, the EC's exchange rate stabilisation
scheme which has functioned without a full-scale realignment since January
1987.
The political complications over ratifying the Maastricht treaty have
compounded Britain's economic predicament. Having described the ERM in
September 1990, a fortnight before Britain joined, as 'a modern day gold
standard with the D-Mark as the anchor', Mr John Major is presiding over
Britain's longest peacetime recession since 1930-31. Yet the UK government's
ability to cut interest rates to revive the economy is constrained by the
tight credit policies of the Bundesbank. Since interest rates have fallen
more slowly than inflation since autumn 1990, UK real interest rates have
risen to an annual 6 per cent from 4 per cent since October 1990 (see
chart).
Calls from some UK politicians and economists for Britain to devalue
sterling against the D-Mark have been heightened by Britain's current
account deficit, underlined by a further widening in the shortfall for July
to Pounds 934m. In spite of economic decline, Britain will record a current
account deficit of between 1.5 and 2 per cent of gross domestic product this
year. The UK's ERM experience so far has been in sharp contrast to France,
which managed to improve industrial competitiveness after adopting an
austerity policy which stabilised the franc against the D-Mark during the
1980s.
The pain caused by Britain's transition to a low inflation economy has
prompted debate around Europe about whether the UK should change policies.
Most leading European economists, however, say that Britain has no choice
but to keep taking the D-Mark medicine  - even though this may, in the short
term, force a highly unpopular increase in the cost of credit.
'After the UK failed during the 1980s to bring down inflation with its own
efforts, improving anti-inflation performance through an external constraint
represents Britain's last hope,' says Mr Hans-Peter Frohlich, international
economist at the Cologne-based Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, the
industry-backed economic research body. 'Britain has to grit its teeth and
press on.'
The option of devaluation within the ERM would not allow British interest
rates to fall below German levels. Such a step might even send sterling
interest rates higher if the markets believed Britain's anti-inflation
resolve were flagging, according to Mr Andre Szasz, executive director of
the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank.
He says experience shows that 'devaluation ends up increasing interest rates
rather than lowering them'. When the Dutch government  - against the advice
of the Nederlandsche Bank  - devalued the guilder by 2 per cent against the
D-Mark in 1983, Mr Szasz says this had a negative impact on financial market
sentiment. 'The government caused Dutch interest rates for years to be
higher than would otherwise have been the case.'
Another experienced continental central banker, speaking anonymously,
advised Britain to 'stick it out' because 'all the alternatives are awful'.
Having decided much later than France to bind itself to ERM discipline,
Britain is only halfway through a four-year battle to convince foreign
exchange markets that it is serious in trying to defeat inflation, he says.
If the UK took the drastic step of leaving the ERM, cutting interest rates
and allowing the pound to float, it would take 10 years to restore
confidence on the financial markets, he adds.
Even if Britain departed from the ERM, it could not wholly insulate itself
from the influence of high German interest rates, owing to the UK's strong
trade and investment links with the rest of the continent, according to Mr
Jean-Paul Betbeze, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. 'Even if you
are not in the ERM, you are not outside the German monetary area, and this
is a zone of high interest rates. There is no hiding place.'
Mr Eric Taze-Bernard, chief economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, advises
central banks around the continent to defend present ERM parities with all
means available during the nervous period up to the French referendum on
September 20. In view of the large credit facilities available to central
banks whose currencies fall to their ERM floors, countries may be able to
maintain present currency rates without having to raise interest rates, he
believes.
Mr Peter vanden Houte, international economist at Banque Bruxelles-Lambert
in Brussels, also favours a tough line. 'The British are being very
masochistic in pegging the pound to the D-Mark. But there is nothing else
they can do.'
He says that organising a moderate sterling devaluation of about 5 to 6 per
cent within the ERM would have little significant impact on the
competitiveness of UK industry. Leaving the mechanism altogether, allowing
sterling to float down to perhaps DM2.20 to DM2.40 from its present level of
about DM2.80, would be politically impossible during Britain's current six
months as president of the EC.
Britain's ERM difficulties represent the latest example of the system's
external constraints colliding with a member government's domestic policy
priorities. For several reasons, however, Britain's problems appear
exceptionally dire. After a 2.4 per cent decline in GDP in 1991, City
economists forecast a further 0.5 per cent contraction in 1992  - the worst
two-year performance of any ERM member since the European Monetary System
started in 1979.
Because EMS members have become increasingly reluctant to devalue, countries
which run into exchange rate difficulties can no longer expect to be bailed
out through agreement on a general currency realignment, as was the case in
the early EMS years.
Mr Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, illustrates this
point by pointing to France's refusal to devalue the franc during the past
few years. This upset chances for currency realignment based on a
revaluation of the D-Mark at the time of German unification in 1990-91  -
when it would have been economically beneficial for Europe.
In spite of governments' antipathy to devaluation, Mr Lipp believes
pressures are building for an ERM realignment this autumn. The strains are
focused not simply on Britain, but also on the lira, which has also slid
close to its D-Mark floor.
Mr Lipp suggests that Britain should join forces with France to persuade
Germany to revalue the D-Mark. If this fails, Britain should devalue
unilaterally in order to 'decouple' from the D-Mark  - a move, he says,
which could be presented as a legitimate reaction to the extreme monetary
pressures caused by German unification.
A powerful reason behind France's commitment to a firm franc has been its
desire to put into place the conditions for European economic and monetary
union. The French government sees the establishment of a single European
currency, to be run by a European central bank, as the best way to end the
present dominance of the D-Mark. This justifies the heavy economic and
political capital France has invested in the Maastricht process  - and also
underlines the high stakes in next month's French referendum.
Yesterday's international intervention to support the dollar suggests that
central banks have adopted the policy of doing everything possible to steady
the foreign exchanges before the French vote. Their inability, however, to
stop the US currency's slide indicates, however, how ineffective that effort
may be.
According to Mr Brendan Brown, international economist at Mitsubishi Finance
in London, the Bank of England may allow the pound to fall within the next
few days to its lowest possible ERM limit against the D-Mark. Under the
rules of the EMS, this would oblige the Bundesbank to intervene to sell
D-Marks, inflating domestic German liquidity and threatening further
unwelcome expansion of the German money supply. This, Mr Brown suggests,
might force the German government to abandon its present reluctance to
revalue the D-Mark.
Britain's dilemma is a cruel one. The measure most needed to convince the
foreign exchange markets of the government's anti-inflation commitment  - a
rise in interest rates  - is precisely the step which could risk turning the
UK's recession into a full-scale slump. Mr Major must hope for a French
'yes' next month, followed by an earlier-than-expected easing of Bundesbank
policies. If these hopes are not realised, and the dollar's slide continues,
the pressures to break free from the ERM may intensify.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Personal View: Careful therapy in the special case of Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin is the first democratically elected leader in
Russia's history, and a leader of proven courage. His government represents
by far the best chance that Russia has of realising its dream of becoming a
political democracy with a prosperous market economy. The west has an
overwhelming interest in seeing Russia fulfil this dream, given that the
alternatives are internal splintering, or a new authoritarianism, or a
frustrated nationalism, or some combination of these.
The Group of Seven leading industrialised countries is surely worrying about
how it can help Yeltsin's regime. The G7 should not confine its thoughts to
financial help. An invitation to enlarge the G7, with a suitable reminder
that this is a club of democracies, could give Russian pride a boost.
Nevertheless, it is no use pretending that Russia can be helped on the
cheap. It is desperately short of foreign exchange. The west has made
provision for Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.3bn) in one form or another. One may
regret that this mostly consists of credits on commercial terms, which
threatens to intensify Russia's long-term debt-servicing problem.
While money is essential, no one imagines any longer that problems can be
solved just by throwing money at them. We have entrusted the International
Monetary Fund with the responsibility of judging whether policies worth
supporting are in place. We have a duty to discuss how the IMF should
discharge this responsibility.
The IMF is currently dealing with three separate pots of money: a Dollars
1bn first credit tranche drawing, a Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn standby drawing
from the higher credit tranche, and a Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund.
The first Dollars 1bn will be released essentially on the basis of past
actions  - the price liberalisation of January, and the efforts to reduce
the budget deficit, the exchange rate unification in July, and the
'nationalisation of the rouble' which addresses at least one dimension of
the problem of establishing monetary control  - plus a declaration of future
good intentions.
First credit tranche drawings have traditionally not carried high
conditionality, and that seems appropriate here. It provides a modest
goodwill gesture.
The stabilisation fund will, appropriately, be released only after Russia
has in place the conditions that would allow stabilisation. It should be
released before the exchange rate is stabilised, so as to enable Russia to
nudge the rouble up to a level worth stabilising, rather than stabilise an
undervalued rate. And it would be silly to insist that any drawings would
have to be repaid within 90 days, for that would emasculate the fund's
usefulness.
The immediate issue concerns the standby. It would be wrong to abandon the
conditionality that has traditionally applied to such drawings because
'Russia is a special case'. It is of course true that Russia is a special
case  - as indeed is every case the IMF has to deal. In principle the IMF
allows for this by tailoring each programme to the particular needs of the
country involved, and in practice it gets closer to that ideal than its
critics acknowledge (which is not to claim that it leaves them no
ammunition).
So what should be the right measures to incorporate in a Russian programme?
It should not be a programme for or against 'shock therapy'. Russia received
a shock when prices liberalised last January and it cannot be unshocked now
by reimposing price controls or increasing the budget deficit.
Nor should the programme commit Russia to a specific target for the rate of
inflation. The IMF game of demanding a commitment to an unrealistically low
rate of inflation and then forcing any responsible country negotiator to
demand a higher inflation target is counterproductive. Policymakers do not
have the tools to fine-tune the rate of inflation and the bickering gives
the public the impression that their authorities are half-hearted inflation
fighters.
Nor should the IMF insist on precipitate liberalisation of energy prices. It
was important that energy prices be raised substantially, as has already
been done. And it is important that the public know that they will
ultimately be raised to international levels. But there was a respectable
case for raising energy prices gradually.
Finally, the programme should not focus on privatisation. The Russians are
pushing ahead on that front faster than many had expected, and the IMF lacks
expertise that could help them to do it better.
The main focus of the IMF programme should be on averting the terrifyingly
real threat of hyper-inflation. Despite the fall every month since January,
monthly inflation is still well into double digits; inflationary
expectations are out of control; and there is no incomes policy. Against
this unfavourable background, the budget deficit started to widen ominously
again in the second quarter; massive new bank credits are being injected
into the economy in the (forlorn) hope of rolling back the vast
inter-enterprise arrears that emerged earlier this year; and the rouble has
fallen sharply again on the foreign exchanges.
Monetary policy offers scope for constructive policy initiatives. The
inter-bank settlement system has almost broken down. The very real problem
of inter-enterprise arrears needs to be tackled, though by consolidating (or
even forgiving) the debts and tightening future budget constraints rather
than by injecting new bank credits. Real interest rates are still sharply
negative and need to be raised, if necessary by indexing some financial
obligations.
Unfortunately these imperatives sound like a declaration against the
powerful pressure group of managers that has emerged in Russia. The managers
are demanding new credits and subsidies to prevent what they see as the
danger of the destruction of the industrial base. But it is quite wrong to
regard this as a nomenklatura opposition out of sympathy with the movement
towards a market economy. There are at least important parts of the
managerial group that realise that budget constraints have to be hardened,
that parts of industry need to be closed down, and that hyperinflation would
be a disaster.
Does the IMF possess the skills needed to act as foreign midwife for an
authentic Russian programme that will command domestic consent? Or is Russia
perhaps enough of a special case to justify asking a senior economic
statesmen to head a special mission that would draw skills from a wider
pool? The stakes are too high to allow that question to be answered on the
basis of not offending institutional pride.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Leading Article: The rising cost of health care
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S difficulties in controlling rising health care costs in the
UK are well illustrated by the spending figures published today by the
Office of Health Economics. This year's total for spending on health looks
likely to top Pounds 40bn, 100 times the cost of the National Health Service
(NHS) in 1949, its first year. The growth in NHS spending appears
inexorable, with expectations now raised by the Patient's Charter which
promises higher quality service and a more customer-friendly approach.
Rising health costs are nothing new. Beveridge, the architect of the modern
welfare state, estimated that the health service would cost just Pounds
170m. The out-turn in the first year was more than double this figure, and
the NHS has absorbed a rising proportion of the national income ever since.
Beveridge's prediction that the cost would not increase as the benefits of
free health care raised the nation's health now looks to be  - as Enoch
Powell put it when health minister  - a 'miscalculation of sublime
proportions'.
There has been some slackening in growth rates: from annual rates of over 5
per cent in the 1960s and 1970s, growth has come down to 3 per cent a year
in the 1980s. And productivity has greatly increased. The number of patients
treated in NHS hospitals has risen from 3.8m in 1951 to 9.2m in 1990-91.
This has been achieved on a much smaller share of national income than most
other advanced countries spend. UK health expenditure is just 6.5 per cent
of GDP, compared with the average for the OECD of 9 per cent and for the EC
of 7.6 per cent.
UK behind
It is not evident that people in the UK are greatly worse off as a result of
spending a quarter less on health than the OECD average. The infant
mortality rate in the UK, at 7.9 per 1,000 live births, is on the OECD
average and barely above the EC figure. Life expectancy rates for both men
and women are also much the same as the EC average. There are indicators
where the UK lags behind  - the high level of heart disease among men is the
best example. On the other hand, Britain does well by other measures  - such
as the death rate from strokes among women, one of the lowest in western
Europe.
One reason for the apparent efficiency of the UK health service has been the
control which the centralised NHS has historically been able to exert over
costs, particularly pay. However, the downside of the UK's planned economy
in health has been queues, with about 700,000 people on waiting lists for
hospital treatment, some for as long as two years. Those who can afford it
go privately  - 13 per cent are now covered by private medical insurance,
mainly to avoid queues.
Higher quality
The government's health reforms are designed to turn the planned economy
upside down. Patients are being given rights and health service managers
empowered to deliver higher quality and more responsive health care. Large
health authorities are giving way to self-governing NHS trusts, and greater
flexibility in staffing and pay is promised.
These aims are wholly commendable, but vigilance will be essential if this
freeing-up of the health market is not to bring an explosion in costs.
Breaking away from national pay scales often leads to wage drift upwards
rather than lower costs. And there are many parts of the country where there
is only one district general hospital within easy reach, which will enjoy
effective monopoly power in the NHS internal market.
Nonetheless, the potential for lower costs is there. The increased number of
patients treated in hospitals has been achieved despite a fall in the number
of beds from 550,000 in 1961 to 330,000 in 1991. New surgical techniques are
increasing the scope for increasing still further the number of treatments
which can be carried out without an overnight stay in hospital. Family
doctors have been encouraged to carry out much more treatment in local
health centres which have lower overheads than all-purpose hospitals. While
cuts in health spending are almost certainly politically impossible, it
should be possible to squeeze better health care out of the budget without
further quantum leaps upwards.

Day / Alastair Macaulay describes a typical (long) day in the life of a
dedicated festival-goer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
10.15am. Breakfast as usual at the Queen's Hall. Gossip partly about
Edinburgh Festival's three triumphs so far  - Moses and Aaron, Mark Morris
and, in last night's Oprichnik, Galina Gorchakova (a Russian Ponselle)
11am. Queen's Hall. Peter Donohoe: Tchaikovsky and Chopin. (Official) After
the virtuosity of his starter, Tchaikovsky's Scherzo a la Russe (Op. 1 No.
1), Donohoe tells us that, when planning this programme, no one had realised
how short the first half would be. So, 'to give the bar staff time to wash
the glasses,' he is adding now Tchaikovsky's late Dumka. ('This was going to
be my encore, so don't clap too loud at the end.')
The selection proves a good sampler of Tchaikovsky's range: you hear his
folk facet, his dance facet, his Lisztian stormy-virtuoso facet, his
charming salon facet. The bridge to Chopin is his late 'Un poco di Chopin'
piece, best known (though not in musical circles) in Drigo's beautiful
orchestral arrangement (and at about half the speed) in the the 1895 St
Petersburg text of Swan Lake, for which Tchaikovsky himself designated it.
Donohoe, always a modernist, proves an unconventional Chopinian. No
lingering, no attention to superficial beauties. Instead, he homes in on the
music's structural daring, its fragmentation and Romantic wildness.
2pm. Assembly Rooms. Jenny Eclair: Mummy's Little Girl. (Fringe). Another
one-person show. Sally Darling, former child star, has descended to crime.
In a tissue of bile and gleeful venom, she blames her ruinous decline on her
ruthlessly ambitious mother  - who is still trying to make her audition for
'the Eldorado tragic waterskiing accident victim'. The show, a hysterical
mixture of Mommie Dearest and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, has its funny
and sad sides, but in general works too hard at either.
4pm. Assembly Rooms. Tom Hickey: Misogynist. (Fringe). Another one-person
show. One daily-paper critic is said to have thought this the worst thing he
has ever seen, another the best. It is, of course, neither. But Hickey is an
astonishing performer. His circuitous, repetitious, Irish ramblings, with
peculiar changes of subject and/or persona, gradually unfold a horrifying
psychopathological study: the helpless and murderous misogyny of this
Catholic devotee. The text is overblown, but Hickey's delivery is an
unflinching tour de force. Stroke by stroke, a non-person looms into vivid
3-D detail.
5.40pm. Assembly Rooms. Compagnie Philippe Gaulier: The End of the Tunnel.
(Fringe). This mime show (with speech), a spoof on the building of the
Channel Tunnel from both English and French sides, relies on exaggeration,
repetition and stereotype. It makes one adequate joke every 10 minutes.
Otherwise, much 'Hello, audience' mugging and adolescent humour.
7.30pm. King's Theatre. Edith Clever, director Hans Jurgen Syberberg. Ein
Traum, Was Sonst? (Official). Yet another one-person show. Syberberg has
been the theme director of this year's Edinburgh Film Festival. (A
retrospective of his movies follows in London, at the ICA, September 4-12.)
I have always wanted to catch his Parsifal  - but, ironically, it is only
showing here this evening, clashing with the local premiere of Ein Traum,
Was Sonst?, his stage vehicle for Edith Clever, his favourite actress.
Alone onstage, she spends the first 40 minutes without speaking. Gravel and
rubble are all around (the ruins of old Europe.) Simply, she listens: to a
lecture on Wagner, to Hitler, to the bombs falling  - and then to the
renewing strains of the Pastoral Symphony. It is fascinating how Syberberg,
like so many German artists, shies away from no part of German history. In
spite of the Scylla and Charybdis of Hitler and the war, he suggests that
German culture has enduring vitality enough to bring comfort and new life.
The first 30 minutes are transporting; Clever looks half like Peggy
Ashcroft, half like Glenda Jackson, and has better bones than either. Every
slight move is economical and eloquent. But then the show starts to
celebrate her skills  - in particular her talent for slowness. When she sits
down, it is virtuoso Alexander technique. When she recites, it is preciously
elegiac. The curtain falls after 105 minutes, we applaud - and, leaving,
realise that this is only the interval. But we do not return.
10.30pm. Royal Lyceum Theatre. Dennis O'Neill: Neapolitan Songs. (Official)
If it were not for Ingrid the glittering accompanist, this would be the
fifth one-person show of the day. O'Neill has worked so hard to become an
Italian tenor  - he even looks like Caruso's cartoons of himself  - that
there is nothing individual left. Half his repertory turns out not to be
Neapolitan, and most of it is stuff familiarised by the 'Three Tenors in
Rome' gala. (Yes  - 'Nessun dorma,' 'Recondita armonia,' and 'E la solita
storia')
As the recital proceeds, O'Neill finds his form. He is at his best, and
least clone-like, in the encores: 'O sole mio,' whose refrain he decorates
handsomely with a slow trill and whose second verse he sings softly; and
'Santa Lucia,' which he belts out fortissimo but with ardent phrasing.
12 midnight. My tally for Week One comes to 26 shows. The taxi-driver tells
me that last year he picked up a little old lady who had just done her 147th
show and who hoped to tot up 200 before the festival was over.

This week's Hollywood Great (Channel 4, 10.20) is Michael Caine. In a way he
is a link with the stars of the 1930s and 40s in being a presence rather
than a great actor. He is always Michael Caine playing a role and in his
drive for financial security too many have been beneath his status. But he
deserves tonight's accolade for the rare occasions when he shines above his
material, notably in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters when he acted the
bigger artistic names off the screen.
The John Bull Business (BBC 2,9.30) tackles the Big One  - the City of
London. At last some City figures are prepared to confront the Dollars
64,000 question  - does the City exist for the benefit of the nation or to
personally enrich its major protagonists? Even the government is wondering
whether the City's pursuit of short term gains as against long term
investment can be allowed to continue indefinitely.
For decades Spanish food remained a national secret. Now more restaurants

FT  25 AUG 92 / Arts: Berlioz and Teixeira - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE intimacies of Berlioz's sacred trilogy are not obviously suited to the
expanses of the Albert Hall nor to the generally bullish atmosphere of a
prom. But Sunday's performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by
David Atherton was in every respect a success  - paced and tended by
Atherton with great care and affection, with decent if unspectacular
orchestral playing and (on the Radio 3 relay at least) singing of immaculate
clarity and passable French from an entirely Anglophone cast.
Berlioz evidently touches a chord in Atherton, a conductor whose treatment
of the 19th-century repertory often seems lacking in the spark he brings
regularly to later music. While still a student at Cambridge in the 1960s he
conducted a memorable performance of Beatrice et Benedict, and the sympathy
seems to have been preserved intact. It would have been easy to over-egg
L'Enfance du Christ in these circumstances, to inflate its moments of pomp,
sentimentalise its rapt inwardness. Atherton allowed a natural unfolding,
ensuring detail was clearly articulated and even undercutting the sweetness
of the 'Shepherds' Farewell' with sharp-edged oboes.
The cast was led by Martyn Hill's narrator, light-toned, impassioned,
humane, and Ann Murray's beautifully poised Mary, investing every phrase
with exact weight and diction. Stephen Roberts was Joseph, soft-grained and
self-effacing, and David Wilson-Johnson made much of the role of Herod,
vividly realising his monologue. The BBC Symphony Chorus, despatched to the
gallery beneath the Albert Hall's dome for the chorus of unseen angels at
the end of the first part, was in attentive form. A pleasing, quietly
rewarding occasion.
*****
One of the most imaginative pieces of planning in this year's Proms schedule
was the filling of Friday's late-evening slot with church music by an
18th-century Portuguese composer all but unknown. That sounds hardly
enticing; but, as given by The Sixteen Orchestra and Chorus (this time
numbering 20), Antonio Teixeira's 80-minute-long setting of the Te Deum
(1734) proved a winner.
Teixeira was born in 1707 and not heard of again after the Lisbon earthquake
of 1755, of which he is thus presumed a victim. Since he merits only one
small paragraph in The New Grove, it breaks all the rules  - happily]  - for
his Te Deum to be at once so grandly structured, so intricately fashioned
for large forces, and so continuously exhilarating.
A boy prodigy sent by King John to study in Rome from the age of ten, he
appears thereafter to have devoted his attentions to the church and opera
house equally  - as anyone might guess who quickly learns to relish the
mixture of rigour and ornate brilliance in the Te Deum succession of
movements. The use of spatially separated choirs and groups of soloists
builds up a momentum that looks back to Monteverdi; the charm and vivacity
of the melodic layout look forward to much later 18th-century church music;
and yet the impact of the whole is utterly 'personal', distinctive and
fresh.
The Proms performers seemed to revel in exactly those qualities (not
surprising: Christophers has already put this work on record). Among the
eight solo singers, two each of soprano, alto, tenor and bass, there should
be a particular word for Lynda Russell, joyously and expertly dispensing the
first soprano's rococo flourishes.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Financial sector wins 17% of market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FINANCIAL institutions account for 17 per cent of the world market in
financial services, according to the institute's review, Peter Marsh writes.
Professor Tony Smith says the British share is second only to that of US
institutions, which account for 66.3 per cent of the market.
Japanese-owned institutions have 5.1 per cent, with French, Canadian and
Swiss groups accounting for 4.2 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent
respectively.
Prof Smith bases his analysis on fees earned by commercial and merchant
banks in 1989, in areas such as foreign exchange dealing, mergers and
acquisitions, bonds and equities.
Behind the success of UK-owned financial groups, says Prof Smith, is their
'inherent efficiency'. This factor is 'difficult to identify and quantify
directly', but has been helped by competitive forces.
Both the UK and the US have 'basically open, unprotected domestic financial
markets and a consequent exposure of national financial institutions to
untrammelled international competition'.
Prof Smith says that many financial groups from continental Europe lack
these advantages.
He adds that the honing of British groups' competitive capabilities 'has not
been without cost'. Rivals from other nations, especially the US, have
frequently won substantial shares in UK markets 'to the point where in some
case the UK experiences a deficit in supply'.

FT  25 AUG 92 / ERM 'may have to be scrapped': National Institute of
Economic and Social Research Quarterly Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN exchange rate mechanism may have to be scrapped if progress
towards economic and monetary union breaks down, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research says in its quarterly review published
yesterday.
If moves to achieve Emu by the century's end falter  - perhaps after a 'no'
vote in next month's French referendum on Maastricht  - serious financial
instability could result, leading to higher inflation and interest rates
across Europe.
The institute says the arguments for Emu  - involving a single European
currency presided over by a single central bank  - remain strong in spite of
doubts about ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
It warns: 'If the prospect of Emu were to recede into the indefinite future,
then (ERM) realignments would become larger and more frequent.
'Continuing with the ERM as it now is cannot be seen as an alternative to
Emu . . . The only lasting alternative to Emu may be a return to floating
exchange rates within Europe.'
A French vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty is a 'necessary although
not a sufficient' condition for Emu taking place as planned, it says.
If Europe were to give up on Emu, signifying an end to the goal of
permanently fixed exchange rates across Europe, the outcome would affect
countries in different ways.
'The outcome (of Emu's abandonment) in each member state would then depend
on the priorities and the reputation of national monetary authorities,' says
the institute. 'Even if the form of the (exchange rate mechanism of the)
European Monetary System was maintained, the result would probably be higher
inflation and higher nominal exchange rates for most of the member states,
including the UK.'
The institute points out that, under Emu, pan-European borrowing costs would
be set according to economic conditions across the continent. That would be
preferable to the ERM arrangements, whereby rates are in practice determined
by German events.
Other arguments for Emu were the reduction in transaction costs that would
follow the introduction of a single currency and the poor record of many
European countries in delivering low inflation and stable growth by national
economic policies alone.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Trade deficit much greater than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VISIBLE trade deficit worsened beyond expectations last month as Britain
continued to import more tradeable goods than it exported.
A 2 per cent rise in the value of imports from Pounds 9.7bn in June to
Pounds 9.9bn last month out-stripped exports which were flat. This caused
the visible trade deficit to widen from Pounds 0.9bn in June to Pounds 1.1bn
in July.
The current account deficit widened to Pounds 0.9bn last month from Pounds
0.7bn in June, with an estimated Pounds 200m surplus from invisibles, such
as services and transfer payments.
The underlying trend in imports and exports  - measured by volume, and
excluding so-called erratic items such as ships, aircraft and precious
stones  - also showed that imports were more robust than exports between
June and July. However, this measure showed a marked slowdown in the growth
of imports over the three months to the end of July.
According to the Central Statistical Office, which released the seasonally
adjusted figures yesterday, import volumes grew by 1 per cent in the three
months to the end of July, which was the same as the growth rate for
exports.
This compares with the year-on-year comparison that puts import volumes 8
per cent higher than a year ago, against exports which were only 3.5 per
cent higher.
Although the annual rate of growth of imports is worryingly high for an
economy stuck in recession, the slowdown in the three months to the end of
July reflects the weak state of consumer demand over the summer months.
Economic slowdown in the European Community  - to which the UK sells more
than half its exports  - meant that exports to the EC were stagnant between
June and last month and fell by 0.5 per cent in the three months to the end
of July compared with the previous three-month period.
Exports to the US were also flat, but exports to east Europe and the former
Soviet Union continued to flourish. They grew by 42 per cent in the three
months to the end of July compared with the previous three months.
In spite of the weak dollar, imports from the US fell by 12 per cent, a
marked reversal from the strong growth in US imports registered at the
beginning of the year.
Exports of cars fell by 3 per cent in the latest three months, while imports
grew by 7 per cent over the same period. Exports of capital goods grew by
3.5 per cent, but exports of chemicals fell by 1.5 per cent.
The visible trade deficit excluding oil and erratics  - often taken as the
underlying state of the UK's trade with the rest of the world  - widened
from Pounds 1.2bn in June to Pounds 1.4bn in July. However, in the three
months to July, it was only slightly worse than it had been in the previous
three-month period.
The UK's surplus on erratic items grew from Pounds 167m in June to Pounds
209m, mainly because of unusually low aircraft imports. Trade in oil was in
balance compared with a surplus of Pounds 74m in June.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Electricity workers accept 'inferior' pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES at the merged retail arms of Eastern Electricity and Southern
Electric, the two largest privatised electricity companies, have accepted
new terms and conditions that union leaders admit are not as good as
national ones.
The deal is among the first local packages to be concluded among the 19 main
employers in the privatised industry. The first was at PowerGen, the
generator, where 6,500 employees agreed to harmonised terms and conditions,
single-table bargaining and increasingly flexible working.
The last national pay settlement in the electricity supply industry was
negotiated this year, with a 5.5 per cent settlement for 1992-93. Employers
then gave 12 months' notice of their intention to negotiate locally next
year.
The retail business, E&amp;S Retail, was created earlier this year with the
merger of the retail and appliance servicing businesses of Southern Electric
and Eastern Electricity.
The new company, which began trading in April, has about 230 retail outlets
across the south and east of England.
Mr Paul O'Shea, southern district officer for Nalgo, the public services
union, said acceptance of the package was a recognition of the bad trading
conditions into which the recession had forced the sector.
Of the 1,391 Nalgo members balloted, 78 per cent accepted the agreement,
which took nearly a year to negotiate. Its terms include a freeze on staff
pay, a reduction in holiday entitlement and a more flexible working week.
Mr Derrick Burch, chairman of Nalgo's southern district electricity
committee, said staff had been told that, in order to survive, the new
company needed to restructure itself and its salaries in line with the
competition. He added that other companies were closing retail outlets and
servicing businesses.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Industry fears weak dollar will worsen recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR INDUSTRIAL STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING British industri-alists yesterday voiced fears that the rise of
sterling to Dollars 2 would worsen the recession.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said the fall in
the dollar would cost his company several million pounds a year. 'It is the
biggest problem in the industry for five years,' he said. 'The European
currency bloc is ridiculously overvalued.'
Jaguar, which last year had 44 per cent of its sales in the US, described
the dollar rate as preposterous.
Mr David Boole, director of public affairs, said: 'For Jaguar as an
operating unit the exchange rate is a disaster. Our cars have little US
content. It is still the problem of making cars in pounds and selling them
in dollars.'
Mr Peter Bates, sales and marketing director of the Savoy hotel group, said:
'There is no doubt that it is very expensive for an American to come here at
the moment.'
The number of guests from the US, who account for 50 per cent of the group's
customers, has fallen by 10 per cent. Since last November American guests at
the group's hotels have been offered rooms at a fixed exchange rate of
Dollars 1.70 to the pound.
Other companies were less worried. The automotive component maker T&amp;N said
the dollar rate was 'not much of a problem in real terms'.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our US companies are
virtually currency neutral in terms of their balance sheets and borrowings.
We do not export much to the US from Europe now since we have big US
manufacturing operations.
GEC, the electronics group which has extensive operations in the US, said
the strength of sterling would be only marginally more negative than
positive.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace company which has plants in the US and UK,
said the currency change was a factor in deciding where to locate new
production. But Mr Christopher Taylor, finance director, said: 'Sales into
dollar economies which are being delivered now were sold at much better than
the present rate. And the forward rate over two years for new deals is more
like Dollars 1.80.'
Mr Taylor also pointed out that the group hedged its dollar exposure.
Courtaulds Textiles' Mr Martin Taylor said this did not apply in his
company's case. 'You can't hedge economic disadvantage. Imports come in from
countries with a dollar cost base like the Far East. It isn't about exports,
it's about import competition.'
Mr Donald Anderson, chief economist at chemicals company Courtaulds, said
the effect of the cheap dollar was limited by long-term contracts and high
barriers to entry in its markets.
But he said 'the dollar is a problem when we translate our profits into
sterling'.
Computer manufacturers said the impact of the falling dollar was broadly
neutral. Most computer components  - microprocessors, disk drives and power
supplies  - are bought in dollars. The slight advantage this will give
non-US suppliers, however, will quickly be countered by the lower cost of
complete US-made systems.
Dr Peter Horne, chairman of Apricot Computers, the UK-based workstation
manufacturer owned by Mitsubishi of Japan, which turned over Pounds 45m last
year, said it might mean an extra 1 per cent or 2 per cent on gross profit
margins, but the effect would be swamped by the savage price-cutting which
characterises the global personal computer business.
Mr Stan Boland, treasurer for ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan, said the
company bought components for its personal computers and mid-range systems
in dollars, but hedged against currency fluctuations by means of forward
contracts and options.
Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, said: 'We operate as a
local producer rather than an exporter. We have not repatriated profits in
recent years but have re-invested them in the US cement and concrete
businesses. All our US borrowings are matched against US assets. We are less
vulnerable, therefore, to currency fluctuations.'
Some other companies said that conditions were so bad in the US that the
dollar's weakness made little difference.
One UK group with housebuilding and aggregates interests in the US said: 'It
would be nice to have enough US profits to be adversely affected by currency
movements.'
For one group of companies the move is good news. Travel operators say that
prices of holidays to the US have come down. Prices to other destinations
have also eased because the travel companies pay for their aircraft fuel in
dollars.
Mr Roger Heape, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said that the
state of the dollar had allowed the company to offer 1993 holidays at prices
6 per cent lower than this year. BA Holidays has been able to introduce new
holiday programmes to the US west coast, New England and the north-east.

FT  25 AUG 92 / IoD calls for abolition of 'archaic' business licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE of Directors is calling on the government to abolish or reform
more than 80 licences which it claims can stifle the creation and growth of
new businesses.
In response to a request from the Department of Trade and Industry, the IoD
has identified a range of licences which it says either impede market entry
for small businesses or entail prohibitive costs.
A list submitted to Baroness Denton, the minister for small businesses, has
earmarked 50 licences for abolition and a further 29 which the IoD says
should be reviewed.
According to the IoD more than 200 types of business require licences, many
of which it believes are 'archaic and irrelevant'. Among the licences it
suggests should be abolished are those for late-night cafes, driving
instructors and private car-hire businesses. Others include licences for
selling alcohol for off-premises consumption, for employment agencies and
for keeping a bull as a semen donor.
The IoD says the common justification for licences is the protection of
health and safety, crime prevention and the protection of economic
interests.
Mr Ian Smedley, the IoD's small business research executive, said: 'Health
and safety must be safeguarded, but in most cases general statutes and the
operation of the market provide better protection than licences.
'Small businesses are more severely affected by licensing than larger ones.
They must cope with the same onerous requirements as big companies but with
fewer management resources.'
He added: 'The cost of management time appearing in person in court to
present a licence application is a heavy burden.'
Earlier this year the DTI said that it was stepping up its drive to cut the
red tape entangling many of Britain's smaller businesses. It indicated that
regulations on businesses such as betting shops, employment agencies and
some professional partnerships could be revised or abandoned.
The government says it is committed to reducing the 'irksome burdens' on
companies and is examining regulations governing them. Further deregulatory
initiatives are expected following the review.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Plea to protect dolphins: British Association for the
Advancement of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNIE LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PANEL of zoologists yes-terday highlighted the need for urgent action to
save whales and dolphins from their main enemy  - the drift net  - at the
association's annual meeting.
Professor Guiseppe Notobartolo di Sciara, of the Tethys Research Institute
in Milan, said drift-net fishing was the main cause of dolphin deaths in the
Mediterranean.
According to European Community laws, drift nets should be no longer than
2.5km. Prof di Sciara said: 'In Italy these laws are not being enforced.'
Nets 12km and 15km long were being used by hundreds of fishermen.
He suggested that a dolphin sanctuary, monitored by an international
authority, be set up in the area bounded by Toulon, Genoa and southern
Corsica, where all drift-net fishing would be banned.
There are no dolphin sanctuaries in the Mediterranean at present.
Dr Margaret Klinowska, of Cambridge University's unit of mammalian ecology,
said sonic reflectors attached to drift nets at three-metre intervals could
make nets appear to dolphins sufficiently like walls that they would avoid
becoming trapped.
The reflectors have been developed in collaboration with scientists at
Loughborough University, their design being determined by engineering
knowledge and dolphin habits.
Dolphins navigate using a form of sonar, measuring the time taken for sound
to bounce off objects.
Dr Klinowska said that dolphins emit ultrasonic signals, above the range of
the human ear, which would bounce off the reflectors, alerting them to
something in their path.
She said fishermen were keen to use the reflectors, 'even though it puts 10
per cent on the price of their nets'. She added: 'The main problem with
their use is storage.'
Further testing, to achieve the best arrangement of reflectors and to reduce
the bulk and weight of modified nets, was needed. The research would cost
Pounds 300,000 over three years.

FT  25 AUG 92 / TV changes anger Attenborough: British Association for the
Advancement of Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is forcing changes on British television that threaten to
destroy the BBC and ITV as sources of high quality programmes, Sir David
Attenborough, the naturalist and broadcaster, said last night.
In his presidential address to the annual meeting of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science in Southampton, Sir David expressed most
concern about cuts at the BBC.
He said the BBC was 'an institution that has produced programmes as
efficiently as any in the world and to the highest of all standards'.
It had provided this country with two television and four radio stations,
but was now being 'gravely eroded, the morale of its staff seriously damaged
and the very things that gave it its unique structure and strength
destroyed'.
Sir David, the first professional populariser of science to be chosen as the
association's president, attacked the changes because television was 'so
overwhelmingly important in the dissemination of scientific knowledge'.
He predicted that science would be squeezed out of ITV schedules because it
could not deliver the 8m audience required for a programme to be shown at
peak evening viewing times. 'From next year onwards, no serious science
programme will be shown on independent television at times that most people
are able to see them,' he said.
Sir David made clear, however, that his concerns for the BBC extended far
beyond science programmes. The corporation's policy of replacing a quarter
of its output with programmes by small independent units was an 'extremely
questionable' way of cutting costs. 'There is no evidence whatever that
competition in broadcasting has ever reduced costs  - and a great deal to
show that it significantly increases them,' he said.
'Nor can it be claimed that the system will encourage innovation. What a
small company needs is programmes that are sure-fire winners. The last thing
it can afford to do is to take major risks.'
Meanwhile the BBC was getting rid of staff. 'The accountants have moved into
production offices and in an attempt to make everyone cost-conscious they
are insisting that even the tiniest action, such as taking a book from a
library, should be costed and logged  - a system that in itself has required
the setting up of a huge new bureaucracy.'
Sir David urged the scientific community to 'contribute with all the
strength at its disposal' to the debate on the government's green paper on
the BBC, due out next month, 'and protect what is left of public-service
broadcasting'.
Sir David made clear his dismay at the prospect of the BBC being compelled
'to concentrate entirely on serious and less popular programmes'. This would
not only prevent it from building its audiences by attracting viewers with
popular programmes and encouraging them to sample other kinds, 'but it also
robs it of the widespread popular support that is essential if the payment
of a licence is to be acceptable to the public at large'.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Japanese win County Hall judicial review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will have to defend in the High Court its controversial
decision to allow the London School of Economics to bid for County Hall, the
landmark London site across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament.
The High Court yesterday gave Shirayama Corporation, the Japanese developer
which bought County Hall in March, the right to seek judicial review of the
decision last month by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, to
allow the social science university to mount a counter bid.
That decision angered Shirayama, which believed an 'opt-out' clause in its
purchase agreement with the London Residuary Body, the owner of the site on
behalf of the London boroughs, would be exercised only if Labour won this
year's general election.
The LSE's interest in the site was well known when Mr Michael Heseltine,
then environment secretary, sanctioned the LRB sale to Shirayama. But last
month Mr Howard decided to allow the LSE to bid and ordered the LRB not to
proceed without his consent.
The LRB is strongly opposed to the LSE's counter bid, describing it earlier
this month as 'highly speculative and not worth serious consideration'.
Mr Justice Otton, granting Shirayama permission to seek judicial review,
said the developer had an 'arguable case' that Mr Howard was exceeding his
statutory powers in issuing his order.
Shirayama, which proposes to convert County Hall into a luxury 600-bed
hotel, paid about Pounds 60m for the building. The LSE is offering Pounds
65m for the Hall and its surrounding site. It wants to relocate from its
cramped premises off Aldwych and create a 'social science park' as part of
its plan to promote itself as 'Europe's social science university'.
The cabinet is known to be split on the merits of the LSE's bid. A final
decision is expected in early September.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC and Social Research Council is to carry out a Pounds 1.4m
investigation of the nation's diet to discover why the British choose to eat
what they do.
A pilot study for the programme, launched at the meeting, suggested that bad
eating habits among children may be broken more easily than previously
imagined.
Professor Fergus Lowe and colleagues at the University of Wales convinced a
group of six-year-olds to eat vegetables they previously would not touch  -
such as broccoli  - by showing a video in which the broccoli-loving Food
Dudes triumph over General Junk and his Junk Junta.
The researchers now believe that children's dislike of certain foods is
normally 'not very deep-seated, not biological or personality based'.
Combinations of pesticides could form lethal cocktails, endangering
wildlife. Dr Colin Walker, of Reading University's zoology department, said
some mixtures of chemicals had a combined action more potent than the sum of
the effects of the components.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Annual health spending forecast to top Pounds 40bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HEALTHCARE spending in the UK will top Pounds 40bn this year
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
about Pounds 640 per person  - according to figures published today by the
Office of Health Economics, the research unit funded by the British
pharmaceutical industry.
Per capita health spending has almost doubled in real terms since 1973,
rising from 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product to an all-time high of
6.5 per cent. The growth in the private health sector has been particularly
marked, with spending on private healthcare rising three times as fast as
spending on the National Health Service.
The figures, published in the eighth OHE Compendium of Health Statistics,
demonstrate the inexorable rise in the cost of the NHS.
The gross cost of the NHS is estimated to reach a record Pounds 35bn by the
end of this year, double the level in 1973 in real terms. Growth in real
terms has, however, slowed markedly from 5.5 per cent a year in the 1960s
and 1970s to just 3 per cent in the 1980s. At 88 per cent of the total, the
NHS now accounts for a lower proportion of total UK health spending than
previously.
Spending on non-prescribed pharmaceutical products amounts to Pounds 2.1bn,
with private healthcare worth Pounds 2.8bn. Private medical insurance covers
one in six households, with a record 7.5m people (13 per cent of the UK
population).
Although the coverage of the private healthcare sector has almost doubled in
size every 10 years over the past four decades, the total spent remains
relatively small at about Pounds 400 per insured household per year.
The UK continues to lag behind other industrialised countries in the level
of its health spending. The average for members of the Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development is 9 per cent of GDP, with countries
such as France and Canada spending a quarter more per person than the UK.
The compendium also shows the considerable growth in the NHS workforce, up
from 575,000 in 1961 to 1.2m last year. Most of this rise has been in the
hospital sector, with about two thirds contributed by nurses, midwives and
medical staff.
There has been a sizeable reduction in the number of hospitals in this
period, however, down from about 3,000 to 2,000. The number of beds has
fallen from 550,000 to 330,000.
In spite of the reduction in beds the number of in-patients treated in NHS
hospitals has reached a record 9.2m (compared with 3.8m in 1951). The
increase is largely due to a reduction in the average length of stay from 45
days to 11 days.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Lib Dems to examine identity and strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Liberal Democrats are to carry out an extensive review of the party's
identity, philosophy and strategy at next month's conference, which could
mean a reappraisal of their attitude to a possible pact with the Labour
party.
Mr Charles Kennedy, party president, said yesterday at the launch of the
conference agenda: 'The party will consider whether we still hold out
replacing Labour as an objective  - short or long-term  - and, if not, what
implications does that have for our political stance now?'
The debate will be spread over most of the Harrogate conference. It will
start with a consultative session on the first afternoon, which will form
the basis for a motion for formal debate later in the week.
There will be a separate debate on a consultation paper, Challenge,
Opportunity and Responsibility, drawn up by a working group chaired by Mr
Paddy Ashdown, party leader.
The paper, to be published a week before the conference, is designed to
raise questions about the policy issues that will have to be addressed in
the next general election, with the intention of producing a framework
document for consideration at next year's conference.
Mr Kennedy emphasised that the strategy discussion would be primarily about
the Liberal Democrats themselves rather than the prospect of deals with
other parties. He said Mr Ashdown had made clear that he did not see a way
forward for 'mechanistic pacts'.
Two fringe meetings will be addressed by Labour MPs. Mr Calum MacDonald, MP
for the Western Isles, will speak at a meeting organised by LINk, an
organisation formed to discuss electoral co-operation. Mr Frank Field, MP
for Birkenhead, will take part in a debate with Sir David Steel, the former
Liberal leader, on whether realignment could deliver electoral success for
the centre-left.
The conference will be addressed by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish
foreign minister  - just two days before it is to discuss a motion calling
on Denmark to reconsider its Maastricht treaty referendum result and a week
before the French referendum on the issue.

FT  25 AUG 92 / HSE acts on finger disease: British Association for the

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNIQUES to combat asbestos-related lung cancer and vibration white
finger, the most commonly reported industrial disease last year, were
announced yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Although only 5,400 cases of vibration white finger (VWF) were reported last
year, the HSE estimates that about 20,000 British workers suffer from it
moderately or severely. VWF, which was recognised officially in 1985, is
caused by vibrating hand-tools such as grinders, pneumatic drills and
chainsaws. It leads to pain and loss of strength in the fingers.
A computerised technique for measuring vibration in the hands will identify
workers at risk in the foundry industry and in shipbuilding and repair
yards. An HSE survey showed that 130,000 people used vibrating equipment for
long enough to cause concern.
Once those at risk have been identified, either the tools will be adapted to
dampen vibration or workers will use them for shorter periods.
The HSE will also monitor the number of asbestos fibres in the air, using a
light-scattering technique which gives an instant reading. Sir John Cullen,
chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, part of the HSE, said more
than 1,000 cases a year of lung cancer were attributable to asbestos
exposure. He said the instrument, which is likely to cost up to Pounds
10,000, would help to reduce exposure 'during the huge programme of asbestos
removal now going on'.

MR IAN BYATT, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
yesterday acted to ensure that water companies could not use funds from
their core businesses to subsidise other activities.
Using new powers available to him after publication of the Competition and
Services (Utilities) Act in July, Mr Byatt published proposed amendments to
water companies' operating licences designed to give him greater control
over their non-regulated businesses.
Water companies have diversified into many fields since they were privatised
in 1989.
The proposals include a ban on cross-subsidies between water companies and
their associated companies, or between their water businesses and any other
businesses.
Water companies would also be prohibited from allowing an associated company
to supply any service that the core company might supply as part of its
regulated water business, on more or less favourable terms than those
available from the core company.

SEACONTAINERS, the UK shipping company, has joined the bidding for the Queen
Mary, the former flagship of the Cunard shipping line moored as a tourist
attraction at Long Beach, California.
The company last night pledged a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 50,251) deposit to
the City of Long Beach, the ship's owner, which is looking for a buyer
following the decision by the Walt Disney entertainment group not to renew
its lease on the site near Los Angeles.
Seacontainers, which will announce its bid formally today, is forming a new
company  - RMS Queen Mary  - to bring the 1,019ft-vessel back to
Southampton, her home port from where she sailed to Long Beach on October 31
1967.
Mr James Sherwood, company chairman, said a statement would be issued on the
project today after expiry of the deadline for bids in Long Beach last
night.
Seacontainers hopes further surveys and negotiations with Long Beach will
lead to the Queen Mary's return to the UK, where she could be redeveloped as
a conference centre, hotel and casino.
Seacontainers is thought to be one of four international bidders interested
in the 81,232-ton liner. Long Beach Harbour Commission last night said at
least 12 proposals had been received for the vessel.
Of the international bids, only one involves British backers. The others are
thought to include a scheme to tow the vessel to Japan where she could be
refurbished as an office block.
The liner was put on the market after Walt Disney decided it could no longer
afford the mounting maintenance costs. Disney is thought to have lost
Dollars 5m a year since it leased the vessel in 1988 as a floating hotel and
museum.
The Southampton-based Queen Mary Project welcomed last night's bid.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ST IVES printing group has agreed to formal talks with the GPMU print
union about the use of casual or temporary labour in its magazine division.
The agreement to talk follows a GPMU ballot on industrial action after the
company refused to stop hiring casual staff in the unskilled finishing area
at Pounds 3 an hour, compared with the usual Pounds 5.85.
The 1,000 GPMU members who work in the seven St Ives web-offset plants -
printing magazines such as the Economist, Company and New Woman  - voted
overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action short of a strike and by a far
smaller majority in favour of strike action.
Mr Tony Dubbins, GPMU general secretary, said that after the company's
positive response to a request for talks no industrial action was being
considered.
The union hopes to negotiate a group-wide agreement on the limited use of
casual labour with St Ives and so block any wider move to casualisation in
the industry.

MR IAN BYATT, director-general of water industry regulator Ofwat, yesterday

Using new powers available to him after publication of the Competition and
Services (Utilities) Act in July, Mr Byatt published proposed amendments to
water companies' operating licences designed to give him greater control
over their non-regulated businesses.
Water companies have diversified since they were privatised in 1989 into
fields including environmental and engineering services, waste management,
and even hotel management to try to maximise earnings from businesses not
regulated by Ofwat.
In spite of water companies' denials, Ofwat says there is 'anecdotal
evidence' of some cross-subsidisation.
The proposals include a ban on cross-subsidies between water companies and
their associated companies, or between their water businesses and any other
businesses.
Water companies would also be prohibited from allowing an associated company
to supply any service that the core company might itself supply as part of
its regulated water business, on more or less favourable terms than those
available from the core company.
It would be compulsory for water companies to give Ofwat full details of any
transactions between themselves and associated companies of more than 0.5
per cent of their water business turnover, or Pounds 100,000.
Companies have until October 2 to respond.
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 privatised water and
sewage companies, said the proposals would not cause concern.

Mr Sean O'Reilly, who ran a business making sports trophies, denies

posing as a partner in solicitors Asshetons and instructing its bank to
transfer the money from its client account to one of Mr O'Reilly's personal

Asshetons discovered its account had been emptied, however, and obtained a

It was clear that at least one other person, somebody with inside knowledge

FT  25 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Bush's China trade policy a sure winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE new hardening of US trade policy towards China is a sure winner for
President George Bush. As Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, made
clear last week, either China caves in by October 10 and agrees to US
demands that it should open its markets, or Mr Bush will announce billions
of dollars in sanctions.
If China does yield to US pressure, the president will have another foreign
and economic policy success; if not, Mr Bush can prove that he is no longer
rolling over to the communist superpower as he did in the days after the
Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations were suppressed.
How tough the sanctions will be must still be seen. The American Textile
Manufacturers Institute is convinced the administration was 'pulling its
punches' when last week it released a Dollars 3.9bn (Pounds 2bn) proposed
'hit list' of possible sanctions targets.
The list had been drawn up in response to industry comment from all sectors
as the trade representative had requested. Honey made the list, as the
American Honey Producers' Association had asked, as did bicycles and other
targets suggested by their industry associations, but textiles and apparel
were barely represented, though both have been severely hit over the years
by Chinese competition.
'We never received any good reasons why we were turned down,' said Mr Carlos
Moore, executive director of the American Textile Institute. 'They claimed
the consumer would be hurt because it would create short supply, but we took
care to ask for products which could have substitutes readily available.'
Instead, the list included only silk, or apparel with a silk component
(items for which demand exists all over the world), Mr Moore said. The other
items on the list are now more easily transshipped through third countries,
because the US Customs Service has focused most of its efforts on textiles
and clothing.
In an election campaign, one of the advantages of being an incumbent
president is the ability to control timing, Mr Harry Freeman, a prominent
trade lobbyist, said.
It was no coincidence that the North American Free Trade Agreement between
the US, Canada and Mexico was announced the week before the Republican
convention. An administration press aide confirmed the White House had had
the Nafta press conference scheduled during 'a window of opportunity' in the
president's schedule, even before the negotiations were completed.
The administration had promised a worker adjustment programme would be
included in Nafta legislation, but a few weeks ago it had only begun to
gather opinions about its shape. Yesterday, however, Mr Bush announced a
grand restructuring of worker training schemes, a move he could have made
months ago except there was no political campaign to drive events.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE beer makers hope to boost their market shares in the US, Europe and
Asia, Reuter reports from Tokyo. At present, Japanese exports account for
only a small fraction of the brew drunk around the world.
Japan's four biggest brewers, Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory, export
about 30,000 kilolitres of beer each year, but world beer consumption is
well over 100m kilolitres.
At the top of the Japan brewers' list of targets is the US. Imported beer
accounted for some 4-5 per cent of the 22.7m kilolitres Americans drank in
1990. Imports are about 2 per cent of the 6.6m-kilolitre Japan market.
Sapporo is leading the way in the US market, aiming at sales of 1.5m cases
in 1992, against 1.4m in 1991, Mr Kenzo Sakami, general manager, said.
Asahi aims to increase its US beer sales to 850,000 cases in 1992 from
700,000 cases a year earlier. Each case holds 12 bottles of 0.633 litres.
Kirin and Suntory have made a link-up with Canadian brewers. Molson, based
in Montreal, is now brewing Kirin beer for export to the US, where Kirin
expects to sell some 1.3m cases in 1992. The Toronto-based John Labatt
brewery started making Suntory's canned draught beer in February, and
Suntory aims to sell 200,000 cases in the first year in the US.
Japanese brewers are also eyeing the potentially lucrative European market.
Kirin is trying to strengthen its sales in Europe through a tie-up with
Britain's Charles Wells, which will make Kirin lager at its factory in
Bedford, starting in February 1993.
Charles Wells plans to brew 150,000 cases of Kirin in the first year and
300,000 cases a year by 1996.
The Japanese companies are also keen to expand in Asian countries such as
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, which have low import duties on beer.

FT  25 AUG 92 / World Trade News: EC copier makers still fighting Japan - To
end dumping duties would be seen as a blow to business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's decision to review its 20 per cent anti-dumping
duty on Japanese photocopier imports highlights the depressing reality that
after five years of protection, European manufacturers are still struggling
in the face of Japanese competition.
The Commission has announced it has opened a formal investigation into
Japanese photocopiers, after complaints from European manufacturers that the
20 per cent anti-dumping duties imposed in 1987 had not achieved intended
objectives.
The European makers, Rank Xerox, Oce of the Netherlands and Olivetti, claim
further that if the duties were allowed to lapse this year as scheduled, it
would injure their business. 'We have not seen the improvement in
profitability in our copier business that we should have seen as a result of
the anti-dumping duties,' says Mr David Whibley, senior legal counsel at
Rank Xerox, the US-UK company.
The photocopier duties were imposed five years ago after the Commission
found that Japanese photocopier manufacturers were dumping products in the
EC  - that is, selling them at prices lower than those in their domestic
market. The duties were to lapse automatically after a period of five years
which ended this February. Over that period, however, the duties were
supposed to have raised the prices of Japanese photocopiers sold in Europe.
This, in turn, was to have improved the competitiveness of European
manufacturers by raising their profitability, plant capacity utilisation and
market share.
Instead, the main effect of the anti-dumping duties was to quicken the pace
of Japanese investment in facilities in Europe and reduce imports from
Ecu1bn (Pounds 720m) to Ecu500m. Prices meanwhile have stayed level or even
declined and 'consumers are continuing to enjoy a price honeymoon', says Mr
Whibley. Rank Xerox points out that the price of one particular
Japanese-made machine sold in Germany has fallen from DM3,600 (Pounds 1,276)
in 1988 to DM3,480 for this year's model.
These price levels show that the Japanese have been bearing the extra amount
of the duty and have in effect continued to dump products, the Europeans
say. Rank Xerox says that because of the artificially low price levels set
by the Japanese, it has not been able to obtain a reasonable rate of return
on sales, which the Commission considers is about 12 per cent for the
photocopier industry.
It further blames the low prices for its inability to increase market share.
Furthermore, Rank Xerox itself has maintained its market share, running at
11 per cent, according to Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy, but
the aggregate market share for European manufacturers has declined.
This is not surprising, as the number of European manufacturers of
photocopiers has fallen from five when the duties were imposed to just
three. The other two have been acquired by the Japanese.
Meanwhile, European dependence on Japanese manufacturers has increased.
Olivetti manufactures copiers through a joint venture with Canon; this
relationship has led the Commission to exclude it from its list of Europeans
that would suffer from removal of the anti-dumping duties.
In addition, the Commission is also considering extending the duties to
higher-end machines able to copy 75 or more pages a minute which had been
exempted from the original action because they were not made by Japanese
manufacturers at the time. However, the Japanese have now entered this
market, which had previously been the preserve of Rank Xerox and Oce.
Japanese companies deny that prices have been kept at artificially low
levels. 'The 20 per cent duty has raised prices so we have tried to bring
manufacturing costs down,' says a representative for Ricoh in Europe.
Canon says it has been able to maintain the largest market share in Europe
without necessarily having the lowest prices.
The Japanese feel that the Europeans are also responsible for their lack of
competitiveness. Rank Xerox and Oce have concentrated their efforts on
higher-end machines and neglected the lower end of the market, one Japanese
manufacturer says. 'It is no surprise that they cannot compete in that
sector.'
As a result of that strategy, Rank and Oce dominate the higher end of the
market, where profit margins are higher. Although Rank Xerox trails Canon in
terms of market share, it is ahead in terms of revenue.
Neither do they agree with the European view of what constitutes reasonable
profitability. European manufacturers may say that a reasonable return on
sales is 12 per cent but Japanese companies would consider a return on sales
of 3.5 per cent respectable. 'In Japan, no company has a return on sales of
12 per cent. If the Europeans expect a 12 per cent return, we can only sigh
in response,' says one manufacturer.
The Commission will spend many months examining prices in Japan and the EC
in an attempt to determine whether dumping has continued.
The most important question it needs to address, however, is whether it is
ultimately in the Community's interest to continue imposing duties on
Japanese photocopiers. 'Do they merit the protection, or should we let these
companies sink?' asks one Commission representative.
If the duties are continued and extended, the most likely effect is not to
raise prices but further to encourage Japanese manufacturing in Europe.
Recent history has shown, however, that this in itself is not likely to
improve the Europeans' competitiveness to their satisfaction.

BALKAN Bulgarian Airlines, the Bulgarian national airline, is seeking
foreign partners as part of its privatisation.
The UK-based financial adviser S G Warburg is preparing a prospectus on the
company and will be seeking airline partners within six weeks. Warburg said
it hopes to have found potential partners by late 1992 or early 1993.
Balkan Bulgarian Airlines has nine western-built aircraft, consisting of
five Boeings and four Airbuses. It also has a fleet of 51 aircraft from the
former Soviet Union. In 1991 it employed 4,000 people and had revenues of
about Dollars 170m (Pounds 89m), S G Warburg said.
The airline was given national carrier status by the Bulgarian Council of
ministers on August 10. This gave it a 15-year franchise as the sole
Bulgarian-based carrier to travel to 53 specified international destinations
in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Far East. S G Warburg said the
Bulgarian government would retain a stake in the new enterprise,though it
was not clear if this would be a controlling holding.

<TEXT>
TURKEY has agreed terms for a build-operate-and-transfer (BOT) coal-fired
power plant, under a deal signed with a US consortium led by Trinity
Partners International of Pennsylvania.
The privately-financed 237MW plant at Cankiri Orta, 130 miles from Ankara,
is estimated to cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) including developing a
nearby 100m tonne coal deposit.
Trinity Partners, with Pagro Power Alhlstron, will build and run the plant
for 26 years under the BOT arrangement before handing over to Tek, the
Turkish power utility.
The project, the first big infrastructure deal agreed by the government of
Mr Suleyman Demirel, will encourage investors trying to get BOT proposals
started.
Ankara is studying a similar arrangement for its city Metro. Lockheed has
been negotiating a BOT proposal for Istanbul airport for two years. Thames
Water, in a consortium with the local Gama group, is seeking agreement with
Istanbul's water authority to take water from a proposed dam and pipeline
project at Izmit.
The Trinity consortium will use Alhlstron's fluidised bed technology,
employing low calorific lignite coal without the extra investment of
emission scrubbers.
The company says the design, well tried under US environmental conditions,
meets World Bank and Turkish emission standards.
The consortium has been given until December 1993 to arrange finance.
Hambros Resource Development Incorporation in Chicago is lead bank. Equity
will account for 20 per cent, the rest raised in loans. The company is
looking to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's
private-sector lending arm, to take an equity role.
It will recover its loan costs by selling power to Tek at pre-arranged
prices.

JAPANESE beer makers are hoping to boost their market shares in the US,
Europe and Asia, Reuter reports from Tokyo. At present, Japanese exports
account for only a small fraction of the brew drunk around the world.
Japan's four biggest brewers, Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory export about
30,000 kilo-litres of beer each year, but world beer consumption is well
over 100m kilolitres, the Brewers' Association of Japan says.
At the top of the Japan brewers' list of targets is the US, where total beer
consumption and the imports share of the market are both high. While Germans
top the world in per capita beer consumption, the total amount of beer
consumed annually in the US is about twice as much as in Germany, according
to the Brewers' Association.
Imported beer accounted for some 4-5 per cent of the 22.7m kilolitres
Americans drank in 1990. Imports are about 2 per cent of the 6.6m-kilolitre
Japan market.
Overseas, Japanese beer has been sold mainly to Japanese restaurants or
oriental supermarkets, but that is changing. 'Japanese beer is increasingly
popular among Americans,' an Asahi official said. 'Sixty per cent of our
beer (sold in the US) now goes to the local market, such as ordinary
supermarkets and liquor shops.'
Sapporo is leading the way in the US market, aiming at sales of 1.5m cases
in 1992, compared with 1.4m in 1991, Mr Kenzo Sakami, general manager at
Sapporo, said.
Asahi aims to increase its US beer sales to 850,000 cases in 1992 from
700,000 cases a year earlier. Each case holds 12 bottles of 0.633 litres.
Kirin and Suntory have made a link-up with Canadian brewers to make beer
that will maintain the premium image of imported beer in the US but be
fresher on the shelves.
Molson, based in Montreal, is now brewing Kirin beer for export to the US,
where Kirin expects to sell some 1.3m cases in 1992. The Toronto-based John
Labatt brewery started making Suntory's canned draft beer in February, and
Suntory aims to sell 200,000 cases in the first year in the US.
Japanese brewers are also eyeing the potentially lucrative European market.
'With the integration of the European Community, its economy is expected to
grow, and this would lead to a rise in beer consumption,' Mr Sakami said.
Kirin is trying to strengthen its sales in Europe through a tie-up with
Britain's Charles Wells, which will make Kirin lager at its factory in
Bedford, starting in February 1993. Charles Wells plans to brew 150,000
cases of Kirin in the year starting February 1993 and 300,000 cases a year
by 1996.
The Japanese companies are also keen to expand in Asian countries such as
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, which have low import duties on beer. The
Hong Kong-based San Miguel Brewery, a unit of San Miguel Corporation of the
Philippines, is brewing Kirin beer for domestic sales and exports to other
Asian countries. 'We expect an increase in Asia's beer consumption as its
economy develops,' Mr Samuro added.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Bush reveals training package

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush tried to put some flesh on his domestic policies
yesterday by unveiling job training programmes designed to make the American
labour force more competitive.
His grandiosely titled New Century Workforce, an amalgam of new and existing
training schemes, would not take effect until 1994. It involves, assuming
Congress goes along, new federal spending of as much as Dollars 6bn (Pounds
3.1bn), to be offset by unspecified budget cuts elsewhere, and preserves a
number of programmes the administration had previously tried to kill off.
One feature is to combine youth job training with drug treatment at military
installations which are to be made redundant as defence spending falls.
Another would provide Dollars 3,000 in retraining vouchers for those laid
off in industries adversely affected by changing international competition.
The policy package is designed to answer criticisms by Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, that Mr Bush is ignoring fundamental
economic questions in his campaign. It is also a response to the specific
concern that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada
would displace US workers.
In a speech in New Jersey yesterday morning, Mr Bush predictably contrasted
his new scheme with the proposals of Mr Clinton, which he said required new
taxes and would destroy jobs, not generate them. Its thrust, he said, was
'to empower people with jobs instead of empowering bureaucracies with
people'.
Most of the public opinion polls conducted after last week's Republican
convention in Houston continue to suggest that economic problems are the
president's Achilles heel in the campaign. A Time magazine survey found only
22 per cent giving him good marks for handling the economy, whereas 61 per
cent approved of his management of foreign policy.
In general terms, the polls are beginning to suggest that the president did
not get quite the 'bounce' out of his convention that Mr Clinton got out of
the Democrats' gathering in New York last month. Newsweek gave Mr Clinton a
53-39 point edge, down a little from 53-36 a week earlier, while CNN-USA
Today had it at 52-42 (compared with 56-37). Time elicited a 54-40 negative
response to the question 'does Mr Bush deserve to be re-elected?'

FT  25 AUG 92 / Arabs detect positive Israeli stance as talks resume
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARAB delegations to the Middle East peace talks said there was a new and
positive atmosphere in yesterday's session of negotiations in Washington,
the first to be held since general elections in Israel brought a Labour
government to power, headed by Mr Yitzhak Rabin. The delegations
representing Israel, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians have agreed
to spend a month in Washington in the hope of a breakthrough.
Israel helped to improve the atmosphere by announcing shortly before the
delegates arrived at the State Department that an expulsion order against 11
Palestinians made by the previous Israeli government had been revoked.
Ms Bushra Kanafani, the Syrian spokeswoman, said that she had detected a
'different tone, a different style and a different approach' from the
Israeli delegation. Israel had tabled a document containing both procedural
ideas and substantive proposals on the future of the Golan Heights which is
the key bilateral issue for the two delegations.
Mr Marwan Mouasher, the Jordanian spokesman, said he had also found a new
tone in Israeli statements and a new terminology 'more consistent with
international law'. Israel had put forward an agenda for discussion which
incorporated ideas introduced previously by Jordan, an indication of a more
constructive approach, he said.
He added that the Israeli delegation had committed itself to negotiate on
the basis of UN Resolution 242 and all its aspects. The resolution calls on
Israel to withdraw from the territory it occupied in 1967 in return for a
full and comprehensive peace.
The change in tone could not disguise, however, the huge differences that
continue to separate the delegations on matters of substance.
Mr Yossi Gal, the Israeli spokesman, said yesterday that his government
would be making a series of specific proposals to the Palestinian delegation
when they hold their first session later today, relating particularly to the
powers of an interim self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza.
He warned the Palestinians that this elected body would have strictly
administrative functions. The Palestinians are insisting that it must have a
legislative function, which Mr Gal said yesterday would invest it with the
symbol of statehood and would not be accepted by Israel.
Mr Gal added that Israel had embarked on a series of confidence building
measures to which he hoped the Arab delegations would respond. He cited the
decision to withdraw the expulsion orders against 11 Palestinians.
Dozens of Palestinians have been expelled since the uprising, or intifada,
began in late 1987. The expulsions have been condemned as a violation of
international law.
The announcement came 24 hours after Israel had eased some restrictions on
Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank and Gaza and prepared
to release 800 Arab prisoners from jail.
Hopes of a breakthrough at the Washington talks were initially raised by the
change of government in Israel which brought Mr Yitzhak Rabin to power,
replacing the hardline Mr Yitzhak Shamir who was ideologically committed to
retaining control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr Rabin has said that he
would like to negotiate a form of autonomy for the Palestinians and to reach
agreement the creation of an interim self-governing authority within nine
months.
There have also been indications that Israel has prepared ideas to be put to
the Syrians on the future of the Golan Heights, including a partial Israeli
withdrawal and demilitarisation. Syria is demanding an unqualified Israeli
withdrawal citing UN resolution 242 which calls for the return of occupied
territories.
Mr Muwaffiq al-Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, said yesterday as
he went into the talks: 'We are here for a comprehensive and total peace,
not for a partial peace. The only way to reach a comprehensive peace is to
return all the territories occupied in 1967.'
Many of its members had been delayed by a dispute at the weekend with
Israeli border officials. The Lebanese and Jordanian delegations were also
at the State Department. Mr Soheil Shammas, the senior Lebanese delegate,
said he was keen to see what the new attitudes in Israel meant in practice.
'We are happy to be back where the action is", he added.

MR Hussein Husseini, the Pro-Syrian Speaker of the Lebanese parliament,
resigned yesterday, accusing his political opponents of vote-rigging, Reuter
reports.
Earlier, the Shia Moslem speaker urged the government to scrap Sunday's
polls in his east Lebanon district after the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of
God) took a commanding lead in Lebanon's first general election in 20 years.
Mr Husseini accused the group of rigging votes.
Interior Minister Sami al-Khatib dismissed a request that counting be
suspended in the Bekaa Valley's Baalbek district where Mr Husseini, a
traditional leader in the largely Shia area, headed a list of 10 pro-Syrian
candidates.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Build-up of allied air shield for Shias faces delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US DEFENCE officials yesterday said the US military was ready to enforce an
allied ban on Iraqi warplane flights over southern Iraq, but diplomats in
the Gulf said the allied plan was facing delays.
The unnamed defence officials, quoted by Reuter news agency, said the
aircraft carrier Independence, carrying fighter and reconnaissance aircraft,
sailed north from Abu Dhabi in the Gulf on Sunday. US Air Force fighters
were also in position in the region, they said.
The readiness of the US forces contrasted with indications that the
timetable for deploying British and French fighter aircraft had not been
finalised and that the siting of operational bases in the Gulf had not been
confirmed.
The reports from Washington indicated that President George Bush might delay
announcing that the US, Britain and France would enforce a no-fly zone to
protect Iraq's dissident Shia Moslems south of the 32nd parallel.
Initially, Mr Bush had planned today to present a united allied front to
shield the Shias by formally warning Iraq not to attack them from the air.
Gulf-based officials and diplomats, quoted by Reuters in Kuwait, said that
delays had arisen because of widespread Arab concern that the no-fly zone
could lead to the dismemberment of Iraq.
In London, the Foreign Office said consultations among the allies about the
operation's mechanics, such as the precise area of the exclusion zone, were
continuing, and emphasised that there had been 'just a few working days'
since last week's initial announcement.
Acknowledging reports of Middle East concern about the future of Iraq,
officials drew attention to strong US and British statements last week about
the allies' absolute belief in the integrity of Iraq.
Britain has committed six Tornado aircraft to protecting the Shias, but
there has been no announcement on when they will go or where they will be
based.
The French Defence Ministry said yesterday that no decision had been taken
as to where its Mirage 2000 jets would be stationed in the Gulf.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Seoul hails diplomatic links with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Roh Tae-woo of South Korea yesterday hailed the normalisation of
relations between his country and China, saying it had removed the last
external constraint on peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.
'The normalisation of ties between our two countries marks a significant
turning point in world history in that it heralds the beginning of the end
of the cold war in East Asia,' Roh said.
Establishment of diplomatic relations, long expected but formalised in a
signing ceremony in Beijing yesterday, is a considerable coup for both
countries and a setback for their respective rivals, Taiwan and North Korea.
It will further enhance China's influence in Asia at a time of changing
political relationships in the region and should boost already growing trade
and investment links. Although Beijing insisted yesterday that its relations
with North Korea would remain unchanged, the move will inevitably raise
pressure on Pyongyang to be more accommodating in dealings with Seoul.
North Korea has not commented on the news that its chief backer has
consummated a relationship with the south. But an early test of its reaction
could come later this week in scheduled talks between the two countries at
the border village of Panmunjom.
Luisetta Mudie writes from Taipei: Taiwan yesterday broke off diplomatic
relations with South Korea and is to take retaliatory measures following the
normalisation of relations with China.
Mr Frederick Chien, foreign minister, called the move 'extremely
unfriendly', and said Seoul had forgotten the tens of thousands of South
Koreans killed by Chinese troops in the Korean war.
Meanwhile, a handful of protesters gathered outside the South Korean embassy
in Taipei at the weekend, burning a Korean flag and hurling eggs and stones
at the buildings.
South Korea was the last Asian nation formally to recognise the Taipei
Nationalist Kuomintang government as legitimate rulers of China. All but a
handful of countries have now switched recognition to Beijing.
Preferential import tariffs and quotas on South Korean goods will be
abolished, and direct flights between the two suspended from September 15.
However, a delegation from Seoul due in Taiwan in early September is
expected to discuss a framework for unofficial ties to be set up.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Divisions emerge over worth of 'no-fly zone' in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and ROGER MATTHEWS

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED plans to declare a 'no-fly zone' over southern Iraq have encountered
unexpectedly deep misgivings from across the Arab world, including the
capitals of states which joined the US-led Gulf war alliance.
The issue is also again exposing divisions among the Arabs. The Gulf states,
notably Kuwait, maintain an any-methods approach in dealing with Baghdad,
whereas other countries, including Syria, Egypt and Algeria, fear the
fallout from another damaging confrontation between Iraq and the west.
Seen from Damascus and from Cairo, the allies are embarking on a new and
risky venture whose outcome is impossible to predict and whose consequences
could be very grave for the region at a time when it is being buffeted by
all sorts of cross-currents  - from Islamic fundamentalism to deepening
economic problems. Looming large is the spectre of Iran profiting from
Iraq's possible descent into chaos.
Among the Gulf allies, Syria has been the most outspoken in its opposition
to the proposed exclusion zone. In Damascus on Friday, Mr Farouk al-Shara,
the foreign minister, said his country 'believed that any step which might
threaten the unity of the Iraqi lands would be unacceptable and of grave
concern for us in Syria'.
Egypt, America's closest Arab ally, has been more circumspect, but it
broadly shares Syria's concerns; although its criticism of western plans has
been stated more obliquely. This task has been left to newspaper
commentators who invariably reflect the views of the presidency.
'Dismembering Iraq does not necessarily mean that Saddam Hussein will be
ousted,' wrote Mr Samir Ragab, the paper's editor-in-chief in Saturday's
English-language Egyptian Mail. 'It is possible that the unified country
will be divided into three parts, while Saddam retains power. What will be
the case then?'
Concern that the allies have not given due consideration to the consequences
of a further escalation causes alarm in Cairo and Damascus. Among questions
being asked is: What action will be taken by the west if Mr Saddam deploys
columns of tanks and artillery against Shia rebels in southern Iraq in a
ruthless campaign to eliminate the resistance? Would the allies feel
obliged, for example, to strafe and bomb Iraqi positions?
Gulf rulers, on the other hand, appear less squeamish than their Egyptian
and Syrian colleagues about possible fallout from renewed conflict.
In London on Friday, the Saudi Arabian-owned Al-Hayat commented that the
allies had now realised that 'bolder' steps were needed to get rid of Mr
Saddam. The paper called for the abandonment of the 'superstition that the
survival of the regime is essential to guarantee the unity of Iraq'.
In this case, Al Hayat reflected King Fahd's hawkish views, in contrast to
those of Prince Saud al-Faisal, his foreign minister, who is understood to
be warning of the dangers of a break-up of Iraq and further opportunities
that would then be created for Iran.
Tehran has not declared specifically its opposition to the 'no-fly zone'
proposal, but at the weekend its Supreme National Security Council stated
that 'the Islamic Republic insists that Iraq's terr-itorial integrity and
independence should not be violated under any circumstances'.
Ayatollah Mohammed Baquer al-Hakim, the Iran-based Iraqi Shia leader,
endorsed last week the creation of 'safe havens' in southern Iraq without
reference to plans by the allies to use warplanes to enforce an exclusion
zone.
Whatever Iran may be saying publicly about allied plans, however, it cannot
be too displeased about the ban on Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft and
helicopters, since it is deeply involved in supporting Shia rebels in
southern Iraqi with both weapons and ground support. Estimates of Iranian
revolutionary guards who have crossed into Iraq range up to 4,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA yesterday unveiled long-awaited measures to boost the ailing
stock market, but analysts predicted the multi-billion-dollar rescue plan
would give plummeting prices only a short-term fillip, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
Prices soared temporarily when Rhee Yong-man, the finance minister,
announced the plan to inject more than three trillion (million million) won
(Pounds 1.97bn) into the bourse.
But the stock market index settled only a few points above the morning
opening level and closed just 12.12 up at 483.73.
'The government has taken these measures because the market has been
languishing in the doldrums for a long time and investor sentiment has
shrunk hugely,' Rhee said.
The measures include attempts to lower money market rates and provision of
tax incentives to investors.
Banks and insurance companies will be required to buy stocks worth 1.5
trillion won and 700bn won respectively over the next six months. The
government will also encourage pension funds to buy stocks worth 1.2
trillion won over the next 12 months.
The Korea Securities Stabilisation Fund, set up in May 1990 to revitalise
the market, will also be encouraged to raise 500bn won for stock-buying.
Investors have been anticipating for several weeks a government bail-out of
the bourse, now at its lowest for nearly five years.
The bourse index, which peaked at 1,077.77 in April 1989, has dropped by
about one-third of its value since the beginning of the year.
'The market is unlikely to be boosted immediately. Investors are accustomed
to shock remedies rather than a medium- or long-term cure,' a Seoul
securities analyst said.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has announced measures designed to
cut government spending, encourage more private investment in industry and
speed government asset sales.
The measures, unveiled just before congress begins debating bills on
financial reform, new taxes, and the central government's 1993 budget, were
meant to show the administration is serious about curbing spending. It is
facing a fiscal deficit this year forecast at 5 per cent of GDP or higher,
which is helping to keep Venezuela's inflation unacceptably high. The
government is trying to cut inflation from its 1991 level of about 30 per
cent.
Proposals include a freeze on federal government hiring, and reorganisation
of the agriculture ministry aimed at cutting 29,000 jobs by next year. No
new public works will be started during his present term, ending in February
1994, Mr Perez said.
The national oil company PDVSA will be asked to cut operating and personnel
expenses in 1993 by Dollars 373m (Pounds 195m), and the armed forces told
not to buy new weapons systems. The state-owned petrochemical producer
Pequiven will no longer invest in new projects, and should carry out the
rest of its current Dollars 7.6bn investment programme with private investor
support.
Pequiven should 'open itself to private capital' and sell shares on
international stock markets, the president added. He urged a speed-up in
privatisation; Alcasa, a government aluminium producer, and two parts of the
state steelworks Sidor, would be privatised.

THE US Federal Bureau of Investigation has thwarted a HKDollars 200m (Pounds
13.4m) attempt to sell forged share certificates of Jardine Matheson
Holdings, one of Hong Kong's leading companies.
Jardine officials said they were informed late last week of an attempt to
pass nearly 3.8m of the company's shares. Both the Hong Kong and London
stock exchanges were informed.
The number of arrests in the US is unknown.
Mr Neil McNamara, Jardine's company secretary, said the Hong Kong police had
told him the FBI was confident all forged share certificates had been
recovered.
Mr McNamara pointed out, however, that the forged scrip  - 110,000
certificates in denominations of 30,000, 35,000 and 40,000 shares  - was
untradeable in the form sold to the FBI.
Jardine's shares are trade-able only in lots of 400 shares. Anyone trying to
sell the forgeries through the stock market would have had to present them
to the company's registrar for conversion. They would then have been
rejected, Mr McNamara said.

KABUL continued to be pounded by rockets yesterday as fighters loyal to
dissident mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar continued their assault on
the Afghan capital.
A grain silo was reported hit and set on fire in the attack, raising fears
that the city's food shortage could become worse.
Western diplomats were among hundreds of people trying to flee to safe areas
in the Afghan countryside. More than 100,000 people have left Kabul since
the dissidents began unleashing continual rocket attacks two weeks ago.
French and Italian diplomats and the Bulgarian ambassador, who was injured
by shrapnel when a rocket hit his embassy at the weekend, left for Termez on
the Uzbekistan border.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) handed overall
responsibility for its surgical hospital to the Afghan Health Ministry
yesterday, according to news agency reports. But Mr Armin Eric Kobel, the
local Red Cross chief, said the ICRC would keep 21 international staff in
Kabul.
All 17 hospitals in Kabul have been hit by the fighting and there is an
acute shortage of medicines. Only eight of Kabul's 17 hospitals are
functioning, according to United Nations officials.
The UN has moved all its international staff out of Kabul because of the
dangers.
The UN, meanwhile, is finalising a Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.1m) international
appeal for humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. But western diplomats
are concerned that donors may hold back from making commitments until the
situation has stabilised.
There was an unenthusiastic international response to an appeal in recent
months for Dollars 180m for rehabilitation and reconstruction of
Afghanistan. So far, only Dollars 42m has been pledged.
The UN secretary general's personal representative on Afghanistan, Mr
Sotirios Mousouris, said in an interview last night: 'It is very unfortunate
that when hope finally seemed to come to Afghanistan, this conflict makes
the efforts of the international community very difficult.'
The dissident mujahideen launched their assault to back their demands for
the withdrawal and disarming of a militia group that switched allegiance
from former President Najibullah to the mujahideen last April.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Saddam condemns 'profiteers' as sanctions bite hard

<TEXT>
A DEFIANT President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, under renewed pressure from the
west, has vowed to intensify a stringent campaign against those he describes
as profiteers, amid signs that United Nations economic sanctions are biting
deeper.
Mr Saddam pledged at an emergency cabinet session on Sunday that he would
continue his 'war on behalf of the poor', but recent visitors to Iraq report
that prices of scarce commodities have 'gone through the roof' and shortages
are becoming more widespread.
Further draconian measures to root out 'hoarders and monopolists' were
reported in the Iraqi press yesterday. They follow an emergency 'plan of
action' to cope with UN sanctions.
The 'war on behalf of the poor' campaign will now extend to employees of
Iraq's financial institutions who will be obliged to fill in special forms
'declaring their movable and immovable property'. Employees of Iraq's two
state banks will be required to disclose their bank balances and
possessions.
'The government should see to it that nobody accumulates a fortune without
the required national and moral right,' Mr Saddam told cabinet.
The execution last month of 42 traders accused of profiteering has brought
much private business activity to a halt, further adding to the shortages.
Belated action by Jordan to stop a steady trickle of trade into Iraq in
defiance of UN sanctions has also taken its toll.
Amman-based Iraqi merchants say that officials have been pressing them to
resume trading with assurances that they would come to no harm, but there
are few takers.
Members of Mr Saddam's immediate family are reported to have visited Amman
recently in an effort to regenerate cross-border trade.
Iraq's announcement last week that it was banning the import of 150 'luxury'
items ranging from tomatoes and bananas to whisky, beer, radios,
refrigerators and computers suggests that Baghdad is running very low on
cash.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Strongman at the economic helm: Marclio Marques Moreira is
seen as crucial for financial stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Marclio Marques Moreira is an unlikely strongman. Diffident in manner,
quietly spoken and polite, the finance minister's demeanour has less the
flavour of a dynamic technocrat, more that of a kindly schoolmaster. But, in
the view of many Brazilians, on his shoulders hang in large measure the slim
chances of short-term stability for Brazil's giant economy.
He took office in May 1991 at the age of 59, a stark contrast with his
predecessor, the fiery Ms Zelia Cardoso de Mello. She had introduced two
shock plans and a freeze of the nation's financial assets; Mr Moreira
promised nothing more than a steady work-out of Brazil's economic problems
and an absence of shock plans. She would lose her temper and use language
that would anger her foreign counterparts; his approach, deliberate and
diplomatic, gained him the nickname The Tamer of Turtles. She offered
confrontation; he conciliation.
A former banker and diplomat  - before his appointment he was ambassador to
Washington  - he arrived in office with no backing from Brazil's powerful
political factions. But he has since built a constituency, not least among
business. A survey of executives in Sao Paulo last week suggested 80 per
cent see his continuation in office as important. The news magazine Veja,
which often reflects the views of the influential Sao Paulo business
community, ran a front page picture of the minister in May beside the
headline 'Bad with him; worse without him'.
Mr Moreira and his economic team have also won the confidence of
international bankers. Without him, many bankers believe the debt
restructuring agreement the government is now negotiating would collapse. A
detailed agreement with leading bank creditors was said last week to be
perhaps two weeks away.
The support of the International Monetary Fund will be required if this
accord is to go ahead, and the IMF will have to be convinced that government
spending is under control. Mr Moreira is said to be strongly resisting
efforts by others in the government to increase spending on projects
designed to secure President Fernando Collor the congressional support he
needs to avoid impeachment.
With the country transfixed by the corruption allegations surrounding the
president, Mr Moreira has begun a damage-limitation exercise.
Hardly able to advance his economic reform, he is now attempting to protect
progress made to date in the hope that when the political crisis is resolved
he can once again move forward to stabilise the economy  - which means
stabilising government finances.
Progress in his central aim of bringing down the Brazilian inflation rate
has been almost non-existent. Inflation is still running at 22 per cent a
month, despite his good intentions, although the corruption scandal has
undoubtedly affected inflationary expectations.
A slump in tax revenues  - the scandal has given people an excuse not to pay
taxes to government officials  - has also meant the government missed the
targets under its IMF standby programme for the second quarter in a row.
On the positive side, Brazil's foreign exchange reserves have soared to
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn), giving the government ammunition against
speculators in the foreign exchange markets.
According to Mr Arminio Fraga, director of international affairs at the
central bank in Braslia, the government has also increased its forecasts of
this year's trade surplus, to Dollars 15bn or more against Dollars 10.6bn in
1991.
In Mr Moreira's shoes, many other ministers would have resigned by now. The
minister, who has in the past expressed shock at examples of Brazilians'
lack of morality, stays on, apparently out of a strong sense of duty. 'When
the seas are rough, people who act responsibly have to maintain their
composure,' he said last week.
He is probably now a more central figure in the government than the
president who appointed him. Even if Mr Collor survives, the president will
almost inevitably be fatally weakened. If the president goes, his
replacement  - Vice-President Itamar Franco  - has said he would like to see
Mr Moreira continuing in office.
It is not yet possible to divine what kind of government Mr Franco would
run. A politician of traditional nationalist mould, he is an unlikely
natural ally of Mr Moreira, and Mr Franco would have to build a political
coalition within Congress. Some of Mr Moreira's supporters fear that if he
were to take a job in the Franco government  - to which he would add
gravitas  - he might well be dumped once he had outlived his usefulness.
Those who know Mr Moreira say that if he faces having to abandon his
principles, in whatever government, he will quit. His continuation in office
is thus a sign economic discipline has not been completely abandoned during
the political crisis.
A resolution of the crisis is still possible within a month or two, one
senior administration official said yesterday. If this happens, it would
have set back the economic reform programme by six months  - unfortunate but
not disastrous. Mr Moreira's nightmare must be of a crisis that drags on for
years as Mr Collor struggles to retain his hold on office.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Senior lawyer to initiate impeachment: Inquiry says
president must have known of 'illicit acts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Brazilian lawyer said yesterday he would start impeachment
proceedings against President Fernando Collor after a congressional inquiry
linked the president to a corruption scheme organised by a close friend.
The investigative committee's draft report, read out by Senator Amir Lando
to a crowded Senate committee room in Braslia yesterday, said it had
uncovered an operation which Mr Collor must have known about and which
produced 'undue financial benefits' for him.
Even before the report's reading was concluded, Mr Marcelo Levenere,
president of the Brazilian Attorneys Association, said he would sign a
request to launch the impeachment process. 'Information that has already
been made public is sufficient for the process to be opened,' he said.
Any Brazilian citizen can launch the process, but Mr Collor's opponents were
expected to seek a leading figure from a respected civilian organisation.
Senator Lando said in the televised reading that the committee had evidence
of a multi-million-dollar corruption operation established by Mr Paulo Cesar
Farias, Mr Collor's election campaign treasurer, who is accused of graft,
influence peddling and tax evasion.
Witnesses' testimony, he said, 'allowed the conclusion that illicit acts
were committed by Farias of which the president must necessarily have
known.' It could not be hidden from the public that the president
permanently, and over the course of two years, 'received undue financial
benefits'.
The document also charged that the president failed in his constitutional
duty as head of state by not impeding the use of his name by third persons
'for practices not in line' with high moral standards.
The committee's document will be debated today and the vote for approval
will take place tomorrow.
The opposition, originally expected to request the beginning of impeachment
proceedings later this week, now says it will wait until at least next week.
Analysts believe the opposition wants time to make contact with Mr Collor.
Many opposition politicians have said they would rather have him resign than
initiate a 16-step impeachment process that could last months. The president
has repeated on several occasions that he will not quit.
Pro-government members of parliament are expected to challenge the report.
Mr Benito Gama, president of the inquiry commission, has said that
amendments to the document will not be allowed but Mr Odacir Soares, a
senator from the pro-government Liberal Front party (PFL), is expected to
offer an alternative report. Mr Soares said in a televised interview: 'The
political situation remains the same. The president has a solid base of
support.'
But there are cracks appearing in the PFL's support for Mr Collor. The party
was forced to replace Federal Deputy Jose Mucio, one of its representatives
on the inquiry commission who is in favour of impeachment. With the change
the opposition's advantage in the commission drops from 13-8 to 12-9.
Financial markets were paralysed yesterday, with the Sao Paulo stock
exchange registering minimal trading volume.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Investigators highlight operation to sell favours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMITTEE of legislators investigating allegations of government
corruption in Brazil yesterday reported the establishment of an organised
operation to sell favours and rake off commissions from state contracts.
The committee's report concluded that President Fernando Collor must have
known of the operation and had received 'undue financial benefits'.
The 200-page report was read by its author, Senator Amir Lando, to a packed
and nationally televised session in a Senate committee room.
Senator Lando said the committee had evidence of a multi-million-dollar
corruption operation established by Mr Collor's election campaign treasurer,
Mr Paulo Cesar Farias.
The senator outlined a corruption scheme which, he said, was set up by Mr
Farias in the Health Ministry, and detailed numerous other tax and legal
irregularities in the running of Mr Farias' two companies, EPC and Brasil
Jet.
'Signs point to a malevolent construction of an intentional operation,
aiming to open space, in the area of the administration and public business,
for agents from inside and outside public administration, to bring about
illicit and illegal benefits,' the senator said.
In outlining the activities of EPC, which was said to provide consultancy
services for several Brazilian companies, Senator Lando said: 'It cannot be
verified that any assistance or services were provided to the companies that
paid EPC.'
The sudden wealth of Mr Farias' companies, he noted, seemed to coincide with
Mr Collor's political success, first as governor of the state of Alagoas and
then as president.
Testimony 'allowed the conclusion that illicit acts were committed by Farias
which the president must necessarily have known,' Senator Lando said.
The draft report said that Mr Collor was remiss in not carrying out his
constitutional duty to ensure high moral standards and stop his name being
used by others for financial gain.
'It has become evident that the president of the republic, on a permanent
basis and for more than two years while in office, received undue financial
benefits,' the report said in its conclusions.
The legislators' report said: 'Those who knew the rules. . . became
'merchandise' for which businessmen and others were willing to pay
incredible and unjustified prices.'
Mr Farias, acting through 'phantom' depositors who used fake names and
numbers, deposited millions of dollars in a bank account linked to the
president, the report said.
Senator Mauricio Correa, head of a sub-committee set up to examine bank
accounts, detailed evidence linking Mr Collor to Mr Farias.
Senator Correa said documents showed that Mr Farias had used false bank
accounts to funnel millions of dollars to Mr Collor via third parties. Among
the cheques he listed were:
More than Dollars 11m (Pounds 5.7m) for building work and landscaping at Mr
Collor's private residence.
Payment of a bill for one of Mr Collor's private cars.
Payment of more than Dollars 2.3m to Mr Collor's private secretary, Ana
Maria Acioli Gomes, to pay the president's household expenses.
Other payments to Mr Collor's first wife, mother, spokesman, secretary,
butler and other staff members.
Referring to payments emanating directly or indir-ectly from Mr Farias, the
committee's report said: 'Such events constitute common crimes, in relation
to which the initiative for follow-up is the prerogative of the federal
prosecutor.'

FT  25 AUG 92 / Swedish short-term money market rates up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S money markets yesterday reacted to a growing lack of confidence in
the government's economic strategy with a rise in short-term money market
rates. The equity market also responded negatively, with the general share
index dropping by 4 per cent.
Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, said there was no reason for the
government to resort to crisis measures to restore confidence. But the main
opposition Social Democrats called on Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's Conservative
prime minister, to break the country's political deadlock and start talks
with them on a broad-based economic programme to reduce interest rates and
the burgeoning budget deficit.
Forecasts suggest the budget deficit could rise as high as SKr140bn (Pounds
13.7bn) this year because of rising unemployment, a crisis in the banking
and insurance sector and falling tax revenues due to stagnant domestic
demand.
'The problem is political. There is declining confidence in the market that
the government will be able to get its policies through,' said Mr Nils
Lundgren, chief economist at Nordbanken.
A weekend summit conference of Sweden's four-party, non-Socialist coalition
government appears to have done nothing to lift the pessimism. But Sweden's
main trade union organisation, the LO, has accepted Mr Bildt's invitation to
discuss next year's wage round on 15 September, in a move designed to calm
the markets.
Some observers, however, believe the government will have to take early
action to head off a full-blown economic crisis and a massive outflow of
capital.
Yesterday the central bank reported a capital outflow of SKr9.976bn last
week, the largest weekly amount since last autumn. The bank can be expected
to maintain a tough monetary policy to stem the outflow.
Further cuts in government spending might be announced soon but the markets
are not convinced that ministers will stick to their strategy. 'Confidence
is something you have to earn and not just proclaim,' said Mr Sten
Westerberg, one of Sweden's leading investment bankers, yesterday.
In the current financial year the government agreed to make SKr14bn worth of
cuts but has not yet succeeded in carrying through all of them. It had been
hoped to save as much as SKr4.5bn by denying Swedes benefit for their first
two days' sickness absence from work but ministers are uncertain whether
this can gain the majority support in parliament.
The government relies on the maverick and populist right-wing New Democrats
to get its programme through but that party's leaders remain hostile to what
it is being proposed.
'What worries me is that the pressures on the government are all to spend
more money, not cut their programmes,' said Mr Ulf Jacobson, chief economist
at Sweden's industrial federation.
The country's labour market board says it wants a further SKr8.8bn from the
government, mainly to provide places on work preparation programmes and
training for young people.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Balkan sights set on Serbia's Kosovo province: It may be a
key to peace or a new focus of bloodshed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS United Nations and European Community diplomats try to work out a
long-term solution to the war in the former Yugoslavia, many diplomats fear
that in the short term Serbia's southern province of Kosovo could be the
next focus of bloodshed. But despite these fears, Kosovo could hold the key
to peace in the Balkans.
Any chance for peace rests on working out out a compromise between Kosovo's
2m Albanians, who demand independence from Serbia, and Serbs who insist on
retaining the present status of the province  - which has no autonomy, no
ethnic rights and no working parliamentary democracy.
Without such a compromise between Kosovo and Belgrade, the Serbian capital,
ethnic Albanians have few illusions about the region's fate. 'If Kosovo
erupts it could mean war throughout the region,' says Mr Veton Surroi, an
Albanian leader whose views are shared by Albanians and Serbs in the
province.
In an attempt to step up international pressure on Serbia to open the way
for dialogue with Kosovo, Lord Carrington, chairman of the European
Community-sponsored peace Conference on Yugoslavia, last month made a trip
to Belgrade to act as a mediator between Kosovo and Serbia, led by President
Slobodan Milosevic.
Mr Milosevic, intransigent as ever, dismissed Lord Carrington's mediating
attempts as 'interference in Serbia's internal affairs'.
However, Kosovo has managed to remain outside the war which engulfed Croatia
and Bosnia-Hercegovina. This week's London peace conference could determine
whether it continues to do so.
Mr Surroi believes the ethnic Albanians should be included in talks about
their future status, and not be confined to the sidelines of the conference
 - their current status. But Mr Vukasin Jovanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician
who is also deputy speaker of the Serbian parliament in Belgrade, says any
invitation to the ethnic Albanians to attend the talks amounts to
encouraging 'the hopes of Albanians to secede from Serbia'.
Essentially, the view among Serb leaders in Belgrade is that they will
continue to rule out any discussion on the status of Kosovo as long as
Albanians call for independence from Serbia.
Moreover, any signs of compromise on the part of Belgrade with Kosovo could
in fact undermine the policies of Mr Milosevic.
After all, it was Kosovo which Mr Milosevic exploited in his bid for power
in the late 1980s. Under the pretext of protecting the small ethnic Serb and
Montenegrin minorities in the province against alleged discrimination from
the ethnic Albanians, he vowed to bring Kosovo back to the Serbian fold.
The late President Josip Broz Tito had carved out of Serbia the southern
province of Kosovo and the northern province of Vojvodina, as a means of
containing the influence of Serbia throughout the Yugoslav federation. Both
provinces were granted a wide degree of autonomy from Belgrade. In
particular, Kosovo is viewed as the cradle of Serbian culture.
Mr Milosevic, who sought to redress this perceived historical grievance,
moved to curb the autonomy of Kosovo.
By 1989, Serbia crushed mass demonstrations in Kosovo, stripped Kosovo of
its autonomy, and imposed direct rule from Belgrade. Tens of thousands of
Albanian professionals were sacked and replaced by Serbs.
In response to the imposition of a virtual police state throughout this poor
province, the ethnic Albanians built their own 'shadow' state. Albanians now
have their own government, denounced as illegal by Belgrade, their own
schools, and their own hospitals.
The question facing their leaders is how long they can pursue the creation
of their own, unrecognised state before public opinion among the Albanians
becomes impatient with, or radicalised by, Serb rule and repression.
Certainly, the appalling destruction and bloodshed in Bosnia has helped
consolidate the policy of non-violence propounded by Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the
Kosovo president elected in last May's unofficial elections. Moreover,
Albanians say, in the event of a conflict with Serbia, there would be a
bloodbath in Kosovo.
'Albanians are not preparing for war. They have seen what happened in
Bosnia,' says a western diplomat.
Serb politicians claim Albanian households are concealing arms. But Mr
Jovanovic says: 'Albanians do not have arms for a serious war.'
Serbia is reported to have armed Kosovo's Serbs, who vow to keep control of
the province at all costs.
'Many Serbs want a 'final solution'. Serbs want a war to solve the problem
of not being able to live together (with the ethnic Albanians),' admits a
Serb official in the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
Yet despite the militancy of Kosovo's Serbs, any decision to change Kosovo's
status would be made not by them but by Belgrade.
Whether they would accept any compromise dictated from Belgrade is doubtful.
Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister of unrecognised Yugoslavia, has promised
to lift the 'special measures' which legalised Kosovo as a police state,
although Serb politicians deny such measures were ever applied. But
compromise appears incompatible with the climate of intense polarisation and
ethnic hatred between the two communities.

<TEXT>
A FORMER financial controller of Belgian state bank Credit Communal has
confessed to stealing BFr700m (Pounds 12m) in frauds stretching over more
than 35 years, the Brussels crown prosecutor's office said yesterday,
Reuters reports from Brussels.
Prosecution officials said yesterday that Mr Jacques Labar, 69, was being
held on fraud charges. He had given himself up on Friday, pleading remorse
and inability to pay back loans he had coaxed out of customers with the
promise of high interest rates.
Credit Communal said it had learned Mr Labar had carried out the frauds by
wrongful use of the bank's name and documents and by falsifying the
signature of a bank officer. The money had been spent on housing, cars and
holidays.
Mr Labar retired in 1989 as inspector-general, in effect the bank's top
auditor in charge of fraud prevention, but he stayed on in an advisory
capacity.

FRANCE would prefer to raise interest rates, as it has in the past, to
protect the franc rather than support any realignment of the ERM, according
to economists in Paris, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
'I don't think France would have anything to gain from realignment, but it
could lose a lot of political credibility if it was forced to abandon its
'franc-fort' stance,' said Mr Robin Hubbard, chief economist at Paribas. 'So
far there isn't enough pressure from the dollar to make realignment a
serious possibility. But if the French do vote 'no' in the Maastricht
referendum next month, then France and Germany may have to choose between
realignment and raising interest rates. If necessary the French probably
would go for higher rates.'

FT  25 AUG 92 / Poll shows Russians want free sale of land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT Russians most want in terms of privatisation is the only sort which is
not yet allowed: the free sale of land.
In an unprecedented opinion poll on Russian economic reform, 67.81 per cent
of respondents said the best result so far has been an elimination of
shortages in shops. In second place, 19.06 per cent welcomed an increase in
the number of retailing outlets as a result of the legalisation of street
sellers and kiosks.
But the nation's top complaint, cited by 31.5 per cent of 4,000 respondents
around the country, was the shortage of banknotes, which has meant big
delays with pay packets. Second came the near-elimination of the value of
savings as prices rise sharply while interest on savings accounts rises
slowly. Another 18.5 per cent cited an increase in crime and corruption.
Completed just as the government announced a scheme to give away industrial
assets through a mass voucher scheme, the poll showed that 53.6 per cent
believed the free sale of land should form the basis of privatisation.
The government, which sees private land ownership as essential, has
threatened to hold a referendum to challenge parliament's insistence that
land cannot be resold for 10 years. The poll was conducted by the Centre for
International Sociological and Market Research in Moscow.
Just over half the population believed assets should be given away. Only
6.89 per cent of the population supported the government's preferred method
of auctioning them. President Boris Yeltsin has issued a decree reversing an
attempt by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, to take over
the Izvestia newspaper.
Izvestia yesterday published an order by the Russian leader telling the
Committee for State Property to strengthen the hold of Izvestia's publishing
house over its property.
Mr Khasbulatov, irritated by criticism from the paper, decreed this summer
that it should be handed over to the Russian parliament, a move widely
attacked as an attempt to curtail press freedom.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Bonn defends Bundesbank over Dollars: German interest rates
'only one factor' in collapse of US currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government yesterday closed ranks with the Bundesbank and
rejected charges that high interest rates set in Frankfurt lay behind the
collapse of the dollar.
The independent central bank's interest rate policy might have been a
factor, but US rates had been 'uncoupled' with the aim of helping American
exports, the finance ministry said yesterday. 'You cannot make the
Bundesbank solely responsible for what has happened.'
Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the group of five leading independent economic
advisers to the government, said that central banks' intervention in the
market was helpful only as a means of hampering 'overdone speculation'. It
could have no effect on the basic situation while the gap between US and
German interest rates remained so wide.
The ministry accepted that the dollar's slump might hit exports, but not all
the effects were negative, it said. The D-Mark's relative strength would
reduce the costs of oil and other industrial imports, helping dampen
domestic price rises, the ministry added.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank remained tight-lipped. Other than confirming that
it had intervened to help stabilise markets, and repeating earlier
declarations that it had 'no interest' in a weak dollar, it refused comment.
However, it has made clear in recent weeks that while it is uncomfortable
with chaotic conditions in foreign exchange markets, it has no short-term
plans to change its policy. A strong D-Mark supports the bank's aim of
controlling inflation and attracts funds to help with reconstruction in the
east.
Even though German ministers expect to come under pressure to use their
influence with the Bundesbank, notably at the planned G7 meeting in
Washington in mid-September, the finance ministry stuck to its established
position.
Rebutting reports that relations between Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister,
and the central bank were under strain, a spokesman said 'this ministry has
always supported the Bundesbank's independence'.
Meanwhile, the BDI federation of German industry, warned of possible damage
to the country's main export industries, notably vehicle manufacture, plant
and engineering and aerospace.
The federation said companies would have to make special price arrangements
with potential customers if they did not want to lose market share.
However, the German pharmaceutical industry yesterday reported a 6.7 per
cent rise in turnover to DM13.9bn in the first half of this year, mostly
thanks to exports.
Forecasting 'moderate growth' for the year as a whole, BPI, the federal
drugs makers' association, said exports had increased by 13.5 per cent to
DM5.5bn. Sales for the whole of last year were DM31bn.
Early indications of steadying west German inflation emerged yesterday in
figures from North Rhine Westphalia, which reported prices up 0.1 per cent
on the month to mid-August.
The year-on-year rate of inflation in the most populous state stood at 3.4
per cent.

FT  25 AUG 92 / TV looms larger for British execs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE daily grind is given new meaning for the managerial classes of west
Europe, following publication today of research into the impact of various
forms of media on executives in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands
and Britain.
While British executives on average appear to watch more television than
their European counterparts  - 31 per cent viewing two hours or more,
against the five-country average of 22 per cent  - they also work a shorter
average day: nine hours and 24 minutes, against a 10-hour average. The
French work longest: 10 hours and 36 minutes.
The fact that the British work shorter hours may have something to do with
the much longer time it takes them to get to the office. Those British
managers using two types of transport to reach the office generally spend an
average 106.7 minutes on the journey, according to the survey. The European
average is 53.7 minutes, and it takes the Germans only 48 minutes.
With all that time on his hands travelling to work, it might be supposed
that the average UK executive would get stuck into his newspaper. Well, up
to a point. . . . Only 30 of those 106.7 minutes spent daily on two methods
of transport are employed scanning the columns. This is the lowest figure in
any of the five countries, and compares with an average 36 minutes and a
creditable 43 notched up by the Dutch.
No prizes either for the TV-obsessed Brits in the magazine reading
department  - only eight minutes a day, against a German performance of 30.
MJP Carat International, which conducted the survey, also asked executives
which regular newspaper or magazine they would miss most if it ceased
publication. National Geographic topped the poll, with the Financial Times a
close second. The US magazine Fortune was bottom of the list.
Executives' most notorious pastime  - lunch  - is obviously coming under
pressure.
British managers were found to be the most likely to eat lunch at their
desks; the Dutch most favour in-house canteens. A third of Germans claimed
to take no lunch break at all.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Italy's TV channels refuse to switch off

A NEW drama began on Italy's television screens yesterday as hundreds of
broadcasters, outlawed earlier this month, vowed to continue transmitting in
spite of a deadline to close at midnight last Sunday.
The sword has been hanging over many of Italy's commercial broadcasters
since a 1990 law aimed at tidying up the country's crowded airwaves obliged
the government to allocate frequencies by last Sunday. Formalising the
chaotic broadcasting rules had often been promised, but never delivered as
ministers shied away from tackling such a highly-charged political issue.
In the 12 years since private stations started transmitting, the country has
developed a patchwork of broadcasters ranging from slick national channels
to tiny low-powered local stations, some of which are believed to be fronts
for organised crime.
The list of concessions agreed this month by the new government of Mr
Giuliano Amato gave the green light to the three private channels controlled
by Fininvest, the holding company of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Other big private
broadcasters allowed to continue were Rete A, Telemontecarlo and, subject to
certain conditions, the three Tele + pay TV channels, established by Mr
Berlusconi, in which he is now only a minority shareholder.
However, almost 800 local applicants were excluded. In the Lombardy region
alone, Italy's richest, only 47 of the 181 stations which sought
authorisation were approved.
Hundreds of stations have vowed to carry on regardless, ahead of what is
likely to be a heated parliamentary debate. The local broadcasters have
dismissed the list as arbitrary and unfair. Meanwhile, members of the
Democratic party of the Left (PDS), the former communists, claim the
concessions have given too much power to Mr Berlusconi.
Dozens of local stations have already banded together into a new committee
and their campaign is set to gather momentum when others join as expected at
a meeting in Bologna later this week.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Russia seeks debt deal with G7: Moscow to put case for
rescheduling at meeting in Paris this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RUSSIA IS to present its case for a rapid rescheduling of the former Soviet
Union's foreign debt at a meeting of Group of Seven deputy finance ministers
in Paris at the end of this week.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the vice prime minister responsible for foreign
economic relations, told a meeting of regional governors yesterday: 'Russia
will not make it to the end of the year without a postponement of payments.
. . . The volume of payments which Russia owes exceeds its hard currency
revenues by two to three times.'
Without giving details, he said Russia was already Dollars 4bn short on
payments owed, and for this reason, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime
minister, had suspended repayments on commercial debts through
Vneshekonombank, which manages the total foreign debt of around Dollars
70bn. 'Our top priority is payments on grain credits,' he said, which
explained a 'fire brigade' like approach in finding cash to pay arrears owed
to Canada so that it would resume grain deliveries.
Mr Shokhin's remarks came as an International Monetary Fund delegation began
a round of talks in Moscow with Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank
chairman, and government ministers about Russia's difficulties in meeting
the terms of its first ever agreement with the Fund.
That agreement, which unlocked a first-tranche IMF credit of Dollars 1bn,
was a minimal condition for Russia to hope for a full-scale foreign debt
rescheduling from its western creditors. So far this year, official and
commercial creditors have been rolling over payments of principal on
medium-term debts incurred before January 1 1991 on a 90-day basis. The
current deferral expires at the end of September.
But what was mooted by the G7 leaders at the Munich summit last July was a
rescheduling over 10 years of both principal and interest payments falling
due this year, with a grace period of 3-5 years during which nothing would
have to be paid.
Such a rescheduling was to be conditional on continued progress in following
the IMF agreement, and the final negotiation of a deal with the wider Paris
Club of official creditors, to be followed by an obligation for commercial
banks to offer similar terms.
But Paris Club negotiations, which have already been postponed until
September, have looked increasingly shaky as Russia has fallen behind with
payments excluded from the deferral, and with Mr Gerashchenko saying last
week he wanted to renegotiate the IMF deal.
The commercial banks are also at loggerheads with their governments over
whether such a rescheduling should be concluded, because they argue that
they have much more to lose than governments.
A row over the IMF agreement within Russia is intimately linked to debates
over how to settle Rbs3 trillion in arrears between state-owned enterprises.
Which solution Russia chooses will have a direct impact on its ability to
meet the targets set by the Fund for a budget deficit equalling 5 per cent
of gross domestic product and inflation of 9 per cent a month. Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, previously responsible for Russia's negotiations with
international financial institutions, has been appointed Russia's executive
director at the IMF in Washington. Mr Leonid Grigoriev, chairman of the
Committee for Foreign Investment, is being tipped as Russia's director at
the World Bank, once it manages to pay up its share of World Bank capital.

FT  25 AUG 92 / World share prices slide as dollar support fails: FT-SE 100
falls 54 points; D-Mark's strength adds to strain on pound and lira
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD STOCK and bond markets fell sharply yesterday after repeated
intervention by central banks failed for the second trading day in a row to
stop the decline of the dollar.
Investors sold financial assets on fears that the continuing fall of the US
currency against the D-Mark could trigger a rise in interest rates on both
sides of the Atlantic.
The continued strength of the German currency also put pressure on the pound
and the Italian lira as they hovered close to their floors against the
D-Mark in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. That
threatened a rise in interest rates in both the UK and Italy.
The intervention to buy dollars for D-Marks by 15 central banks, including
the Federal Reserve, Bundesbank and the Bank of England, failed to arrest
the dollar's decline.
In London, it closed at a record low of DM1.4035, down more than 3 pfennigs
on the day and 7 pfennigs in the past week. In US trading, it slipped
further to DM1.3988, but recovered slightly to DM1.4015 at the close. In
Tokyo today it opened at DM1.40345.
The pound gained nearly 5 cents against the dollar in London, closing at
Dollars 1.9945. At one point in intra-day trading, sterling was over Dollars
2.00 for the first time since February 1991. In New York it finished at
Dollars 1.994.
On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 index lost 54.6 to 2,311.1, its
biggest one-day fall since the failed Soviet coup against president Mikhail
Gorbachev a year ago.
Bourses in Frankfurt and Paris lost 1.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent
respectively, while on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
down 25.93 at 3,228.17. This followed a 50-point decline on Friday.
Bond prices in Europe and the US also fell sharply. The US benchmark 30-year
bond fell more than a point on fears that the lower dollar would deter
foreign investors from buying US government securities.
In yesterday's intervention, the fifth such operation in the past month, the
central banks bought dollars in five separate waves in European and North
American trading. The action took place as the US currency fell through the
DM1.43 level in Europe.
The volume of intervention appeared about the same as it had been last
Friday, in which case about Dollars 1bn would have been spent. This modest
level suggested that the Fed wanted to smooth the path of the currency's
fall rather than halt it outright.
The strength of the D-Mark raised new tensions inside Europe's ERM. The
pound dipped to a new low of DM2.7950 in London, before closing  1/4 of a
pfennig firmer on the day at DM2.8000, despite worse-than-expected UK trade
figures for July. At the close, the pound was less than 3 pfennigs above its
ERM floor against the D-Mark. In New York it was quoted at DM2.796 at the
close.
The lira was at L764.00 against the D-Mark in late New York trading, almost
touching its ERM floor of L765.00. The lira closed in London at L762.1.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Pressure builds to raise UK interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faced renewed pressure yesterday to raise interest rates as
sterling remained under strain in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Intervention by the Bank of England and other central banks to buy dollars
for D-Marks helped to lift the pound slightly against the German currency,
but financial markets signalled the high possibility of a politically
unpopular rise in UK base rates.
The three-month interbank rate, at which UK banks lend among themselves,
rose yesterday by  1/4 percentage point to about 10 3/4 per cent. This
indicated a likely rise by the autumn of nearly 1 percentage point in base
rates, now 10 per cent.
However, yesterday's braking of sterling's recent falls gave the Treasury
and the Bank valuable breathing space in their fight to stave off a rise in
borrowing rates, which would almost certainly prolong the recession.
The UK currency closed in London last night above its day's lows but still
perilously close to its ERM floor of DM2.778, indicating continued weakness.
An increase in Britain's current account deficit from Pounds 747m in June to
Pounds 934m last month did little to help sentiment.
A Downing Street official insisted that the government's position remained
unchanged. 'We will do whatever is deemed necessary to ensure that sterling
remains within its exchange rate mechanism bands,' he said.
Government spokesmen attributed the turbulence to the weakness in the dollar
and continuing concern over a possible 'no' vote in the September 20 French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty. One official said a firm 'yes' could
help to stabilise sterling. But he added: 'If it went no, then the countries
that are vulnerable could have problems.'
A senior minister conceded there was little alternative to 'toughing-out'
the uneasy market sentiments. 'We are engaged in one of those wait-and-see
situations and the government is determined to see it out.'
The Bank yesterday refrained from any public action to buy pounds for
D-Marks on the cur - rency markets, an action which might help push up
sterling's value and further stave off the possibility of a base-rate rise.
Sterling's weakness triggered a fresh attack on government policies by Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. He said the deteriorating trade outlook
and growing imports signalled 'a fundamental weakness' in the economy that
had to be addressed by a stimulus to investment and employment.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, returned to London last night from his
Italian holiday. His absence has sparked disquiet on the Conservative
backbenches. Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, repeated his call for the
chancellor either to restore confidence or to be replaced.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Import strength pushes trade deficit to Pounds 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's trade gap widened in July as the recession failed to stem the
growth in imports. Rising imports outstripped flat exports, causing the
visible trade deficit to grow by almost Pounds 200m from Pounds 947m in June
to Pounds 1.1bn last month.
The current account deficit, which includes a projected Pounds 200m surplus
on 'invisible' goods, such as banking, and transfer payments, grew from
Pounds 747m to Pounds 934m.
In the three months to the end of July the visible trade deficit narrowed
slightly to Pounds 2.9bn compared with Pounds 3.3bn in the previous three
months.
However, this mainly reflected a bigger surplus on erratic items such as
ships, North Sea installations and precious stones, which rose to Pounds
538m from Pounds 6m in the same period. The underlying deficit, which
excludes oil and erratics, was almost unchanged at Pounds 3.7bn in the three
months to the end of July.
Although consumer confidence remains weak and retail sales have been flat
since the general election in April, import growth means the UK has been
unable to close its trade deficit with the rest of the world.
In the three months to the end of July, the value of imports grew by 5 per
cent compared with the same period a year ago, against exports which were
only 1.5 per cent higher.
A breakdown of the UK's overseas trade suggests that slower economic growth
in other European Community countries is the main hindrance to higher export
sales. The value of exports to the EC fell by 0.5 per cent in the three
months to July compared with the previous three months.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said the rise in
imports was further evidence that the government's economic policies were
failing British industry. 'Only halfway through 1992 Britain has clocked up
a deficit larger than the whole of last year,' he said.
The Treasury said exports continued to perform well in July and that the
rise in imports, consistent with economic recovery, was not unexpected.
Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC, said: 'The government's
economic policy is in tatters. A monthly deficit of over Pounds 900m when
the economy is in the greatest slump since the 1930s is scandalous.'

FT  25 AUG 92 / US insurers face heaviest hurricane damage claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on
storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across
southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage.
The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to
hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government
spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying
eastern islands.
Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said
total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were
taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds
2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US
hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989.
The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers,
industry analysts said yesterday.
Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine
Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the
Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance
of reinsurance risk  - known as the retrocession market  - has shrunk
considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their
risks through Lloyd's.
Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated
that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so
far.
'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he
added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.
Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.
Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face
losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m
and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each.
However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the
Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards
New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood
damage.
Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama
port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or
early Thursday.
It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production
facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900
workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution.
A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the
Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing
emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations.
Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast
of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off
houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees
before heading out over the Gulf.
A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as
the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and
Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were
without power.
Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables,
just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its
radar and satellite antennae were blown away.
President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas
and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

FT  25 AUG 92 / W Saharan referendum plan fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UNITED NATIONS, New York
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS attempts to promote a referendum on the future of the former
Spanish territory of Western Sahara have again failed and the settlement
plan, in which this is a key element, may have to be revised or abandoned.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, told the Security
Council in a written report yesterday that without tangible results in
further talks in the next few weeks he must conclude that the disputing
parties were unwilling to co-operate in implementation.
These parties are Morocco, which claims sovereignty, and the Polisario
nationalist movement, seeking an independent Western Sahara.
Under the UN plan a referendum was to have been held last January, four
months after a ceasefire went into effect. But the parties have been
unwilling to agree on who should be eligible to vote.
UN troops are on duty in Western Sahara for peacekeeping during the process,
but in smaller strength than was envisaged - because of the difficulties
that have arisen.
Mr Sahabzada Yakub-Khan, the former Pakistani foreign minister who is the
new UN mediator, was due to begin a further round of talks yesterday with
the two sides.
In a minor breakthrough, he has obtained their agreement, as a
confidence-building measure, to focus on safeguarding the rights, political
and otherwise, of whichever side is defeated in a referendum.

<TEXT>
REBEL groups in Surinam are surrendering weapons to representatives of the
Organisation of American States following a peace agreement with the
government, writes Canute James.
The deal ended eight years of civil unrest in the republic, which forced
thousands of Surinamese to seek refuge in French Guyana. Mr Ronny Brunswijk,
leader of Jungle Commando, the main rebel group, said democracy and civil
rights for the country's bush negroes had either been achieved or promised.
The truce promises economic relief for the former Dutch colony of 400,000
people. At the height of the fighting, three years ago, rebel groups
targeted bauxite mines and refineries and electricity generating stations,
setting back the already weak economy.
The government has agreed to establish special economic zones to benefit
communities which supported the rebels.

RESULTS DUE
BRITISH GAS announces its second quarter results tomorrow, the first since
it called for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the UK gas
market.
The share price has slipped slightly on the resulting uncertainty and is
unlikely to be boosted by Tuesday's figures. Expectations range widely, from
a historic cost net loss of Pounds 75m to a Pounds 150m profit, reflecting
forecasting difficulties in the first year of quarterly reporting by British
Gas and a changed year-end from March to December.
Interest centres on the dividend, with the market looking for a signal that
the payout will not be affected by the MMC referral and recent regulatory
changes. Estimates range from 6.4p to 7.7p for the first half, with most
around 6.5p.
WH Smith is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the year to
May 31 of Pounds 110m-Pounds 114m. This will be a healthy increase on the
previous year's Pounds 89m, helped by last summer's rights issue and the
disposal of its loss-making TV division. The retailer is likely to raise its
full-year dividend to 13p or 14p from 12.5p.
Newspaper wholesaling, the subject of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
study launched this past week, has continued to perform strongly. US
operations have been good and UK retailing reasonably resilient. But
Do-It-All, the DIY chain owned jointly with Boots, is likely to have made a
much lower contribution.
Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the UK's five leading composite
(general and life) insurers, is expected to report a cut in pre-tax losses
on Wednesday, underlining the sector's recent improvement. Pre-tax losses
are expected to fall to between Pounds 45m and Pounds 60m compared with an
Pounds 88m deficit at the interim stage last year.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Emperor has no plan: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republican convention was like a performance of Hamlet without the
Prince. The delegates, living in a fantasy land of their own, simply refused
to acknowledge the brooding presence of an enfeebled economy. Outside the
Astrodome everybody was complaining about the lack of growth and jobs.
Inside, the economy was barely mentioned; the talk was of glorious foreign
policy triumphs, the threat from 'deviant' lifestyles and the evils of
abortion.
In an outpouring of vitriol, Governor Bill Clinton was caricatured as a
skirt-chasing, pot-smoking, draft-dodging proponent of gay and lesbian
rights. President George Bush plunged in the final dagger claiming (falsely)
that Mr Clinton was anti-enterprise, would raise taxes on anybody with a
job, and favoured huge increases in federal bureaucracy. Some overnight
polls showed a surge in Mr Bush's support, although whether such crude
Clinton-bashing will provide lasting benefits is uncertain.
As Houston fades from memory, the economy must reappear as the crucial
issue: there is still no sign of the vigorous recovery the White House first
predicted 18 months ago. And it was ironic that as Mr Bush put final touches
on a speech celebrating US strength, the dollar - which nobody in political
circles ever ever mentions - was plunging toward a new post-second world war
low against the D-mark. Even if Mr Bush escapes a full-blown dollar crisis,
he may pay dearly for the off-hand vacuity of his economic proposals. Voters
will surely not be impressed by his offer of a tax cut balanced by new
spending curbs, when not even a dime of those savings was specified.
And the touted 'big idea' - that taxpayers should be able to earmark up to
10 per cent of their taxes for debt reduction - hardly survives scrutiny.
The intention is that spending would be cut each time a taxpayer ticked the
debt reduction box. If the plan were feasible it would be unpleasant; in
effect rich individuals would be able to veto programmes for the poor. But
since a Democratic Congress would never approve so arbitrary a form of
spending control, Mr Bush's plan would be no more than an irrelevant
accounting gesture, with money moving harmlessly from one pocket to another.
So where do the candidates stand on economic policy after the two party
conventions?
Mr Clinton has been attacked for claiming he would 'halve the deficit' while
substantially raising spending on infrastructure and education. This may
sound as implausible as former president Ronald Reagan's promise to balance
the budget while cutting taxes.
The point is this. The Clinton team is not proposing policy changes that
will halve the deficit (how could they when their tax and spending proposals
roughly balance?). All they are saying is that their policies will not
prevent the decline in the deficit projected by nearly all forecasters as
the economy moves out of recession and as distortions (such as the savings
and loan bailout) fade.
I suspect Mr Clinton will prove more fiscally conservative than Mr Bush.
However, it would be suicidal to be more explicit in a campaign. It was
probably a mistake even to promise higher taxes on the top 2 per cent.
In judging the Bush and Clinton plans it is far more important to understand
the very real philosophical differences. In his offhand way, Mr Bush is
advocating a continuation of Mr Reagan's supply-side doctrines. Cuts in
income and (especially) capital taxes are seen as way of stimulating growth
by encouraging affluent Americans to save and invest. The problem is that
huge cuts in tax rates in the 1980s did not raise savings, investment or
productivity growth.
Mr Clinton is also offering a supply-side strategy, fathered by Mr Robert
Reich of Harvard University. It works rather differently. The premise is
that in a world of mobile physical and financial capital, government can
best promote higher living standards by focusing on factors of production
that are relatively fixed.
The two factors that cannot move at all easily are people and
infrastructure. By advocating higher investment in education and training,
the Clinton team hopes directly to increase the productivity of American
workers, thus raising the wages they can earn in competitive markets. By
investing in public infrastructure, the team hopes directly to increase the
return that private entrepreneurs (of whatever nationality) can earn by
locating plant and equipment in the US.
The Clinton plan is a step in uncharted waters. But plenty of academic
research suggests it could work. The economic return to extra years of
education has steadily risen, suggesting that that this is the most potent
investment now available. The link between the profitability of private
business and the quality of public infrastructure (be it canals, roads or
fibre optics) is long established.
Mr Clinton's modest proposals for channelling an extra Dollars 200bn into
education, training and infrastructure over four years will not transform
American productivity. But it is a reasoned response to the challenge posed
by global economic competition that should appeal to the millions of
middle-income Americans who have seen their wages stagnate for a decade. It
is certainly more innovative than anything Mr Bush has proposed.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Justinian: The perils of private life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the welter of public discussion over the stealthily photographed
indiscretions of the Duchess of York spattered across the pages of the
tabloid newspapers last week, little attention has been paid to the
inactivity of the law.
That is because in this country there is no legally enforceable right to
privacy. This was demonstrated all too clearly by the dismissal by Mr
Justice Latham of the 11th-hour application by Mr John Bryan, the Duchess's
adviser and companion, for an injunction against the Daily Mirror, which
proceeded to publish the photos.
But supposing there were to be a new tort (a civil wrong) for the invasion
of an individual's private life. Would it, as it is widely claimed, inhibit
investigative journalism and prevent publication of matters which are
newsworthy or of legitimate concern to the public?
It is important at the outset to distinguish between the methods used by
journalists to acquire information and take photographs, and the decisions
of editors to publish. The Calcutt Committee on Privacy and Related Matters
in 1990 accepted that private lives should be protected from public
exposure. The committee proposed that three forms of journalistic trespass
should be made criminal. The government has not said whether it accepts or
rejects these proposals.
However, Calcutt stopped short of endorsing the claims for a civil remedy.
Its proposals failed to discern that invasion of privacy goes beyond what
objectively appears to be physical invasion. Publication of private matters
is the cause of the hurt and harm to individuals. Preventing journalists'
investigations may not in practice be easy, or even desirable. Publication,
however, can be more readily visited by a pre-emptive legal strike - namely
the injunction.
There's the rub. If those whose private lives are threatened with exposure
could readily invoke the mighty protection of the law courts, the danger to
press freedom would indeed be great. But the courts' approach to the
prevention of defamatory publications indicates that a privacy law would
give no such encouragement to prospective plaintiffs. The media have a right
to publish libellous material, of course always at the risk that they may
have to pay damages - sometimes inordinately large sums of money - if they
cannot subsequently justify what has been published.
The courts have said time and time again that they will not stop publication
of defamatory statements in any case where the person who wants to publish
is prepared to defend what he has published in any court action. Threats by
angry clients and their solicitors to stop the presses rolling with
last-minute dashes to the High Court are largely bluff.
It is worth recalling Lord Denning's remarks in a case in 1969: 'The court
will not restrain the publication of an article, even though it is
defamatory, when the defendant says he intends to justify it or to make fair
comment on a matter of public interest. The reason sometimes given is that
the defences of justification and fair comment are for the jury. But a
better reason is the importance in the public interest that the truth should
out. The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest
that individuals should possess, and, indeed, that they should exercise
without impediment, so long as no wrongful act is done. There is no wrong
done if it is true, or if it is fair comment on the matter of public
interest. The court will not prejudice the issue by granting an injunction
in advance of publication.'
In like fashion the courts would retort to any action brought on the grounds
of an invasion of privacy. The mere raising of the defence of public
interest would instantly stifle any injunction pending the trial. English
courts do not generally countenance prior restraint any more than do their
American counterparts employing the first amendment to the US constitution
guaranteeing freedom of the press.
The newspaper that publishes the activities of public figures or politicians
would thus hardly be deterred from publishing anything that it wished, save
for the long-term potential of having to fight a case for damages in the
courts. But that is precisely what every editor has to consider when judging
the risk of a libel action for something he wishes to publish.
Too much of the debate on privacy is focusing on the extent to which private
lives of public figures are fair game. While the public figure issue is of
great significance, the threshold decision, whether society should accord
legal protection to the private lives of all its citizens, needs to be made
before discussing any differing standards for those who choose to be engaged
in public affairs.
Over 100 years ago two distinguished Americans wrote the most influential
law review article ever written in the English language on any subject. It
led to privacy laws being introduced in every jurisdiction of the US. Samuel
Warren and Louis Brandeis (later to become a Supreme Court justice) wrote in
1890: 'The intensity and complexity of life, attendant upon advancing
civilisation, have rendered necessary some retreat from the world, and man,
under the refining influence of culture, has become more sensitive to
publicity, so that solitude and privacy have become more essential to the
individual; but modern enterprise and invention have, through invasion upon
his privacy, subjected him to mental pain and distress, far greater than
could be inflicted by mere bodily injury.'
Those words are apposite in modern Britain.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: The broad mind of travel - Martin
Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour Operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In David Lodge's novel Paradise News, an anthropologist called Roger
Sheldrake argues that the package holiday is the modern-day equivalent of
the religious pilgrimage, that guide books are devotional aids, and that a
dip in the hotel pool is a form of baptism.
'Tourism is the new world religion,' Sheldrake tells a fellow-tripper to
Hawaii. 'Catholics, Protestants, Hindus, Moslems, Buddhists, atheists - the
one thing they have in common is they all believe in the importance of
seeing the Parthenon, or the Sistine Chapel, or the Eiffel Tower.'
Modern tourism's gigantic migrations preoccupy Martin Brackenbury too. There
are currently about 360m people travelling abroad on holiday every year. In
the next 10 years, he says, that figure could double.
Brackenbury is one of the tourist industry's most senior figures, with as
many titles as there are delayed departures from Gatwick airport.
He is president of the International Federation of Tour Operators (Ifto),
which represents travel companies in 17 countries; chairman of the Tour
Operators' Study Group (TOSG), the big UK holiday companies' oddly named
trade body; chairman of the TOSG's trust fund, which brings tourists home
when companies fail; a member of the national council of the Association of
British Travel Agents; and a director of Thomson, Britain's biggest travel
group.
He is also, like the fictional Roger Sheldrake, a trained anthropologist,
having studied the subject at Cambridge. But he does not think much of the
idea that tourism's growth is linked to organised religion's decline. People
travel, he says, when they have money and political freedom.
'If you have growth in discretionary income, the propensity to travel
doesn't grow in a linear fashion, but in an exponential one,' he says.
As to political freedom, 600,000 people travelled to the west from
Czechoslovakia in 1989. The following year, after the collapse of communism,
the figure rose to 8.1m. Many east Europeans do not now have the money to
travel, but when they do they will join millions of other new tourists.
'The eastern Europeans will travel south, to the cheaper areas of the
Mediterranean, to parts of Greece. In Japan and the Pacific Basin there are
more people who will want to travel. And then there are lots of people who
until now haven't even considered travelling: Chinese, Indians.'
Given the profit these new tourists could offer to the company Brackenbury
helps run and to the others he represents, he is curiously ambivalent about
the prospect. On the one hand, he says, 'the underlying idea that people
should have the ability to travel must be a blow for freedom'.
On the other hand, 'too many people gathered together ruin a place. Some of
the eastern coastal resorts of Italy have become overdeveloped, anonymous,
and have lost whatever character they had.'
Roger Sheldrake's solution is to end tourism by pointing out to the
holidaymakers how miserable they are. 'Look deep into their eyes,' Lodge has
him say, 'and you will see anxiety and dread.'
Brackenbury agrees that holidays are stressful. 'There's a much higher level
of anxiety when people go away. They're not only going to a place which is
unfamiliar, through which they somehow have to shepherd their children.
They're also with their partner 24 hours a day for two weeks. That comes as
quite a shock.'
In the strangeness of the holiday environment, tourists cling to the
familiar. 'Tourism, in the main, is about people making migrations in very
large numbers for very short periods of time. So when they are taking a
holiday away from Germany and going to Majorca, they're seeking a German
holiday in Majorca. Equally, the English are seeking an English holiday in
Spain, not a Spanish holiday - largely because it's such a short time.'
The current trend away from hotel holidays to self-catering apartments and
villas does not imply greater confidence in dealing with foreign cultures,
Brackenbury says. People simply like the flexibility of self-catering.
Buying your own food does not require much contact with local people. Many
self-catering complexes have restaurants and supermarkets on site, which
sell what English or German visitors want to buy.
If the tourists want what they have at home, why don't they stay there?
'Part of it is habit,' Brackenbury says. 'You've got a holiday and you ought
to go away. If you stay at home, you end up doing odd jobs and watching
television.
'People see that by going away, they are enhancing their world in some way.
They are looking, in general, for new experiences.' But new experiences that
are unthreatening? 'Yes, in a rather controlled environment.'
Whatever the stresses of being abroad, Thomson's surveys show that people do
enjoy their holidays, Brackenbury says. He rejects the view that the foreign
holiday has gone out of fashion. The reported fall in European tourism this
year is purely the result of economic hard times, he insists.
The problems caused by tourism cannot be solved by reducing the number of
tourists because people are not going to stop taking holidays. 'Try denying
them the opportunity,' Brackenbury says. 'People, in general, feel the
better for the experience. It's revitalising in some way. People find that
by taking holidays they get a different perspective on their own activities.
Most people are so involved in what they do day-to-day that they don't take
time to step back.'
What the tourist industry has started to do is think about how to preserve
the environment and ambience of its resorts, Brackenbury says. The Majorcan
seaside town of Magaluf degenerated to the point where families were staying
away. It has had some success in winning them back by improving facilities
and curbing the owners of nightspots.
In the past, the tourist industry developed its Magalufs and, when they
became too downmarket, moved on to Greece, Turkey, Africa or the Caribbean.
'They could do that in the 1970s, and to some extent during the 1980s. But
talking to my colleagues in Ifto, they no longer believe that is possible.
The reason for that is there is nowhere else to move on to,' Brackenbury
says.
'That means that the places they've got, which they've invested an awful lot
of time developing, are the ones that they're going to have to stick with if
they're going to have a business for the future. That lies at the centre of
their concern with environmental issues. It's nothing to do with altruism
and long-term views on the planet. The only way we can make this business
work is if people are satisfied when they get there. It's entirely to do
with self-interest.'
Beyond such pragmatism, Brackenbury the anthropologist must surely have some
views on people's peculiar practice of leaving their home to spend two weeks
in a country where they do not speak the language and mistrust the food. If
it does not resemble the religious rituals of previous ages, what does it
resemble?
Somewhat reluctantly, Brackenbury ventures a guess. 'In simple societies,
you don't have any clear examples of what you would call leisure. But you do
have examples of celebration. They usually involve sacrifice of some sort or
initiation ceremonies, and people have high degrees of anxiety about that.
But they come out at the other side feeling part of something bigger and
somehow enhanced as individuals. And then they have a big celebration and
they collectively feel better. It seems to me that there are certain
analogies with that in taking a holiday.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: A dazzling D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question now facing the world's central banks is how the dollar's fall
can can be stabilised, writes James Blitz.
Recent interventions show that the US authorities do not want to see the
dollar fall uncontrollably, if at all. There is a negative impact on equity
markets: the Dow Jones Index fell by over 50 points on Friday. The dollar's
fall also increases strains in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism as
traders sell dollars for D-Marks, pushing up the German currency's value.
Many dealers believe that the Fed is planning more rounds of intervention,
in the hope of turning the market once-and-for-all. With the dollar testing
DM1.42, it must be easier to convince the market into thinking that there
are profits to be made.
But can intervention work ? The fundamental problem weighing the currency
down is that the US, Germany and Japan are pursuing domestically-oriented
policies which put less emphasis than usual on exchange rates.
That dysfunction has widened the differential between US and German
short-term rates so far that the markets are dazzled by the D-Mark's
investment potential. It has undermined the credibility of concerted
intervention, too. By buying dollars, the Bundesbank puts D-Marks into
circulation and founders its attempt to control the M3 monetary supply
target.
Arguably, the only factors which will underpin the dollar are an improved
outlook for the US economy or a cut in German interest rates. Analysts see
no sign of the former, but Germany's slide into recession may bring a rate
cut by the end of this year. Until then, central banks may pay heavily in
reserves to stabilise the currency system.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Swiss Bonds: Investors languish in the doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been another disappointing year so far in the Swiss franc bond
market, with investors still waiting for the decisive interest rate move
that could set off a rally and issuers still finding better terms in the
swap market.
The total volume of new issues in the first seven months slumped by nearly a
quarter to SFr22.4bn and would have tumbled further but for the
deterioration in public sector finances in Switzerland.
In the domestic part of the market, which is made up mainly of government
and government guaranteed issues, the volume of new issues jumped 30 per
cent to SFr12.66bn in the first seven months.
The federal government expects to run a record SFr5.6bn fund raising
programme this year, and most of the big cantons have also become big
borrowers.
By contrast, new issues in the once very active foreign sector halved in the
first seven months to SFr9.75bn. The main reasons for this decline are
fairly familiar. Foreign issuers, in particular, have been put off by the
uncharacteristic volatility and weakness of the Swiss franc.
Meanwhile, the rising trend in long-term interest rates has encouraged
investors to stay in short-term instruments where yields have been higher
anyway. The recessionary climate has made industrial companies shy to invest
and banks reluctant to lend.
A factor peculiar to the Swiss market has been the drying up of public
issues by Japanese borrowers. In the late 1980s, when the Japanese stock
market was booming, there was a huge flow of issues, most equity related, by
Japanese companies. This year there have been almost none.
Ironically, this deterioration of the market has come during a period when
several steps have been taken to improve its notorious lack of liquidity.
Typically, bonds issued in the Swiss franc market have been placed over a
period of two or three weeks and not seen again until maturity. Even now,
according to the Geneva bankers Pictet &amp; Cie, only about five federal
government issues and a similar number of others have any significant
secondary trading.
Until last year, there were no issues large or long enough in the Swiss
franc market to serve as benchmarks. The first steps to fill this gap came
when Swiss Bank Corporation led a SFr600m issue for the World Bank and a
two-step SFr800m issue for the European Investment Bank.
This year, the federal government, which used to come to the market only
three or four times a year with relatively small issues, agreed to start a
monthly treasury auction programme, which would consist of tap issues of
varying coupon rats that could become benchmarks.
The issues, which began in May, have all been around SFr500m and coupons
have ranged from 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent. Dealers say these issues have
already improved liquidity and cut the spread between bid and offer prices.
The start-up this year of bond futures on the Soffex exchange has also
helped improve liquidity.
The next government auction is due to be announced today, and analysts are
expecting another SFr500m tranche of the 7 per cent coupon issue or perhaps
a new issue at a slightly higher coupon. 'If they try a lower coupon,
interest in it would be subdued,' says Mr Franz Ruegg of Bank Julius Baer in
Zurich.
After two years of depressed market conditions, bond analysts are reluctant
to show much optimism about the near-term outlook, but they do point to some
encouraging signs.
The franc has remained strong in recent weeks in spite of the Swiss National
Bank's refusal to follow German rate increases, and some analysts suspect
that the current turmoil in Europe over currency unification and the French
referendum on the Maastricht agreement is helping to restore the franc's
haven role.
They also point out that inflation in July at 3.8 per cent was half its
level of a year earlier, making real interest rates very attractive. And
short-term rates have come close enough to long term ones in the past few
days that investors could start to be tempted to shift some cash into bonds.

FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Gilts: Market falls under sterling's shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S weakness cast a shadow over the gilt market, forcing up yields
for short-dated bonds owing to expectations that the UK government may soon
be forced to lift base rates.
For longer-dated gilts, buying pressure was depressed ahead of the auction
by the Bank of England this Wednesday of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.75 per cent
Treasury stock payable in 2017. That put a ceiling on price rises at this
end of the yield curve.
Meanwhile, gilts were hardly helped by indications from opinion polls of a
substantial likely 'no' vote in the French referendum on the Maastricht
treaty on September 20.
An outcome of this sort would make unlikely a move to economic and monetary
union around the turn of the century. That would probably lead to
significant selling of gilts by investors, along with other European
government bonds denominated in weak currencies.
Sterling closed on Friday night at below DM2.80 in the European exchange
rate mechanism, within a whisker of its permitted floor of DM2.778. The
pound's fragility was in spite of concerted government action on Friday to
weaken the D-Mark. That took the form of intervention by 16 central banks
led by the US Federal Reserve to sell the German currency for dollars.
While much of sterling's recent fall has been linked to the dollar's
weakness and the consequent strength of the German currency, investors are
worried about the lack of any UK recovery.
Although weak economic activity helps gilt prices on the grounds that
inflationary pressures should stay weak for the foreseeable future, the
ensuing lack of confidence in sterling reduces demand pressure for UK
government bonds.
Such an interpretation was supported by events in the gilt market last week
when in thin holiday trading the benchmark short-dated 10 per cent Treasury
stock maturing in 1994 lost more than  1/4 point, closing on Friday night at
100 5/16 . Its yield was pushed up during the week from 9.47 per cent to
9.75 per cent. The longer dated 9 per cent Treasury stock due in 2008 closed
little changed at 99 23/32 , for a yield of 9.03 per cent.
Much weaker economic expansion than that expected by the government will
make a nonsense of the treasury's calculations about the public sector
borrowing requirement, which is pushed up at times of economic fragility.
The PSBR is now thought likely by City economists to be about Pounds 33bn
this financial year and around Pounds 40bn next year - as opposed to the
treasury forecasts of Pounds 28bn and Pounds 32bn.
Such arithmetic explains why the Bank of England is under strong pressure to
keep up the pace of gilt sales. Assuming this week's auction is successful,
the Bank will have sold an estimated Pounds 16bn-Pounds 18bn out of the
Pounds 35bn or so gilts for which it will need to find buyers this financial
year.

FT  24 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Caught unawares by a plummeting dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST when the bond market thought it was safe from President George Bush's
appetite for vote-catching tax cuts, it was caught unawares last week by, of
all things, a plummeting dollar.
Normally, the dollar does not figure in the bond market's daily
calculations, but so unnerving was the currency's decline on Friday (it fell
to its lowest ever value against the D-Mark of DM1.4310 in spite of
concerted attempts by world central banks to prop it up) that treasury
investors turned tail and ran.
What had been a solid half a point rally in 30-year bonds was turned into a
half a point decline in barely an hour. The initial rally on Friday morning
had been a response to President Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican
convention.
Those early gains in bond prices, however, were not an unconditionally
positive response to the president's rhetoric or his economic battle-plan,
but rather an expression of relief that Mr Bush had not announced a
deficit-widening package of tax cuts. He did propose to cut taxes, but only
on condition that Congress agreed to some balancing reductions in spending.
Explaining why the bond market took fright at the dollar's decline is not
easy. Typically, there are two main reasons why bonds do not like a falling
dollar.
First, the lower the currency goes, the less room the Federal Reserve has to
cut interest rates.
The last thing the dollar needs is a further widening in the differentials
between US and German interest rates. Second, a falling dollar can lead to
higher inflation over the long term by raising the cost of imported goods.
However, neither were particularly convincing explanations for why bonds
fell so sharply last week. Insiders suggest the Fed would be prepared to cut
rates again no matter what the consequences for the dollar. And inflation,
currently hovering around 3 per cent, is likely to remain unthreatening for
at least another year or two, even with higher import prices.
The most likely cause for the decline on Friday was a combination of the
weak dollar and a dawning realisation in the wake of the president's speech
that neither the Republican nor the Democratic candidates are willing to
bite the budget deficit bullet.
As Mr Joe Taylor, foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said
when asked about the fall in the dollar and bond prices: 'I think what we
are getting here is global capital calling for a mandate to cut the Federal
budget deficit.'
Given that President Bush and Governor Clinton's deficit-cutting plans are
both highly unconvincing - one has promised to cut taxes and spending, the
other to raise taxes and spending - those calls are likely to go unheeded.
*****
Is it Salomon revisited?
The Federal Reserve has confirmed that it is taking a closer than usual look
at what is happening to the market in five-year notes maturing in July 1997.
In the past week, there has been a severe shortage of the five-years, the
result of a squeeze by a few institutions that control a large amount of the
issue.
Traders who sold the issue short in anticipation of a drop in five-year
prices have had to borrow the five-years from the few institutions that hold
them.
Because they need the five-years so desperately, the short sellers have been
forced to lend money at effective annual interest rates of under 1 per cent
in repurchase agreements to get hold of the five-year notes.
While squeezes of various kinds happen all the time in the bond markets, the
severity and length of the five-year squeeze has attracted special attention
from the Fed. So far, however, there is no suggestion that the Fed will
follow its new policy unveiled in the wake of last year's Salomon scandal
and issue extra five-year notes to ease the shortage of supply.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Stock-picking, a computable
art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I SPENT an instructive morning last week at a portfolio management pitch by
a very blue-blooded New York bank. It was impressive. These people claim to
have made stock-picking a computable art. Computable, because it is highly
systematic; an art rather than a science, because the aim is shrewdly
modest: 'To get it a bit less wrong than the others.'
To judge by the results, they get it very significantly less wrong. Could
one ask for more?
Well, yes; but before we get to the ungrateful bit of this column, the
system deserves serious attention. It rests on a large force of analysts, as
you might expect; but analysts with a difference; both in approach and
motivation.
The approach rests on an effort to measure the underlying long-term trend of
earnings, as much as five years ahead; this should give a more objective
measure against which to judge price than the normal historic or one-year
prospective price-earnings ratio. The result cannot be guaranteed to be
superior, but the method certainly generates non-consensual judgments. One
for the long view.
How far is this due to superior science (five-year projections are tricky,
to put it mildly) and how far to different motivation? Brokers' analysts no
doubt struggle to be objective, but essentially they are part of the sales
force: their findings are useful to the firm only when they provoke action.
'Buy', by all means; 'Sell', if that is the way the cookie crumbles; but
'Hold' earns no commission.
For the portfolio manager, on the other hand, 'Hold' is the ideal finding.
It can't come up all the time, because prices change much more than
prospects.
Indeed, so far as this search for underlying value is successful, it will
lead to active trading as the market catches up; so this is not the passive,
widows-and-orphans style of cautious choice and an annual review (which can
also be highly successful).
This is, as it were, active long-termism; the reviews are monthly. (Anything
more frequent tends to beat the water into a foam.)
The portfolio analyst has another advantage: he can give proper attention to
small companies, where the market liquidity may be too small to offer much
business to a serious broker. If you analyse the research brokers put out,
you will see that smaller companies only get fitful attention, at best.
You might conclude that the fund manager has a natural advantage over the
brokers' man; but why, then, does the average manager trail the index?
He is not pressured into short-termism by the needs of the fund; but a
quarterly review seems to produce the same result. And in any case, no
individual record can get round the fact that successful stock-picking is by
definition a minority knack. If we could all do it, there would be no buying
opportunities.
If all this meant only that most fund managers were destined to fall short
of their ambitions, we could write it off to institutional arrangements,
which could be improved, or human nature, which cannot. But the trouble is
that stock-picking is not only usually ill-done; it is habit-forming.
Those who spend their lives brooding over lists forget the big picture. And
the big picture is that over the past five years any likely share portfolio
 -even the one we were inspecting with some wonder - would have
under-performed a simple switch into bonds.
Hindsight, the frustrated equity man will mutter. But it is not. The bond
strategy is not known as the Norwich Union view for nothing.
Cash has also been pretty rewarding in this country, though not in the US.
But getting a confirmed equity man even to consider the alternatives is next
to impossible especially if he has just spent a morning being shown that
somebody is managing to do the job better than he does.
Investment managers (and their committees) should, then, spend a little time
in this sad holiday break wondering not just if they could pursue whether
their present efforts amount to more than making the best of a bad job.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Market may carry seeds of its
own destruction - Floating Rate Notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are signs of a revival of interest in the floating rate note market,
once the most liquid of the Eurobond market. But some traders who lived
through the market's collapse in 1986 believe it may carry the seeds of its
own destruction.
For the first time since 1986, more floating-rate than fixed-rate debt has
been issued in the Eurodollar bond market so far this month. BankAmerica's
Dollars 500m issue of floating rate notes last week was the largest since
the market's heyday in the mid-1980s.
Throughout this year, traders have reported demand from an increasingly
broad investor base for paper in the secondary market. Although the market
remains dominated by banks, recently fund managers, particularly in the US,
and some retail investors have become more active. With dollar interest
rates at historic lows, many fund managers believe that interest rates will
soon be on their way up.
The credit quality of US banks, which make up a large portion of the issuer
base, has started to pick up again, as the US economy emerges from
recession. The sector has rallied strongly.
There are some technical reasons for the market's improvement. Swap spreads
 -the margin which determines at what level a borrower can swap the proceeds
of an issue from fixed to floating-rate - have tightened to such an extent,
that for some potential borrowers (mainly banks) it is cheaper to issue
floating-rate notes than to issue fixed-rate bonds and swap the proceeds.
Some dealers argue that the increase in demand could easily collapse. Most
of the recent surge of new issues has consisted of 'collared' floaters -
floating rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels. The buyers of
these notes have been Swiss investors, keen to lock in coupons of about 5
per cent, at a time when current money market rates are about 1 1/2 points
lower. But, to some dealers, the structure is fatally flawed: as soon as
money market rates rise above 5 per cent, much of the value of the paper
will be instantly eroded, and investors may face large capital losses.
In the secondary market, consisting mainly of deals issued in or before
1986, the key US bank sector has made the best gains. Some traders argue
that the rally can only be partly attributed to credit considerations. Much
of the paper in that sector of the market is 'floored' - has a minimum
coupon level. Investors started buying the paper when money market rates
fell below the floor levels on these deals.
If the market is set for a shake-up further down the road, it will not be
the first time. In 1986, the market boasted impressive liquidity, with
prices for a Dollars 50m trade quoted at a three basis point spread.
The ability to raise cheap funds in large size attracted not just banks but
sovereign borrowers. The largest outstanding deal is a Dollars 4bn floater
issued by the UK in 1986, which pays  1/8 point below Libid (the London
interbank bid rate) and matures in 1996.
Then, the structure of the market changed suddenly. The investor base was
made up largely of banks, which frequently held large portions of each
others' capital in the form of subordinated floaters. In 1986, new capital
guidelines were mooted by the Basle committee, under which banks holding
capital issued by other banks would have it deducted from their capital base
.
The perpetual FRN sector collapsed, dragging down prices in the rest of the
market with it. 'The perp market was predicated on liquidity, and when it
dried up, the market went into free-fall,' one trader recalled.
At the end of the 1980s, the sharp deterioration of the credit quality of
many banks killed off any remaining interest in dated bank paper.
While the US bank sector has improved sharply this year,the rest of the
market is a mixed bag. The perpetual FRN market has not recovered.
European bank floaters have underperformed US bank paper. Demand for Italian
and Scandinavian bank deals is still flagging, due to the increasing credit
concerns about both banking industries, and Japanese bank paper is under
pressure. Prices in senior (unsubordinated) paper have been steadier. Last
week's BankAmerica deal, which some traders felt was too large at Dollars
500m, has tested demand.
Part of the problem for new issues is that they may not mirror secondary
market performance. Demand for secondary market paper has been particularly
strong from US fund managers, who cannot buy issues until they are seasoned.
However, on the supply side, there are reasons to expect further activity.
Banks are keen to take advantage of one of the few markets which gives them
access to subordinated debt, as they struggle to meet the Basle capital
guidelines which come into force next year. The deluge of collared deals
this month bears witness to their enthusiasm.
After half a dozen years of famine, the market may not be able to digest a
feast. But investors' appetites, for the moment, are not sated.
Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg, the German bank, is planning to launch a
Dollars 500m fixed-rate Eurobond, with a maturity of five to 10 years, in
early September. JP Morgan has been mandated to arrange the issue.

loans

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR EVELYN de Rothschild, chairman of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons of London, and
lawyers for Rothschild Bank in Zurich were unavailable for comment Friday
and yesterday on reports that the Zurich bank had made loans to a single
client above the level permitted by the Swiss Banking Commission.
According to reports in Swiss media, the loans were made to the troubled
York Hannover property group led by the Canadian-German financier, Mr
Karsten von Wersebe.
RBZ, which is an associate company of NMR, early this month sacked one of
its top executives, Mr Jurg Heer, after he was arrested for 'irregularities'
which are understood to centre around making large unauthorised loans.
Last month, the bank revealed that a recent credit review had found that
some loans were not fully covered and so it proposed to quadruple its annual
provisions in the year to March 31, 1992 to SFr99.8m (Dollars 75.6m) and to
dissolve its SFr63.5m in hidden reserves 'as a safety measure'. According to
reports in Zurich, the bank's actual total of bad loans may be considerably
larger than these figures indicate.
Such loans and provisions are unusual in a bank whose main activity is
managing funds for rich individuals in return for fees. As a rule, these
funds are invested in very conservative instruments, with a view to
protecting clients' capital by avoiding unnecessary risk.

FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: UBS hits back at 'ill-founded allegations'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, has written to leading fund
managers stressing that it is committed to the 'production of independent
research' on companies.
The letter is a response to what the firm calls 'allegations that Mr Smith
has been suspended due to pressure from major companies'.
It calls these allegations 'ill-founded and objectionable'.
Mr Terry Smith, head of the firm's UK research department, was recently
suspended for allegedly breaching internal procedures with regard to writing
the book, called Accounting for Growth.
It is an expanded version of research published by P&amp;D in January 1991,
which highlighted a number of accounting techniques used by companies to
boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of borrowings
shown on their balance sheets.
Several investment fund managers said they found the UBS letter unconvincing
and voiced concern that independent research was being 'stifled'.
One senior fund manager said: 'The fact is we have always suspected that
companies can put pressure on security houses. The Smith episode appears to
confirm this; nothing in UBS's letter makes us feel any happier about the
situation.'
The UBS letter, co-signed by Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman, and Mr Hector Sants,
vice-chairman head of equities, says analysts are required to show before
publication any 'significant piece of material' to the company or companies
covered by it before it is published.
'We do not, however, in any way guarantee to make changes to reflect
differences of tone or interpretation, although a company's views are always
considered carefully before our final decision is reached.'
The letter goes on to accuse Mr Smith of not going through the standard
procedures. It also alleges that a vast majority of the UBS research report
in 1991 - on which the book was based - 'was written and edited by our
senior analyst Richard Hannah'.
Mr Smith, who attended a UBS disciplinary hearing on Friday, said: 'I was
never aware of any standard procedure at UBS.
'As to the writing of the book, I have never taken away the fact that I
received help and contributions from my colleagues.'

make more lay-offs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MCDONNELL Douglas executive said declining commercial business and not
defence spending cuts were mainly responsible for its 33,864 job cuts over
the past two years, Reuter reports from St Louis.
Mr James Caldwell, director of new business development for the aerospace
contractor, told the Pentagon's Defence Conversion Commission that more
lay-offs would occur in the next two years as some Pentagon programmes were
terminated.
'Most of the job eliminations directly attributable to defence programme
cuts are still ahead of us, and will be felt with particular severity over
the next two years,' he said.
McDonnell had 99,096 people on its payroll in June, down from 132,960 in
June 1990 because of declining commercial business, divestitures and steps
to enhance global competitiveness, he said.
Mr Caldwell told the commission that it expected the US defence market to
remain sizeable in spite of budget cuts that could spark more lay-offs.
TENNECO said it completed its Dollars 3bn restructuring programme with the
sale of its pulp chemicals business to Sterling Chemicals for about Dollars
202m, Reuter reports from Houston.
The company said the Dollars 3bn in restructuring measures involved the sale
of non-core assets valued at Dollars 1.5bn, the issuing of Dollars 716m of
equity, capital spending cuts of Dollars 350m, and cost reductions of
Dollars 300m.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: Ciba-Geigy gains 12% in opening
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIBA-GEIGY, the Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, said its
consolidated net profit in the first half rose 12 per cent to SFr1.4bn
(Dollars 1.06bn) on sales also up 12 per cent to SFr12.26bn, and forecast
'further profit growth during the second half of the year'. Cash flow
increased 11 per cent to SFr2.03bn.
The strong performance was attributable mainly to the rapid advance of the
group's pharmaceutical division where sales jumped 23 per cent to SFr3.2bn.
The group claimed this growth was twice as fast as that in the market as a
whole and enabled it to move up one rank to become the world's fourth
largest supplier of pharmaceuticals.
Ciba cited the successful US introduction of its transdermal patch,
Nicotinell TTS/Habitrol, in the division's growth. US sales of the patches
exceeded SFr400m in the first half. Although competition was increasing and
'proper patient usage' was needed, the group said the patches and a new
menopausal drug, Estracomb TTS, would continue to fuel growth through
introduction in other countries.
The group's agricultural sectors fared less well. Plant protection sales
were flat at SFr2.8bn, hurt by a spring drought in many parts of Europe and
changing buying patterns due to changes in EC agricultural policy.
Industrial product sales gained 10 per cent to SFr4.6bn and the group said
margins were improving. Growth for the remainder of the year was expected to
be driven by sales in the US and Asia, especially of textile dyes, chemicals
and additives and pigments.
Ciba pointed out that once again its sales figures were flattered by a
weakening Swiss franc. In local currencies, its overall sales growth was
only 8 per cent. Since the beginning of the year, the group has set a goal
of hedging against potential negative currency effects its total anticipated
consolidated profit. Previously, it hedged only the net cash flow exposure
flowing to the parent company.
As a result, it said the expected consolidated profit for 1992 was projected
at a rate of about SFr1.5 to the US dollar.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: Uni chief to propose share plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDERS Eckhoff, the chairman of Uni Storebrand, the beleagured Norwegian
insurer, is today expected to seek board approval to expand the company's
share capital by at least NKr2bn (Dollars 347m).
The plan will include some form of state participation although Mr Sigbjoern
Johnsen, finance minister, has ruled out direct state cash transfers. The
state is expected to provide a guarantee for a rights issue and, as the main
owner of Norway's top three banks, will order participation in the issue by
Den norske Bank (DnB) and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks, who
are experiencing financial difficulties.
Uni has been working on details for a rights issue for several weeks but
turbulence within the company and volatility of its share price has slowed
the work.
A nominal value of NKr20 per share has been set for the issue but last week
Uni's A-share price plunged to new lows ending the week 40 per cent down at
NKr13.30 per share on the Oslo bourse, putting its market capitalisation at
an estimated NKr1bn.
The board and the state is seeking to avoid writing down below the share's
nominal value.
Uni's problems stem from a misguided NKr4.7bn investment to acquire a 28.3
per cent stake in Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. Together
with Hafnia Holding, the troubled Danish insurer, Uni sought to create a
pan-Nordic insurance alliance with Skandia, but failed.
Because of Skandia's limited voting rights Uni's strategy could not be
forced on the company which saw the move as hostile and unwelcome. Skandia's
share price has been extremely volatile in recent weeks causing the value of
Uni's original investment, made at NKr200 a share, to be cut by more than
half.
Adding to Uni's woes are demands by some dissident shareholders that the
company sell off non-core assets, reduce operating costs by NKr500m annually
and return its attention to domestic life and non-life insurance business.
Moody's, the US-based international rating agency, downgraded to 'Not Prime'
from 'Prime-3' the short-term debt rating of Uni Storebrand A/S, the group's
holding company, affecting about Dollars 250m in its Eurocommercial paper
programme.
Moody's said the cut stemmed from continued holding company losses,
especially those tied to the Skandia investment and volatility in
Scandinavia financial markets.

NATIONAL BANK of Canada said its exposure to Olympia &amp; York Developments and
related companies rose from CDollars 473m (USDollars 400.8m) to CDollars
500m in the third quarter.
It has made total provisions of CDollars 350m against these loans, including
about CDollars 200m in the latest quarter.
Mr Andre Berard, chairman, said the bank's provisions for loan losses in the
fourth quarter would be at normal levels and he expected the bank to show a
small net profit. The bank has tightened up lending practices and its core
business in Canada continues strong.
The extra provisions brought a loss of Dollars 118m, or Dollars 1 a share,
in the third quarter ended July 31 against a profit of Dollars 39m, or 25
cents a share, a year earlier. Loss for nine months was Dollars 38m, or 52
cents a share, against a profit of Dollars 145m, or 94 cents a share, a year
earlier.

FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: The age-old skill of spinning a yarn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOOL PROCESSING is an ancient and arcane business that became industrialised
with the spread of steam power about two centuries ago.
Today, wool merchants buy raw wool ('greasy wool') from farmers and usually
commission companies such as Woolcombers to prepare it for spinning into
yarn.
This starts with the blending of fine and coarse fleeces into mixtures that
will end up in knitted or woven clothing or carpets. The finer the wool
filaments, the softer the final garment.
Then the wool is scoured: stirred through a series of tanks of hot water and
detergent. This removes the 'woolgrease', which is skimmed off and refined
into lanolin, and suint - dried sheep's sweat.
The clean wool is then 'carded', or pulled by a series of wire brush rollers
to disentangle the filaments.
In some cases, it is further straightened and aligned by being pulled
through a metal grid in 'gilling' and the shortest filaments - 'noils'  -
removed by 'combing' with a yet finer metal grid.
By this time, the wool is in loose ribbons of fibre without twist called
'slivers'.
Finally, the slivers are coiled into 'tops', usually weighing 10
kilogrammes, compressed and bundled up for shipping to yarn spinners before
being woven or knitted into clothing or carpets.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: Minorco may close Yuba Westgold
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, has given up its efforts to dredge gold from
shallow seas. It invested about Dollars 90m in two of these ventures in the
past five years.
Dredging operations off Nome, Alaska, were permanently shut down in
September 1990, and it seems the end is nigh for Yuba Westgold. This company
has been producing about 25,000 troy ounces of gold a year with an offshore
dredge near Marysville, California.
Western Gold Exploration and Mining, a 78-per-cent-owned Minorco subsidiary
which in turn has two thirds and management control of Yuba, said it would
not provide additional financing for Yuba.
Consequently Yuba said it may have to file for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law after failing to make a scheduled
payment to Bank of America.
Minorco originally put Dollars 80m cash into Westgold in 1987 in a joint
venture with its US subsidiary, Inspiration Resources.
Inspiration contributed some gold properties, including the one off Alaska.
Then in 1989 Westgold paid about Dollars 16m and a production royalty for
Yuba.
Inspiration Resources and Minorco shared a Dollars 30m charge in respect of
the Alaskan closure.

TELEBRAS, the state-owned telecommunications holding company, announced
profits of Dollars 354m for the first six months of 1992. In the whole of
1991, the company made Dollars 121.8m.
Last week, the government authorised Telebras to make a foreign equities
offering of Dollars 500m. The company is expected to make a private
placement of American Depository Receipts shortly.
Telebras also announced that it would increase domestic long distance and
base rates for subscribers by 30 per cent by the end of the year.
The new revenue should help Telebras meet its investment target of Dollars
3bn for the current year.
The Gerdau Group, Brazil's largest private steel producer, announced profits
of Dollars 29.5m for the first six months of this year.
Company officials said the result was 32.3 per cent better than that for the
same period in 1991. Overall, the group registered profits of Dollars 36m
last year.
Gerdau has been active in the government's privatisation auctions.
The company owns three steel mills once owned by the state. Most recently,
in February, it acquired Acos Finos Piratini for Dollars 107m, getting a
foothold in the specialised steel sector.

FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Midland Bank to lose creator of Vector
account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Gavaghan, the man who invented Vector, Meridian and Orchard,
Midland Bank's branded current accounts, is to leave the bank at the end of
September after seven years.
Mr Gavaghan, the best-known advocate of strong branding for high-street
banking products, said at the weekend that he had decided to move out of
banking and back into mainstream retailing services.
His departure from Midland comes amid the restructuring of the bank in the
wake of its takeover by Hongkong Bank.
Mr Gavaghan became Midland's marketing director in 1987, having worked
earlier in Thomas Cook, Marks and Spencer, and the Burton Group.
He attracted immediate attention across the industry by saying his
department resembled Procter and Gamble rather than a clearing bank.
By 1989, the branded current accounts which he had designed were picking up
70,000 customers a week, but when the recession began, financial services
designed specially for yuppies and jet-setters lost their appeal and the
branded accounts were quietly jettisoned.
He said he hoped his chief legacy at Midland would be increased awareness
that different groups of customers have different needs.
'I have no regrets. I could not have been in banking at a more interesting
time but I am not sure that I want to be in banking in the near future,' Mr
Gavaghan said. He declined to comment on whether he was being given
compensation for leaving.

FT  24 AUG 92 / International Company News: LSI Logic to centre its
manufacturing in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LSI LOGIC, the Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, is to close its
plant in Germany, reduce operations in the US and shift most of its
manufacturing to Japan and the Asia Pacific region.
About 450 jobs will be lost, including about 275 in Germany, in a broad
restructuring of the group's manufacturing and product strategy. 'Our cost
structure is out of line with the current level of revenues and we are
compelled to reduce costs, and do it quickly,' said Mr Wilfred Corrigan,
chairman and chief executive.
LSI, which specialises in application specific integrated circuits, will
take charges of Dollars 95m to Dollars 110m in the current quarter and
expects to report net losses of about Dollars 100m. For the second quarter,
LSI reported losses of Dollars 5.8m on sales of Dollars 151.8m.
The German assembly and test factory in Braunschweig was opened in 1985 and
is one of the most advanced of its kind in the world. It was built to serve
expected strong demand from the European computer industry, Mr Corrigan
said, but the anticipated level of demand failed to materialise.
'There is very little PC or computer workstation manufacturing in Europe,
and this represents a large portion of our market,' he noted.
The rise in the value of the D-Mark against the dollar has made the factory
more costly to operate, Mr Corrigan added, and it could no longer compete
with the lower costs of subcontractors in Asia.
In addition to closing the German plant, LSI Logic said that over the next
18 months it would shift the bulk of its wafer fabrication operations to
Japan where it had a large scale facility and was in the process of
constructing a new factory in a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel. Research
and development as well as pilot line production would remain in the US.
'Following completion of the new wafer factory in Japan in 1993, LSI Logic
does not foresee the need to build new wholly owned plant capacity,' said Mr
Corrigan.
The company aims either to share the cost of future plants with strategic
partners as it has in Japan or to subcontract manufacturing. The cost of new
semiconductor plants has risen sharply over the past few years, making them
affordable by only the world's largest chip makers.
'By the mid-1990s you are going to see a lot of shared chip plants,' Mr
Corrigan predicted. LSI's problems stem from losses in the market for
personal computer chipsets driven by sharp declines in PC prices.
However, the bigger issue faced by LSI is high overhead costs. The cuts will
reduce costs by about Dollars 10m per quarter, the company said. LSI
projected net losses of about Dollars 100m after charges, for the current
quarter but said that it hoped to return to profitability in the fourth
quarter.
'We are committed to lowering our break-even point, restoring profitability,
and pursuing a value-added product strategy with emphasis on intellectual
property, ASIC design tools and system-level integration,' Mr Corrigan said.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Economics Notebook: Spotlight turns on investment in Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America's bid to turn its recent economic advances into sustainable
growth will turn in large part on one issue: investment.
The signals appear more hopeful than at any time since the onset of the debt
crisis a decade ago. Of the Dollars 40bn (Pounds 21bn) of capital that
flowed into Latin America last year, Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
securities house, estimates that foreign direct investment jumped to nearly
Dollars 14bn. Executives at many multinational companies say they are
seeking to boost investment in Latin America, after a decade of, at best,
holding on.
None the less, it is not yet clear, even in the most successful economies,
whether enough investment will arrive to sustain growth.
Furthermore, the amount of investment isn't everything: investment was
plentiful during the free-spending 1970s in Latin America - and hugely
inefficient.
As JP Morgan, the US investment house, points out in its latest issue of
World Financial Markets: 'For most of Latin America, emphasis on investment
quantity is less critical than the need for sustained improvement in its
quality.'
The Brazilian economy is a case in point. The level of fixed investment in
Brazil was the highest in Latin America during the 1980s, accounting for at
least a fifth of GDP throughout the period. However, because the economy was
riddled with price distortions and controls, the results in terms of growth
of output have been unimpressive: a meagre 0.7 per cent a year from 1987 to
1991.
Over the next five years, Morgan calculates that Dollars 960bn of gross
fixed investment will be needed to generate annual growth of at least 5 per
cent in the seven biggest economies - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. This represents a relatively modest 11 per cent
increase on the Dollars 863bn invested in the five years to 1991, when
investment was depressed.
The calculation depends on the economies coming close to the level of
investment efficiency already achieved by Chile, where economic reforms are
the most advanced.
The indication of Chile's productivity achievement is the growth over the
last decade in the country's co-called total factor productivity (TFP), the
amount by which output growth exceeds growth in inputs of capital or labour.
The higher a country's total factor productivity, the higher the output
generated by any given amount of capital.
TFP encompasses a variety of influences on productivity such as
technological advancement, economies of scale and education. It is also
influenced heavily by the economic and regulatory environment in which the
investment is made.
In Chile, and Colombia, growth in total factor productivity during the 1980s
exceeded that in the industrialised countries.
Morgan reckons other Latin countries may be able to match their
performances, partly because their investment patterns are becoming more
like those in rich countries. For example, current rapid growth in service
industries in Latin America will require the same high-tech investments,
such as computers, as in the rich countries. The dropping of tariff barriers
and government controls also means that, unlike in the past, Latin economies
are able to import the latest technologies.
Most of Latin America has also taken great strides in rehabilitating market
mechanisms, thereby allowing prices to provide accurate signals for the
allocation of resources.
As a result, the Morgan economists say it is not fanciful to believe that
investment can be generated sufficient to secure the 5 per cent target.
However, meeting the investment requirement will be harder for some
countries than for others. According to Morgan's calculations, Brazil -
which accounts for half the region's investment outlays - could secure the
growth target by investing 9 per cent less than the Dollars 445bn it
invested from 1987-91. But it would have to introduce competitive technology
and wide-ranging economic reform to do so. Brazil is so far behind on
implementing structural reforms it is 'unlikely to achieve the investment
efficiency within the grasp of the others,' Morgan concludes.
At the other extreme, Argentina would need to boost investment by 145 per
cent over 1987-91 levels to achieve 5 per cent growth. 'This may be too
ambitious,' says Morgan. Fixed investment fell to 8.9 per cent of GDP in
1990, the lowest in Latin America, and rose to only 10 per cent last year,
in spite of a successful reform programme.
Peru and Venezuela would also need substantial rises in investment - both of
22 per cent. But Mexico requires only a 16 per cent rise, and Colombia an
increase of 5 per cent to meet the growth target. Investment in Chile
dropped sharply in 1991, a result of government attempts to stop the economy
overheating, but fixed investment is again on the rise. 'It should exceed 20
per cent of GDP this year - more than enough to meet the 5 per cent target,'
Morgan says.
The report, while acknowledging the importance of foreign investment as a
catalyst for growth, underlines the central role of domestic saving in
capital formation. Here the news has not been good, as saving rates have
been falling in the region.
It suggests initiatives in three areas to correct this: more public saving
(ie, reduced government borrowing); social security reform - following the
example of Chile whose pension system reforms have transformed the country's
capital markets into the most mature in the region; and restructuring
domestic banking systems.
The report concedes that over the next few years Latin governments will be
constrained in their attempts to cut spending by pent-up demand for
investment and for spending on social services. Infrastructure has
deteriorated so badly in some countries, such as Peru and Venezuela, that it
may now constitute a bottleneck to future growth.
Public saving will therefore probably be increased by continued
privatisation, resisting public sector wage increases and sustained efforts
to broaden inadequate tax bases.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Japanese banks return to favour with investors: Tokyo market
reaction to government statements on the financial system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT TOOK just three days last week for Tokyo's sagging Nikkei stock index to
put on 1,907.47 points, or 13.3 per cent to close at 16,216.88.
The broad rally in the market was underpinned by an even more powerful rise
in bank share prices. On Friday alone, the Nikkei bank share index shot
ahead by 8.7 per cent, compared with a 6.2 per cent rise for the market as a
whole. A conviction has quickly spread among investors that something
fundamental has changed in the outlook for the banks, and that the
government is now committed to solving their problems of poor profitability,
inadequate capital and, most serious, the enormous burden of bad debt.
Yet aside from a few measures aimed at tiding the market over the first half
of the financial year, which ends next month, almost nothing concrete
emerged last week to address the bank's deeper problems. It is therefore
important to ask whether the perception that the government has changed its
attitude - followed by a flurry of leaked news reports about measures under
consideration - can justify such a change in market sentiment.
The measures were offered on Tuesday evening by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance
minister. Mr Hata said that banks would not have to report and provide for
unrealised losses on securities holdings at the interim, thus reducing
incentives to realise capital gains on other shares to boost profits. Banks
would also be allowed to distribute more than 40 per cent of profits as
dividends, thus allowing them to maintain payout levels without selling
shares for profit.
Mr Hata said he hoped to halt a vicious cycle in the market in which
declining share prices forced financial institutions to sell more shares,
thus driving securities prices even lower. Yet perhaps even more important
for sentiment than the temporary measures offered was Mr Hata's admission
that Japan's financial system was standing on the edge of a precipice,
facing its worst crisis since the second world war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor,
confessed for the first time to concern that the low level of the stock
market was having negative effects on Japan's economy and banking system.
Until then, Mr Mieno has repeatedly said that Japan's financial system was
sound and that the central bank would not save imprudent investors by moving
to shore up sagging share or property prices.
Indeed financial authorities seemed at last to be thinking along similar
lines. Mr Mieno endorsed an idea under discussion to establish a corporation
to purchase land held as collateral by banks for bad loans, and thereby help
to remove bad assets from the banks' balance sheets.
Since then, an avalanche of proposals apparently being drawn up by the
Finance Ministry for inclusion in an emergency economic package to be
announced on Friday have hit the nation's press.
They include:
A corporation to purchase property and possibly bad property loans from the
banks. Most analysts believe banks have between Y25,000bn (Dollars 200bn)
and Y30,000bn of loans, mainly for property, for which no interest is being
paid. Up to Y3,000bn may be unrecoverable, but in the meanwhile banks cannot
get bad loans off their books because the property market is so illiquid.
A corporation capable of buying the property, presumably at a market price
below book value, would at least give the banks the option of choosing
between keeping loans on the books until the market recovers or taking an
immediate capital loss. Another idea is to use the land itself as capital
and to issue mortgage securities to investors. Mr Mieno and Mr Mamoru Ozaki,
vice finance minister, have both welcomed the concept. But neither has
warmed to the suggestion that the government or central bank should invest
in it or provide cheap finance.
Ms Rie Ota, banking analyst at Baring Securities, says: 'Who is going to
bear the cost? That is the key question.'
It would make little sense for the banks to invest in such a company
themselves, unless substantial tax breaks are given to the banks for
disposing of bad loans, which would amount to a government subsidy.
Realising the idea promises to be complex and time consuming, if practical
at all.
Tax Breaks. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the economic daily, has reported that
Japan's 11 city banks would add more than Y1,000bn to tax-exempt loan loss
reserves in the current half year, with the blessing of the Finance
Ministry. The ministry in the past has allowed such provisions only after
two years in which no interest has been paid. The ministry is also
considering allowing tax breaks when banks cut interest rates to help out
borrowers.
The problem, however, is that banks are big taxpayers. With tax revenues
expected to be Y6,000bn to Y10,000bn lower because of the weak economy, the
ministry could prove very conservative in using its discretionary authority
to grant tax breaks. And with bad loan costs last year amounting to 175 per
cent of pre-tax profits, banks could still be under tremendous pressure to
sell shares unless the ministry comes up with an extremely attractive, and
costly, package.
Bank operating profits are being helped by lower interest rates, and could
rise by over 20 per cent in the current half year. The ministry has also
basically solved the problem of banks meeting the 8 per cent capital
adequacy requirements set by the Bank for International Settlements by
showing more flexibility in allowing banks to issue relatively high-cost
perpetual floating-rate notes or convertible bonds with mandatory
conversion, counting as tier 2 capital.
It has also proved more flexible in allowing banks to securitise loans and
sell them.
Yet a solution to the banks' more fundamental problem - how to get the huge
volume of bad debt off their books - has been outlined only in the
sketchiest form. Government authorities may have changed their attitude, but
there is plenty of scope for disappointment later this week when the
government unveils detailed proposals to boost the economy. Investors who
bid up bank shares last week are taking a lot on faith.

FT  24 AUG 92 / SE reviews its powers to discipline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange is conducting an informal review of how to punish
listed companies which breach the rules contained in the exchange's Yellow
Book.
Senior officials believe the exchange's punishments are inadequate. 'Some
companies and their advisers are taking no notice of the Yellow Book',
complained one.
The Yellow Book contains the rules which companies should follow after they
are listed. One of the most common breaches is to release price sensitive
information to selected newspapers, before making an official announcement
to the exchange. Another breach is making a Stock Exchange announcement
which turns out to have been misleading.
Over the past few months, the exchange has investigated 26 examples of
alleged leaks by companies. If convinced there has been a deliberate leak,
the exchange will normally reprimand the company in private.
One official said: 'Do not under-estimate how embarrassing it is for a
company to be told that it has broken the rules.'
However, another exchange executive believes the exchange should be tougher.
It has two additional punitive powers. It can make a public statement
criticising a company or it can delist a company. The exchange would
probably never use delisting as punishment if a company leaked information.
'We have to consider the interests of shareholders', said an official. 'If
we delist the shares, they suffer, even though they are not to blame for the
rule infringement.'
The last time the exchange censured in public was a year ago, when two
directors of Mountleigh, Mr Nelson Peltz and Mr Peter May, were criticised
for selling shares in the group two months before it disclosed poor results
and launched a rights issue. In recent years, the only other companies to
face public censure were Polly Peck and Tottenham Hotspur.
Mr Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive, has had a meeting with the
City &amp; Financial Group of the Institute of Public Relations to discuss what
to do about leaking. 'We (the Institute) think the exchange should censure
in public' said Mr Geoff Kelly, head of public relations at investment bank
Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Yorkshire textile group plans flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF Yorkshire's largest textile companies is planning the biggest textile
industry flotation on the London Stock Exchange for almost a decade.
Woolcombers Group is part of the Illingworth Morris Group, owned by Mr Alan
Lewis who acquired a majority stake in 1983 and took it private in 1989.
A pathfinder prospectus and share placing are planned for next month by the
company's broker James Capel.
Less than half the group is to be sold and the company is likely to have a
market capitalisation of Pounds 35m-Pounds 40m.
Three divisions of Illingworth Morris are to be floated under the
Woolcombers Group name: Jarmain, which processes UK wool mainly for carpets;
Woolcombers (Processors) which processes UK and southern hemisphere wools
for carpets and clothing, and Westbrook Lanolin which takes by-products from
the first two companies and refines them into pharmaceutical lanolin for
cosmetics, toiletry and medical products.
Illingworth Morris is one of 55 subsidiaries of Log Trust, a UK company 75
per cent held by Hartley Investment Trust, wholly owned by Mr Lewis, and 25
per cent held by an offshore trust of which Mr Lewis is the sole
beneficiary.
The remainder of Illingworth Morris consists of yarn, weaving and clothes
manufacturing operations as well as the Crombie brand name traditionally
associated with overcoats.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Foreign banks split on loans to Efim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIVISIONS have emerged between foreign bank creditors to Efim, the Italian
state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month, ahead of
this week's meeting with Italian treasury officials in London.
The differences became apparent as foreign bankers, who lent around L3,500bn
(Pounds 1.63bn) of Efim's L8,500bn total debt, held a round of talks in
London and Milan late last week to co-ordinate their positions.
Separately, there have been unofficial indications that the Italian treasury
may be prepared to soften its position on the treatment of bank creditors,
opening the way to a compromise.
Foreign banks earlier this month threatened to declare Efim in default on
its loans after the treasury announced it would pay rates of interest
substantially below current market levels on the special bonds to be issued
to Efim's creditors.
As a result, banks would receive only around 80 per cent of the total
principal and interest due.
Last week, about 15 foreign bankers met senior treasury officials in Rome to
discuss their differences.
However, the meeting was limited to an exchange of views, with detailed
talks being left to this week's session in London, expected to take place on
Wednesday or Thursday.
Foreign bank creditors appear divided between those calling for an immediate
declaration of default on Efim's loans, and possibly the invocation of
cross-default clauses on loans to Iri and Eni, Italy's two other state
holding companies, and others recommending a less hawkish approach.
Gaps have also emerged over bankers' interpretations of the treasury's
position.
At last week's meeting, Mr Mario Draghi, its senior civil servant, made
clear that no solutions had been 'pre-judged'.
Foreign banks are at odds as to whether that apparent flexibility is a
tactic to gain time and exploit creditors' divisions, or indicates a real
willingness to raise interest rates on the bonds - the crux of the dispute.
Meanwhile, the treasury appreciates foreign banks could play a decisive part
in plans to privatise state assets to cut the budget deficit and the risks
it runs if the conflict continues.

FT  24 AUG 92 / BAe shrugs off Riyadh's deferral of Pounds 8bn air base
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE, the troubled defence contractor, yesterday played down
the likely impact of a decision by Saudi Arabia to shelve the Pounds
8bn-10bn Sulayil air base project.
The base was to have been part of BAe's largest overseas contract,
al-Yamamah, which is understood to be worth Pounds 30bn over the next
decade.
Riyadh is paying BAe, as lead contractor on al-Yamamah, about Pounds 3bn a
year for the rest of the decade for defence equipment, construction and
services such as training. BAe has never disclosed what proportion of the
total it will be retaining, and how much of it is being paid to the other
companies involved in the contract.
A total of Pounds 10bn has been paid by the Saudis so far, most of this for
72 Tornado air-to-air combat aircraft and a number of trainers. In April,
BAe received an instalment worth about Pounds 1.5bn.
News of the postponement comes at a sensitive time for BAe, which is being
restructured in an effort to restore its financial health. Mr John Cahill,
the company's new chairman, is expected to reveal progress on the
restructuring in BAe's interim results due late next month.
BAe confirmed the Saudi decision to shelve the project yesterday. But within
the company it was being argued that the move was 'not significant'.
Equipment, training and support were a far larger part of the al-Yamamah
project than construction, it was said.
Postponement reflected a change in priorities for Riyadh and suggested that
funds would be moved from the construction project to the procurement of
fighter aircraft, the company argued.
This could lead to Saudi Arabia increasing its order for BAe's Tornado IDS,
the version of the aircraft designed for air-to-air combat.
Officially, BAe would say only that: 'We remain satisfied on the progress of
negotiations over the procurement of further equipment for the al-Yamamah
programme.'
The Saudi decision will mean the transfer to other projects of 100 staff at
Ballast Nedam, BAe's construction arm.
They have been working on designs for the Sulayil base, intended to be a 900
sq km complex, about 480km south of Riyadh in a desert region known as the
Empty Quarter.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: European car market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's decision to put its UK plants on short-time working is partly a
reflection of the poor state of the British economy. But the move also says
something about the weak state of Europe as a whole. Last year car
manufacturers were relatively sanguine about depressed sales in Britain and
France, because post-unification Germany was growing rapidly. This year
Germany was expected to slow, with Britain, France and Spain taking up the
slack. Germany, however, has now turned down sharply but the British and
French markets at least remain stubbornly depressed.
Excess capacity has a double impact on Europe's carmakers. German groups
could comfortably sell much of their output at home last year, so had little
need to chase market share elsewhere. That has now changed. Price
competition was also subdued in markets outside Germany while non-German
manufacturers could divert production to the German market. Now the worry is
that German manufacturers will compete aggressively for a bigger share of
export markets, sparking price wars. Manufacturers with dated or unpopular
models - like Fiat and to some extent Ford - are likely to be hit hardest.
Shares of Europe's carmakers have already fallen in anticipation of extra
margin pressure. But there are still worries about the high labour costs of
German manufacturers. While much of German industry can ease such costs by
high productivity, carmaking technology is increasingly easy to transfer.
Companies such as General Motors now find it cheaper to make a Cavalier in
Britain rather than Germany, a problem exacerbated by the strength of the
D-Mark.
The problem is even greater for component makers. The tradition of German
carmakers buying from German component manufacturers is being challenged
because UK manufacturers now have a significant price advantage. Lucas, T&amp;N
and GKN have all made gains in market share, and the opening of Japanese
transplants will help further. In the short term cyclical pressure may
depress profits, but further out Britain's component manufacturers look well
placed.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK food makers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditional defensiveness of the entire UK food manufacturing sector has
taken a serious knock in the past couple of weeks. Stock market attention
has been focused mainly on Hillsdown - whose shares have collapsed by more
than a quarter since August 8 - yet there is barely a quoted company apart
from Unilever which remains unscathed by recent broker downgrades. Northern
Foods, Unigate, United Biscuits, and Ranks Hovis McDougall - a
representative enough sample from a peculiarly diverse industry - have all
underperformed the FT-A All Share Index by more than 10 per cent in the past
month.
The savagery in some analysts' pens has startled even experienced observers,
prompting suggestions that some of the latest estimates are wild and
possibly unduly pessimistic guesses. With many companies in their closed
reporting season, after all, the market would normally wait to see interim
numbers in September before making any substantial end-of-year profit
adjustments. One can also point to special factors behind the more
substantial falls: Unigate's vulnerability to imminent changes in the
methods of milk distribution by the Milk Marketing Board, Northern's and
UB's sensitivity to trends in the UK biscuits market, and the impact on RHM
of a tight harvest for bread milling wheat.
Even so, the market is understandably worried about postponement of economic
recovery beyond the important Christmas season, and growing evidence from
the high street that on top of lower prices for seasonal items food price
inflation generally has almost disappeared. That means manufacturing margins
will be under pressure from the retailers, notably for non branded products
or those where there are other suppliers. Sainsbury's tendency to purchase
chickens from France and Iceland's ability to source pizzas from Germany is
a reminder that supermarket buyers have become increasingly European.
Possibly the biggest threat, though, comes from the consumer in a long
recession. The discretionary element of the shopping basket, after all, has
grown bigger and bigger in the past 10 years as manufacturers sought to
widen their margins with higher added value products.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Sharing the deficit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One side-effect of the Maastricht treaty may be to drive Europe more quickly
towards privatisation. With governments under additional pressure to bring
public sector finances under control the equity market is being asked to
shoulder an increasing chunk of the burden. The Italian government has
pencilled in L42,000bn from sales of commercial assets by the end of 1994.
Last month Germany outlined a programme which will probably start with the
offering of a 25 per cent stake in Lufthansa. A giant flotation for Deutsche
Telekom - valuing the group at anything up to DM70bn - may not be far
behind. France is looking to raise FFr15bn next year, assuming the
Socialists retain power, while under a centre-right government privatisation
will have a far greater role. To this must be added rolling programmes in
Spain and Portugal, and the first hints at privatisation in cash-strapped
Belgium.
In contrast to early UK experience, the recent continental wave of
privatisation is driven by budgetary pressure rather than reforming zeal.
Equity investors will still be hoping for efficiencies as nationalised
industries are put to the test of the market. Partial privatisations which
leave the state in majority control, though, may be the worst of all
possible worlds: making additional demands on the equity market without the
promise of real efficiency gains.
Smaller European equity markets may benefit from greater liquidity and the
breadth of investors that a privatisation programme can attract. The
experience of the UK suggests supply can be perfectly benign in the upswing
of the economic cycle. On the downswing, however, the story is likely to be
different. Will governments relying on asset sales to meet strict
Maastricht-style criteria be prepared to pull back if the market turns
against them? After all, every lira not raised from the equity market will
have to come from either taxation or the bond market. In a recession the
economy can barely afford the former, while the latter hardly solves the
problem of public sector indebtedness.

FT  24 AUG 92 / TGWU and GMB unions set for formal merger talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Britain's three largest unions, the TGWU and GMB, are expected to
begin formal merger talks this autumn in a move which could lead to the
creation of a 2m-strong organisation.
The talks, likely to be confirmed in September or October, would follow
months of merger speculation. They would be welcomed by employers who see
union amalgamations as a means of simplifying their collective bargaining
arrangements.
A TGWU-GMB merger would also raise further questions over the role of the
Trades Union Congress. The recent trend towards a smaller number of large
unions in the UK has already diminished the need for the TUC's co-ordinating
function.
Neither union could confirm the talks yesterday, but senior officials at the
TGWU are confident that leaders either of their union or the GMB will make
the first formal approaches after the annual trade union congress next
month.
Just a few months ago such a merger would have seemed impossible.
Traditionally the two unions, both of which represent workers in a range of
industries, have been rivals to recruit the same workers and this has often
led to friction. Links have strengthened considerably since the election
last year of Mr Bill Morris as TGWU general secretary.
This year the two unions have increasingly worked together, including on a
campaign to improve training. Earlier this year Mr Morris became the first
TGWU general secretary to visit a GMB annual conference.
A merger would be the latest in a series of amalgamations involving large
unions. Earlier this year the AEU engineers joined forces with the EETPU
electricians, and next year the Nalgo and Nupe public sector unions and the
Cohse health service union are due to form a 1.5m-strong organisation.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Panic faces challenge from militant Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MILAN PANIC, the Yugoslav prime minister, was on a collision course with
militant Serb leaders in the northern Serb province of Vojvodina yesterday
over his pledge to halt 'ethnic cleansing'.
Ultranationalist Serbs in the village of Hrtkovci threatened to set up
roadblocks if five of their leaders were not released from prison today. The
five were arrested on Friday night for 'endangering the freedom and rights
of citizens of other nations' after spearheading the expulsion of some 5,000
Croats from Hrtkovci, formerly a predominantly Croat village.
The arrests appear to be timed to coincide with this week's London
conference on the former Yugoslavia, in an attempt to improve the west's
image of Yugoslavia. If the Serbian radicals remain in jail, it will signal
that Mr Panic has enough power to back up his pledge.
The confrontation could destroy the fragile co-existence between Vojvodina's
Serbs, who make up 55 per cent of the population, and its ethnic Hungarians
and Croats. The wars in Croatia and Bosnia began when militants set up
roadblocks, claiming territory as their own, and took up arms against their
ethnic rivals.
Mr Ostoja Sibincic, the village's mayor, was one of the five men detained.
He joined a group of Serb refugees from Croatia in ordering streets be
re-named and demanding the name of the farming village be changed from the
Croat-sounding Hrtkovci into Serbislavci, meaning 'the place of Serbs'.
Croat inhabitants of Hrtkovci last month complained to Mr Panic about being
forced to abandon their homes. They told of escalating harassment if they
refused to accept offers to swap their homes for the houses of Serb refugees
from Croatia.
One Croat was found murdered after Mr Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist
Serb leader who visited the village in July, read out a black-list of 17
people who he said had to leave the village.
If Mr Panic caves in and frees Mr Sibincic it would set an ominous precedent
for minorities in Serbia, where Serbs make up two-thirds of the population.
Meanwhile, fierce fighting continued in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
yesterday. Sarajevo radio said 22 people had been killed in the city since
noon on Saturday.
Ivo Dawnay in London writes: Mr John Major, the prime minister, will open
the London conference on Wednesday with a speech as European Community
president. His address, expected to condemn Serbian human rights abuses and
press for tighter sanctions against Belgrade, is also intended to build
bridges between the EC and the UN, whose relations have been strained by
poor co-ordination.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Accord likely in Eurotunnel dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running dispute over the cost of building the channel tunnel may be
close to settlement.
Its resolution hinges on the manner of financing the cost over-run, rather
than the size of the additional costs.
Eurotunnel's building contractors, which are grouped in the Transmanche Link
(TML) consortium, indicated over the weekend that they are within a few
weeks of settling the dispute, which in the past has threatened to bring
work on the project to a halt. The size of the settlement is likely to be
the maximum permitted without Eurotunnel making a serious breach of its
banking covenants.
That would mean Eurotunnel could make a cash payment to TML of no more than
Pounds 1bn, in historic prices as opposed to today's prices.
However, the eventual settlement is likely to be some Pounds 1.2bn. So
Eurotunnel is offering Pounds 200m - equal to about Pounds 300m in today's
prices - in some form of equity, probably a convertible debenture.
Eurotunnel has stressed that any equity issued to TML will not be equal to
more than 10 per cent of its existing equity. But TML's UK members - BICC,
Taylor Woodrow, Costain, Wimpey and Tarmac - do not want so much equity.
Once the deal between TML and Eurotunnel is agreed, it must be approved by
Eurotunnel's 206 banks. If the settlement is no more than Pounds 1bn in cash
and Pounds 200m in equity, 65 per cent of the banks as measured by the value
of their loans would have to vote in favour.
If TML were promised more, 90 per cent of the banks would have to give
approval. One of Eurotunnel's leading bank creditors said 90 per cent
approval would never be won, because a number of banks were disenchanted
with the project.
'We would hope to get 65 per cent approval,' he added. Without bank
approval, Eurotunnel would run into serious financial difficulties.
On the question of how much TML should be paid to take account of increases
in the costs of building the tunnel since its initial contract was
negotiated, the two sides are still Pounds 150m apart. However, an executive
with a close knowledge of the talks said that 'serious arguments' were
focusing on just Pounds 50m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How well did the Daily Mirror do from its biggest scoop in a decade? The
publication of the photos of the errant Duchess comes at a time when the
long-running battle between The Sun and the Daily Mirror for the title of
Britain's biggest selling daily is at a crucial stage.
In 1991 the Daily Mirror regained the number one spot, but The Sun has been
narrowing its lead lately. Last month the Mirror raised its cover price by
2p, making it more expensive than The Sun, and the latter has been merciless
in highlighting the price differential. Referring to the Mirror's former
owner, the late Robert Maxwell, The Sun has been taunting the opposition
with jibes such as 'what the Mirror coffers lack its readers are now paying
back'. The Mirror badly needs more such scoops if it's to hold its slim
circulation lead.
Carat, which specialises in buying advertising space, did a telephone survey
last Thursday, and reports that readership of the Daily Mirror had gone up
by 29 per cent on the day; circulation may have increased by 11 per cent. A
W H Smith survey of 600 newsagents found that Mirror sales had risen 17 per
cent on Thursday and the Mirror says it has been printing an extra 400,000
copies. By contrast, The Sun printed an extra 300,000 copies.
The reason for Carat's research is that its space buyers are frequently
called by newspapers promising a big story and trying to get buyers to pay
closer to rate card rates for the advertising space. But while circulation
increases are important, increased readership levels are much harder to
gauge.
So the good news is - salaciousness sells. Come to think of it, isn't that
the bad news, too?

How time flies. Russia's Central Bank is issuing 1m three-rouble coins
commemorating the democratic victory over Communist hard-liners who launched
last year's abortive coup.
Three roubles, which is less than three cents at the current exchange rate,
can buy little these days in Russia: six rides on the Moscow subway or a
newspaper. Before the coup, three roubles could buy 60 subway rides, or a
hearty lunch in a state-subsidized cafeteria.

Having difficulty finding a room in the inn? Earlier this month Observer
passed on the Welsh Tourist Board's advice on why Japanese don't like room
44. A well-travelled colleague noted that this was only a fraction of the
story.
It's not just a Japanese problem, but a Chinese one too, and the Chinese
seem to take things a whole lot further: the hotel floors 4 and 44 are often
omitted: telephone numbers with lots of '4's in them can be a blight on a
company.
On the brighter side, numbers 8 and 9 are greatly sought after, apparently
bringing immense good luck - the Chinese for 8 rhymes with the word for
'rich', and the word for 9 sounds like the word for 'long life'. In auctions
for car registration numbers in Hong Kong, numbers 8 and 9 regularly attract
immense premiums.
Steering well clear of certain numbers seems to be by no means a Chinese or
Japanese fixation: a well known Sultan, for example, has had the number of
his London pad changed from 13 to 12 1/2 . Meanwhile, another colleague
reports that some Pakistanis don't like room 420. It is often under-utilised
because the number is said to be a code for describing crooks and swindlers.
If you have any other similar travel tips, a superstitious Observer would
like to hear them.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Observer: Wilhelm joins the ANC volk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most white South Africans are deeply disillusioned with the African National
Congress these days. Hence it is rare to find a white man signing up as an
ANC member, and doubly so if his name is Verwoerd.
Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, must be squirming in his
grave to learn that grandson Wilhelm, 30, has joined the ANC. Wilhelm, who
has a theology degree, had a political 'awakening' when attending Oxford as
a Rhodes scholar, according to his wife, Melanie, who is also an ANC member.
Within the Verwoerd family, his behaviour appears even more out of
character: his father, Professor Wilhelm Verwoerd, Hendrik Verwoerd's eldest
son, is a member of the ultra-right Conservative Party. His aunt and his
grandmother have moved to Orania, a whites-only village in the remote
northern Cape where blacks are excluded, even as labourers. It was
established by Verwoerd's son-in-law, Prof Carel Boshoff.
But the family is not just split between left and right: Hendrik Verwoerd,
Jr, another Verwoerd son, has set up a rival white homeland at Morgenzon in
the Transvaal. He and son-in-law Boshoff agree that they want to live
without blacks, but Verwoerd, Jr claims the entire industrial heartland of
South Africa as his territory, while Boshoff is content to live in dusty
isolation in the Cape.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: Authority of AGM is no panacea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sceptical that Dr Maurice Gillibrand's proposals (Letters, August
11) for legislation to restore the authority of annual general meetings or
to introduce two-tier boards are significant for competitiveness.
Corporate governance is no panacea. Japanese companies win because they
manufacture quality goods at a price that people want. Meanwhile, their AGMs
are, sometimes, arguably populated by gangsters.
If AGMs are given more power, minorities able to attend could force change
against the majority. Perhaps investors should find ways to exchange ideas
and exert constructive, on-going influence.
German practices do not simply import: two-tier boards will throw sand into
the Anglo-Saxon corporate machine. Let us preserve efficiency in the unitary
board until investors act more responsibly. 'Dividend-strippers' are as bad
as greedy directors.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MOHAMAD A VAYID
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The matter with the British economy is not just government policy, nor
the position of sterling within ERM. I spent a period in London in June and
July and I can report a catalogue of difficulties.
After spending a few hundred pounds on bed linen at John Lewis in Oxford
Street, I could not have it packed for carriage on the plane. The export
department, to which I was directed, dismissed my request, saying it only
answered enquiries and executed orders from overseas.
At Debenham's, a folding table and chairs, described as being in stock and
available for quick delivery, could be delivered to an address merely 2km
away only several days later. The salesman would not even arrange, when told
that the buyer was leaving London that day, for delivery before noon.
A suit bought at Harrods needed a minor alteration and I was asked to
collect it the following week. A telephone call confirmed it was ready. But
when I went to the shop and tried it on, the work had not been done. I was
asked to return. No luck this time also: the alteration was faulty. The
third time, I was lucky. The extra taxi fares: Pounds 32.
Barclays Bank, in Putney High Street, refused to honour a draft for Dollars
500 in favour of an account holder because it had to check whether Mauritius
had 'enough foreign currency to cover this amount'. As this could take time,
the account holder presented the bank manager with a cheque from a friend
for Pounds 150 drawn on Lloyds. Told it might take five days to clear, the
account holder asked the manager to fax Lloyds to confirm the cheque was
good, offering to pay any extra charge. The manager refused.
To redeem itself, British business needs to go back to the basics of
salesmanship.

Sir, It seems incongruous that securities analysts are permitted to write
reports, presumably without direct corporate contact, during a company's
'close season'.
An altered profit forecast, without a right of reply, can have a devastating
effect on a company's market capitalisation. These regulations hardly seem
sensible, particularly for a nation that believes in fair play.
Perhaps the deafening silence from the corporate sector on this can now be
broken.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Town Hall 2, just when you thought it was safe. . .: The new
council tax threatens to worry taxpayers and their MPs almost as much as the
poll tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the bloodcurdling alien which returns periodically from apparent death
to terrorise filmgoers, local government taxation is threatening to rise
again as a political issue. The government may have believed that it had
killed off the monster of the poll tax, which threatened electoral defeat
and helped to topple Mrs Margaret Thatcher. But with just over seven months
until its final interment, terror stalks the Tory heartlands as the
unfamiliar features of the council tax come into focus.
Last week, Sir Rhodes Boyson, the former local government minister, warned
that the government was climbing 'out of one treacle well into another' in
its reform of local taxation. Rumblings on the backbenches can be expected
to grow in the run-up to the Conservative party conference in October,
particularly from MPs in southern constituencies which are expected to do
badly from the changeover.
Some of the alarm is misconceived - partly encouraged by the complex
structure of the council tax, which was carefully designed to stop
profligate councils from milking wealthier property-owners in the way that
some did under the old rating system. Homes will be allocated to one of
eight valuation bands, according to their capital value on April 1 1991. The
tax to be levied on property in the top band will be three times that on the
bottom band to avoid swingeing imposts on the well-to-do.
One consequence of this banding is a sizeable tax increase for a home which
just creeps into a higher tax band. As the figures prepared by the Chartered
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) show, a home worth about
Pounds 120,000 is likely to face an average tax bill of Pounds 657 if it is
in band E, Pounds 776 in band F. The differences in some local authorities
will be much higher than these average figures: Cipfa estimates, for
example, that the step up could be more than Pounds 150 in the highest tax
councils.
Experts in local government finance have been warning for some time that
such jumps in bills between bands will make the valuation process much more
controversial than under the old rating system, where there was a smooth
progression in values and tax bills. The government, which originally hoped
to avoid a cumbersome appeals process, has now conceded one, recognising
that it will be essential if the tax is to be seen as fair.
However, taxpayers' evaluation of the fairness of the council tax is likely
to be influenced by the fall in house prices in many parts of the country.
The first that most will know about their council tax bill will be in March
1993, when they receive a bill from their local authority based on the value
of their home two years earlier. If the value of their home has fallen in
that period, it may be difficult to convince them that they have been
correctly assessed, especially if a more up-to-date valuation would put them
in a lower band.
The government is already redrafting parts of the official notice that will
be sent out with tax bills to make it clear that valuations are based on
1991 values. But the legitimacy of the new tax may be undermined if it fails
to get across the message that, if one house in an area has dropped in value
since 1991, the others will be in a similar position.
More misleading has been the spate of press stories suggesting that such
valuation problems will mean higher council tax bills for everyone. Figures
produced last week by the Local Government Information Unit, for example,
appeared to demonstrate that the government had overestimated the value of
property in its original calculations. The conclusion drawn was that the
average tax bill would be Pounds 61 higher than predicted.
The inference, however, is groundless. The average council tax bill in any
local authority will not depend on the value of the property within it, but
on the amount the council must raise from local taxpayers to finance its
spending. That bill must be divided *something in here (HP) *
among the taxpayers, whatever the property values, and the average will not
be affected by changes in valuations.
What may change is the distribution of the tax bill across the tax bands. If
there are fewer houses than expected in the highest bands, the council tax
level will need to be higher in every band to raise the same amount of
money. With reports suggesting that this is the case, tax bills for each
band may work out higher than the government had forecast, but with more
households in the lower bands than expected.
The misunderstandings revealed by some of the early scare stories reflect
the difficulties involved in explaining the workings of a property-based tax
 -difficulties familiar to those who remember the unpopularity of the rates.
Indeed, it was the belief that the revaluation of properties in Scotland
would of itself mean higher rates bills which eventually scuppered the rates
and led to the premature introduction of the poll tax.
There are equally worrying similarities between the funding problems now
faced by the government in introducing the council tax, and those that
dogged the launch of the poll tax. It was, after all, Treasury parsimony on
the poll tax - which Mr Nigel Lawson, the chancellor, had strongly opposed -
that denied it sufficient funds to ensure that winners outnumbered losers.
Cipfa estimates that at least an extra Pounds 2.3bn will be needed to keep
average tax levels down to the figures the government estimated in its 1991
white paper on the council tax. In the absence of additional funding, the
average figures for the first year of the council tax will be 35 per cent
higher than the government's targets.
There will also be considerable variations between regions within the
overall average figures unless there is some transitional arrangement to
even out the burden. Local taxpayers who have been told that the average
council tax bill in England is to be Pounds 400 may be surprised to find
that the average in inner London will be Pounds 714 and more than Pounds 600
throughout the south-east.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is said to be pressing for a
generous settlement in this autumn's spending round. Even if the Treasury
was prepared to be generous in the introduction of the council tax, however,
the economic circumstances make it unlikely that the support needed to
guarantee a painless transition will be forthcoming.
The result will be that the scare stories based on misunderstandings will
begin to give way to worries about the level of the new tax in the run-up to
its April introduction. The council tax is likely to enter the world in
unpropitious circumstances, with its valuations undermined by falling house
prices, inadequate understanding of its workings and insufficient funds to
ease the pain. It is not a pleasant prospect for ministers who felt that
they had vanquished the alien beast of local government taxation in the
final reel of the poll-tax saga.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: The Bundesbank is led to the dock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD FLIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free
of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy
without regard to national, regional or global interests.
Whatever policy the Kohl government followed over reunification, it was
bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in
Germany. As the western German population is now aware, German reunification
needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of
eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the
east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank
would wish.
In Europe as a whole, very high real interest rates threaten to turn
recession into depression. The governments of Europe have been remarkably
patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of
European effort for greater economic and political integration. Surely there
must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter?
It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term
reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary
priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is
threatening the EMU commitment.
Beyond Europe, the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary.
But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could
afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.
Yet Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, advises there are no
grounds for a cut in Germany's interest rates. This, despite the
unreliability of German money supply data.
The German government might point out to the Bundesbank that monetary
targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than 3m unemployed
in Germany, of the destruction of the EMU programme and global depression.
A DM exchange rate adjustment within the ERM is not the answer to the
problems. We need a prolonged low-interest-rate German reunification boom.
The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a
result of Bundesbank interest rate policies. And this is aggravating
recession.
A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US Federal
Reserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economic
interest.
The governments and central banks of Europe and the G7 block - including the
Kohl administration - should pressurise the Bundesbank, and be prepared to
consider constitutional changes if necessary, to halt this idiocy.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Peace hopes and war fears: Iraq's intransigence and
Arab-Israeli talks provide opportunities for President Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of war in the Middle East will again dominate Washington's
foreign policy agenda this week, pushing into the background negotiations
that could lead to a breakthrough in the seemingly intractable conflict
between Israel and its Arab neighbours. For President George Bush, fresh
from launching his re-election campaign in Houston, it is a dual opportunity
to prove to a sceptical electorate that his qualities of international
leadership more than offset the doubts about his handling of an ailing
economy.
The issue of war is again dictated by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and
the unfinished aspects of the Gulf war. Last week in Houston Mr Bush claimed
credit for the collapse of communism and the Soviet empire, the
reunification of Germany, the staging of Middle East peace talks, and even
the improvement in race relations in South Africa. But his supposedly
greatest personal triumph, the victory over Iraq in the Gulf War, is
beginning to turn electorally sour.
President Saddam Hussein, probably with an eye on Mr Bush's re-election
campaign, has chosen this time to intensify his defiance of the conditions
imposed on him by UN Security Council resolutions at the end of the war. He
will not allow UN inspectors to visit ministries in search of evidence
relating to weapons of mass destruction; he has denied visas to other UN
staff overseeing aid efforts; and most frightening of all, he is said to be
preparing his army for another large-scale assault on the Shia population in
the south.
It is not a challenge that Mr Bush can ignore and, unlike the disaster of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, it is not one that can so easily be evaded by references
to 'quagmires' and Vietnam. Together with Britain and France, the US has
responded by planning an air security zone at the 32nd parallel below which
Saddam's aircraft will be forbidden to fly.
The details are expected to be announced tomorrow. It is aimed at delivering
a further blow to the prestige of the Iraqi leader and to offer limited
protection to people in the south, particularly in the marshes north of
Basra, where the Iraqi army finds it difficult to deploy armour and heavy
artillery.
But it is also likely to prove an open-ended allied commitment to protect
the people of southern Iraq who number more than 50 per cent of the
population. With protection already being given to the Kurds north of the
36th parallel, it brings closer the division of Iraq into three distinct
parts and the eventual involvement of the allies in the country's political
reorganisation.
Baghdad is unlikely to challenge the air ban, but if it continues to pursue
the Shia, the allies will have to decide if they are prepared to attack
Saddam's forces on the ground, increasing the risk of full-scale hostilities
against Baghdad.
An extended conflict brings wider regional repercussions. Opponents of
superpower involvement in the Gulf, such as Iran, have already warned the US
to stay away from Iraq, while Jordan and Syria, two of the participants in
this week's Arab-Israeli negotiations in Washington, have also objected to
the air exclusion zone.
Jordan and Syria will this week be attempting to gauge, along with the
Palestinians and Lebanon, just how much the peace process launched last
October in Madrid can be advanced following the June elections in Israel and
the extent to which the US remains committed to its success.
The more pragmatic approach of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new Labour prime
minister, to the demands of the Palestinians living under occupation since
1967 contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Mr Yitzhak Shamir. In
the wake of defeat, Mr Shamir admitted his aim had been to negotiate for 10
years if necessary, during which time so many Jews would have been settled
in the West Bank and Gaza that the territories would become irreversibly
part of Israel.
It was that determination to continue building settlements, considered by
the international community to be the biggest obstacle to peace, which made
the US deny Israel the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees it was seeking to
absorb new immigrants. The Labour government said from the outset that it
was prepared to freeze most new settlement building not required for
security - although it will complete more than 10,000 apartments under
construction - and wanted to negotiate within nine months a form of autonomy
for the Palestinians. On the basis of that encouraging statement, Mr Rabin
was welcomed to the US earlier this month and returned home triumphantly
with the promise of the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees.
American unwillingness to insist on a total ban on new settlements caused no
more than a temporary hesitation among the four Arab delegations about
travelling to Washington. They complained about a US tilt towards Israel,
hoped that it would resume an 'honest broker' role, but tacitly acknowledged
that proposals could emerge in Washington which will interest them.
Mr Rabin would probably like to press ahead more quickly in negotiations
with the Palestinians than with Syria, but has been told by the US that it
would be 'unhelpful' if the parallel discussions did not proceed roughly in
tandem. Israeli observers say that in spite of the improved negotiating
climate, Mr Rabin will prove especially tough on all security issues. They
note that he has retained Mr Elyakim Rubinstein as the chief negotiator with
the Palestinians, a decision designed to underline his security concerns.
But Mr Rubinstein's reappointment has been balanced by the selection of
Professor Itamar Rabinovich, an expert on Syria and a pragmatist, to lead
the team negotiating with Damascus.
Arab negotiators like to emphasise that UN resolutions lie as much at the
heart of their negotiations as they do in the conflict between Iraq and the
western allies. In the case of the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is resolutions
242 and 338, passed after the 1967 and 1973 Middle East wars, which call for
the return of territories occupied by Israel and assert the inadmissibility
of the acquisition of land by force. For Syria that means regaining control
of the Golan Heights and for the Palestinians it means achieving
self-determination in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
'Let's see now if the US will be as keen on UN resolutions affecting Israel
as it is on enforcing those on Iraq,' an Arab diplomat commented.
The core of the Israeli-Palestinian talks for the next month will be on an
interim self-governing authority in the West Bank and Gaza to administer the
territory for five years. During the final two years, negotiations will be
held on the precise borders and status of the territories. The Palestinians
tabled their concept of the Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority
(Pisga) in Washington on March 3. It is the embryo of an independent state.
'The success of the transitional process is only possible if the Pisga is
vested with all the powers of a true self-governing authority,' asserts the
Palestinian document.
The Palestinians will press for elections to a 180-member legislature,
together with a 20-member executive council and a judiciary. Israeli
officials, baulking at anything which hints at a Palestinian state, said
recently that a much smaller 'self-governing authority' would be sufficient.
Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the territories, argues that
the numbers issue is not so important. 'What we want to be sure is that the
source of authority is a Palestinian one, that the source of legality is a
Palestinian one. . . . It is not the numbers; it is the principle.'
In one important respect the assumptions underlying discussions on elections
will be very different following the change of Israeli government. Whereas
Mr Shamir was at best offering municipal elections covering about 30 per
cent of the population of the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Rabin is talking about
a poll encompassing all the territories with their population of about
1.75m.
The Palestinians, in their preparations for Washington, have formed no fewer
than 37 committees to plan for the transfer of authority over such functions
as health, education and social welfare.
The Camp David accords negotiated between the US, Israel and Egypt in 1978
and reviled at the time by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and almost
all Arab governments, provide the fullest offer made by Israel for
Palestinian autonomy and accepted 'the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people and their just requirements'. But in the nearly 14 years since then,
the number of Jewish settlers in the territories has increased to 110,000,
and the Palestinian uprising, which started late in 1987, has intensified
the bitterness on both sides.
The suggested 20,000-strong, locally recruited Palestinian police force,
operating in areas vacated by the Israeli military as envisaged in Camp
David, would be sure to be resented by militant Jewish settlers whose future
must seem less secure in the wake of Mr Rabin's electoral victory.
Syria, robbed of the security umbrella and assured arms supplies provided by
the former Soviet Union, may prove marginally more flexible in its demands
for the unqualified return of the Golan Heights. Mr Rabin is said to be
willing to discuss shared sovereignty and US troops being stationed on the
Heights. But in return Israel would insist on a full peace, a prospect that
many Israelis suspect would be too much for President Hafez al-Assad to
accept.
Few of the parties to the conflict doubt, however, that for negotiations to
have reached this stage, a massive diplomatic effort was required by the US
and in particular by Mr James Baker. And therein lies the main reason for
continued caution about the prospects for real progress. Mr Baker, who
yesterday took over as White house chief of staff, is now far more concerned
about the uphill task of getting Mr Bush re-elected than with monitoring the
peace talks.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, his acting successor at the State Department, is
unlikely to be able to devote the same time or energy to the issue. And all
the time, forcing himself on American public attention is the man Republican
party leaders refer to as the 'Baghdad bully'. They know that in the next 10
weeks he can damage the president's electoral chances far more than peace
talks can boost them. Deep in his Baghdad bunker, President Saddam Hussein
may not fully appreciate just how much Mr Bush wants his political scalp.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Georgia's statesman gets tough at home: The republic's
age-old conflicts are testing the patience of Eduard Shevardnadze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eduard Shevardnadze, whom westerners have long regarded as a conciliatory
statesman, has once again proven that he also knows the nastier side of
politics. This is not surprising. The 64-year-old former Soviet foreign
minister, who proved throughout his career that he is a realist, learned the
political ropes as Communist party boss of the former Soviet republic of
Georgia.
That is the reason, his supporters say, Mr Shevardnadze, a key member of
Georgia's current ruling presidium, sent in the tanks last week to crush
separatist Abkhazians after they kidnapped 12 of his senior officials.
'There was no way out,' says Mrs Irina Sarishvili, a Georgia State Council
member who backs Mr Shevardnadze. 'The ministers were hostage. If we didn't
send them (the tanks) in, the people would think, 'what kind of people are
you'?'
The question now is whether Mr Shevardnadze, who contributed greatly to the
remoulding the old Soviet Union, can now make the birthplace of Mr Josef
Stalin look squarely at its own internal problems and change. Despite Mr
Shevardnadze's enormous international prestige, the challenges are great.
In this task, the picturesque nation of 5.4m people, mythologised by the
Greeks, has already chosen to go it alone. It is the only former Soviet
republic outside the Baltic region not to join the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
In addition to securing the dangerous streets of Tbilisi, the capital, and
bringing home troops from the separatist regions of South Ossetia and
Abkhazia, Mr Shevardnadze must rebuild an imploding economy. Georgia's
output fell by a quarter last year, after dropping 5 per cent in 1989 and 12
per cent in 1990, and the International Monetary Fund predicts that this
year will probably be worse.
The key to economic improvement, analysts say, will be the outcome of the
October 11 elections for the republic's new parliament, which will replace
the unelected State Council. Assuming that Mr Shevardnadze retains a
leadership role, say his admirers, the silver-haired politician will enjoy
an undisputable mandate. Whether the country is to led by a prime minister
or president has yet to decided, and so Mr Shevardnadze's role after the
elections remains unclear.
At it stands, Mr Shevardnadze is just one of four members of the State
Council Ruling Presidium, where his pragmatism collides directly with the
militarism of the defence minister, Mr Tengiz Kitovani. Mr Kitovani's
detractors say he has exacerbated that violence that has debilitated Georgia
since January, when President Zviad Gamsakhurdia was deposed in a revolt by
his former allies.
'The minister of defence has great influence. He has the army under his
control. This influences the situation all over Georgia, because the army is
the strength in the country,' says Mr Ivliani Haindrava, a State Council
member and leader of the Georgian Republican party. 'We hope that the
parliamentary elections will somehow change the situation, and I think they
will.'
There is a lot to overcome. The first is the region's history. The last
eight months have shown that Georgians, as with their bretheren throughout
the former Caucasus Mountains, are quick to resort to violence to settle
political disputes - a characteristic, historians say, that is almost
unbroken in time.
Indeed, throughout the region Caucasians are fighting obscure wars. The most
prominent pits Armenians against Azerbaijanis in the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh. But there also has been violence in the autonomous region
of Daghestan, Chechenia, Nakhichevan and north Ossetia, in addition to south
Ossetian and Abkhazian battles with Georgia.
East and west Georgians have fought since at least the ninth century and,
after Mr Gamsakhurdia fled, they enthusiastically resumed a war that had
been interrupted only by the 70-year Soviet rule.
The Abkhazian conflict is a good example of the age-old disputes that have
festered in the region. The Georgian claim to the mountainous, seaside
region goes back to the fourth century BC, when Georgia was populated by the
Kolkh tribe in the west and the Iberian in the east. Abkhazian tribes
arrived only 600 years later, Soviet historians say - showing that Georgians
are legitimate heirs to the disputed western territory, not the Abkhazians,
whom the Czars and Soviets granted autonomy. The Georgians note that west
Georgians now comprise 45 per cent of Abkhazia's population, and Abkhazians
just 18 per cent.
The Abkhazians, of course, have their own reading of history, arguing that
they comprise merely 100 per cent of the population a century ago, but that
Mr Stalin changed the demographics by moving in his native west Georgians.
Even his biggest supporters concede that Mr Shevardnadze had to expect
complications if he sent troops into Abkhazia, where, among other
complaints, he said that bandits were robbing cargo trains and lorries
headed south. It was the pragmatic Mr Shevardnadze, not the better-known
conciliatory one, who acted when Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba
declared independence, and Georgian interior minister Roman Zventsadze and
11 others were abducted.
Announcing that the army would secure Abkhazia's railroads and port against
banditry, Mr Shevardnadze said nothing when Mr Kitovani proceeded to seize
the local capital outright despite resistance by Mr Ardzinba's supporters.
It was the pragmatic side of Mr Shevardnadze which also surfaced in January,
when Georgians deposed Mr Gamsakhurdia at the point of an artillery barrel.
In explaining the coup, the former foreign minister said straight-faced: 'It
was not so much a violent takeover as a conflict between an authoritarian
regime and democratic forces which were supported by armed formations.'
Many Abkhazians don't consider Mr Shevardnadze a great conciliator, and
journalists who have seen Mr Ardzinba in his stronghold of Gadauta say he is
digging in for a long fight. 'This land has been ours since 1931, but the
Georgians still think it's theirs,' says Mrs Patrulya Karbiyev, an Abkhaz
woman who was hiding in her Sukhumi home last week as Georgian troops
patrolled the streets.
Mr Shevardnadze the realist has been heard to say he has never had a tougher
job. Indeed, supporters believe he may even be forced to retain Mr Kitovani
as defence minister to avoid even worse upheaval in the future. Few expect a
stable Georgia soon.
'Georgia has no tradition of democracy, and no control over its military
forces. You can't expect us to become a highly developed, democratic country
in just two or three years,' says Mr Haindrava, the Republican Party leader.
'We must change our mentality. We need time.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / Leading Article: For richer, for poorer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE three weeks since Imperial Chemical Industries announced its proposal
to divide itself in two, outside opinion has divided itself with equal
neatness. For its admirers, the plan is a radical example of long-term
industrial strategy. For its critics, it is a transparent piece of financial
engineering. Doubtless, the plan contains elements of both. On balance, ICI
perhaps deserves the benefit of the doubt.
The critics' case is simply put. Historically, ICI has lived within its
means, rather than seeking cash from its shareholders. For whatever reason,
this has now changed. The company proposes to raise new equity, reputedly in
excess of Pounds 1bn. But ICI has for decades been bedevilled by a low stock
market rating, chiefly because of the cyclical nature of its bulk chemicals
business. Raising equity capital is thus expensive and inefficient. Drug
companies, on the other hand, enjoy high stock market ratings. The answer is
to split off ICI's drug business, load it with all the group's debt and use
its higher stock market rating to repay the debt cheaply.
Conservative culture
While this doubtless adds to the plan's appeal, it is unlikely to be the
main motive. To begin with, it would be out of character. ICI is a company
which commands respect in many ways. Few of them are financial. The
company's culture is characteristic of its industry: conservative,
inward-looking and preoccupied by technology and markets rather than
short-run financial advantage.
It is in this context that the radical nature of the demerger must be
understood. ICI, like many of its US and European rivals, represents the
classic model of the giant chemical concern. Starting a century ago, the
model progressed from basic alkalis and dyestuffs to absorb successive
technologies such as plastics, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. Some of
ICI's rivals have lately shed related businesses - Union Carbide, its
industrial gases; Monsanto, its process controls. None has taken the basic
model and carved it down the middle.
One obvious question is why not. Other chemical companies might reply that
the various parts of their business employ common research and technology.
ICI would reply that this is only partly true. Various biological and
genetic techniques apply across the fields of pharmaceuticals, seeds and
agrochemicals. They will be duly grouped together. There are links between
inorganic chemicals and polymers and between paints and explosives, which
will form the other group. Between the two groups there is little in common.
The same argument could be reversed: that no single individual in ICI fully
understands the business as a whole, from the genetic engineering of plant
seeds at one extreme, to the operation of giant ethylene crackers at the
other. ICI is in that sense a diversified conglomerate. Hanson or BTR could
doubtless run it after a fashion. ICI's own managers may lack the necessary
skills. If so, the burden of proof lies the other way: if ICI is too big to
handle, why should it stay in one piece?
Exposure to the cycle
One traditional answer would be that the different parts of the business
provide stability through the economic cycle. Bulk chemicals go from boom to
bust and back again. Agrochemicals work on a cycle of their own.
Pharmaceuticals have no perceptible cycle at all. Although this is in fact a
fair description of what has happened within ICI over the past 20 years, it
may not be relevant. Other industries - paper and pulp, for instance -
expose themselves fully to the vagaries of the cycle. The element of
stability is provided by the capital markets and the banking system.
It may not be a coincidence that the two clearest examples of outright
demerger in the UK over the past decade - Bowater and Courtaulds - have
proved successful. Bowater US remains a large paper company, while Bowater
UK is a significant force in packaging. Courtaulds Textiles has held its
own, while the remainder is a successful chemicals company. Perhaps there
really is something liberating about allowing managers to concentrate on a
business which they can comprehend. In ICI's case, it at least seems worth a
try.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Policy choice for US voters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RHETORICALLY, the choice of economic policies being offered to American
voters looks familiar. The economy needs a stimulus: the Republicans offer
tax cuts, the Democrats a large programme of public investment. Mr Bush
looks back to President Reagan, Mr Clinton to President Roosevelt; or to put
it in oppositional terms, Mr Bush wants to make the rich richer, Mr Clinton
to tax and spend.
The reality is totally different. Both programmes are based on unrealistic
arithmetic; more important, the president's proposals have no chance of
being put into action, short of a wildly improbable upset in the
Congressional elections. The real choice is whether to continue with the
contest which has kept the president and the legislature deadlocked for the
last four years, or to take the risk of an active, interventionist president
with Congressional backing - an activist who will have to learn on the job.
Despite the clear disillusion of voters, there is something to be said for
the deadlock they have so far chosen to perpetuate. Mr Bush inherited an
appalling mess - not only a huge Federal deficit, but a largely bankrupt
financial system. Keynesians might argue that it is only the deficit which
has prevented large-scale private default from pushing the US economy into a
slump. In any case, the largely unintended Bush strategy of tackling
financial reform with energy, but leaving the deficit on the back burner,
has worked out quite well.
Signs of recovery
The economy still looks flat, but thanks largely to the Federal Reserve and
a floating exchange rate, it is in fact recovering. Slow export-led growth
should continue were the president to win re-election, though as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has forecast, there
is unlikely to be much acceleration. It is not an inspiring prospect, but
the president's friend Mr John Major would settle for it.
The president's domestic frustrations have also had a welcome result. They
have driven Mr Bush into concentrating on what he knows best, the
international scene. Some of the results - continued G7 co-operation
(low-level, but better than squabbling), the Brady debt relief plan, and
most promising the North American Free Trade Area - have been bright
features in a dark scene. If Mr Bush could give Mexicans a vote, he would
win in a landslide.
At the same time it must be said that the president's domestic proposals are
ill-considered, unimaginative, and unworkable even if they were desirable.
His hurriedly promised tax cuts, a concession to his right wing, rely on
capping spending on entitlement programmes such as government health care
programmes. His opponents must wish that anyone believed this to be a
serious proposal, for it would guarantee them the votes of nearly everyone
over 50. But in fact it is simply an advance script for attacking Congress.
For the rest, the deficit would be limited by what Mr Herbert Stein, a
Republican economist, once decribed as President Reagan's one important
fiscal innovation, the asterisk - used in Reagan budgets to mark spending
cuts yet to be identified.
Clinton's plan
Mr Clinton's proposals are more carefully considered, and serve desirable
ends - an improved infrastructure, better education, welfare conditional on
willingness to work, and investment incentives for the private sector. The
package would also, according to some Wall Street analysts, give a strong
boost to activity. However, outsiders must wish that the Republican insult,
tax and spend, were more accurate.
The spending proposals are clear, but the tax proposals do not match them,
as a distinguished Democrat economist, Ms Alice Rivlin, has pointed out.
Some are also objectionable, notably the usual demagogic promise to tax
foreign corporations more heavily; and this is a suggestive mistake, as is
the heavy reliance on defence cuts. There is a disturbing streak of
isolationism and protectionism in the Democratic party, both among
grassroots supporters and such senior figures as the House majority leader,
Mr Richard Gephardt. Mr Clinton is an intelligent and pragmatic figure, and
may resist these pressures; but if he wins the voters' support, he must
expect a wary welcome in the outside world.

Very rarely do television travel programmes hit the mark - there is usually
a nagging feeling that the narrator and crew have brought the life style of
Hampstead, or, in Alan Whicker's case, Mayfair, to the part of the world
they are theoretically exploring.
You can never really forget that however shrilly the front man squeals there
are a cameraman and producer and all the comforts of civilisation close at
hand.
A new series of Traveller's Tales does little to dispel the doubts. Six
'characters' were allowed to visit a country of their choice. Nigel Farrell
kicks off with a trip on Lake Malawi.
Since the country rarely enters the news this opener sounds promising but
Farrell actually has a nice time drifting along on a lake steamer, and the
programme ends up exposing Farrell rather than the destination. (Channel 4,
9.00).
Nature Special (BBC2, 8.30) examines the last-minute attempts to save the
London Zoo by making it more environmentally friendly.
Only a late flurry of visitors in the next few weeks can produce the revenue
to enable the zoo to make the transition into a conservationist paradise.

<TEXT>
A YEAR ago the Edinburgh Festival was playing host to the leading orchestras
and opera companies from the Soviet Union when the world was shaken by the
August coup. Stories circulated of musicians refusing to believe the reports
in the Scottish evening newspapers until they had seen for themselves
pictures of Yeltsin astride a tank or Gorbachev on television returning to
Moscow.
Now the Soviet Union is gone and the Leningrad Philharmonic has returned to
Usher Hall, Edinburgh as the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. This
year's festival theme of Tchaikovsky must have made the orchestra's
participation almost select itself. The exhilaration of its performances at
the weekend will have shown that the scalding concerts given in the heat of
the crisis last year were no isolated high-point.
The playing here was brilliant and full of passion. As with any of the top
international orchestras, the St. Petersburg Philharmonic achieves a
remarkable clarity of texture and yet its sound is never transparent in a
bloodless fashion. The overall picture is of strong colours, firm outlines,
vital rhythms, with every player providing a full complement of red
corpuscles.
In Tchaikovsky's Serenade for strings the sonority of the opening (where
Tchaikovsky hit upon the then novel idea of double-stopped chording)
pulsated with vibrancy down through every part. The first violin section
also deserves a note for its unanimity in the Elegy, which could have been
the work of one player, exactly in tune, however high the part went, and
producing an impassioned singing line.
The Fourth Symphony, announced by a piercing trio of trumpets, was
hair-raising as a display of orchestral elan and power. Mariss Jansons now
exerts an even tighter grip over this symphony than when he last conducted
it London and the sense of music of such fearsome intensity just being held
in check by his iron grasp only makes the final pages, when he lets
everything rip, the more cataclysmic. These were two unforgettable
Tchaikovsky performances, which fully justified the festival's policy of
giving the well-known works a hearing too.
The pair of concerts under Jansons included two other major pieces. On
Friday Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony again presented tension screwed to its
tightest notch. No slackening of the pace is allowed in Jansons's
Shostakovich, no brooding, no letting the attention wander; and this
symphony, in which the composer was forced by political blackmail to keep
his musical vision blinkered, is the most ideal Jansons material. On
Saturday Mikhail Rudy joined the orchestra for a strong account of
Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. Where others may allow the famous main
theme to droop into spineless lyricism, Jansons set a tough, march-like
rhythmic tread in motion underneath and Rudy responded with playing equally
firm of purpose, the weighting finely judged, poetry and passion ever just
below the surface. After Edinburgh the St. Petersburg Philharmonic moves on
to the Proms. It should not be missed.
Concerts sponsored by IBM United Kingdom Ltd. and The Royal Bank of
Scotland.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: Mark Morris Dance Group - Edinburgh International
Festival
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARK Morris, one of the triumphs of this year's Edinburgh Festival, has
moved from the King's Theatre to that inimical barn, the Playhouse, to
present a sextuple bill. The move is successful. The dances project well;
the audience cheers lustily.
The programme, though it lacks the authority of Dido and Aeneas,
demonstrates Morris's awesome range. Musical accompaniment, as always with
Morris, is of high, high quality - whether with Gareth Jones conducting the
Scottish Ensemble and Schola Cantorum or with Linda Dowdell at the piano.
Five of the six works have been made in the last fifteen months.
Two of these are jewels - the slow, serene duet Beautiful Day and the fast,
furious choral dance Polka. Beautiful Day is set to the brief but haunting
cantata 'Schlage doch, gewunschte Stunde,' variously attributed to JS Bach
or G-M. Hoffmann. Alone together, a man and a woman exist in a strange, rapt
calm, caught in a spell that is larger than themselves but that includes
their own delight in each other. A bell keeps chiming in the music; each
time, one dancer 'chimes' the other's body.
Polka is many things: folk dance, war dance, Dionysiac frenzy, cartoon
explosion, polka. Barefoot, stamping, sitting, slapping, shaking heads and
hands, the dancers move in a single ring, in sliding semi-circles, in
opposed columns. Their non-stop and full-bodied attack has astounding
vehemence; and yet the 'Two to the left, two to the right' sequences also
add a dash of absurdity. As so often with Morris, something apparently
simple is utterly ambiguous. The piece seizes by its command of the music's
metre, its pulse, its force, and its incessant energy.
The evening begins with A Lake, which Morris made for the White Oak Project,
with whom it was seen in London this spring. A pure-dance work to Haydn's
second horn concerto, it is a happy introduction to Morris's world. Men
partner men, people exist as individuals and in the group, gestures and
motifs recur with curious emphasis, separate events coincide with masterly
harmony. Every bit is admirable, and the simplicity, weight, and fullness of
phrase that the Morris dancers bring to it are highly appealing (more so
than White Oak). I don't, however, 'get' it as a structure; or why it is
called A Lake.
The world of Bedtime is now sweet slumber, now tense nightmare. To three
Schubert lieder - 'Wiegenlied,' 'Standchen' (the 'Zogernd leiser' with
back-up chorus), and 'Erlkonig' handsomely sung by Lorraine Hunt - its
imagery hangs between the worlds of waking and dreaming. Children are
lulled, impressed, commanded, terrified and betrayed by parents.
The meanings of this riveting piece will surely multiply with further
viewings. In Three Preludes, Morris himself is alone with Gershwin and in
impish mood. His exceptional coordination and rhythmic mastery are evident;
so, alas, is his big, heavy bottom.
The programme ends by bringing an 'old' masterwork, Gloria (1981, revised
1984), to a British stage for the first time. How did he ever think of
setting these anecdotes, this behaviour, to this Vivaldi Gloria? This dance
shows you the highs and lows of the human spirit in bewildering array.
Individuals are disregarded and rejected - but find strength and grace by
themselves. Couples and even families fail - but soloists come together.
People lose their private selves and discover a larger energy. The mighty
shall fall flat; the lame shall dance. How Morris fits this humanist vision
so firmly to this music is his secret, and a sure sign of his genius.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: Bauhaus changes its contours - The institution embarks
on an environmental rethink / Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUNTER KOWA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH his dark, bushy beard, Rolf Kuhn, director of the Bauhaus, looks an
unlikely successor to Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe. He has inherited
the fame and the burden of an institution that revolutionised 20th century
architecture and design; today it is based in what appears, after 40 years
of neglect, a nondescript, dilapidated town in former East Germany.
The Bauhaus, however, remains Dessau's most famous building, capable of
overawing the visitor by the serene proportions of its interlocking glass
and steel structures, seemingly untouched since it opened in 1924.
The perfect exterior conceals a history that Bauhaus admirers in the west
are only now learning about. The institution is setting out on a course
which, according to Kuhn, redefines its original purpose in the social and
architectural context of the present day Germany.
Kuhn has some explaining to do, since he was appointed under the old regime
in 1988. Although a communist party member, he played a significant part in
the mass protest that swept through Dessau in November 1989. When he came to
office, the Bauhaus was still paraded as a showpiece of the heritage
preservation of which the regime boasted to the world. The further education
seminars for architects conducted at the Bauhaus for many years had had
little impact on the stifling monotony of the housing estates and new towns
built during the 1970's and 1980's in East Germany.
The regime had discovered a grudging love for the institution late in the
day - at the end of the 1960s, when Soviet scholars began to take an
interest in the left-wing traditions that enlightened the Bauhaus of the
1920s. By the time a faithful restoration of the building was under way in
1970, East Germany had begun to claim separate nationhood from West Germany.
It looked upon certain monuments and historical figures as a part of its
working class heritage, and the Bauhaus was given 'progressive' status.
During the 1950s and 1960s, the regime had taken a very different line,
calling the Bauhaus 'anti-German' (in blatant Nazi tradition) and
anti-working class to boot, while the buildings continued to languish in
their disfigured post-1933 condition.
But there are some who say that the Bauhaus after its re-opening developed
into an institution which the state failed to bring under complete control.
This view is shared by Rolf Kuhn, who set up so-called 'Walter Gropius
Seminars' two years before the collapse of the East German state. These
seminars were designed to question the validity of monotonous town planning
and repetitive building techniques.
By extension, the new Bauhaus, while retaining a museum function, has
developed the idea of an 'experimental academy' intent on the solution of
the urban problems of the region, while providing a model on a far wider
scale. Utopian ideals mix with hopes of a partial revival of the historical
Bauhaus tradition. Environmental re-thinking is now the order of the day.
Project-oriented classes, among them the first architectural design class
since the enforced closure of the Bauhaus in 1933, as well as a drama class
and an environmental class, have begun to devise schemes to restore and
revitalise old quarters of Dessau which have suffered from 50 years of
neglect. Ideas to liven up the drabness of east German tower blocks are
still being explored. No academic qualifications can be obtained, but the
Bauhaus experience is seen as an enrichment of an individual's curriculum
vitae.
Kuhn is optimistic. He points to the uncertainties of direction which
characterised the Bauhaus during the early years at Weimar. He sees the new
Bauhaus as an experiment, in which different disciplines come together to
find solutions. Kuhn and others have been remarkably successful in securing
government research grants.
The biggest windfall for Bauhaus may come if Kuhn's ambitious plans for a
co-operation with the planned Expo 2000 in Hanover are realised. Kuhn has
been canvassing a model redevelopment of the Dessau-Bitterfeld region. The
Expo organisers have shown interest in including some of his plans.
The Bauhaus wants to revitalise the region, among the most heavily polluted
in Europe (blighted by a moribund carbo-chemical industry, open-cast coal
mining and record levels of unemployment with resulting widespread social
deprivation) along environmentally conscious lines. Architecture and urban
renewal, not least the restoration of many historical working-class housing
estates, are seen as a part of this process, together with the development
of 'soft tourism' which is to reawaken interest in the very considerable
landscape assets of the region.
Kuhn has named this project the 'industrial garden dominion'. To him, this
is not a paradox, because Dessau was the centre of landscape improvement as
pioneered by the enlightened 18th century Dessau court and of the German
industrial revolution at its peak around 1900.
If the Bauhaus of the 1920s served the latter, the new Bauhaus, says Kuhn,
has the task of wedding industrial progress and environmental consciousness.
It remains to be seen if 'Bauhaus' can be a meaningful label attached to an
institution which has gone through so much fundamental change.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: International visual arts venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council has spent the last few years desperately trying to shed
clients, so it is something of an event that it will this week announce a
brand new arts venture which will cost nearly Pounds 400,000 a year in
subsidy once it is up and running.
The Institute of New International Visual Arts, or INIVA, will be an arts
centre dedicated to promoting contemporary artists from Africa, the
Caribbean and Asia. As well as gallery space there will be education,
research and publishing facilities.
Already Pounds 277,000 has been committed, including Pounds 47,000 from the
London Arts Board, to develop the idea and to get the creative work underway
while the search goes on for the disused factory, or empty warehouse, or
even purpose built structure, which will be home to INIVA.
Originally Kings Cross was the favoured location but now the Arts Council is
talking to Lambeth, and Kensington and Chelsea Councils, both of which have
received City Challenge money from the Government. A local authority will
ideally supply the building while the Arts Council meets the running costs.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Arts: The Provoked Wife - New End Theatre, Hampstead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR John Vanbrugh (1664-1726) was the architect of Castle Howard and
Blenheim. He also wrote a number of plays, of which The Relapse with its
memorable character of Lord Foppington, previously Sir Novelty Fashion, and
The Provoked Wife remain the best known.
The Relapse was performed first - at Drury Lane in 1696. The Provoked Wife
was performed next, but may have been written earlier - possibly when the
young Vanbrugh was a soldier-prisoner in the Bastille. Nobody is quite sure
about the origins of the play.
Anyway, both works are among the best of English drama. The Provoked Wife is
playing now at the New End Theatre in Hampstead.
As a play, it declines as it goes on, but does so from a very high level.
The subject is what to do about an unsatisfactory marriage at a time when
the divorce laws were considerably less flexible than today. Vanbrugh's
conclusion seems to be that there is nothing very much that can be done, at
least until the law is reformed, but there are nevertheless some wonderful
lines and situations along the way.
Sir John Brute (played by John Ashton) confesses at once that anything
touched by his wife turns him off.
Lady Brute (Corinna Richards) sacrifices some of the sympathy she might
deserve by openly admitting that she married him only for money. Provoked by
Sir John's debauchery, she sets off in pursuit of an affair of her own.
There is also a sub-plot. Lady Fancyfull, the female equivalent of Lord
Foppington in The Relapse, believes that she is the greatest beauty in
London and is teasingly wooed by the handsome, but poor, Heartfree. 'Your
vanity, madam,' he tells her, 'I take to be about eight degrees higher than
any woman's in the town.'
Plot and sub-plot, servants and mistresses, all eventually come together as
Heartfree falls for Lady Brute's niece, Bellinda.
But forget about the structure. The Provoked Wife is one of the few English
sexual comedies, past or present, where the bulk of the dialogue takes place
not between male and female, but instead with men talking to men and women
to women.
The best example is Lady Brute talking frankly to Bellinda (Caroline
Lintott) about how to woo men. There is also Carol Holt's Lady Fancyfull
talking to her French maid (Adrienne Swan) who replies mainly in French and
has a more worldly attitude than the English.
The male discussions are pretty open as well, not least between Heartfree
and Constant (Jon Harris) who has been wooing Lady Brute for two years
without success.
The difference between the two of them, Heartfree tells him, is that 'I
persuade a woman she's an angel; she persuades you she's one.'
Apart from the comedy and farce, there is a serious play trying to get out
which must have had an influence on, among others, Oscar Wilde. The writing
is fine throughout; almost architecturally so.
The original text was subject to some censorship. In his main drunken scene,
when he was taken before the magistrate, Sir John was dressed as a parson. A
version appeared later with him dressed instead in his wife's gown. This
revised version may have removed some clerical satire, but it provides more
recognisable humour. The later version is rightly played here, though
neither has a great deal to do with the theme.
At the end, the Brutes come together again, but it remains ambiguous whether
they will stay so, or indeed whether Constant will give up his pursuit.
Production is by Tina Marshall and direction by Jonathan Best. The set is
almost bare, but the absence of trappings takes nothing away from the play.
Earlier this year, I praised Pirandello's As You Desire Me at the same
venue. If this standard is maintained, the New End Theatre will be catching
up with the Bush and the Gate as small theatres that must be watched.
New End Theatre, Hampstead until September 13. (071) 794 0022

FT  24 AUG 92 / People: Bolland moves up - Press Complaints Commission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the midst of what is proving to be an eventful summer for the Press
Complaints Commission, 29-year-old Mark Bolland, who has served as deputy
director since the turn of the year, has been promoted into the vacant hot
seat.
The PCC, set up at the beginning of 1991 in accordance with recommendations
of the Calcutt report on privacy and the press, initially took over the
resources - from staff to desks - of the old Press Council. The previous
director Ken Morgan left at the end of December, and now the council is
peopled almost entirely with new faces.
Bolland had worked for PCC chairman Lord McGregor, who is 71 tomorrow, at
the Advertising Standards Authority; he joined the PCC a year ago. He had
previously been on the marketing side for IBM, and has also spent a stretch
with a Toronto public affairs consultancy.
McGregor says Bolland had been told he would be considered for the
directorship after a year as deputy, but that he had 'been so good and
effective, particularly in dealing with the staff' that he was promoted
early.
The ASA experience is relevant, according to McGregor, 'to the extent that
both are self-regulatory bodies that have to enforce a code of practice
framed by the industry and not by the self-regulatory body itself'.
This autumn Sir David Calcutt is to reconsider the question of whether a law
of privacy is desirable, and is expected to report to the government around
Christmas. In the course of this he will be examining how effective the PCC
has been since it was created.

The troubled jewellery chain Ratners has persuaded David Wellings, managing
director of the Cadbury Schweppes confectionery business, to join the board
as a non-executive director, thus giving the company three part-time
directors when Sir Victor Garland retires at the forthcoming agm.
'I am not terribly interested in the kind of company where it is a question
of sitting at the back of a Rolls-Royce,' says Wellings concerning his
appointment at the loss-making company which has yet to recover from Gerald
Ratner's description of one of its products as 'total crap'. 'Rather than
coasting along on someone else's success, it is a much more attractive
proposition actually to be able to do something,' he says.
He says that jewellery and sweets share both the seasonality - a huge
pre-Christmas bulge - and, to some extent, the element of impulse buying. He
also believes that, with his experience in confectionery display, he can
perhaps encourage the company 'to think in other directions' as to how it
arranges its shops.
Wellings, 51, has known James McAdam, who stepped in as Ratners' chairman in
January, since they met when advising the London Region Post Office in the
mid 1980s.

After four years marketing jet fuel to airports worldwide, John Auld faces
the challenge of marketing to a different type of consumer as he takes over
as managing director of Kuwait Petroleum (GB).
Auld is not entirely new to the job. He was managing director of Ultramar's
UK marketing arm Ultramar Golden Eagle when it was one of five companies
acquired in 1987 by Kuwait Petroleum, which had recently started to develop
a UK marketing operation.
As the most experienced manager from the largest of the acquisitions, Auld
became acting managing director of Kuwait Petroleum (GB) for five months,
before being offered the chance of heading Kuwait Petroleum International's
aviation company.
He has 22 years of petroleum experience, beginning with Occidental, before
13 years with Ultramar. He returns to a company which has expanded rapidly
since 1987.
'I am very excited that someone else has done all the groundwork,' he says.
'It will be enjoyable for me to be able to focus on one country, after
running a business with activities all over the world.'
Auld takes over from Brian Stanley, who becomes managing director of Kuwait
Petroleum (Denmark).

FT  24 AUG 92 / Management: Redefining the three Rs - American employers are
becoming more demanding of their workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two things are clear in the debate over the quality of American workers. The
first is that employers are worried about the abilities of their employees;
the second is that they are not sure what is wrong. 'They do not know what
the hell they are talking about. That's the problem,' says Arnold Packer,
director of a government inquiry into the skills that employers demand from
workers.
Even employers agree with that criticism. 'Most employers are not very
sophisticated about what they want from workers. They only know it when they
see it,' says Renee Lerche, Ford's manager of employee development.
Corporations complain of a range of problems from literacy and numeracy, to
poor reasoning ability, and difficulty in working in teams.
Such complaints are not prompted by falling skills standards among
employees. The young workers about whom employers worry have on average
achieved more at school than those they accepted without complaint in the
1970s. Average scores in the Scholastic Aptitude Test for school-leavers
rose in the 1980s after falling in the previous two decades. The problem
comes from changing employer demands. Two trends in skill demands can be
distinguished:
One trend is a growth in demand for more highly-educated workers - in
particular a boom in middle-level technician jobs such as paralegals (legal
assistants) and medical technicians. There is expected to be a 76 per cent
growth in the number of paralegal jobs in the US between 1985 and the turn
of the century.
Stephen Barley of Cornell University says this shift is caused partly by
aspects of managerial work being given to technical support workers, and
partly by mechanisation in plants and offices. This cuts the number of
low-skilled jobs but requires more technicians to supervise machines. Most
of these new technical jobs require further education for a two-year degree
at an institution such as a community college.
A second trend is broader requirements for workers with basic levels of
education. An example is the entrance test for workers at New United Motor
Manufacturing (NUMMI) in Fremont, California. Although NUMMI does not
require assembly workers to have high school diplomas, it tests recruits on
their ability to work together by asking them to take part in mock group
discussions about production problems and planning.
This shift in skill requirements has several strands. One is the increased
need for problem-solving: devolvement of authority to lower levels in
organisations demands greater intellectual skills in entry-level workers. A
second strand involves attitudes. The belief that applicants lacked the
attitude to adapt to the workplace was easily the most common complaint by
employers in a 1990 National Association of Manufacturers survey.
Peter Cappelli, co-director of the National Centre on the Educational
Quality of the Workforce at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the
requirement for employees to work in teams means that organisations are more
concerned about workers being disciplined and committed to achievement. 'If
you reduce supervision and monitoring, bad work attitudes tend to show up
more clearly,' he says.
Such changing needs for workers with high school education can be seen by
looking at training and re-education programmes run by US companies over the
past five years. Large employers including Polaroid and Digital Equipment
have spent considerable sums upgrading the skills of adult workers. They
have been prompted by both skill shortages, and a tradition of investing in
current workers rather than hiring others.
Such employers have been forced to define more precisely what they now want
from workers. This has happened at Polaroid's camera assembly plant in
Norwood, Massachusetts. Two hundred and twenty assembly line workers there
have just completed courses in reading, writing and arithmetic.
Many of the workers involved in what Polaroid calls the hardware apprentice
programme are first generation immigrants from Haiti or the Cape Verdean
islands. The change in work organisation required them to work happily
together and take responsibility for quality control on their section.
Managers estimate the jobs now require formal education probably only
equivalent to the sixth grade level - the standard of an intelligent
12-year-old.
Yet Polaroid believes it would have been impossible to ask the employees to
work successfully in teams and solve basic assembly problems if they had not
taken the lessons. Jim Mahoney, the plant's manufacturing manager, says the
assembly line job in its new form needs workers to make presentations and
participate in team meetings. 'Without the education, it would simply have
been a waste of time to send them on team-building courses,' he says.
Acquanetta Farrell, Polaroid's director of technology readiness, argues that
public schools are now failing to prepare students for even the most basic
jobs. 'In the classroom, they are told to sit down, fold their hands and
shut up. Then when they leave we suddenly ask them to work together in teams
and participate in making things run,' she says.
Digital Equipment has had a similar experience at its software manufacturing
plant in Westminster, Massachusetts. As part of a switch to team working,
employees from engineers to shopfloor workers have been offered re-education
in the past four years. The company believes the gains from this are hard to
quantify, but it has improved quality and output at the same time as cutting
the workforce from 830 to 690.
'People have much more confidence and sense of self-control and leadership,'
says Barbara Sinisgalli, the plant planning and development manager. She
argues that there is a strong correlation between the level of education and
the ability to work with other people and contribute to innovation and
quality improvement.
The result of experiments such as those at Polaroid and Digital is that many
US corporations are now questioning whether US high schools could provide
better basic education for work. Employers in some school districts have
started trying to define better the requirements of new jobs. Fort Worth
Independent School District in Texas has carried out extensive job analyses
in local companies to find out what pupils should be taught.
The biggest federal effort has been the Secretary's Commission on Achieving
Necessary Skills (Scans) inquiry, headed by Packer, which issued its final
report in April. The inquiry concluded that employees now had to have the
ability to work with others and analyse information, in addition to basic
thinking and reading skills. It found that teaching methods in most US
schools were ill-suited to produce these new abilities.
Packer argues that the broader range of skills needed by employers means
workers need to be taught how to analyse and debate in high school, and not
just in colleges. But he does not underestimate the size of the challenge
this presents to educators. 'We are asking everyone to re-examine something
they thought was settled long ago,' he says.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Management: Grandmother's footsteps in Europe - Christopher
Lorenz urges slow cross-border integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago IBM, with its eye very much on the need for cross-border
integration ahead of 1993, unveiled a far-reaching European reorganisation.
The strategy of the computer giant's move was eminently sensible: in
essence, it consisted of a decentralisation around Europe of most of the
regional responsibilities long exercised by IBM Europe's headquarters in
Paris. But, from the very start, the precise pattern of the restructuring
looked too neat and textbookish to be true.
In a set of patent political compromises, the HQ's regional responsibilities
were parcelled out to the general managers of the four largest country
organisations. With a new European title to his name, each took charge of
strategy for one or two types of product or system, and one or two customer
sectors. The chairman of IBM Germany gained mainframe computers plus
manufacturing industry; his French counterpart got telecommunications,
'professional and technical services' (including maintenance and systems
integration), software and IBM's internal computing systems; Italy took over
mid-range machines, scientific computers and government and the public
sector; while the boss of IBM UK took charge of personal computers and
'Unix' open systems products, as well as the banking and financial services
sector.
Sure enough, within a year two aspects of the neat reorganisation had to be
reversed in rather embarrassing circumstances because they had proved
inappropriate. First, responsibility for PCs was transferred back from the
UK to IBM Europe; then the latter also reassumed professional and technical
services from the French organisation. The principle of some businesses
being run centrally was thereby reasserted.
To most IBM insiders, this episode pales into insignificance compared with
last summer's much more dramatic reorganisation of IBM worldwide into a
number of arm's length product/systems businesses and marketing/service
units. But to the outside world it typifies the dangers of trying to create
every aspect of a pan-European organisation too rapidly and too neatly.
The risks of doing so are underlined by four McKinsey consultants - though
without any reference to IBM - in an article called 'Creating European
organisations that work', published in the latest issue of the McKinsey
Quarterly*.
Experience shows, say the consultants, that the best way to Europeanise is
to shift power gradually (a tactic which IBM had been following until 1990).
Most successful efforts focus initially on only a few 'lead functions',
where the need is most apparent and urgent and where good early results can
cause a ripple effect which gradually overcomes nationalistic attitudes and
practices.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the American consumer goods group, did this by introducing
a 'Eurobrand' concept to bring national product managers together in a task
force to thrash out common brand requirements. In another food company, the
key lever was a manufacturing task force, and a freight company set up a
pricing task force.
But only when such groups get down to nuts-and-bolts practicalities does
commitment to a common European vision - and actual co-ordination  - really
start to develop, say the consultants. In addition to its main objective,
the pricing task force also uncovered a need for better cross-functional
co-ordination on such issues as sales management, product labelling and
packaging, and distribution.
When it actually comes to realigning the power structure 'short cuts do not
work', warns the McKinsey team. Simply imposing a functional 'head of
Europe' frequently proves ineffective because such people do not have power
over - and respect from - the various national operations.
When a German company appointed a European operations manager, it left
control of production in the hands of its product managers in Germany. So
sales and marketing companies elsewhere in Europe found they were better off
ignoring the new Euro-manager and continuing to deal direct with Germany.
One obvious approach, as at IBM, is to give the managers most threatened by
prospective changes part of the responsibility for planning and executing
them.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Economics: Better news on UK deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's visible trade deficit deteriorated only marginally in June and
mainly because of a reduced oil surplus. But the small change masked a sharp
fall of 3.5 per cent in the value of exports which was mostly, but not
entirely, offset by weaker imports.
Today's figures from the Central Statistical Office are forecast to show a
small narrowing of the visible trade deficit even though the recent trend
has been for imports to grow faster than exports.
In France, second quarter GDP figures are out on Friday. The forecast is for
almost flat growth after a 1.1 per cent rise in output in the first quarter,
when France was one of Europe's fastest growing economies.
This week could be difficult for the US authorities if the dollar continues
to come under pressure. Although there are relatively few sensitive
statistics out this week, the Conference Board's consumer confidence survey
out tomorrow is important.
If it does not show signs of life the dollar could suffer further losses and
the forecast is for only a marginal increase from 61.0 in July to 61.9 in
August.
The following are some of the other economic events of the week. The figures
in brackets are the median of analysts forecasts and come from MMS
International, a financial information company.
Today: UK, July current account (Pounds 700m deficit), July visible trade
(Pounds 900m deficit); Canada, July department store sales (flat); New
Zealand, July trade balance.
Tomorrow: US, July existing home sales, August consumer confidence (61.9),
car sales August 11-20 (6.2m); Canada, June wholesale trade (up 0.6 per
cent), June employment earnings (up 3.1 per cent); Australia, skilled
vacancies in the second quarter.
Wednesday: US, July durable orders (up 0.5 per cent), July durable
shipments; France, July trade balance (FFr1.5bn surplus); UK, July net new
mortgage commitments (3.2bn); Australia, July manufacturing production
statistics, July motor vehicle registrations (down 5.5 per cent).
Thursday: US, preliminary GDP figures Q2 (up 1.6 per cent), preliminary GDP
deflator Q2 (up 2.4 per cent), after tax corporation profit Q2 (up 6 per
cent), initial claims for week ended august 15 (403,000), July export price
index, July import price index, money supply data for week ended August 17;
Australia, Q2 earnings; Japan, July retail sales (down 2.4 per cent on
year), July industrial production (up 1.7 per cent).
Friday: US, July personal income (up 0.3 per cent), merchandise trade Q2,
July bank credit; UK, Confederation of British Industry monthly trends
survey; France GDP Q2 (up 0.1 per cent); Australia, net foreign debts Q2,
company profits Q2, private sector stocks Q2; Japan, July unemployment rate,
August consumer prices index - Tokyo (up 1.9 per cent on year), excluding
perishables (up 2.2 per cent on year), July CPI - nation (up 2 per cent on
year), excluding perishables (up 2.3 per cent on year).
During the week: Germany, preliminary figures for August cost of living (up
0.1 per cent on month, up 3.4 per cent on year), July import prices (down
0.5 per cent on month, down 3.4 per cent on year); France, July unemployment
rate (10.3 per cent); Belgium, August CPI (up 2.5 per cent); Italy, July
hourly earnings (up 3.6 per cent), July bank lending (up 14.5 per cent),
June PSBR, July trade balance (L0.5trillion deficit); Switzerland, August
Geneva CPI, August Basel CPI.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Courtship in the land of the giants: A look at the prospects
for a GMB/TGWU merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general workers' union, is not
the shy, retiring type. He is quick to express his views and rarely allows
himself to be overshadowed by other union leaders.
Imagine, then, the surprise of the union's 863,000 members to see the
prominence given to Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary of the TGWU
general union, in the first four issues of Direct, the GMB's glossy new
monthly magazine.
Each issue has carried at least one picture of the TGWU leader and one
printed four images of him to accompany an interview in which his views on a
wide range of issues were given a generous airing.
The explanation can be found in the courtship which has emerged this year
between the GMB and TGWU. The GMB has used promotion of Mr Morris's views to
gauge its members' views of him, of the TGWU and, most important, of a
possible merger.
The word from the union's headquarters in Wimbledon, south-west London, is
that the reaction to Mr Morris has been favourable.
That is just as well. It now seems almost certain that merger talks will
begin later this year. That does not make amalgamation a certainty, but for
the first time it seems a strong possibility.
If industrial logic was the only criteria amalgamation would have taken
place years ago.
As general unions, the GMB and TGWU organise in similar and, in many cases,
the same industries. They both have substantial memberships in local
government, and non-engineering areas of manufacturing such as plastics,
chemicals, glass, and food. Together they claim about 95 per cent of the
unionised part of the clothing and textiles industry.
In many companies officials of both unions attend the same meetings with
employers, represent the same kind of workers, often unskilled, and argue
the same points. Merger supporters point out that thousands of working
hours, paid for by the unions, could be saved by sending one official to the
meetings rather than two.
There is scope for rationalisation of office space. Both unions have offices
in virtually all large towns and declining membership means that some are
already underused.
There are, however, powerful cultural and political differences between the
unions which will make amalgamation discussions difficult, and may
eventually scupper them.
In the TGWU shop stewards wield considerable influence and the executive,
which is made up of lay members, is left of centre. At the GMB the
officials, negotiators and regional officials are more dominant and power is
concentrated in fewer hands. Mr Edmonds tends to get his way far more than
recent TGWU general secretaries have at their union.
His politics and those of the union are right of centre in the Labour party.
The TGWU has embarrassed party leaders several times in recent years, over
issues including nuclear disarmament, while the GMB has been a model of
loyalty.
The political and cultural differences, with fierce competition to recruit
members from similar groups of workers, meant that until just a year ago the
possibility of a merger had never been seriously raised. Two developments
have changed the climate.
First, all unions have experienced financial difficulties as the membership
rolls have declined, few more so than the TGWU which last year spent Pounds
11m more than its income.
Backed by hefty assets, the TGWU's future is not in danger, especially as
monthly operating deficits have been significantly lowered and possibly
eliminated.
But the financial difficulties have concentrated minds as to whether
resources would be improved if a powerful merger partner could be found.
The second development has been the merger of the AEU engineers and EETPU
electricians to form the AEEU, and the likely amalgamation of Nalgo, Nupe
and Cohse public-sector unions.
For more than 60 years the 1.1m-strong TGWU has prided itself on being
Britain's largest union and in recent years the GMB has been chasing it
hard. Next year both will be overtaken by Unison, the Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse
amalgamation, which will have 1.5m members.
'Where do we general unions go?' says one GMB official. 'The danger is that
the we will be squeezed hard when we try to recruit members, both in
manufacturing, by the AEEU, and in the public services by Unison.'
As recruitment becomes increasingly difficult, the TGWU and GMB's best hopes
of growth are through mergers. Other unions that may seek partners in the
next few years include the Usdaw shop workers, the Ucatt construction
workers and perhaps even the MSF general technical union.

The number of new pay deals between 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent has grown to
19 this month while the number of 5 per cent to 5.9 per cent rises stands at

national agreements of 2.5 per cent in the construction sector.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACK CUNNINGHAM, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday firmly countered
an attack from Labour leftwingers that the leadership has been 'clueless'
and slow in pressing international issues, Ivo Dawnay writes.
He described a highly critical editorial in the latest issue of Tribune
newspaper and an accompanying article by Ms Clare Short, a fellow
frontbencher, on the party's response to the Bosnian crisis as 'ill-informed
and wrong'.
He said Labour's foreign affairs team had repeatedly castigated the
government's slow response to the Balkan conflict, alongside its
parsimonious attitude to aid and its misguided approach to exiles and asylum
seekers.
Mr Cunningham insisted that the party leadership would discuss this week
whether Labour should demand a recall of parliament to discuss the former
Yugoslavia and Iraq. He added that on the Bosnian question the issues were
difficult and complex, while the most important objective was to end
hostilities.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Bacteria to cleanse water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACTERIA ARE being encouraged to breed in UK water supplies in an attempt to
remove iron particles and comply with European Community directives on water
quality, Tim Burt writes.
The scheme, the first move away from the chemical cleansing of water
supplies in Britain, has been launched in southern England by Three Valleys,
a subsidiary of Generale des Eaux of France.
The company is breeding bacteria to absorb the iron and manganese that is
common in underground water sources in southern England and East Anglia.
In many areas the iron content exceeds EC limits.
Officials at Three Valleys say the bacteria are 78 per cent more efficient
than chlorine in removing iron. They expect cost savings of more than 10 per
cent at the first plant to use the system, at Roydon in Essex.
Other water companies are understood to be considering the scheme following
warnings from industry executives last week that the cost of complying with
EC directives on water quality could exceed Pounds 60bn.
Independent scientists have also welcomed the scheme. Dr Brent Knox-Holmes,
a research scientist at Sheffield University, said: 'The process of using
naturally occurring organisms to absorb harmful materials has multiple
applications.'
Other water companies have experimented with using bacteria but the Three
Valleys scheme is the first on stream, according to officials at Biomechanic
Environmental, the Midlands company which specialises in biological water
processes.
Three Valleys introduced the bacterial process - pioneered in France - as
part of a Pounds 3.5m investment at Roydon. It has been encouraged by the
bacteria's appetite for iron.
Untreated water in the area has an iron content of about 2 milligrams per
litre. This is reduced to 0.02mg by filtering out the heterotroph and
autotroph bacteria before the water is fed into the domestic supply system.
The EC limit on iron content is 0.2mg per litre.
The company has abandoned water chlorination at Roydon in favour of
bacteria, which it says are more environmentally friendly.
Mr Mike Gerrard of General Water Processes, which installed the system,
admitted the scheme was 'outside what is normal for the UK water industry'
but said there had been inquiries from other companies. 'We will be
tendering for other plants. Anglia Water has similar problems as do other
companies in the south-east,' he said.

FT  24 AUG 92 / AEEU may face split affiliation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AEEU engineering and electrical union could have one section in the
Trade Union Congress and one section outside, according to a confidential
report for today's meeting of the TUC's finance and general purposes
committee.
The committee will discuss the dispute over the re-admission of the former
EETPU electricians' union via a merger with the former AEU engineering
union. The dispute over the electricians, expelled in 1988 for refusing to
obey TUC rulings, will also feature at next month's trade union congress.
Both sections of the AEEU will vote in April on whether to remain in the
TUC, in the case of the engineers, or rejoin in the case of the
electricians. A clear majority for TUC membership is expected.
Several unions want to place conditions on the return of the electricians,
including the giving up of members belonging to break-away groups from the
National Union of Journalists, the Fire Brigades Union and the Prison
Officers Association.
If those conditions prove too onerous for the electricians it seems it could
remain in the AEEU but outside the TUC. The TUC's legal adviser has said
that the two sections remain sufficiently independent to affiliate
separately.
Meanwhile, the TUC today publishes the final agenda for this year's congress
and the general council's report.
The report stresses that the TUC must focus its operations from the current
17 priorities to just six. The two most immediate are a campaign for full
employment and the establishment of an employee's charter laying down a set
of minimum rights at work.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Freight companies expect sharp increase in business
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK FREIGHT and distribution companies expect a sharp increase in business -
particularly export business - in the coming year, according to a survey by
European Freight Management, a Financial Times newsletter.
Sixty two per cent of the organisations questioned said they expected export
and domestic business to increase. Only 52 per cent said they expected
import business to make gains. This would be an improvement on the past 12
months, when 48 per cent of the companies questioned saw an increase in both
export and domestic business and only 30 per cent reported more import
trade.
The survey shows a marked difference in the outlook of large freight and
distribution companies - those with more than 1,000 employees and which
carry out most of the business. They pre-dicted continuing depressed
domestic and import conditions. Only 45 per cent of these large
organisations expected an increase in this type of trade in the next 12
months. But 73 per cent of the large organisations suggested their export
business would increase.
Only 36 per cent of the large companies reported an increase in import
business in the past 12 months. Domestic business increased for 55 per cent
and export business for 73 per cent.

FT  24 AUG 92 / 'Heads buried in the sand' over VAT rules: A look at EC
changes facing importers and exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME IS running out for importers and exporters faced with meeting tough new
European Community value added tax regulations from January 1.
With four months to go, revenue authorities across the Community fear that
many - perhaps most - companies have yet to take steps to change their
business systems to satisfy the requirements.
The new regulations will affect every company in the Community that imports
or exports goods. They comprise a series of interim measures designed to
bridge the gap between current national arrangements and a harmonised,
Community-wide VAT system planned for 1997. They are designed to do away
with the paperwork that causes delays at border crossings.
They make mandatory a series of new reports, including comprehensive
statistical records of the movements of goods and lists of sales to
companies in the Community.
Customs and Excise said: 'People seem to have been burying their heads in
the sand, hoping the problem would go away. It will not go away and for some
companies it may already be too late to make the deadline.'
Customs and Excise says that about 140,000 UK companies trade with other EC
countries each year and a further 420,000 believe they will be trading with
other Community countries within three years. Yet most have not started to
modify their computer systems to enable them to generate the new reports.
Software specialists are warning that they may have underestimated the time
needed to make the changes.
The UK has moved faster than mainland Europe to create and to comply with
the legislation. Yet of 30,000 UK companies that will have to submit the
most detailed statistical returns, only 3,000 have sought clarification of
what is expected of them. The consequence for companies inadequately
prepared for the changes will be costly. If they are unable to generate VAT
data from their computer systems they will have to compile the information
manually, or employ a clearing agent or accounting consultancy. Failure to
satisfy the authorities could lead to fines or - in the case of failure to
provide accurate statistics - criminal charges. Customs and Excise has made
clear that it will be lenient with companies making errors in the first year
of the transitional period.
Some experts believe that compiling the information manually would be
expensive and time-consuming. They do not think it is a viable option for
companies with significant cross-border trade. Some companies already use
clearing agents to prepare the single administrative document which
accompanies exports and which will be swept away by the changes.
A few UK companies, among them British Steel, Kingfisher Group, and Marks
and Spencer, are well advanced with their preparations. British Steel has
been working on changes to its computer systems since the middle of last
year. Mr James Whitfield, British Steel's director of financial services,
said the company had up to 100 people working on the project. 'It cuts
across all the functions in the company,' he said.
In spite of the early start, Mr Whitfield cannot guarantee the system will
be complete by January 1, principally because final details of the
legislation have yet to be settled: 'To that extent, we are working in the
dark,' he said.
A number of UK software companies are developing software to handle the
changes, but companies will not be able to solve the difficulty simply by
buying and installing a software package.
The packages need data to process and that can only be generated
economically by making changes to a company's basic accounting software.
Mr Richard Collier-Keyward of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand said UK
companies were aware of the legislation but had failed to warn their
computer managers of the changes that would be required. 'About 50 per cent
will get it right in January and the rest will muddle through - at a cost,'
he said.
Problems for companies and VAT authorities are compounded by the fact that
each country is at a different stage in preparing its legislation. By July 1
this year only Denmark and the Republic of Ireland had passed legislation
while Italy and Greece had not even produced a draft law.
The consequences of VAT legislation for business computing will be dealt
with in the next issue of Software at Work to be published with the FT on
September 11.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Anger over N Ireland's energy costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE ENERGY users in Northern Ireland have condemned electricity price
rises that have been agreed by the authorities shortly before the planned
privatisation of the province's electricity supply industry.
The Action Group on Northern Ireland Electricity Prices, which includes many
of the larger industries in the province, says the tariff will mean
increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, in addition to the 18 per cent
price differential which exists between Northern Ireland and the mainland.
Mr Michael Oliver, manager of Blue Circle's Northern Ireland operations,
said: 'We're incensed by this. We cannot understand it in a recession. It
can only mean that we shall have to lay people off.' Mr Oliver said he was
taking the matter up with the government.
The new tariff was approved by Offer, the electricity regulator, as part of
the approach to the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity in
November. It was designed to give NIE a sufficient rate of return to reflect
the higher cost of power in the province.
Electricity has traditionally been more expensive in Northern Ireland
because of the shortage of locally produced fuels and its heavy dependence
on imported oil. The new pricing formula will, however, oblige NIE to raise
its prices at less than the rate of inflation in future.
The province's Department of Economic Development said the new tariff would
be introduced gradually and would not result in price rises for all
consumers. It said some companies, which it declined to name, might see
prices fall.
Following the sale of Northern Ireland's four power generators earlier this
year the forthcoming privatisation will consist of Northern Ireland's power
distribution network. It will be sold in one piece and the intention is to
introduce more competition in time by linking the province's grid to those
of the Irish republic and Scotland.

FT  24 AUG 92 / More building society branch cuts forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER BUILDING society branches might be shut following the planned
closure of 10 out of 245 branches of the Britannia, a building society
executive warned yesterday.
The Britannia closures, which will mean the loss of about 150 jobs, were
announced at the weekend. The society is the ninth largest.
Mr Ken Scott, marketing manager of Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-largest
society, said he could not see how the industry could continue supporting
the current number of branches.
'The strains are very apparent everywhere,' he said. Mr Scott added that
Bristol &amp; West itself had no plans to close any of its 186 branches.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the sixth-largest society, said it had closed about 12
branches this year but had done so without compulsory redundancies. It said
the situation of smaller branches was constantly under review in most large
societies.
Two of the largest societies, Halifax and Leeds Permanent, both denied
planning any branch closures.
Leeds Permanent said: 'We bit the bullet two years ago and closed 60
branches. It looks as though the recession is forcing other people to go
through the same process.'
Building society branches most at risk of closure tend to be small ones on
the edges of large towns, which act as satellites for the main local branch.
These are expensive to maintain and generate relatively little additional
income for societies.
Societies say that where closure of a small branch is inevitable because of
the need to cut costs, it is often possible to maintain it as an agency,
working for the same society but not owned by it. This reduces costs while
keeping the services available to members more or less unchanged.

PLANS to refloat a cargo ship driven on to rocks in a storm were being made
yesterday.
The 22 Egyptian crew of the Antigua-registered Sea Reefer were rescued by
lifeboat and two RAF helicopters after the vessel dragged her anchor and
struck rocks near Peterhead harbour, Grampian, on Saturday night. Nobody was
injured.
Aberdeen coastguard said yesterday that a tug was standing by and an attempt
would be made to refloat the 2,800-tonne refrigerated vessel after an

FT  24 AUG 92 / Some time to wait before the Bundesbank budges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUNDESBANK-watching is an increasingly popular pastime among Europe's
politicians as well as financial markets operators. Only when the Bundesbank
council decides to ease German monetary policy will the beads of sweat on
the brows of finance ministers in London and France start to dry up.
History, and the stubborn growth of German money supply, suggest they may
have a long wait.
The Bundesbank's task is to secure stable prices in Germany alone. In spite
of being the de facto central bank of Europe, it is not required to care a
jot about inflation or economic growth in any other country. So, short of
leaving the ERM or agreeing to an upward revaluation of the D-Mark which
might encourage the Bundesbank to ease earlier, other European countries
have little choice but to wait.
The Bundesbank will not budge until it is convinced that its monetary policy
has been tight enough for long enough to put German inflation firmly on a
downward path. Recent signs have been promising. The annual inflation rate
in west Germany dropped to 3.3 per cent in July from 4.3 per cent in June,
its lowest level since May last year. Wholesale prices fell by 0.9 per cent
over the year to July as the falling dollar cut German import prices.
Yet, like any other prudent central bank, the Bundesbank will take some
convincing. Mr Jeremy Hale, an economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment
bank, has measured the average length of time that central banks in the US,
Japan and Germany wait before easing policy once inflation has peaked. The
chart tracks the official discount rate in the US, Japan and Germany in the
months before and after their most recent inflation-rate peak.
The US and Japan provide a test for Mr Hale's admittedly rather tentative
results. Concerns about the build-up of debt in the US encouraged the
Federal Reserve to move unusually quickly this cycle compared to the
previous four. The first cut in the discount rate came in January 1990,
three months after the peak in inflation, compared to an average lag of
eight months since 1970. But the Bank of Japan hit its average historic lag
spot on. Inflation peaked in January last year and the first rate cut came
six months later.
The German evidence is more difficult to interpret. Strictly, the average
historic lag since 1970 is only two months, suggesting that, as the consumer
inflation rate peaked in March of this year, the discount rate should have
fallen in May. In fact, it rose in June. But this historic average is
distorted by the period of global fixed exchange rates when the Bundesbank's
autonomy was compromised and the discount rate was cut in April 1969, 15
months before German inflation peaked.
The lag between the inflation peak and the fall in the discount rate was 10
months in both 1972 and again in 1981-82, slightly longer than in the US and
Japan, as the Bundesbank's reputation would suggest. If history repeats
itself for the third time then the first cut in the German discount rate
will not occur until January, as the chart implies.
Do not bet on it. Bundesbank-watching, like economics, is an art and not a
science. While history can provide clues, every cycle is different. And
unification has made this German cycle especially different. The
Bundesbank's credibility has since been dented twice, first when its
recommendations for the terms of monetary unification were ignored and then
by the subsequent acceleration in inflation.
To repair the damage and reassert its anti-inflationary zeal, the bank's
council agreed an austere target for broad money growth this year of 3 1/2
per cent to 5 1/2 per cent. But continued rapid growth of state subsidised
bank lending to east Germany means that it is still overshooting this target
range. M3 grew at an annual rate of 8.6 per cent between the fourth quarter
of last year and last July and is not expected to re-enter the target range
this year.
So history is likely to under-estimate the time that the Bundesbank will
wait before cutting interest rates. It may even raise them first. Europe's
finance ministers may still be sweating in the spring.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Business braced for rise in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S recession-hit business community is bracing itself for an increase
in the cost of money, which it says will hit investment programmes and snuff
out any chances of economic recovery.
Given poor business prospects well into next year, as well as increasing
alarm at the impact of possible public spending cuts, some industrialists
are likely to warn that higher interest rates could turn recession into
slump.
The Institute of Directors said at the weekend that many businessmen had not
wanted Britain to join the European exchange rate mechanism. Others have
consistently suggested that sterling entered at too high a level.
Most business leaders still support ERM membership. They now accept,
however, that the price for government determination to beat inflation is
likely to be a longer recession and more unemployment.
For much of this year the Confederation of British Industry has argued that
interest rate reductions are the most important step towards encouraging
economic revival. It has said the government's successful fight against
inflation has already made possible minor, 'step-by-step' interest rate
cuts.
Any rates increase now, however small or temporary, would be met with deep
dismay and could bring more industrial criticism of the government's
handling of the economy.
With this year's spending round expected to involve particularly tough
negotiations between Treasury and departmental ministers, the CBI is urging
the government not to impose cuts that would further demoralise business.
Ministers have suggested that large reductions in capital programmes can be
achieved, most notably in housing, roads, education and prison building.
Concern in industry about possible cuts has prompted Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general, to write to Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury. Mr Davies says that any increases in public-sector pay rates
should be financed through efficiency improvements or cuts in government
operations, enabling spending programmes to be maintained.
Mr Davies suggests recent planned increases in public expenditure recognised
that public expenditure would continue to fund the bulk of spending
programmes. He adds: 'We hope that recognition is also evident in the
outcome of this year's expenditure round.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: US election rivals ignore dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMPLICATIONS of the dollar's plunge are only just beginning to seep into
US political consciousness.
Strange though it may seem in Europe, President George Bush and Governor
Bill Clinton, his Democratic challenger, are debating the economy without
even mentioning the dollar. Both men are focusing exclusively on domestic
imperatives, such as the need to create jobs. Until very recently top White
House officials were calling loudly for further cuts in interest rates.
This blithe indifference to the dollar may not last. On Saturday the New
York Times and Washington Post ran front-page stories on the dollar's
decline. Until then currency news had been relegated to business pages. As
public awareness grows the Democrats may try to make capital out of the
dollar's weakness, saying it is yet another sign of Mr Bush's economic
incompetence.
But the exchange rate is politically a far less sensitive indicator than it
is in Europe. The dollar is rarely perceived as a macho measure of economic
strength, if only because few US consumers know or care what it is worth in
terms of other currencies. Dollar depreciation has been widely welcomed as a
way of giving US companies an edge in export markets. Mr Nicholas Brady, the
Treasury secretary, and an ardent advocate of lower interest rates,
frequently argues that export growth holds the key to US economic revival.
Few analysts worry that dollar weakness will threaten an acceleration of
inflation. Exports and imports each account for less than 11 per cent of
gross domestic product, about a third of the ratio in European economies.
Higher import prices thus have little impact on the overall price level.
Forecasters expect inflation to fall to between 2.5 per cent and 3.0 per
cent next year as high unemployment and competitive labour markets keep a
firm lid on wage rises.
A free fall of the dollar, of course, is not at all the same thing as a
gradual, controlled depreciation. On Friday the dollar's plunge undermined
both share and bond prices, something that the US cares a great deal about.
Until then domestic markets seemed oddly insulated from foreign exchange
fluctuations.
Even so, few Wall Street analysts see dollar weakness as likely to cause a
revision of monetary policy. They do not believe the US Treasury and Fed
will do more than 'talk up' the dollar and join other central banks in
periodically intervening in foreign exchange markets.
Mr Bill Griggs, a bond market expert, said: 'I don't think there is any plan
to raise interest rates. I don't think they feel the economy would permit
it. Politically, it would be suicide.'
Mr William Brown, chief economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said
that if the economy failed to strengthen, a further loosening of monetary
policy was likely. 'If the growth rate is still 1.5 per cent in three months
time and unemployment is trending higher, the Fed will cut the discount rate
again,' he said. He believes small cuts in the federal funds rate - at which
banks lend to each other - are possible before then, if economic news is
bad.
The view that US rates ought to fall rather than rise is not just based on
worries about the sluggish domestic recovery. In the US Germany is blamed
for causing turbulence in foreign exchange markets. The problem is seen
primarily as an excessively strong D-mark rather than a weak dollar - which
has held its value much better against the Japanese yen.
Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corporation, a Wall Street
brokerage, said: 'I would hope and expect that the Fed will not place itself
in the position of the Bank of England and subjugate monetary policy to
foreign exchange constraints.' If the Fed were to raise rates now, he said,
the US would in effect become an honorary ERM member and allow the
Bundesbank to dictate its monetary policy. That would not be acceptable in
the US.
The country's policymakers are keenly aware of the strains that high German
interest rates are causing in Europe. They sympathise with the plight of
countries such as the UK and are anxious that progress towards economic
integration in Europe is not jeopardised by French rejection of the
Maastricht treaty.
The Fed, at the direction of the US Treasury, has thus joined other central
banks in intervening in foreign exchange markets as much to ease tensions in
the ERM as to defend the weak dollar. In the short run, the strong D-mark is
seen as a much bigger threat to small, weak European economies than to the
US.
Fed intervention on Friday, however, did seem motivated mainly by domestic
considerations. The Treasury wanted to make sure that the dollar remained
firm following Mr Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican convention in
Houston. In the event, the intervention misfired because it seemed to
confirm market fears about the dollar's fragility. Mr Griggs said: 'The
dollar would probably have been stronger without any intervention.'
Most US analysts believe the dollar is now chronically undervalued and will
rebound as the economy recovers and the abnormal gap between German and US
interest rates narrows. However, the belief that the Fed will not raise
interest rates in the approach to a close presidential election creates the
potential for great instability. Put bluntly, it invites speculation against
the dollar and puts far too much strain on foreign exchange intervention.
The assumption that the Fed will not raise rates may, of course, be false.
It has tightened policy in the approach to past elections. But if it were
forced to act, it would strike a devastating blow to Mr Bush's re-election
hopes.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: Currency tacticians ready to
defend pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TACTICS of the Treasury and the Bank of England in propping up the pound
will be tested today, when sterling is expected to come under renewed
pressure on currency markets.
After the pound's sharp fall on Friday night, when it traded perilously
close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate
mechanism, UK monetary officials spent the weekend thinking of ways to
defend the currency without a politically damaging rise in interest rates.
Some economists believe, however, the chances for a rescue of the currency
are slim. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, the
investment group, said: 'There's been a steady reduction in confidence in
sterling. We may be moving into a crisis.'
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief UK economist at brokers James Capel, believes UK
monetary authorities have 'a credibility problem' due to their lack of
success in arresting sterling's recent decline. He thinks there is a 'good
chance' of a rise in base rates, now at 10 per cent, in the next few days.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has attempted to lift the currency
throughout the pound's 15-pfennig slide over the past three months to
DM2.7975 at the London close on Friday night.
He has issued determined statements that Britain will keep the currency in
its existing ERM band around a central rate of DM2.95. The essence of this
message is that investors who sell the pound when it approaches its ERM
floor of DM2.778 will lose money, as the UK will never allow the limit to be
breached.
Mr Lamont's strategy has been buttressed by modest and discreet intervention
by the Bank, mainly in the Far East, to buy sterling for other currencies,
chiefly D-Marks, to lift the value of the pound. The Bank has also joined
three highly public operations by other central banks during the past month
 -including moves by the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank - to buy
dollars for D-Marks, and so depress the German currency.
The strength of the D-Mark - caused by the difference of 6.75 percentage
points between German and US short-term interest rates - has been one of the
main components of sterling's recent difficulties.
But UK efforts to buoy the pound may have run out of steam. The main
obstacles have been:
D-Mark resilience. The interventions by central banks to lower the value of
the German currency - the last one being on Friday - have failed. The dollar
fell below its all-time low of DM1.4430 against the D-Mark on Friday, and
this helped to push down sterling.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank
Corporation, said: 'The dollar may be set for bigger falls, and I don't
think the central banks can do much about it.' Economic gloom. In recent
weeks the economic outlook has worsened. At the end of May the consensus
among private-sector economists was that UK output this year would rise by
0.8 per cent. The latest average forecast, according to Consensus Economics,
a consultancy firm, is for a 0.5 per cent decline. Such sentiments have
knocked market confidence and helped persuade investors to sell sterling.
Devaluation worries. In spite of Mr Lamont and Mr John Major, the prime
minister, stressing Britain's ERM commitment, doubts remain about whether
the UK might devalue should the pound fall too far - especially if raising
interest rates was the only alternative.
Some large UK companies, hedging bets about a possible devaluation, have
been among sellers of sterling in the past week. Maastricht concern. The
financial markets are worried about the possibility of a large 'no' vote in
the French referendum on ratification of the Maastricht treaty on September
20. Such a result would almost certainly halt progress towards economic and
monetary union. It might also damage confidence in the ERM, undermining weak
currencies such as the pound. As the referendum nears, these fears will give
investors more excuses to switch out of sterling.
Where does this leave Mr Lamont and his advisers? One option is for the Bank
to intervene heavily and publicly to buy the pound for D-Marks.
Such an operation would convince investors of Britain's determination to use
its foreign-currency reserves - which add up to Dollars 45.7bn (Pounds
23.5bn) and include a substantial proportion of D-Marks - to defend its
currency.
If intervention of this sort failed to relieve pressure on sterling the only
other alternative, assuming devaluation remained a non-starter, would be to
raise UK base rates. Such a move would reverse Britain's progress in
bringing base rates down by 5 percentage points from 15 per cent since it
joined the ERM in October 1990.
The move, coming when Britain is still locked in recession, would also, to
ERM critics, underline the perverse results of sticking to the mechanism's
rules.
But some commentators - including Mr O'Neill of Swiss Bank - think Britain
will convince markets that it believes in the ERM only if it demonstrates
its preparedness to increase borrowing rates as well as lower them.
Mr O'Neill said intervention was unlikely to be effective in boosting the
pound, Rather, the government should immediately increase base rates by 1
percentage point. With luck, the rise in rates could soon be reversed,
assuming that sterling strengthened.
He said: 'If Mr Major wants us to believe the ERM is valuable, he should
back up his words with action.'

LEADING BANK OF ENGLAND AND TREASURY PLAYERS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Top schemer: Eddie George
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chain-smoking, discreet deputy governor of the Bank of England and the
brains behind its market operations. Aged 53, joined Bank in 1962, after
spell in military intelligence. Hates inflation and is staunch advocate

views on UK economic outlook. Fine chorister and keen on old railways.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shy thinker: Alan Budd
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Aged 54, Treasury chief economic adviser since last year. Will help in
feeding political guidance from chancellor to the Bank's market team in

FT  24 AUG 92 / Bad weekend for South Africa's right-wingers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RIGHT-WING whites in South Africa had a hard time over the weekend. Rugby,
the national sport of the right, dealt them a cruel blow when the South
African side lost to Australia 26-3 (though the relatively civilised
behaviour of the fans at least ensured that future rugby tours should not be
in jeopardy).
And right-wing politicians took a small step towards acknowledging the end
of white hegemony when they agreed to participate in 'talks about talks' on
a post-apartheid constitution which, even if they have their way, would
leave whites with a much smaller share of land and privilege in South
Africa.
The weekend ended what has been a rough month for the right: Mr Eugene
Terreblanche, leader of the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging
(Afrikaner Resistance Movement or AWB), has had his sexual relationship with
a South African journalist exposed in the British courts in sordid detail.
Mr Terreblanche had already become a figure of fun when he tumbled from his
horse last March at a right-wing rally in Pretoria. Now that the court has
bared Mr Terreblanche's green underwear to the world, it is difficult to see
him leading a ferocious Afrikaner nationalist resistance to reformist
President FW de Klerk.
Indeed, lack of leadership appears to be the right wing's main weakness at
the moment. Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the right-wing Conservative
party, the official parliamentary opposition, is an old man weakened by the
referendum result, and is scarcely likely to survive much longer at the CP
helm. And there is no heir apparent to Mr Terreblanche, a powerful orator
whose humiliation weakens the right-wing cause.
But if the right lacks leadership, it does not lack support.
Over 30 per cent of the white electorate voted for the right in the recent
referendum, and there are believed to be well over a hundred small
ultra-right groups (many of them paramilitary) operating throughout the
country. They could prove a powerful force if united.
For the moment, unity is proving illusory, even among the politicians. Ten
days ago, five Conservative party members of parliament resigned to form a
new right-wing party, the Afrikaner Volksunie. Led by Mr Andries Beyers,
whose victory in the Potchefstroom by-election earlier this year prompted Mr
de Klerk to call a referendum to prove his support among whites, the new
party advocates negotiation with blacks for a much smaller separate white
homeland in the northern Transvaal and parts of the Cape. (The Conservative
party says it wants a larger homeland covering the 41 constituencies won by
the CP in the 1989 elections and by-elections.)
Though it is too soon to gauge the new party's support, its formation has
provoked a number of resignations from grass-roots party organisations, and
its more moderate stance appears to have forced a measure of moderation on
the parent Conservative party as well. Last Saturday the party decided after
a special congress that it would participate in talks with the Zulu Inkatha
Freedom party, and possibly the National party, about the failed Codesa
constitutional talks, suspended since June.
Mr Treurnicht, who has raised evasion to an art form during his long
political career, refused to be drawn on whether the Conservatives would now
join negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) on a
post-apartheid constitution. But it seems likely that the weekend decision
to attend 'talks about talks' could eventually lead to negotiations with the
ANC.
Both the ANC and the National party hope that the Conservatives can be drawn
into talks. They worry that white separatists could turn to violence if they
feel that they have been barred from all peaceful avenues to achieve their
aim of national self-determination for the Afrikaner.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Israel eases curbs on Palestinians: Concessions made as
parties gather in US for peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday announced the easing of some restrictions on Palestinians
living under occupation and the release of 800 prisoners. The concessions
came as Arab and Israeli delegations gathered in Washington for the sixth
round of Middle East peace talks.
A statement yesterday from the office of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, said a number of steps were being taken to 'improve the atmosphere
among the Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip'.
Apart from the prisoner release, Israel was also re-opening Palestinian
homes and streets sealed by the army. Such forms of collective punishment,
under which families of Palestinian activists are made to suffer, has been
much criticised internationally.
In addition, the statement said streets in Palestinian areas which had been
sealed by the army during violent clashes would gradually be reopened.
It expressed the hope that the measures 'will have a positive contribution
on the willingness of the Palestinian population to support the progress of
the peace negotiations'.
The apparent goodwill gesture follows a bitter row on Friday after Israeli
officials barred support staff travelling with Palestinian peace negotiators
from crossing into Jordan on their way to Washington.
The Palestinian delegation turned back in protest and demanded that the
Israeli authorities cease their 'harassment' of the Palestinian negotiating
team.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said in Jerusalem yesterday
before leaving for Washington that the delegation had been assured it would
not be subjected to further interference by the Israeli authorities.
'We have the assurance of the Americans that we will not be interfered with
and they told us that they have this assurance from the highest levels of
the Israeli authorities,' Mrs Ashrawi said.
The Palestinian spokeswoman added: 'We feel we have achieved something
absolutely basic - the recognition of the status of the delegation and
recognition that we should not be made subject to the dictates and the whims
of the Israeli authorities.'
Mrs Ashrawi said details of a written agreement on the status of the
Palestinian delegation would be worked out during the Washington talks to
avoid further 'harassment'.
The latest round of talks is the first since Mr Rabin and the Labour party
came to power. Mr Rabin has promised to freeze new Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories not required for security reasons and wants to
negotiate a swift agreement on autonomy for the Palestinians.

   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA and China established diplomatic ties early this morning after
more than four decades of cold war hostility. The agreement was signed by
South Korean Foreign Minister Lee Sang-ock and his Chinese counterpart, Qian
Qichen, in Beijing.
The ceremony was broadcast on Chinese state television, which announced that
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo would make an official visit to China
soon. South Korea had agreed to recognise Beijing as the only government of
China, severing its close ties with Taiwan, it added.
Normalisation between the two former enemies has been on the cards for some
time, with the rapid expansion of economic ties. Total trade volume reached
Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3bn) last year and is forecast to exceed Dollars 10bn
for 1992, making South Korea China's fourth biggest trading partner after
Hong Kong, the US and Japan.
Last year both countries signed an agreement giving each other
'most-favoured-nation' status for investment and business ventures. South
Korean investment topped Dollars 130m in 1991, quadrupling that of 1990.
This year the two countries agreed to exchange Bank of China and Korean
Exchange Bank offices in each other's capitals.
North Korea is certain to be unhappy at the diplomatic link-up between its
northerly neighbour and China. China has backed the North since partition of
the peninsula after the second world war, while the US was patron to the
South during the cold war.
Mr Lee made no comment on arrival at Beijing but last May he told a seminar
in Seoul that relations between China and South Korea would act as a
'catalyst for change'. Diplomatic normalisation would bring North Korea out
of its isolation, he said.
'Lingering of the cold war on the Korean peninsula and North Korea's
continued isolation certainly are not desirable for South Korea, North Korea
and China,' Mr Lee said. China's interest in normalisation lies in South
Korean investment and trade.
Taiwan, shrugging off its worst diplomatic setback in a decade, said its
foreign policy would not change following South Korea's switch of diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing, Reuter adds from Taipei.
Government leaders said the island would retain its claim of sovereignty
over China and continue seeking to build unofficial ties with countries that
recognise Beijing.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Lebanese choose first MPs for 20 years: Hizbollah guerrilla
group enters the political mainstream

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOSLEM and Christian residents of northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley
voted yesterday in Lebanon's first parliamentary elections in 20 years.
A few ballot boxes went missing with voters' lists, irregularities which
appeared to favour government candidates. But the pro-Iranian Shia Moslem
Hizbollah movement, the most popular party in the Bekaa Valley, said it
believed the poll was free and fair.
The Hizbollah fielded four candidates in the Baalbek-Hermel region - marking
its transition from a secret guerrilla movement associated with the
kidnapping of westerners in Lebanon to a mainstream political party.
The poll went ahead despite objections by Maronite Catholics, concentrated
in the mountainous coastal strip running from east Beirut up to Jbeil, and
in the Israeli-controlled 'security zone' in southern Lebanon. These regions
observed a 'day of mourning' in protest at the poll yesterday.
But Christians in northern Lebanon and the Bekaa are generally allied with
Syria and participated in the voting. 'We would not participate in this
election if we did not think it was free,' Sayyid Ibrahim Amin, a Shia
cleric, member of the Hizbollah political bureau in Beirut and the leading
candidate on Hizbollah's list, said. 'This doesn't mean that the government
will not do some cheating. Elections that are 100 per cent free and fair
exist only in paradise, and we do not live among angels.'
Down the hill at Baalbek's Palmyra Hotel, the Lebanese Speaker of Parliament
Hussein Husseini, Hizbollah's main opposition in the Bekaa, was concluding
an election-day meeting with Gen Ghazi Kenaan, the chief of Syrian military
intelligence in Lebanon. Syrian troops and plain-clothes intelligence
officers manned check-points every few kilometres throughout the Bekaa, but
there were no Syrians in the villages or polling stations.
The Hizbollah are the only party to have published an election programme for
the controversial poll, which is scheduled to continue next week in Beirut
and Mount Lebanon and on September 6 in the south.
Many Shia voters said yesterday that they supported Hizbollah because it was
the only group in Lebanon which continues to fight the Israeli occupation of
the south. But the programmes of the 'Party of God' in the Bekaa, which
include Iranian-financed supermarkets, schools and hospitals, have also won
it the loyalty of many in this neglected region.
Hizbollah parliamentary candidates claim they will improve living conditions
for the poor throughout Lebanon if they are elected. 'In some of the world's
worst dictatorships, people are respected to the extent they have water,
electricity, streets, hospitals and job opportunities,' Sayyid Ibrahim Amin
said. 'These are not available for a large segment of the Lebanese
population. The Lebanese people live in a system that despises them. This
didn't start with the civil war. It's been going on for 50 years.'
Condemnation of the Maronite elite who ruled Lebanon until the civil war was
implicit in Sayyid Ibrahim's speech. The majority of Maronites, about a
third of the population of Lebanon, are boycotting the legislative elections
because 40,000 Syrian troops are still in Lebanon. 'Was the election of
Bashir Gemayel in 1982 free, with Israeli troops in Beirut?' asked Sayyid
Ibrahim. 'It was the same parliament that elected him. If they had opposed
the 1982 presidential election, their opposition today would be more
credible.'
The enmities of the 1975-90 civil war still linger. 'The Maronites are
saying these elections are not fair because that is their last excuse,' Ali
Shirazi, a 20-year-old French literature student and Hizbollah supporter
from Baalbek, said. 'They are sulking because they are losing their
domination over everyone else in Lebanon.'
Twenty-five kilometres from Baalbek, in the Shia village of Chmestar, Mr
Talal Salman, editor of As Safir newspaper, one of Beirut's main dailies,
said he understood the Maronites' reservations but regretted their boycott
of the poll.
'The balance of the country will be lost through their decision,' he said,
pointing out that there are no Syrian soldiers in the Jbeil and Kesrouan
regions, where opposition to the vote is highest.
Mr Salman, whose newspaper is considered pro-Syrian, noted that Syria was
named in the 1989 Taif Accords to help implement the peace plan. 'Syria has
lost the lives of many soldiers in 16 years in Lebanon and they see
political influence as payment for that sacrifice. Israel, by occupying part
of Lebanon, gives Syria the right to be here. You cannot tell the Syrians to
go while Israel is still here,' he said. In the run-up to yesterday's
elections, Lebanese officials travelled every day to Damascus to confer with
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam. 'This silly government in Lebanon
doesn't have the confidence to make its own decisions,' Mr Salman said.
'Over the years, the Maronite leaders were the ones who went most often to
Damascus to ask favours. This is a transitional period after the war, and it
will pass.'
Meanwhile, women in chadors and girls in tight blue jeans, Hizbollah
fighters, lawyers and teachers crowded into the Chmestar girls' public
school down the road from Salman's house to post their ballots under the
watchful eye of Lebanese policemen armed with automatic rifles.
Mr Habib Shadad, a civil servant in suit and tie from the Ministry of the
Interior, sat next to a metal ballot box securely closed with two padlocks,
in the presence of representatives of the five competing candidates' lists.
Shadad held his right hand over the slot in the top of the ballot box at all
times, lifting it only when voters had shown their identity papers, been
checked off on the voters' list and slipped their ballot into a
ministry-stamped envelope. 'This is my responsibility before God,' he said
of his role in supervising the election. 'I am 30 years old and I never
voted before today. I hope we have elections every day, so we can express
our opinions like the French do.'
But would the elections be free and fair, in view of the presence of Syrian
troops? The civil servant's spontaneous reply: 'God willing,' he said.
'According to what I heard from the media and (Syrian) President Hafez
al-Assad, it will be.'

Freedom of expression in Iran is still 'brutally suppressed', despite the

Under Mr Rafsanjani, the group says in a report published today, journalists

government officials or hardline opposition groups, whose activities go
unpunished. The clampdown on journalists and artists 'continued with renewed
vigour' after widespread anti-government riots in April and May, and in June
the new parliament reaffirmed the late Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence

process, currently so high, may disappear beneath an arms race that
perpetuates instability, conflict and bloodshed in the Middle East.'
Saferworld says the US has received orders worth about Dollars 28.5bn,
principally from Saudi Arabia, which has ordered more than Dollars 17bn
worth of equipment.
The 1992 'Javit's list', which sets out the US's expected arms exports for
the year, predicts sales worth Dollars 35bn, mostly to countries in the
Middle East.
The report says the US government 'has helped its manufacturers by providing
Desert Storm veterans to recount their experiences at arms fairs, such as
the Paris Air Show. The Pentagon has also provided equipment used in the
Gulf War free of charge, saving manufacturers hundreds of thousands of
dollars in leasing and transport costs.'
Saferworld says the UK has received orders worth about Dollars 4bn in which
Tornados, Hawks and other aircraft figure prominently. 'Russia, Germany,
North Korea, China, Czechoslovakia, France and other industrialised
countries have all received orders from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia,
Israel, Kuwait, Iran, Turkey, Egypt and Syria lead the importing nations.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / The London Conference: Bosnian president to unveil peace
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic will unveil to the London conference a
comprehensive peace plan based on ethnic rights and a secular democratic
state, writes Judy Dempsey. The plan, aimed at preventing Bosnia from being
carved up between Serbia and Croatia, or from being divided into ethnically
based cantons, involves reconstituting the government of Bosnia.
Bosnian officials last night said the republic would neither be a unitary
nor an Islamic state. Instead, it would set out to give Moslem, Serb and
Croat ethnic communities far-reaching rights which would be enshrined in the
constitution, and exercised in a second chamber. The ethnic groups
represented in the second chamber would have power of veto.
The officials added that the plan would also entail clawing back some of the
territory seized by Bosnia's Serbs.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The London Conference: Macedonia hovers in wings during
Balkan drama - There are fears that international opposition to the
republic's independence could lead to unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACEDONIA will not be centre-stage at this week's London talks on the former
Yugoslavia, but if it is ignored it could quickly become the main act in the
Balkan drama.
Though the republic has played by EC rules, complying with EC conditions on
human and minority rights to win international recognition, it has stayed
the victim of Greek insistence that the name Macedonia is Hellenic property.
In an attempt to placate Greece, the EC has said it will not recognise
Macedonia until the southern Yugoslav republic changes its name.
This approach has held sway in the wider international context. The US has
postponed Macedonian recognition until after the November presidential
elections, to avoid conflict with the large Greek community, diplomats say.
Politicians in Skopje, Macedonia's capital, fear history is repeating
itself. Over the past century, whenever Macedonia has tried to assert itself
as an independent state, jealous neighbours have provoked a war. President
Kiro Gligorov hopes the republic's status will be resolved when the
three-day London Conference on Yugoslavia, jointly chaired by the United
Nations and the EC, convenes on Wednesday. 'There is a real danger of war
spreading through the Balkans if Macedonia is not recognised,' he says.
Diplomats say the republic's population may run out of patience with western
intransigence. 'Macedonians are united in refusal to change the name. A
serious risk exists that the radical threat the Greeks say they fear could
become a self-fulfilling prophecy if Macedonia is sentenced indefinitely to
purgatory,' says one diplomat. While politicians in the republic do not
expect a spontaneous uprising, several factors could destabilise the
republic.
Because of its sensitive geographical position, they fear unrest would
trigger intervention by some or all of its neighbours: Serbia, Greece,
Albania and Bulgaria. Mr Ljubomir Frckovski, interior minister, believes the
danger is conflict in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
Leaders of Macedonia's ethnic Albanians, about 35 per cent of the 2m
population, warn they would fight to defend kinsmen in Kosovo in the event
of Serbian aggression there. Serbia might then intervene in Macedonia.
Turkey, among the first countries to recognise Macedonia, appears interested
in gaining influence in the Balkans and might intervene on behalf of
Moslems.
President Gligorov admits violence in Kosovo could destroy the fragile
co-existence between Albanians and Macedonians. Although in a minority,
Albanians are better integrated into Macedonia than the majority Albanian
population in Kosovo. 'Albanians are part of the parliament and the
government. They share responsibility for the destiny of Macedonia,' he
says.
There is also the problem of ultranationalist Macedonians. Many fear
deepening economic deprivation, due to the war in the former Yugoslavia and
international sanctions against Serbia, will strengthen the hand of the far
right. The Internal Macedonia Revolution Organisation (VMRO) is the most
extreme party on the Macedonian political scene. A faction calls for the
integration of Macedonia into Bulgaria.
Many Macedonians fear that, in the event of a war, Bulgaria, whose people
consider Macedonians to be Bulgarians, would intervene on the pretext of
aiding their kinsmen.
Mr Vladimir Milcin, a Macedonian human rights activist, says the EC's
failure to recognise Macedonia will radicalise the population. He fears that
after the wars in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia, Macedonians will believe the
only way to win independence is through conflict.
'Recognition would show there does not have to be bloodshed to gain
independence,' he adds.
Leading politicians believe short-term violence can be avoided through
bolstering economic ties with countries which have recognised Macedonia. Mr
Milcin warns: 'Without economic aid, the third Balkan war will begin on the
territory of Macedonia.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / SPD about-turn on asylum seekers: New stance on use of
German forces in UN-led operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and REUTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats (SPD) announced surprising about-turns
at the weekend on two of the most delicate policy areas plaguing the Bonn
government: asylum-seekers and the use of German forces in UN-led military
operations.
Bowing to grass-roots demand and risking a rift with his party's left wing,
Mr Bjorn Engholm, party leader, said immigration must be 'braked and
controlled'. The party was ready to approve a change in the constitution if
necessary. Some 240,000 asylum-seekers took advantage of Germany's liberal
laws in the first seven months of this year, arriving at the rate of one a
minute during July. Last year's total was a record 256,000.
Most are seeking work in Europe's richest country and have, by law, to be
housed and fed by local authorities and individual state governments. Mr
Engholm has come under pressure from state authorities, most of them
SPD-controlled, for a change of course. In future, he said after a private
meeting of party leaders, people arriving and giving no reason, or false
reasons, in their request for asylum should be excluded. Those from
countries where there was no political persecution, should also be turned
away.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, welcomed the change, though it had
come 'late'. Leaders of the main coalition parties, the Christian Democrats
and Christian Social Union, demanded an immediate start to talks on
constitutional change.
The SPD also renounced its opposition to the use of German forces in
international military actions under the UN flag. Mr Engholm called for UN
reform, so it as a whole, not just 'three or four states', took
responsibility for policing world peace. That could be achieved in a few
years. Meanwhile, the party was ready to 'decide on' German military
participation in the case of 'unforeseen conflicts'.
The decision on use of the military is partly a response to divisions within
the SPD over the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The constitution is
vague on the use of German forces, but has been interpreted by all parties
as banning deployment outside the Nato area. But the government has pressed
for a more liberal interpretation to allow an enlarged Germany to fulfil its
international obligations.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, said he had already drafted an amendment
to clarify the constitutional issue, which also laid down conditions for
out-of-area involvement. These included deployment only of volunteers, under
UN command and only after an examination of each case by the Bundestag.
Several hundred right-wingers attacked a hostel for foreign refugees in the
east German port city of Rostock yesterday and fought police for the second
night in a row, Reuter reports from Rostock.

PORTUGAL'S Premier Anbal Cavaco Silva has promised to curb public spending
in a tough 1993 budget, but ruled out higher taxes, Reuter reports from
Lisbon. 'We will be very demanding with all those responsible for
controlling state money. I am determined not to allow any increase in
taxation, and to widen scope for private enterprise,' he told a rally of the
ruling Social Democrat party at the weekend.
He described 1993 as 'a year of rigour and containment' and pledged to
streamline the civil service. The premier's commitment to greater austerity
follows a central bank demand for budget deficit cuts to curb money supply
and inflation, at 9.5 per cent a year.

MANY companies in Brazil are facing delays in orders and investment because
of the political crisis caused by charges of government corruption, a poll
of executives by the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo shows, Bill
Hinchberger reports from Sao Paulo.
Eighty-one per cent of respondents say the crisis is having negative impact
on their businesses, with 53 per cent noting clients are delaying or
cancelling orders. Some 33 per cent say local investment outlays are being
cancelled or delayed, while 31 per cent report a similar effect on
investment from abroad.
The continuance of Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira as economy minister was 'very
important' to 80 per cent of executives who responded. Mr Moreira has said
of questions about his possible resignation: 'I am working in this
government.'
The parliamentary commission investigating charges of government corruption
presents the draft of its conclusions this morning. On Wednesday the
commission is scheduled to vote on approval of the document.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Gaidar adviser tells of oil price mistake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the mass privatisation programme announced last week by President Boris
Yeltsin, Russian reform was now taking its 'second step', after earlier
price liberalisation, Mr Sergei Vasiliev, an economic adviser to Mr Yegor
Gaidar, acting prime minister of Russia, has argued in London.
But the government had made its first mistake by not liberalising oil and
energy prices in April, he admitted. As a result, oil exports had been
falling, and wasteful use of energy continued and administrative controls on
oil exports had had to be kept. Failure to liberalise also led to three
months' stagnation in the reforms, while the opposition (mainly former
communists) gathered strength.
Mr Vasiliev was announcing the appearance of a new quarterly journal,
Russian Economic Trends, an English-language publication of the Russian
government*. Apart from the latest statistics, it sets out the government's
economic strategy and analysis of economic developments.
Western aid could not solve the problems of so large a country as Russia,
but western barriers to exports of high-technology products, textiles and
agricultural products were an important obstacle to Russia's ability to
exploit its long-term comparative advantage in trade.
The government was still unable to control the budget deficit, Mr Vasiliev
added. But such control was a necessary condition for a fixed exchange rate,
needed to provide the environment desired by foreign investors.

FT  24 AUG 92 / The European Market: Szczecin holds key to cross-border
regional renaissance - Germans and Poles look to the port to power
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Poland they call it Szczecin, one of the country's largest ports and a
gateway to the Baltic, Scandinavia and the rest of northern Europe.
But to the Germans it is still Stettin, once sold by Sweden to Prussia and
then taken from Germany after the second world war. The city of 411,000
people lies at the mouth of the River Oder, which forms part of the border
separating the two countries.
Szczecin, with its grand 19th century avenues and parks, suffered severe
damage during the war, much now repaired. Today it is at the centre of
tentative moves towards economic and political co-operation that hold out
the hope of renewed prosperity for the region of Pomerania spanning both
countries.
At present that hope is a long way from realisation. But the will is there
on both sides since the fall of the Berlin Wall opened up a new era for the
region's 1.5m inhabitants.
On the east German side there is an eagerness to reach across the Oder and
develop Pomerania as an economically viable cross-border region, with
Szczecin as its natural centre. 'We've got to start rebuilding links with
Poland now,' says Mr Rainer Haedrich, head of the local council in Pasewalk,
a small German town at the far eastern edge of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the
agricultural state next to Poland. 'We must take that step.'
The Poles are keen, since the prospect of Szczecin being able to benefit
again from its former hinterland is attractive. There is also the prospect
of EC funds under a programme for border regions. Arthur D. Little, the US
consultancy advising the German side, suggests comparisons with the
maquiladora system of labour division in the border free-trade zone between
the US and Mexico. Since 1960 about 2,000 US companies have created half a
million jobs on the Mexican side.
But before anything like this can happen, considerable work and money will
be required on both sides. The main prospects for increased co-operation are
in tourism - the largely enclosed bay area north of Szczecin is especially
attractive for yacht owners - as well as construction, transport, food
processing and furniture. German companies already buy cheap Polish timber,
upholstery and building materials.
But while eyeing the possibilities of broader co-operation, both sides have
more immediate problems. As in the rest of east Germany, the regions of
Pasewalk and neighbouring Ueckermunde are struggling to adjust to the free
market. The area was over-farmed and over-fertilised in the interests of
East German self-sufficiency. Most of the agricultural jobs are now
disappearing.
The big railway depot near Pasewalk is also reducing its operations. The
extensive maintenance activities that supported agriculture are being run
down and some of Ueckermunde's industry has been privatised. Unemployment is
high.
Against this background it is hardly surprising that many Germans in the
region are hopeful of renaissance in Szczecin and its nearby sister port of
Swinoujscie (Swinemunde), which handles bigger ships. The Poles, too, are
keen to develop business, seeing their port complex as a natural link with
Berlin.
'We are more favourably placed than Rostock (the east German port city
further east) to serve the Berlin area,' says Mr Jan Grenke, Szczecin port's
chief technologist. 'Historically, Szczecin was the main port for Berlin.'
It was also part of the pre-war route between Scandinavia and Prague.
There is potential for growth. Some German companies are interested in using
Szczecin and Swinoujscie to ship timber, chemicals, building materials, and
other goods in and out of Germany. Szczecin also wants to set up a
customs-free zone.
In recent years the two ports, employing nearly 5,000 people, have operated
at well below capacity, mainly because of the drop in Polish coal mining and
the loss of some markets. To develop new business, the port wants to build a
multi-purpose terminal in Szczecin for container and roll-on/roll-off
vessels.
Swinoujscie also needs new handling and storage facilities. Since the ports
do not have the money, they are looking for German, Scandinavian, and other
partners. 'We have the land, but because of our economic situation we have
no funds,' Mr Grenke laments.
Language is one difficulty, since the Poles - at least, the younger ones -
prefer to speak English, which was hardly taught in the old East Germany.
But Polish is now starting to be taught on the east German side.
The east Germans also plan business parks to attract investment in light
industry and services. In Ueckermunde a DM60m (Pounds 21.2m) marine harbour
is being developed to attract prosperous Berliners who want to sail in the
attractive Oder bay straddling the border. Pasewalk has hopes it can attract
investment to build a DM1bn cement complex on the site of a limestone
deposit.
For the east Germans the possibility of a revived Pomeranian region with its
heart in Szczecin makes the present economic uncertainties easier to bear.
Says Mr Peter Heise, head of Pasewalk's economic development department,
hopefully: 'We want to give this region, which is away from the main centres
of economic development, a better image in the outside world.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / Russia's central banker 'playing political game'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Russia's central bank, has been accused
by a senior minister of playing a political game in calling for
renegotiation of the country's agreement with the International Monetary
Fund.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for foreign
economic ties, said in an interview yesterday that Mr Gerashchenko 'says one
thing to the press and another in real life.' He added that the central bank
chief had twice confirmed he supported an accord unlocking an initial
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) credit tranche before the IMF board met to approve
it on August 4.
But on the eve of a meeting today with Mr Richard Erb, the IMF's deputy
director, Mr Gerashchenko said in a newspaper interview he wanted to change
IMF conditions for the loan. Mr Shokhin suggested the chairman might not put
the issue so starkly to the Fund.
A western official said Moscow had already asked whether it could increase
credits to boost the working capital of state-owned enterprises from
Rbs150bn to Rbs300bn in the second half of this year. The IMF agreement said
the Rbs150bn ceiling could be altered with Fund permission, but within an
overall ceiling of Rbs700bn for new credit to the economy.
Asked if the government had made the mistake of endorsing strict conditions
it could not meet, Mr Shokhin said: 'We can always talk to the Fund if we
have problems carrying out what we promised to do.' In contrast, Mr
Gerashchenko seemed intent on making a 'political drama' out of the issue.
Dumping the existing IMF agreement would make it difficult for Russia to
obtain a debt rescheduling and more western funds. It could further damage
faith in the country's reliability as a negotiating partner.
Even before Mr Gerashchenko's comments, it was obvious Russia was unlikely
to meet the targets of cutting its budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by
the end of the year and reducing inflation to 9 per cent a month. The
central issue now is how far he can undermine government attempts to
discipline enterprises through a tight credit policy.
A western official said: 'It looks like Gerashchenko is trying to capitalise
on the discontent of the industrial sector, to appear as the man who has the
courage to stand up to the IMF and who will negotiate better terms so that
the Russian economy is kept alive and not destroyed, as the IMF is supposed
to want to do.'
Although the central bank cannot unilaterally alter Russia's agreement with
the Fund, Mr Shokhin acknowledged that lack of support from the chairman
would seriously undermine the accord.

</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA has reached broad agreement on constitutional reform, with the
likelihood of acceptance by all 10 provinces.
Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, who has traded a reformed Senate for a
permanent guarantee of 25 per cent of the House of Commons and greater
autonomy, has endorsed the deal. The two provincial premiers who failed to
accept the Meech Lake accord in June 1990, Mr Clyde Wells of Newfoundland
and Mr Garry Filmon of Manitoba, are ready to fall in line.
But Mr Bourassa may well face opposition in his own Quebec Liberal party.
Quebec voters generally opposed Senate reform and nationalists say Mr
Bourassa has obtained less than Quebec was promised in the Meech Lake talks.
The preliminary text now goes for legal drafting and review by the first
ministers later this week. The federal parliament and all provincial
legislatures must ratify the final version. A national referendum is
possible.
The main points are:
The Senate will become an elected body with a fixed number of senators from
each province and one each from the Yukon and the northwest territories. It
will have little legislative power.
The Commons would be expanded from 295 to 337 members, with Quebec and
Ontario each getting 18 more seats, British Columbia four more and Alberta
two more.
Quebec gets 25 per cent of the seats, providing a guarantee of its input at
the federal level, and is recognised as a distinct, primarily francophone,
society. Protection for English minorities in Quebec and French minorities
in other provinces is provided. Quebec and all other provinces can veto
changes to the Senate and other federal institutions.
Aboriginal people get an 'inherent right to self-government', but no new
land rights.
More powers are transferred to provinces that want them, mainly Quebec, but
the problem of inter-provincial trade barriers has yet to be resolved.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Republicans resort to fire and brimstone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN savage campaigning over the weekend the Republican party for the first
time sought to link the Democratic party and its presidential nominee, Mr
Bill Clinton, with the troubled private life of Woody Allen, the actor and
film director.
And President George Bush, addressing a meeting of fundamentalist political
activists, came close to accusing his opposition of being anti-religious. 'I
am struck,' he said in Dallas, 'by the fact that the other party took
thousands of words to make up its platform and left out three simple
letters, G O D'.
The president and his surrogates emerged from the party's convention in
Houston last week breathing fire and brimstone and encouraged by scattered
polling suggesting Mr Clinton's lead in the electoral race has been reduced
to single figures. A Los Angeles Times poll, for example, had him only eight
points ahead, nearly 20 points below his previous lead.
But some of the Republican attacks are sure to trigger controversy,
especially that delivered, in Mr Bush's presence, by Congressman Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, an ardent conservative.
Warming up a rally for Mr Bush, he said: 'Woody Allen having non-incest with
a non-daughter to whom he was a non-father because they were a non-family
fits the Democratic platform perfectly.' The Democrats, he said, had 'no
concept of family'.
As is now standard practice, the Bush campaign issued a statement
dissociating Mr Bush from Mr Gingrich's remarks. 'The president is not going
to make Woody Allen an issue,' it said.
The Clinton campaign said the congressman's comments were 'silly and
outrageous'.
The Rev Pat Robertson, a convener of the Dallas meeting and prominent at
last week's convention, painted an even more Stygian picture of Democratic
values in an extraordinary attack on feminism - typified in Republican eyes
by Mrs Hillary Clinton - in a fund-raising letter he has written to an
anti-feminist campaign in Iowa.
One paragraph runs: 'The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for
women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that
encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practise
witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.'
The Dallas meeting, to which Mr Clinton had turned down an invitation, made
the Houston convention seem mild. The Democratic candidate, it was charged,
was a friend of pornographers, would let homosexuals run the armed forces,
and failed to understand that the hole in the ozone later was an atheist
ploy.
The conservative Republican platform was frequently praised for having put
backbone into the president. Mrs Phyllis Schlafly, a leading opponent of
abortion, called it 'one of the cleanest, clearest victories we have had'.
Conservative satisfaction of a different kind was also expressed yesterday
by Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, who said in a television interview
that he thought the president's acceptance speech had gone a long way
towards meeting right-wing demands for a commitment to sharply reduced
taxes.
Mr Clinton, in his weekend campaigning in the northern 'rust belt' states,
has not taken all this lying down, although he has focused more on the
economic issues which he considers his greatest strength. He came close to
accusing Mr Bush outright of being a liar in describing as 'untrustworthy'
the president's promise to cut taxes next year, which have been coupled with
attacks on Mr Clinton's alleged propensity to increase taxes.

FT  24 AUG 92 / EC traders face VAT offences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES which trade with other EC member countries could face a battery
of civil and criminal charges next year unless they take urgent steps to
comply with new value added tax regulations which come into force on January
1.
The revenue authorities are worried that only a handful of companies have
begun to modify their business systems to take account of the biggest change
in VAT legislation since the tax was introduced 19 years ago.
The new regulations are an interim stage between purely national VAT systems
and a Community-wide system set for introduction in 1997.
Designed to simplify and lower the cost of cross-border trade, the
legislation nevertheless demands that companies will have to provide a broad
range of new statistics and reports.
The top 24 per cent of traders, which account for 97 per cent of the value
of all imports and exports, will have to make detailed monthly statistical
returns. So far, only 10 per cent of these companies have started to prepare
for 1993. Penalties for failing to comply with the requirements include
fines, while companies reporting inaccurate trade statistics could face
criminal charges.
UK Customs and Excise has been publicising the legislation but is concerned
that many companies are turning a blind eye to the implications. To meet the
new demands effectively, companies will have to make detailed changes to
their computer systems. Many companies will find it difficult to meet the
deadline. A scramble for scarce, specialised computer staff is expected
towards the end of the year. when companies realise the extent of their
predicament. Companies which cannot modify their systems in time will have
to muddle through using expensive manual methods or agents to make their
returns.
The customs authorities made clear last week that they would be lenient in
the early days of the new regime, but said: 'VAT is not a particularly
forgiving tax.' The rest of the Community is in worse shape than the UK -
legislation has not even been passed in Italy or Greece.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Banks braced for dollar fall: UK base rates may be increased
to maintain sterling within its ERM band
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CENTRAL BANKS around the world are today braced for renewed pressure on the
dollar after the US currency breached its all-time low against the D-Mark at
the end of last week.
In the UK, pressure on sterling may require a rise in base rates to prevent
the currency's falling below its ERM floor.
Bank of England and Treasury officials were yesterday working on strategies
to support the pound yesterday as Mr John Major, the prime minister,
returned to London after his Spanish holiday,
Treasury officials said the government would do whatever was necessary to
maintain the pound within its ERM bands. A senior UK official added:
'Sterling's fate is out of our hands. The future of the pound depends on
what happens to the dollar and D-Mark.'
In the US, the likely response of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank,
to a further decline of the dollar was uncertain. In spite of the failure of
foreign exchange market intervention to halt the dollar's slide on Friday,
few Wall Street analysts believe the US monetary authorities are yet
prepared to raise interest rates to defend the dollar.
The pressures resulting from the strong D-Mark seem certain to be on the
agenda of a meeting of finance ministry officials from the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations - the US, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada
and Italy - expected later this week to discuss a range of economic issues.
The dollar's decline led to a sharp fall in share prices on Wall Street, and
caused severe strains on the weaker currencies in the European exchange rate
mechanism, including the pound.
The US currency fell through its historic low of DM1.4430 in European
trading on Friday while the D-Mark's strength led to sterling closing in
London within two pfennigs of its lower ERM limit.
In late morning trading in Tokyo today the US currency was quoted at
DM1.424, having opened at DM1.4185 compared with a New York close of DM1.429
on Friday. Sterling was trading at DM2.799 against DM2.801 in the US.
Monetary officials in Europe are concerned that a further fall in the dollar
against the D-Mark could force several countries in Europe - including
France and Italy - to raise interest rates at a time of weak economic
activity.
In Germany, the Bundesbank is expected to come under renewed domestic and
international pressure to cut its high short-term interest rates, thereby
reducing the wide differential with US borrowing rates. This would depress
the D-Mark's value.
Mr Herbert Hax, head of the German government's council of economic
advisers, said: 'A large wave of international criticism of the Bundesbank's
interest rate policy cannot be excluded ahead of September's meeting of the
World Bank and the IMF.'
In the US, the consensus view is that US monetary policy should be dictated
mainly by the needs of the domestic economy which is still showing no signs
of a robust recovery. Some economists continue to predict further small cuts
in US rates if the economy fails to revive.
The dollar's decline, while attracting some media attention, has been
overshadowed by the presidential campaign. Over the weekend Mr George Bush
and Mr Bill Clinton traded punches on economic policy but neither saw the
need to speak on the dollar.
The Fed is unlikely to attempt to defend any particular value of the dollar,
although it would strive to reduce the rate of dollar depreciation through
carefully timed forays in the markets. The US Treasury is thought to have
supported concerted intervention in recent weeks as much to ease tensions in
the ERM as to defend the dollar.
Turbulence in markets is seen as mainly a consequence of excessively high
German interest rates rather than inherent dollar weakness. Policymakers are
concerned at the slowdown in global growth and believe that a reduction of
European interest rates would be a more appropriate way of stabilising
currencies than an increase in US rates.
If a further plunge in the dollar led to big falls in US share and bond
prices, however, the Fed might be forced to raise rates.
In Britain, City economists believe that the government may buy pounds
today. Another strategy thought to be under discussion at the Bank is to
strengthen sterling by raising the rates at which it lends money to
commercial banks and discount houses in the cash market.
A small rise in lending rates would not necessarily trigger a base rate
rise. But, by the close on Friday, prices in sterling cash and futures
markets were discounting a rise in base rates by a 1/2 point.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Pressure on pound unsettles Tory MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporters
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMIC uncertainty in the UK as a result of the pound's weakness
triggered a new spate of public unease from Conservative backbenchers
although there were sharp divisions over how to respond.
With Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, not due back from Italy until later
today it was left to Mr Gerry Malone MP, the party's deputy chairman, to try
to calm the many backbench Tory MPs now expressing both deep-seated unease
and fiercely divided opinions as to the correct political strategy.
He told the BBC that the markets were testing the government's resolve on
inflation. It was crucial, he said, for Britain to remain within its ERM
bands as part of a consistent programme to cut inflation and interest rates.
Refusing to rule out interest rates rises as an option, he added: 'Nobody
ever saw this as a one-way street.'
Downing Street said there were no formal plans for a meeting between Mr
Major and Mr Lamont. Instead, they would both probably 'take stock' during
the day.
Conservative Euro-sceptics have seized on sterling's weakness and the
continuing UK recession to press their case for Britain's withdrawal from
the ERM.
Building societies warned that they would be unable to keep their mortgage
rates down if there were an increase in the banks' base rate this week.
'If base rates go up, there is no doubt that mortgage rates will follow very
quickly. Building societies don't have the scope to absorbed an increase,'
said Leeds Permanent, the fifth largest building society.
Business leaders would greet an increase in interest rates, with dismay.
While industry has been generally supportive of the government's
anti-inflation stance within the ERM, it has repeatedly singled out interest
rate cuts as an essential step to economic recovery. The Confederation of
British Industry has been calling on the government to implement minor
interest rate reductions.
The prospect of higher borrowing costs will further demoralise the business
community. Any rise is certain to bring renewed warnings of company closures
and job losses. There will be particular anxiety over the prospects for
corporate investment programmes.
More outspoken criticism of the government's handling of the economy is also
likely, along with demands from some industries that Britain either quits
the ERM or seeks a realignment of the currencies within it.
Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, claimed
that many businessmen had not wanted Britain to join the ERM in the first
place.
Mr Ronald Taylor, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce,
conceded higher rates might be necessary but added: 'We are part of a club.
I don't think you can walk away and abandon it just because you have hit a
spot of bother, albeit a very difficult and deep spot of bother.'

FT  24 AUG 92 / US warns citizens to avoid Mideast as hostility grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has warned its citizens to stay away from the Middle East, especially
Jordan, and from north Africa and south Asia, amid mounting Arab hostility
to its agreement with Britain and France to impose an air exclusion zone
over southern Iraq.
Details of the plan, under which Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd
parallel will be threatened with destruction, are expected to be announced
in the next 48 hours.
Most of Iraq's neighbours, in spite of their hostility to the regime of
President Saddam Hussein, have warned that the exclusion zone will increase
tension in the region and threatens to dismember a sovereign state. Iran,
Yemen, Syria, Jordan and Algeria have issued statements in support of Iraq's
territorial integrity and opposing the allied plan.
Egypt is also known to be concerned at the US action, and even Gulf
countries such as Bahrain, where Britain based its Tornado aircraft during
the Gulf war, have sought to head off further US involvement in Iraq. Only
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are believed to be fully behind renewed military
action.
Mr Kamel Abu Jaber, Jordan's foreign minister, appeared to sum up Arab fears
when he said: 'Any measure that aims at curtailing the unity of the Iraqi
people and its territorial safety will lead to destabilising the region's
security and subjects its states and people to dangerous options.'
Iraqi opposition groups and reports from Iran said yesterday that Shias in
the south had come under fresh attack from President Saddam's troops who
were using heavy artillery and tanks.
The aim of the allied air exclusion zone is to protect the Shias from
persecution by Baghdad in defiance of the regime's obligations imposed by UN
resolutions after the Gulf war ceasefire.
There is also a US threat to bomb other targets in Iraq if the regime
refuses to permit UN inspectors to enter government buildings to search for
evidence of weapons of mass destruction. An inspection team is expected to
return to Baghdad next week.
The US said last week that Mr Saddam was planning 'genocide' against the
Shia population.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Kuwait plans to spend Dollars 12bn on building up armed
forces
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT has allocated an extra KD3.5bn (Dollars 12bn) to spend on buying
advanced weapons and building up its armed forces over the next 12 years,
Reuter reports from Kuwait.
A decree from the Emir, issued late on Saturday, said the government was
authorised to draw the KD3.5bn from its general reserves and add it to money
already allocated to bolster Kuwait's defences.
'The Higher Defence Council is authorised to allocate the sums needed for
every financial year for 12 years beginning from the financial year
1992/1993,' the decree said.
'Those sums which are not spent in every year will be transferred to the
subsequent year.'
It was not clear exactly what was meant by the amount already allocated for
Kuwait's defence. Economists said they believed money drawn from the KD3.5bn
would most likely not be included in budget projections, but would be added
to final accounts drawn up at the end of each fiscal year.
Kuwait raised defence spending in fiscal 1991/1992 five-fold from the
previous year but the increase was mainly due to huge contributions towards
the costs of allied forces which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation.
Kuwait has not announced a defence allocation for its current 1992-1993
budget, which foresees a drop in total spending to KD4bn from an estimated
KD6.2bn in 1991/1992.
But it has said non-recurring war costs would fall to KD2.21bn in 1992/1993
from KD4.5bn the previous year.
Diplomats say Kuwait's plans to overhaul its armed forces and buy hundreds
of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, helicopters, artillery and air
defence systems are still being worked out.
No exact breakdown is available, but economists say the emirate's general
reserves and overseas assets have dwindled to less than Dollars 40bn from
Dollars 100bn before Iraq's invasion because of heavy Gulf war spending.

AZERBAIJANI warplanes bombed the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh at
the weekend, killing dozens of civilians, Russian television said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
An evening news report showed people being dragged from the debris of a
refugee hostel it said was destroyed on Saturday when an aircraft dropped
two bombs on the Karabakh capital, Stepanakert. Some 40 people were reported
killed in Saturday's attack by Su-25 planes and 100 wounded. Others died in
a raid yesterday.
A spokesman for the Karabakh Committee, which represents ethnic Armenians in
the enclave, said many more had been killed and injured. Bomb attacks killed
several people in the nearby town of Shusha on Saturday.
'The main victims were old people, women and children. Many of them remain
under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the clearing of which is made more
difficult by the panic which has gripped people,' the Armenian news agency
said. Azerbaijan has made no statement.
More than 2,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting between
the former Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The conflict is
mainly in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave within
Azerbaijan. But it has spread to wide areas along the border between the two
Caucasian neighbours, both members of the Commonwealth of Independent States
which replaced the old Soviet Union.
Russian TV showed Azeri aircraft dropping what it said were half-tonne bombs
on Stepanakert. A string of Armenian victories earlier this year succeeded
for a time in driving enemy forces out of Nagorno-Karabakh. But Azerbaijan
has since seized the initiative, regaining a foothold in the territory and
capturing Armenian land. Peace negotiations and several attempted ceasefires
have foundered.

<TEXT>
MOST of France's jails returned to normal at the weekend as prison officers
reported for work after last week's strike, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Officers at most of the country's 175 prisons called off their industrial
action on Saturday following an offer by Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice
minister, to recruit an extra 730 staff in response to demands for increased
manning and better protection against violence.
The government attempted yesterday to force the remaining strikers to return
to work by threatening to invoke legislation from the 1950s denying public
employees working in sensitive sectors - including the police, magistrates
and prison officers - the right to strike.
Last week's action was in protest over the murder of a warder by an inmate
at Rouen jail. It created chaos in prisons and riot police were drafted in
to restore order.
Ministers, who have faced a series of industrial disputes throughout spring
and summer, are anxious to stabilise the political climate in France ahead
of next month's Maastricht referendum.

FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A case of getting the timing right - The
prospective flotation of Woolcombers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'KARATE helps keep me calm in stressful situations', says Mr Alan Lewis, a
black belt, second dan, who trains three times a week with the top rated
karate teacher in the UK.
He is also a committed Christian, head of CBI Eastern Europe - established
to boost trade with eastern Europe - and a Lancastrian who controls a string
of textiles companies in the traditional enemy heartland of Yorkshire. Next
month he plans to float on the stock market a minority stake in part of his
textiles empire.
It may not be an easy task, even for as resolute and stress-free a man as Mr
Lewis.
He has a strong track record in his favour. At 54, he has had almost four
decades of picking bright business ideas and turning them into a lot of
cash.
He left school in 1953 at 15 and, after training in printing, made his first
fortune by car dealing and redeveloping depressed garage sites.
He then bought loss-making textiles companies, moving them into the property
business or making them profitable and selling. His timing was spot on: he
got out of markets just before the crash of 1973 and moved to Barbados.
He returned in 1975, when the recession was at its deepest, to buy property
shares. The remnants of the Slater Walker financial empire now form his
Anglo-Manx Bank.
In 1979 his ambitions settled on a troubled giant of the textiles world,
Illingworth Morris. The company had fallen on hard times, beset by
interminable squabbles between the board and 46 per cent shareholder Mrs
Pamela Mason, a Hollywood chat show hostess and former starlet who had
married actor James Mason.
She had inherited control of the company from her father, Isadore Ostrer, a
penniless Lithuanian Jew who had arrived in Britain at the turn of the
century. He rose from clerk to merchant banker (Ostrer Brothers) and ran the
Gaumont British Picture Corporation cinema concern before it was sold to J
Arthur Rank.
Ostrer died in 1975 and his heir's eclectic ownership style include board
appointments such as Mr Caspar Weinberger, who left to become President
Reagan's defence secretary, and Mr Tommy Yeardye, a hairdressing tycoon and
former escort of British film sex symbol Diana Dors.
As the company's share price and profits slid, and death taxes officials
pressed their claims on Mrs Mason, the corporate predators closed in.
It took four years for Mr Lewis to win the takeover battle. He outlasted
rival bidders, endured the Mason family's court battles over control of the
inheritance, and emerged triumphant from a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation.
His record during Illingworth's relatively stress-free quoted days was one
of shareholder-pleasing profits growth. In 1982, Illingworth shares traded
at 18p. In 1989 he paid 185p a share to take the company private, promising
to one day return it to the market.
But Mr Lewis's effectiveness stands in sharp contrast to the patchy
investment record of the textiles industry.
There were only a handful of flotations in the 1980s and most hit trouble.
One clothing manufacturer, Babygro, was sold within a year for one third of
its initial market capitalisation. Others fell into loss, were forced to
restructure or to pass dividends.
The company Mr Lewis intends to float, Woolcombers Group, is a different
beast. It deals with raw materials rather than clothing. It never assumes
ownership of the wool in its charge, rather it earns a 'tariff' per
kilogramme to turn raw wool into a material suitable for spinning into yarn.
This means that turnover and profits are related to volume of business
rather than the wool price. The link to volume is one of two main reasons
for the timing of the flotation.
Most textiles companies suffered badly over the past three years as a
halving of wool prices played havoc with the valuation of stocks.
But the price falls have helped sustain demand at levels about 10 per cent
below those in the late 1980s. Low prices should mean steady demand and high
volume, the right formula for Woolcombers.
The second reason is that the company has only just emerged from another
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation, this time into the
acquisition of Jarmain, a commission wool scouring company that is now one
of the three divisions of Woolcombers Group.
Mr Lewis's strategy - 'to become number one in the UK and Europe' - worked
too well, according to the MMC. It found that his companies had 52 per cent
of the UK commission wool scouring market. Between 1990, when Mr Lewis took
control, and this year, Jarmain increased annual turnover by 43 per cent to
Pounds 6.4m but trebled operating profit to Pounds 733,000.
In July this year, after more than two years of MMC probing, Mr Lewis agreed
to mothball one of his wool scouring lines for a year - another running
alongside is now operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week - and for two
more to be closed or sold.
He still controls enough of the industry to implement scouring tariff rises.
July's 8 per cent increase, the first in two years, will be followed by
another in January. The combination could double operating profits.
Woolcombers Group also dominates other markets. It has 84 per cent of UK
lanolin production and about 15 per cent of the Pounds 35m world market. It
has patents to a treatment called Superwash that makes wool shrink
resistant. Superwash has 72 per cent of its market in the UK. Capacity has
just been doubled with a new line and the company has licensed the
technology to Italy and the US.
Mr Lewis is resigned to further encounters with the MMC. 'We are major
players in these sectors. We are bound to come across them again.' he says.
His record of profitability and success in dealing with the MMC may be
enough to persuade the City to dip into the purse for the first textiles
flotation of the 1990s.
But there will be two prejudices to dispel first: a decades-long mistrust of
the textiles industry based on disappointing financial performance, and a
more recent fear of tycoons with quoted companies who maintain parallel
private and offshore vehicles. The Lewis empire now consists of several
offshore vehicles including the Anglo Manx Bank, as well as 55 UK private
companies in property, finance and textiles.
The fact that he intends to keep majority control of Woolcombers Group is
unlikely to reassure fund managers.

FT  24 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading water treatment works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BALFOUR BEATTY has been awarded a Pounds 12.5m design and construct contract
for the modemisation of the Tittesworth Water Treatment Works by Severn
Trent Water, with Acer Engineering acting as engineer.
The contract will be executed by an internal collaboration between the water
industry unit and the central unit of Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering, with
Balfour Beatty Projects &amp; Engineering providing the detailed design.
Located two kilometres north of Leek, Staffordshire, the existing works
treats water from Tittesworth Reservoir by conventional gravity
clarification and sand filtration, to a design typical of its period, the
1960s.
The new works will replace the existing plant, with enhanced technology
comprising clarification by dissolved air flotation (DAF), first stage sand
filtration, second stage sand filtration and disinfection.
This treatment stream includes dosing systems for various different
treatment chemicals and systems for waste water reclamation and sludge
disposal. Also included in the contract, which is scheduled for completion
in the autumn of 1994, is refurbishment of the ancillary plant.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I PASSED a building site recently. There is not much building work in London
at present, given that construction is one of the 97,500 UK industries to
have received a pitiless booting from John Major, Norman Lamont, and their
masters at the Treasury. But this site was active. A man was at work:
probably late 20s, yobbo-jeaned, forehead invisible, knuckles dangling, the
Sun in his pocket, leering at passing women. He was working amid fumes and a
blaze of sparks, doing something to a girder. He was drowning in sweat.
I started to feel sorry for him, until I remembered that I have stopped
feeling sorry for Sun readers. I was transfixed, instead, by the thought
that there were no imaginable circumstances in which I would be capable of
doing what he was doing unless forced into it as a prisoner of war. We were
virtually different species. Our paths had diverged.
But it has given me an idea. For those of us who were at our desks this week
and not basting ourselves in Fiji, the most cheering news was the
proposition by Teresa Gorman, Billericay's Conservative MP, that for every
UK business that went bankrupt from now on, the government should sack a
civil servant at the Treasury - starting with the permanent secretary.
The Gorman plan won immediate support, in The Times, from macho pundit
Anatole Kaletsky, whose blow-torching of the Treasury and its do-nothing
smugness has been one of the summer's highlights for those who read good
newspapers.
It must be terrible to be torched by Kaletsky. The Gorman plan, he wrote,
should be put into effect immediately, with just one amendment to make it
fair. 'The mandarins should be given until Christmas to produce a clear
economic recovery. If they failed, the first ritual sacking, of Sir Terence
Burns, the present permanent secretary, would be set for New Year's Day.'
This could transform government policy overnight. While Lamont and Major
deserved part of the blame for the length and depth of the recession, 'the
greater culprits have been the Treasury officials who have been telling them
how to act, speak and think at each step of the economy's long decline. The
doctrine of ministerial responsibility, far from ensuring a democratically
accountable government, has long been a shield to hide the incompetence of
the top civil servants who make most of the government's decisions.'
The Gorman-Kaletsky plan would undoubtedly work, but it would succeed more
speedily with an additional refinement - if the mandarins knew in advance
what fate awaited them after January 1. Sacking is not enough. They would
retreat to their Dorset or Tuscan properties, spend their time pottering,
swim in lazy pools, sit among their roses, read Petronius and Seneca - and
thumb their noses at us from the comfort of retirement.
Instead, they must be punished. If the British economy is ever to recover,
the mandarins must know what lies in store if they fail to gird their loins
and get things moving. They must be put out to real work.
We will start with Sir Terence on January 1. We won't just sack him. We will
send him to live in Catford, give him a pair of jeans, some size 13 boots,
make him read the Sun, watch Eldorado, ride on public transport, work on a
building site, out in all weathers, cope with sparks and fumes, learn what a
girder is - a dog's life for Terry. We will see how he likes a taste of his
own medicine.
From New Year's Day - I promise - we will hear less and less rubbish from
the Treasury ventriloquists and their dummies: no gain without pain,
unemployment a price worth paying, vital not to throw the baby out,
credibility all important, things safe with us, old man, we know what we're
doing.
That should provide us with a memorable January 1. On January 2 we will sack
the second highest Treasury mandarin. I do not know his name. That is the
point. Mandarins are furtive, creatures of the shadows, never brought to
book. Which is what we would be changing. We would appoint the second
Treasury mandarin to the post of chief council tax collector in the borough
of Brent. January 3: rat-catching in the Chunnel.
January 3 is followed by January 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and so on. Of course it would work. By February we would
be humming; by March, in fine heart; by April, ruling Europe.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Victory for human ingenuity: The checkerboard battle between
God and a computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS POSSIBLE that at about 7pm this evening the human race will absorb a
big dent to its collective pride. That is when a draughts (or checkers)
match between the world's strongest-ever player of the game and a computer
designed to beat him is scheduled to end.
The human, Dr Marion Tinsley, a mathematics professor from Talahassee,
Florida, has been the strongest exponent of what Americans call checkers
since 1955. During that time Dr Tinsley has lost only five games.
On Wednesday, at the match venue, London's Park Lane Hotel, the good doctor
lost the sixth game of his career to Chinook, a computer programed by
Jonathan Schaeffer of the University of Alberta, Canada. Tinsley was, by all
accounts, astounded by the denouement of this game, and just marginally
consoled by the fact that he had won the only previous decisive encounter of
the best-of-40 series.
According to The Times, if Dr Tinsley does lose the match 'another fragment
of man's dominion will have been stripped away by the microchip.' Tinsley
takes the thing even more metaphysically. He is that most American thing, a
born-again Christian. 'I'm sure I have a better programer than Chinook has.
God gave me a logical mind,' Tinsley told The Independent. 'I don't want to
let my programer down, and I'm sure I won't'
I know how Dr Tinsley feels. Three years ago I challenged the world's
strongest chess program, Deep Thought, to a game. Earlier that year, Deep
Thought, programed at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and partly
funded by the CIA, had started to beat grandmasters in tournament play.
My theory was that the chess masters were losing because they played against
Deep Thought as if they were dealing with a human. They were trying to
out-calculate the brute. And since Deep Thought assessed 750,000 positions a
second that was attacking the enemy at his strongest point. My (not very
original) theory was that one should attack at the machine's weak point -
strategy.
I took on Deep Thought by telephone. Each of us was allotted 30 minutes for
all moves. I had not played tournament chess for years, but everything
seemed to work like a charm. By avoiding violent contact, and posing only
positional rather than tactical threats, I achieved a winning position. But
then came the problem. To win even the most overwhelming position, it is
necessary to engage in some tactics. I could not find a way through, and
lost on time.
'Tough game,' said the programer down the line with the condescension
typical of a victorious human. In reality, it is no sort of triumph for a
computer to beat the mind of Dominic Lawson, although chess, with its
1,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000 (or 1044)
possible positions, is hardly susceptible to the exhaustive analysis
favoured by the electronic brain. The number of possible draughts positions,
however, is thought to be no higher than the square root of that of chess,
which indicates that Dr Tinsley really is up against it.
I do not care much about draughts, and would not lose much sleep if it
became what mathematicians call a 'trivial' or solvable problem. But I would
grieve if that fate overtook chess. The game would die if grandmasters could
simply copy from the computer by rote all the best opening variations and
responses. They would themselves become enslaved by the computer's
omniscience; their artistic and creative achievements would be at an end.
Even now chess grandmasters routinely use computers in overnight end-game
analysis, and some brilliant variations attributed to certain unscrupulous
grandmasters should in fact be attributed to the mind of the machine, or
rather to that of some computer scientist in Moscow or New York. And here
lies the point which I hope will not elude Dr Tinsley, should he lose his
match against Chinook later today.
Rather than become all maudlin and apocalyptic at the thought that his
God-given brain has been bested by a soulless computer, Dr Tinsley should
use his logical mind to work out that the brain of Jonathan Schaeffer,
Chinook's programer, is no more or less a creation of God than his own
cerebral cortex. If Marion Tinsley loses the title he has held for 37 years,
he will be a victim of human ingenuity.

FT  22 AUG 92 / From currencies to currents: Alison Streeter, forex dealer
and cross-channel swimmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN COURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALISON Streeter is something of a long-distance specialist. During the week
she trades in Far Eastern currencies in the foreign exchange dealing room at
Standard Chartered Bank in London. The rest of the time, she swims. She is a
marathon swimmer.
She has covered the equivalent of an Atlantic crossing. It is a good counter
to the pressures of work, she says. 'Either it's been really quiet and you
haven't been able to make any money, or it's been so hectic that you didn't
know where the next million was coming from. Then you can go home in the
evening and thrash it out on the swimming pool.'
Alison's relentless front crawl has powered her round the Isle of Wight,
Jersey and Manhatten Island, up and down the tidal Thames from Richmond to
Gravesend, and across the Catalina Channel in California. She has crossed
from Capri to Naples, and from Ireland to Scotland and back.
But it is to the grey waters of the English Channel that Alison returns time
and again. She is 28 next Saturday and has recorded a total of 18
cross-Channel swims since her first in 1982.
Alison is the first woman to have swum a three-way Channel crossing. That
was two years ago. It took 34 hours and 40 minutes, with 10-minute breaks
allowed at either end. The swim was almost her last.
'I nearly died of asphyxiation. My throat had swollen up so much with 34
hours of salt water non-stop that I could hardly breathe. We just about
finished in time.'
A successful Channel crossing during the week of neap tides that started
yesterday would equal the women's record of 19 crossings held by Canada's
Cynthia Nicholas. A further push, planned for next month, would make Alison
Queen of the Channel.
What is the attraction? 'When I'm in the middle of the Channel, I think:
'What am I doing here? I can't believe I'm doing this again.' It's yourself
against the elements. It's not racing against other people, but it's how you
compete against the tide and the wind. Although I've done 18 crossings now,
every swim has been different. That's what I like about it.'
Alison has a ready smile, a weather-beaten face and the build you would
expect of the carbohydrate-loading pasta binges which are part of the
long-distance swimmer's training. She is stocky, with broad shoulders and
powerful arms. Her brown hair is cut in tight curls to fit under her bathing
cap.
Closer inspection reveals her latest battle scars. There are abrasions on
her neck, caused by the rubbing of her bathing cap on skin not covered with
enough of the grease that marathon swimmers use. On her upper arm is a red
patch where the skin has been rubbed raw by swimming. Below is another
graze: the remains of a jellyfish sting.
Her voice is slightly wheezy. She started swimming in childhood to combat
bad asthma and discovered she had a long-distance swimmer's endurance and
lung capacity. After thousands of miles and hours in the water, what keeps
her going?
'All my swims have been sponsored for charity. I keep thinking that there's
a lot of other people who are less fortunate.'
Alison has raised Pounds 65,000 for charities, particularly for leukaemia
research and Across, which provides holidays for sick and handicapped
people.
Alison's father contracted leukaemia, which has since been cured, and that
fuelled her desire to help fight the disease. Her mother is also her
trainer; it is her parents, she says, who have helped her most.
Before starting a swim she psyches herself for the marathon ahead. Once in
the water, however, things are different.
'The biggest problem is boredom. In the first hour, you're already bored and
cold and tired, with another 10 hours ahead. Once you're over half-way you
try and gear your mind to blanking everything out. That seems to make the
time go a lot quicker.'
Brief hourly rests help break the monotony. 'But you have to make sure you
don't stop concentrating. I've often found myself under the hull of the
boat, very close to knocking myself out.'
On her latest swim, a two-way crossing on August 6, a cross-Channel ferry
passed within 50 metres at full speed, leaving Alison to struggle through
its wash. Other hazards have included jellyfish, which attacked her during a
crossing from Ireland to Scotland.
'I was stung non-stop for four hours. Eventually I was pulled out of the
water, unconscious from the poison. They only managed to grab me out of the
water by my finger-tips as I was going down.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Private View: The philosopher who believes in tarot and God
 -Christian Tyler meets The many-sided Michael Dummett and finds that
arguing with a logic professor can be taxing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHAEL Dummett is an expert on the game of tarot. Most people associate
tarot cards only with fortune-telling, with gypsies in tents. Since Michael
Dummett is also Wykeham Professor of Logic in the University of Oxford, this
upsets him very much.
It is not just that his treatise on the early-15th century Italian card game
gets stashed away in the 'Occult' section of bookshops; his reputation as a
serious - some would say brilliant - philosopher is compromised.
The professor's fascination with tarot is a kind of antidote to another of
this many-sided man's passions: race relations. Dummett not only believes
that Britain's immigration policy amounts to a coded encouragement of
racism, he has suffered for his beliefs.
In 1967, he was arrested with his wife, Ann - a former director of the
Runnymede trust and a race relations professional - for demonstrating
outside an Oxford hairdresser which refused to serve black customers.
(Charges were dropped and the home secretary, Roy Jenkins, apologised).
Life has its hazards for the philosopher with a conscience. When Dummett
publishes his extra-curricular views - as he did in The Tablet in June,
saying Oxford undergraduates could no longer write decent English and that
the meaning of the terms 'university' and 'degree' was being shamelessly
diluted - he is, inevitably, accused of illogicality.
'Everyone thinks of that joke,' he said. 'It's absolutely maddening. I can't
write a letter to the newspaper without some idiot writing and saying 'If
that's logic, then I'm a blah, blah . . .'
Dummett is a non-ideological left-winger who resigned from the Labour Party
in 1956 because the Hungarian workers' call for a sympathy strike was
rejected by the Trades Union Congress and suppressed by the British media.
He likes jazz and used to read a lot of science fiction. What is more, he
believes in God.
I thought professors of logic were supposed to be atheist, I said.
Dummett laughed in astonished disbelief. 'Why do you say that?'
Most people would say it was contradictory.
'Well, that's a very thoughtless thing to say. Why should they say that?'
The prospect of having to argue with the Wykeham Professor of Logic at
Oxford - before lunch, too - was unappetising. I muttered something about
mediaeval superstition having been swept away by the fresh air of
rationalism.
If there's no contradiction, I said, can you explain why not?
'You'd need to point out the contradiction.'
I experienced an inward struggle. I cited materialism, the philosophical
theory that says mind, soul and personality are just names for bundles of
physiological occurrences. If you believe in God, I asked, do you need to be
a philosopher at all?
'I've sometimes thought that if I didn't believe in God, I wouldn't think it
was worth going on with philosophy. So it's just the opposite of what you
say. As for the things you're talking about, they are superstitions.
Materialism is one modern superstition, and determinism is another.
'When you talk about materialism, you need to be clear first what
constitutes matter. It's not a very easy question to answer, actually.'
The professor took pity on me. 'Obviously, there's a contradiction between
believing in God and being an out-and-out materialist. But I don't think to
be a professor of logic you need to be an out-and-out materialist. In fact,
I think it is indefensible. So, I'm still perplexed about the contradiction.
I think it's only to do with the zeitgeist that religious belief is
intellectually extremely unfashionable.'
Dummett was the son of non-practising Anglicans who rejected religion in
adolescence but converted to Catholicism before he was 20. I asked if it had
been a reasoning process.
'Yes, that's right. It wasn't through contacts at all.'
So you got there by yourself?
'I got there by myself.'
Dummett sat in the corner of a deep sofa, eyes half closed, chain-smoking
cigarettes. Once, without even looking, he reached in his shirt pocket and
swapped cigarette holders in mid-smoke. At times he pondered deeply,
sage-like, before replying; at others, he chuckled heartily through his
words and looked like a tubby schoolboy.
I wondered if there was a connection between his philosophy and his other
views. Is it possible, I asked, that philosophers incline to one or other
opinion merely out of temperament?
'Yes, it's certainly possible. But the value of their work lies in the
strength of their arguments or otherwise. It doesn't matter why they believe
what they do.'
Are your political views the result of temperament?
'I wouldn't put it as strongly as that. But I think you're quite right. They
don't come from patient exploration of the kind philosophers go in for
professionally. I hope they're coherent with my other views, but they
certainly don't stem from philosophical work at all.'
When I suggested that the popular picture of a professor of logic was of a
sexless, cold-blooded creature, a brain-in-a-bowl, not a leftish political
activist with five children, he was tickled.
'Why? I don't think professors of logic have to be any one kind of person.
Of course, when you're engaged in philosophical enquiry, you've got to be
very careful to follow arguments where they lead. But that doesn't seem to
me to mean you shouldn't react strongly to injustice or hatred or
oppression.'
He was not so amused when I asked him if he understood racism and could
sympathise with xenophobes.
'No, I don't sympathise with them at all.'
Isn't it natural to fear and resent . . .
'I don't know what's human and natural,' he interrupted. 'It may be human
and natural to behave as people are behaving in Bosnia at the moment. But it
has to be curbed.
'I really don't know whether, if conditions were different, English people
would be yelling for the expulsion of the Scots, killing them, destroying
their houses and putting them in camps. I mean, it's also human and natural
to behave to other people in a decent way.'
Do you get emotional to the point where you can't concentrate on your work?
'I suppose you could say that. When I was heavily involved with immigration,
that took an awful lot out of me. For some years I did my teaching and
lecturing but didn't attempt to do any creative work. These are very
distressing things, particularly if you deal with individual people in
trouble.'
Dummett's fame is due to his interpretation of Gottlob Frege, the German
pioneer of mathematical logic. The theme of his life's work has been to
remove the metaphorical traps in arguments for and against the real
existence of things - whether objects, numbers or mental states - and to
show that realism is much harder to defend than people think it is.
He agreed that philosophy - but not only philosophy - is suffering in an age
when an economic justification is sought for everything that costs public
money.
Does philosophy make progress?
'I wouldn't engage in it if I didn't think progress was made - although some
philosophers think differently. One can't easily ask what are the
established results of thousands of years of philosophy.' He laughed
cheerfully.
But I did ask what impact philosophy has had on the way we behave.
The professor went into deep thought for a long two minutes. He surfaced and
said: 'Well, I think - this is not a thing I'm totally happy with - the way
in which people are disposed to make a distinction between what's a fact and
what's an evaluation. That's a very crude effect but it is an effect.'
Nor had philosophy been squeezed out by science. 'The most obvious example
is the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Scientists can use the theory
but they don't know what it means exactly. When they debate that, they are
doing philosophy. The aim of philosophy is understanding what you can
already deal with in a restricted context.'
Dummett retires at the end of next month. Such is the state of university
finances, a replacement for the post he inherited from A J Ayer has not yet
been chosen. He plans to revise two of his philosophy books and to write a
successor to his 1984 book Voting Procedures which, he thinks, did not sell
because it was too mathematical. Typically, he will not be setting out with
a conclusion, to advertise his preferred brand of proportional
representation (PR).
'I'm reluctant to say it's about PR because I don't even accept the normal
definition of PR. It must be intelligible, even to people who shudder at the
sight of an equation. I realise that to get people interested there mustn't
be any equations at all.' The Wykeham Professor of Logic roared with
laughter.
Underneath, perhaps he is afraid his book on electoral reform will also end
up on the shelf marked 'Occult.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Going Dutch in the Gallery - Low Countries paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN past times, 'Seventy-Six Notable Paintings of the Dutch Golden Age' could
have served as the title for the National Gallery of Scotland's beautiful
exhibition. What you will see - hung rather too densely for comfort - is a
feast of paintings by Rembrandt, Hals, Cuyp, Saenredam, Ruisdael, Steen, and
de Hooch, plus a host of other Dutch 17th Century masters.
Such an over-stuffed exhibition demands several visits. Upstairs, too, there
is a subsidiary display showing Dutch artists' influence on Scottish
painters such as Sir David Wilkie and on miscellaneous other artists in the
Gallery.
But however many visits you make, it would surely be impossible to part
without a pang from two inexpressibly poetic late landscapes by Jacob van
Ruisdael, A View of Haarlem from the Bleaching Grounds and A Distant View of
Alkmaar. They belong to the Earl of Wemyss and March and have not been
publicly exhibited since 1957.
Given all that, one might ask whether there could be anything much wrong
with Dutch Art and Scotland: A Reflection of Taste. But the flabby title
hints at a fundamental problem with the way the show has been conceived -
even though visitors can perfectly well ignore it and simply concentrate on
enjoying the pictures.
The difficulty comes from the so-called relevance of these masterpieces to
Scotland. Plugging Scotland obviously makes sense politically and as a
marketing ploy. Edinburgh must be one of the only public galleries in the
world where guards wear national costume, namely those fetching tartan trews
 -also sported at the show's opening by the director, Mr Timothy Clifford.
But who can really think it matters that all these masterpieces have at one
time or another been owned by Scots? Or rather, to be absolutely accurate,
nearly all of them. One that was not, Domenicus Van Wijnen's hallucinatory
Temptation of St Anthony was for a period kept in Scotland by Arthur Kay, an
English Edwardian collector with a passion for Scotland. Eventually, he gave
this exceedingly peculiar picture to the National Gallery of Ireland.
Almost the first painting in the exhibition is Daniel Mytens's full-length
portrait of the third Marquis of Hamilton, resplendent in silver-grey silk,
painted in the 1620s when Mytens was in England. Tracing the many
connections between wealthy Scottish connoisseurs and contemporary Dutch art
of the 17th and 18th Century really does add up to something.
In fact, it could be the beginnings of a rather fascinating sideline to the
Festival if you tracked down other Dutch artists active in independent
Scotland, for example at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh and Hopetoun House,
the spectacular house just outside the city which Festival-goers ought to
put on their maps.
A diligent catalogue points out that in the 17th and 18th centuries there
were particularly close and fruitful links between Scotland and the
Netherlands. Here were two small countries with an expertise in banking, an
intellectual passion for Roman law, shared Calvinist convictions (hence, it
is claimed, Scottish patrons particularly appreciated moralising Dutch
pictures), and a passion for golf.
For that period, at least, the theme of Scots-Dutch cultural relations works
fine. But things become far more tenuous in the case of figures who did not
buy Dutch art, but merely inherited it.
One notable case is the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, who in the
late-18th century acquired superb Dutch paintings by marriage to the heiress
of the Northamptonshire family of Montagu. (By the way, another outing well
worth making is to Boughton House at Kettering, the superb house and
art-collection of the Dukes of Buccleuch, open on August afternoons.)
From another Buccleuch house, Drumlanrig Castle, comes the most beautiful of
the cabinet paintings in the exhibition, a Wooded Landscape by Moonlight by
Van der Neer, and also two paintings which were sold this century:
Rembrandt's celebrated Flora, lent by the National Gallery in London, and
the late Self-Portrait of 1659, now in Washington.
But do such ins and outs of provenance really add up to very much?
Sometimes, admittedly, they can be piquant. One of my favourite paintings in
the exhibition is a large Cuyp, The Riding Lesson, which shows gentlemen
schooling their horses on a golden afternoon. Now in Toledo, Ohio, it was
looted from the Rothschilds for that assiduous non-Scottish collector,
Hermann Goering.
There are 10 Rembrandts - or nearly Rembrandts depending on your view of
recent de-attributions - in the exhibition, including Titus at his Desk from
Rotterdam and the Queen's An Old Woman, both recently exhibited in London,
so it is nice they have now travelled north.
Five of these great paintings belong to Scottish public collections; the
famous Self Portrait aged 51 has been on loan from the Dukes of Sutherland
to the Gallery in Edinburgh since 1946. The famous Woman in Bed came to the
Gallery thanks to William MacEwan of the brewing dynasty. In the 1880s,
depressed that Scotland could boast no Rembrandt on public view, he
presented the Trustees with Pounds 5,000 and told them to buy the first
decent Rembrandt which came on the market. Now there is a case of patriotism
and taste - a moral example to modern magnates, north and south of the
Border.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: A chat with Mr Nissan-san - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY'S Radio 4 Conversation Piece was better than its throwaway title
suggests, for its focus was Ian Gibson, Managing Director of the Nissan
factory in Sunderland. Mr Gibson has an open-plan office, where he works in
Nissan uniform (not an overall, even if others wear the same kit).
Some 80 per cent of his workers are locally engaged and trained; half of
them had been long unemployed or never employed at all, and all the senior
posts come from internal promotion. The trouble over the UK Nissan
distributor is an entirely separate affair. Presenter Sue MacGregor kept the
talk very interesting.
Poets and Places make a good association for Radio 4's Tuesday series, but
the places don't always live up to the poetry. Last week we had Larkin,
whose place had to be Hull, not the most romantic place in the country. Next
week we have Betjeman, paired with his holiday area in Cornwall, less
characteristic than the London suburbs.
But this week, Housman, whose verse almost sprouts from his young days among
the Shropshire lads. Presenter John Florance, with Jane Caulcott of the
Housman Society, had to open with 'the blue, remembered hills', and soon
began to match the names - Wenlock, Abdon, Ludlow, Clun, but oddly not
Bredon - with the country and its history. Of the poet himself, we were told
little - a happy childhood, later distress from his illicit affection for
Moses Jackson. The verse reading was poor.
Jackson might have taken a higher place, for many poems deal sub rosa with
Housman's liking for young farm lads and sadness at the 'laws of God, the
laws of man' that prevented its celebration. Though the incidence of suicide
in the county may not have been as high as his lines suggest, the fatal
emotions were surely his own, not those of some Shropshire Terence.
The Edinburgh Festival must compete for its place on Radio 3 with the Proms
and the Texaco Trophy matches with Pakistan, but it began well with
Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron on Sunday and Tchaikovsky string quartets the
next three mornings, wrapped around discussions between Peter Diamand and
John Drummond, both former Festival directors. The Summer Season drama goes
on, but I would rather leave it unreported.
The most interesting play I heard was Dr Barry, the first of a Radio 4
series, Who Sings the Hero?, that will tell about heroes. The week's subject
was a woman, her birth and upbringing unrecorded, who made a set of friends,
including Lord Erskine and Arthur Wellesley, so effectively as a child that
she was admitted to Edinburgh University Medical School (as a boy) when she
was 10. She pretended to be a man most of her life.
An unpopular posting to Plymouth led to an equally unpopular but more useful
posting to Cape Colony, where she reformed everything and was intimate (as
man or woman, who can say?) with the Governor, Lord Charles Somerset.
Reforms and promotions followed, until her unpopularity led to postings, and
promotions, to Mauritius, Jamaica, St Helena, Montreal. On leave from Corfu,
she visited Scutari, where she reformed, and annoyed Florence Nightingale.
In South Africa, she did a Caesarian with no anaesthetic, of which we heard
all the sounds, and had a baby of her own, though no details exist. In St
Helena she fought a duel, neither side being hit.
This was all narrated by Maggie MaCarthy in Jean Binnie's drama, with
Veronica Quilligan as Barry. Martin Jenkins directed.
Gary Lineker is one of my favourite public figures, so I naturally listened
to Radio 5's Gary Lineker's Football Night, on Wednesday, where he was a
presenter, not only for football but for athletics. So far he sounds much
like other sports presenters. Mostly I heard the commentary on the game
between Villa and Leeds; I had to wait for half-time for Lineker.

<DATELINE>
   THIS festival has three main themes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and the playwrights Harley
Granville-Barker and CP Taylor. One is endlessly rewarding, one is a flawed
delight, and one is very patchy indeed. So it seems at the end of this first
week.
The one big CP Taylor success so far has been the Greenwich Theatre Company
production of Schippel, already reviewed in these pages this summer, and
playing in Edinburgh at the Church Hill Theatre. It is possible to find some
fault with the play, with its direction, with the cast - with everything
except the hilariously perfect David Bamber as Hiketier - but only when the
high level of the entire achievement has been recognised.
The play's mixture of farce and social satire, the slick polish and impish
wit of the production, and the verve and flair of all on stage have made
this one of the strongest theatre events this festival.
It does not prepare you for Walter or for The Ballachulish Beat. As Malcolm
Rutherford observed in Thursday's Financial Times, Walter is a bore, both
rambling and monotonous. The Ballachulish Beat, published in 1967 but never
performed before, tells a predictable tale about a failed political crusade
 -a Scottish rock group, the Keelies, innocently, sincerely and radically
left-wing, who are variously manipulated by corrupt or soulless management
and who then find themselves leading a radical youth revolution they can't
handle.
Unfortunately, Taylor's writing is crude, gimmicky, devoid of suspense or
subtlety. The many rock songs are all pastiche, but they're the one lively
element in the show.
No doubt that Taylor was a good idea as a theme playwright. His Scottish
origins, the Scottish themes in several of his plays, both make him
suitable; and the anti-highbrow manner of several of his plays must make him
appealing to those locals who find that the Edinburgh festival is
excessively genteel and intellectual. And Fifth Estate performs The
Ballachulish Beat in the Corn Exchange (next to some sheep pens and the
abattoir), a novel venue for the Festival but good for a show with so much
rock music.
One hopes, though, that the Taylor plays of this festival's second and third
weeks will show more sheer stagecraft. Walter and The Ballachulish Beat had
me wondering if the wit and command of Schippel are largely derived from the
Sternheim play on which Taylor based his.
Those in search of a well-made play have so far fared much better with
Harley Granville-Barker. There are parallels between the two playwrights -
both attended to the corrupting influence of capitalism, and neither was a
master of sheer stagecraft - but Barker is much the more absorbing.
There have been excellent five o'clock play-readings of Rococo and Farewell
to the Theatre, directed by William Gaskill, at the Lyceum. I think
Gaskill's staging of The Voysey Inheritance reveals Barker's incidental
weaknesses as a dramatist - so much exposition - but he has shown the range
and depth of Barker's mind. Both readings have included extensive narration
(spoken by Christopher Good), in prose that places Barker midway between
Dickens and PG Wodehouse.
Rococo is an engaging and impish trifle about the follies of a family feud:
who should inherit this repulsive but valuable vase?
Farewell to the Theatre, a duet between a leading actress on the brink of
retirement and a lawyer who has wooed her on and off for 30 years, is
something else. It opens window upon window: the relation of life and art;
theatre as imitation of life or as self-projection; a woman's independence;
a woman advancing through middle age. Susan Engel played the actress with
wisdom, charm and authority, her dancing eyes and constantly fresh pacing
animating the reading into theatrical life.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Playwright, actor and scholar - Man of the theatre
Harley Granville-Barker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMEONE should write a play about Harley Granville-Barker, the dramatist
whose works are being celebrated at this year's Edinburgh Festival. The
trouble is that hardly anyone would believe it and, like most of
Granville-Barker's own plays, it would have a dying fall.
To anyone who did A-level English, he is probably known mainly as the man
who wrote the Prefaces to Shakespeare. Yet those came later. Like EM
Forster, another English writer whose influence spanned a large part of the
century, Granville-Barker did most of his creative work before the first
world war.
Anyone who reads the Prefaces, however, must realise that they are the work
of a professional man of the theatre. When John Gielgud was playing King
Lear in 1940, Granville-Barker was called in briefly to coach him. The 10
days that the old pro gave to the production, Gielgud wrote afterwards,
'were the fullest in experience that I have ever had in all my years upon
the stage'.
Before the first world war, Granville-Barker was actor, writer, director,
manager and innovator par excellence. He did not actually discover George
Bernard Shaw, but he certainly brought him on. Shaw was rumoured (falsely)
to be Granville-Barker's natural father; his real, very obscure, father was
almost exactly Shaw's age.
At the Court Theatre in London's Sloane Square, Granville-Barker acted in
and directed Shaw's early and (some would say) best work. As an actor, Dover
Wilson, another Shakespearean scholar, wrote of him that he had 'the finest
voice that I have ever heard, on or off the stage.'
He also wrote himself. The Voysey Inheritance, his only work to have been
repeatedly revived over the years, was first performed at the Court in 1905,
the same month as Shaw's Major Barbara, and was again on show in Edinburgh
this week. Initially it was compared unfavourably. 'GB is simply GBS minus
S,' wrote one critic. With hindsight, however, we can see that that some of
Granville-Barker's output, though less prolific, was superior. It omits
Shaw's windyness.
The talent spread everywhere. Granville-Barker brought the best of
contemporary continental plays to the Court. In other theatres, he took a
fresh approach to Shakespeare. 'There is no such thing as a Shakespeare
tradition,' he wrote, 'only a text and a few stage directions.' He put on
the first full production The Winter's Tale in London for almost 50 years.
His direction of A Midsummer Night's Dream was as controversial in its time
as those subsequently by Peter Brooke and, this year, Robert LePage.
As a director, he resembled Stanislavki in his intensity, though that was
coincidence: the pair only met later. He insisted on the importance of
repertory theatre to give the actors variety. 'No man can act Hamlet eight
times a week; he can only repeat the performance.'
Along with the critic William Archer, he also developed a plan for a
national theatre which is remarkably close to the one that finally came into
being, even down to the site on London's south bank.
Yet something went wrong with this glittering career. One explanation was
the outbreak of the war, which severely hampered the London theatre. Another
was that arguably his best play, Waste, was censored. It was not performed
publicly until 1935. About a reforming politician who in a night of passion
produces a pregnancy leading to an abortion, it was too much for Edwardian
London to take. 'Waste has wasted me,' Granville-Barker wrote. Sadly, it is
not included in this year's festival.
There was also the problem of money - it kept running out - and disillusion
that his ideas for a national theatre were not more widely supported. The
commercial theatres were against it on the grounds that it might harm their
box office. Early in the war he went to America, touring Euripides at Yale.
He met, and fell in love with a woman 10 years his senior, called Helen
Huntington. She was already married into the railroad family of that name.
Granville-Barker was married to the actress Lillah McCarthy, whom he had
directed and starred with in the early Shaw plays at the Court.
There were divorces all around. Granville-Barker married Helen, Archer
Huntington made a remarkably generous financial settlement and the one-time
playwright-director was never poor again. He wrote two more plays, one of
which, His Majesty, will be performed for the first time in Edinburgh next
week. Gradually he turned his attention to the Prefaces.
His defection, if such it was, gave rise to a remarkable denunciation by the
actor, Lewis Casson. 'He was a hero who gave up the struggle, threw off the
dust of battle, and became a mere professor.'
In fact, there is evidence that he had long wanted to get down to academic
writing. In a little known work, Farewll to the Theatre, which had a
rehearsed reading in Edinburgh this week, he puts into the mouth of the
actress Dorothy words that could be his own. Dorothy has been a great star
and a great beauty in her time and is still going strong, but her debts are
catching up with her, and her lawyer is advising her that she should retire.
'But visions do come,' she says, 'of better things than we are. . . of a
theatre not tinselled. . . and an office not dusty with law. . . all
rustling with quarrelsome papers.' She goes on dramatically: 'Oh, my poor
theatre] Keep it for a while then to patronise and play with. But one day it
shall break you all in pieces. And now my last curtsey's made. . .'
That is what Granville-Barker has done. He came back to break (in the sense
of astonishing) us in two ways. One: his national theatre came into being.
Two: his plays are now being appreciated for the masterpieces that some of
them are.
In Edinburgh he has had the posthumous good fortune of The Voysey
Inheritance seeming more topical than ever because of its similarities to
the Maxwell affair. It is just possible that when Waste is revived again it
will coincide with a political scandal, for it, too, is remarkably fresh.
Granville-Barker died in 1946, just before the national theatre became a
real possibility. The best book about him is written, appropriately, by an
American, Dennis Kennedy.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Delights beyond Tchaikovsky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TCHAIKOVSKY is one of the household gods of this year's Edinburgh Festival.
But it is, of course, not all Tchaikovsky in the musical schedule.
Additional themes and sub-themes have been developed to amplify it with
exactly the quickened sense of variety that was so badly missed in the
planning of this festival over the last few years.
'Scottish Music Through the Centuries' is one such development: a
five-concert series stretching from austerely beautiful plainchant hymns to
St Columba and motets by Robert Carver (all sung with authority, but perhaps
a touch too respectfully, by Cappella Nova in Greyfriars Kirk) to James
MacMillan's new percussion concerto for Evelyn Glennie.
Another is the infusion into the Queen's Hall morning chamber-concert
programme of important young talent new to Edinburgh, or - in the case of
the young Scots pianist Steven Sloane, who followed hard on the heels of the
Borodin Quartet - new to a wider international audience.
Sloane, a recent Clara Haskil competition winner, gave a recital of Haydn,
Schubert and five of Messiaen's Vingt Regards that was substantial and full
of deep seriousness and musicianly feeling, in spite of a quality of
physical tension (simple nerves?) that seemed for long stretches to invade
his Schubert G major Sonata, D. 894, hardening the sound and limiting the
dramatic range.
Brightest new development of all is the provision of 10.30 pm recitals at
the Usher Hall - epilogues to the main concerts of the evening. At the
first, Ann Murray and Philip Langridge sang Das Lied von der Erde with Peter
Donohoe providing a leonine account of Mahler's own piano score. The absence
of orchestral timbres is at first a severe shock to Mahlerian expectations,
then a challenge that becomes ever more stimulating.
The effect is of encountering familiar images under new lights, clean,
plain, sometimes even rather harsh; while one misses the plangency of
Mahler's scoring, one is provoked to admire afresh the combination of
extreme intensity and economy in the musical inspiration. In purely vocal
terms neither of these distinguished singers was ideally apt for their
lines, yet both tapped resources of quiet eloquence therein unknown to many
more conventionally suitable Mahler voices. (In another late-night concert,
toward the end of the festival, Diana Montague, Anthony Rolfe Johnson and
Charles Mackerras will explore the Schoenberg chamber reduction of the same
score.)
The big Tchaikovsky event of the first festival week was to have been the
concert performance, by Scottish Opera forces under Mark Ermler, of The
Oprichnik, an early (1874), rare Grand Opera on a Russian-historical
subject. But misfortune struck. The title role had been confided to the
Russian tenor Paolo Kudryavchenko, a technically erratic singer at the best
of times; from his very first notes it became clear that he was in poor
vocal health, and though an announcement was made before the second half
craving our indulgence for a throat infection, the damage could not be
contained, and proved ever more extensive.
It would be unwise to form any confidently held opinion of the work on this
evidence alone: the wearisome heaviness of the brass scoring and
tub-thumping squareness of the public scenes, influenced by Meyerbeer, Auber
and Glinka equally, appear to be mitigated by much tenderly felt lyrical
invention for the leading female roles.
If, indeed, the evening was a not a total write-off, that was entirely to
the credit of fine singing from the mezzo-soprano Ludmila Nam and simply
glorious singing from the soprano Galina Gorchakova. That phenomenal Renata
in the Covent Garden Fiery Angel was no fluke: the possibilities of
Gorchakova's singer's instrument - ample, free-ranging, shot-silk in texture
and molten-hot in emotional colouring - now seem absolutely limitless.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR a moment Gene Kelly, possessed by recall, looks about 29. He reminisces:
'When we all worked together at MGM, we were an angry young group of people,
because musicals up to that time had been looked down on. Every good
director would say, 'Oh, one day I'll have some fun and make a musical.' And
some of them tried it and their films went right in the bucket. But making a
musical and not just having people yell at each other - not having them say
'I love you' and then burst into song  - that was hard work and it was new.'
So was Gene Kelly 50 years ago, and even newer 80 years ago. The man who
battles Fred Astaire for the title of American cinema's greatest
singer-dancer was born on August 23 1912. And back in 1942 a newcomer with
St Vitus feet and a head-cold singing voice came to MGM to make his first
musical.
Kelly became the most important thing that ever happened to that form.
Before him - before On The Town and An American in Paris and Singin' In The
Rain - song-and-dance movies, when not backstage stories, were about high
society folk kicking up their heels between Long Island parties. The
Astaire-Rogers films, shot in black and white like old New Yorker cartoons
come to life, set the style.
In came Kelly and MGM and almost overnight musicals were multi-coloured and
so were their social spectrums. 'The big difference between me and Fred -
and we always got angry when critics said we were like two peas in a pod -
is that in his musicals everyone was always rich. Even if they did a
divertissement with poor people, they all had tailored clothes] It was like
Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice: she had an apron designed by
Givenchy or someone. It was a whole different age.'
Some filmgoers, myself included, do not go back to the Astaire age, except
via TV re-showings in which the Incredible Stick Insect and Ginger dance
everywhere from bandstands to banana boats. I like Top Hat and Roberta, but
I grew up with Kelly's films and like them more. Postwar baby-boomers
preferred their musicals grounded in a real world with real colours and
characters.
Kelly today - we met at his modest but maximum-security hacienda off Sunset
Boulevard - is a gracious, fatherly gent with a cardigan and balding
no-toupee pate. The tenor-adenoidal voice is hoarser than when it sang in
the rain back in 1952, but it still transmits tremors of recognition:
especially when, to illustrate the genesis of the musical cinema's
best-known solo number, Kelly breaks into the vamp from Singin' In The Rain.
'Do-de-do-doo-do-de-doo-de-do-doo. . . That was Roger's idea' - Roger Edens,
MGM music arranger - 'and it gave me the 'in' to the number that I wanted. I
can't escape that song. It's become a classic, and I'm deeply grateful for
that.'
Singin' In The Rain - chalk up another birthday, it is 40 this year - has
topped poll after poll as everyone's favourite screen musical. But neither
the project's starting point, a bunch of old Arthur Freed songs in search of
a script, nor the title song itself seemed promising back in 1952.
'It was an old Freed number and it had been used three times before on
screen and never worked, so I thought it was jinxed. Arthur came up to me
one day and said, 'How you gonna do it?'. I said, 'I don't know, but I'll be
singing and dancing and it'll be raining.'
'Well, it took 10 days to rehearse and we shot it in one and a half. People
don't believe we could do it that fast, because we had to back-light the
rain, and have puddles dug, and cue each effect to the music. Plus, I had a
fever and a bad cold, and it was scorching hot outside. We were working on
the backlot under these big tarpaulins and the rain was coming out of hoses.
I didn't enjoy it, but I knew what I had to do.'
I suspect he did enjoy it. Kelly's powers of recall today are fond and
focused, and he jumps on any memory-error perpetrated by former colleagues.
When I tell him about Debbie Reynolds' claims that Kelly, first, did not
want her in Singin' In The Rain and, second, put her through hell in the
rehearsal room he answers: 'Wholecloth]' (A favourite Kelly term of scorn).
'Both Stanley (Donen, co-director) and I saw straight away that Debbie was a
pretty girl and bright as a whip. She wasn't a great tap dancer - she was
only 18 - but she worked hard and faked well. As for training, Debbie says
that one day her feet bled. Well, it may be so but I never saw it. She
romances that past quite a bit.'
So much for Debbie. Kelly himself de-romances the past. The man MGM helped
turn into a superstar is startlingly casual about the studio's heyday and
its myths. On the colourful LB Mayer, for instance, whom history paints as a
non-stop despotic interventionist: 'Mayer never stepped on to a soundstage
that I recall. We were pretty much given free rein. I hardly even met him:
we used to refer to him and his executives as the Pope and the college of
Cardinals.'
So genius flourished unencumbered?
'We weren't geniuses. We were contract players just like athletes in the old
days. If there was a style to a movie or group of movies, it might come with
the individual directors like Minnelli.
'But we had, I guess, a sense of mission. We wanted to make films in which
the music was part of the plot and there was some kind of characterisation
of the actor in his numbers. In the old musicals you could take any song or
dance and put it somewhere else in the film - they often did - and even give
it to a different character.
'But if you take a musical like On The Town, which is my favourite, what we
tried to do was treat it as real. The songs and dances were part of the
story. The film was very daring for its time: we shot on location in New
York City, we had blacks and Japanese-Americans as main characters - LB
Mayer didn't like that - and we threw out the chorus line because we said,
'Well, the five leads will be the chorus.''
But there's a point beyond which you cannot go, surely, pace On The Town,
West Side Story and other gritty song-and-dance shows. The musical is a
romantic form, isn't it, even an escapist one?
'The critics like to say that: they always say, Oh musicals make no social
comment. But a good musical makes more than the deepest, dreariest drama. In
Singin' In The Rain, for instance, we took the art form of the 20th century
 -the cinema - and we told the truth about the silent era and the way sound
movies came in. Every detail was true, all the way from the broken careers
of actors whose voices couldn't make it, to those scenes of early sound
recording with mikes hidden in flower vases.
'But if you ask me if there's romance in musicals, of course there is. I
think that's why it's died as a movie form: because dance follows music, and
since the revolution of the Beatles that music has got louder and a bit more
frightening for dancers. It's very hard to say 'I love you' to modern pop
music. To the music of our generation it was easy and the dances became an
extension of that.
'Fifty years from now, that romanticism might come back. Occasionally I hear
melodic lines creeping back into a song that's half-popular. And if it does
come back, so may a new generation of trained dancers who can sing and act.
They've always been the rara avis in show business.
'When I was at MGM we tried to bring on a lot of new male dancers, because
after a while I was a bit embarrassed: I'd be 40 years old and I'd be
partnering Debbie who was 18, Leslie (Caron) who was 17. So the studio and I
collected and trained a group of young dancers who I think were the best in
the world. But the public wouldn't accept them. They would't go to the
films. Right up into the Fifties - right up almost into our fifties - they
still wanted me and Fred.'

AT half past nine on a sunny Thursday morning in mid-August there is
scarcely an empty seat in Sligo's Hawk's Well theatre as Professor Helen
Vendler of Harvard University addresses the assembled company on 'Yeats's
Ottava Rima'.
'Ottava rima,' she says, 'is not exactly a subject for the crack of dawn.'
It is less intimidating once you realise that it is the standard form of the
first eight lines of a sonnet, five beats to a line with alternate rhymes
building up to a final couplet ('I must lie down where all the ladders
start,/In the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart').
The technical analysis of the style and diction of half a dozen of Yeats'
greatest poems that followed was so clear and jargon-free that even the most
novice Yeatsian could not fail to be enlightened.
Vendler's lecture was the highlight of the first week of the 33rd Yeats
International Summer School in Sligo, whose second week ends today. The
prospect of getting people to pay IPounds 250 (excluding accommodation and
meals) to spend two of the best weeks of summer attending lectures and
seminars in a run-down Victorian town on the rainswept north-west coast of
Ireland is so unlikely that it would be laughed at by the tourist industry.
Yet the Yeats School has been so successful that imitations have sprung up
all over the country to study and celebrate all manner of writers in all
kinds of places - Brian Merriman in Lisdoonvarna, Goldsmith in Longford,
Gerard Manley Hopkins in Monasterevin, James Joyce in Newman House, Dublin,
JM Synge in Wicklow, and Bram Stoker in Clontarf, to name but a few.
The YISS is in danger of becoming a victim of its own success, since it must
now compete for custom with its imitators. And yet people still come - more
than 80 this year, in spite of a postal strike in the booking season -
divided between university students with a professional interest in Yeats
and poetry lovers seeking a friendly special interest holiday.
The YISS has a name for being friendly and relatively informal. It is hard
work for both students and the 23 lecturers and tutors, with two lectures
and a two-hour seminar every weekday, in addition to a packed schedule of
optional events such as poetry readings, lunchtime theatre (Yeats, of
course), concerts (Donovan singing Yeats) and outings to Yeats Country -
'Students should bring packed lunches and wear strong shoes'. Then there is
the late-night drinking and talking essential to any such school.
One reason why these schools prosper is that today's academics find them
helpful for networking. Angela Bourke of University College Dublin is
assistant director this year, and over the past six years she has made
friends in Sligo with colleagues such as Terry Eagleton, Seamus Heaney,
George Bornstein and Helen Vendler. Such friendships lead to invitations to
lecture abroad which might not otherwise materialise. It is a way of
compensating for the lack of mobility and poor promotion prospects in
academia caused by cuts. The School's Director, Patrick Sheeran of
University College Galway receives numerous letters from overseas academics,
particularly American, asking for the privilege of an invitation to lecture
 -and this at a fee of IPounds 45 per lecture, IPounds 15 per two-hour
seminar plus IPounds 40 per diem expenses.
Helen Vendler has been coming to the school since 1971. She found that
seeing the places that Yeats wrote about gave her a more intimate relation
to the poetry, and recommends the experience to her graduate students at
Harvard.
She has seen various phases in Yeats scholarship, the emphasis changing in
line with intellectual fashion. Yeats has survived deconstruction, and is
currently the subject of a lively debate on political versus aesthetic
readings of the poems.
The director and assistant director are responsible for the programme and
are appointed by the board of Sligo's Yeats Society, a group of
predominantly elderly local worthies who formed the Society to foster the
connections between Yeats and Sligo. Yeats was born in Dublin and grew up in
London, spending only his boyhood summers in Sligo, but he loved the place
with a passion - not the dreary little town, but the undeniably spectacular
scenery around it.
As John Keohane, president of the Yeats Society points out, even if you are
not interested in Yeats, the best way to see the area is to follow Yeats
since he wrote about all the best places: Lough Gill, which has Sleuth Wood;
the Lake Isle of Innisfree; the Rock of Donney; and the village of
Dromohair; 'bare Benbulben', an inland cliff whose distant prospect towers
over the streets of the town; Lissadell House, where Gore-Booth still lives,
and the grave in Drumcliffe churchyard- 'Cast a cold eye/On life, on death./
Horseman, pass by]'
Yeats actually lived about two hours' drive south at Thoor Ballylee near
Gort in County Galway, but his 'ancient tower' and the nearby ruins of Lady
Gregory's Coole Park are no match for the grandeur of the Sligo landscape.
Another potential rival is the Yeats International Theatre Festival, now in
its second year, which takes place at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin from
August 25 to September 12, bizarrely sponsored by Coca-Cola, but so far it
lacks the kudos of the Sligo event.
The YISS would also welcome a major sponsor to enable it to pay its
lecturers a more realistic fee and establish more bursaries to help students
with the cost. But if the man from the Tourist Board has his way, a sponsor
will not be necessary. Damien Brennan is proposing a 25-minute
state-of-the-art audio visual presentation 'W B Yeats - Sligoman' in the
Yeats Society's headquarters, with 75,000 visitors a year paying to see it
and the profits ploughed back into the school. The question is whether the
staid and serious Yeats Society would permit it. They would be foolish not
to.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Swiss eccentric who defies classification - The career
of the painter Jean-Etienne Liotard, known as 'The Turk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE notion of artistic eccentricity has a distinguished pedigree. Vasari
records how the old and reclusive Piero di Cosimo was enraged by the sound
of crying babies, coughing men, ringing bells and singing friars, and lived
on a diet of eggs which he boiled 50 at a time along with his glue.
Pontormo, if the mood so took him, would refuse to work for a Medici and
instead paint a Madonna for a builder.
It was the Romantics, however, who established the idea of a distinctive
artistic temperament and dress. Flowing locks and unorthodox costume became
means by which young bloods could assert their independence from the art
establishment.
What, then, is to be made of the pre-Romantic Jean-Etienne Liotard, 'The
Turk', who sported a scandalous belt-length beard and Turkish garb long
after his return to Europe? Is it simply hindsight that tempts the
organisers of a current monographic show to see his mode of attire as an
expression of aesthetic non-conformity?
Clearly he cannot be neatly pigeon-holed. This most versatile and
cosmopolitan of artists was born of French Hugenot parents in the Republic
of Geneva. He was apprenticed to a portrait painter, miniaturist and
enameller in Geneva, and to a miniaturist and engraver in Paris.
In 1735 he travelled to Naples with the French ambassador, le vicomte de
Puisieux. While in a coffee house in Rome, he overheard a group of gentlemen
praising his miniature of the Medici Venus, and made the fateful
acquaintance of William Ponsonby, future 2nd Earl of Bessborough.
With Ponsonby, Lord Sandwich and company he sailed for the Levant, and there
he remained, in Constantinople, for four years. Subsequently he went to
Moldavia on the invitation of the Prince, and proceeded to Vienna to paint
the Imperial court.
In Paris he became Painter Ordinary to the King, although fiercely excluded
from the French Academy. So he prospered, portraying the aristocracy and
bourgeoisie of France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria and England.
Even at the age of 80 he was producing still-lifes for Catherine II of
Russia. He was a highly proficient painter in oil and enamel, a sensitive
draughtsman and a virtuoso pastel painter.
Liotard is still celebrated as a painter in pastel. As a draughtsmen he is
less known. This exhibition, a collaboration between Geneva's Musee d'art et
d'histoire and the Musee du Louvre in Paris, is the first to reunite his
drawings - and what is not here is usefully published in the catalogue. The
whole is leavened by a sprinkling of pastels and oils, gouaches and
miniatures. Visitors to the Geneva view are also directed to the museum's
outstanding holding of delectable Liotard pastels.
The show opens with full-length figure studies or, more precisely, costume
studies of the peasant women of the Roman campagna in regional folk dress -
working and Sunday best - executed Watteau-style in red and black chalk.
Then come the elaborately dressed girls of Malta, Chios, Milos, and
Constantinople drawn for the publication planned by Liotard's English
companions.
In Smyrna and Constantinople, we find the Europeans gone native. The
frock-coated French consul in Smyrna lounges on a low divan. Alongside the
exotic henna-tipped Frankish women at the Turkish bath, Greeks, Tatars,
Turks, merchants and musicians, the British ambassador to the Sublime Port
sits musing in damask robe and soft slippers. The Levant seems all langour,
ennui.
From the first, Liotard's touch is careful but deft. He exploits both the
hard edge of the chalk as well as its softness, combining its delicacy and
its breadth. His miniaturist's taste for detail makes him the textile
historian's dream. Even a rapid sketch speaks volumes about stuff: no doubt
the lace, the embroideries, the woven silks, each applique flower and fringe
are identifiable. In pastel he goes a stage further and captures the
softness of silk, the bloom of velvet, the depth of a rich Turkey carpet.
Costume and textile often have more substance than the sitter.
Liotard is invariably content to depict exactly what he saw - this apparent
objectivity was to be much admired by Flaubert and Ingres. If the Empress
Maria-Theresa happened to look like a gute Hausfrau, so be it.
Only occasionally does he care to penetrate the psychology of a sitter, as
he does in his subtle portrait drawing of the seated Mehemet Aga or his
study of the young British archaeologist Richard Pococke in sombre Ottoman
rig, whose sensitive features radiate a keen intelligence.
Liotard can be refreshingly unconventional. Only rarely did he succumb to
the seductive charm of the prevailing Rococo style - a considerable
achievement for an artist who worked in pastel and coloured chalks. Into his
portrait drawings, even if not always into his oils and pastels, he
introduced an air of easy informality only previously acceptable in
portraits of literary figures, philosophers or artists. His drawings made in
the Levant are as fascinating to us as they were to our 18th century
forebears. Above all, they remain extraordinary documents of a particular
time and place.
The exhibition continues at the Musee d'art et d'histoire, Geneva, until
September 20, and shows at the Musee de Louvre in Paris, October 15-December
14.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Hills alive with the strains of music - Salzburg
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN at 30` celsius, Salzburg remains a delightful place to be. The 'Sound
of Music' bus tours still run (they take you to see where Julie Andrews
stood when she sang this, and where the nuns did that) - though for such
senior citizens now, that they must be the last generation of clientele.
Temperatures and tempers have been rising still higher among the Festival
artists, as you may have read. There have been disputes, but no mass
defections; in fact the Festival proceeds with its usual air of comfortable
success.
Over what might have been the largest bone of contention, the new director
Gerard Mortier's aim of pulling the Festival further into the 20th century,
one hears no audible growls. After all, there is still plenty of Mozart,
including three of his operas - and two by Strauss, one by Janacek and one
by Rossini (with strong international casts, if not exactly the ones
originally announced).
The late Olivier Messiaen's Saint Francois d'Assise was sure of a safe
passage in a devout Catholic land; and the seven concerts allotted to Pierre
Boulez are going splendidly.
Of the four given by the Ensemble InterContemporain, two offered the
composer's Repons of 1981, so far his most brilliant marshalling of
instruments-plus-electronics, aptly prefaced by the Dialogue de l'ombre
double: 'strophes' for solo clarinet (Alain Damiens, dazzling) against his
own pre-recorded 'accompaniment'.
Each strophe exploits a particular diction - one studded with little
grace-note whoops, another gurgling with trills, and so on - while the
softer accompaniment whirls around the ring of speakers high on all four
walls. Patterns emerge and expand. The effect is not studied or arcane, but
marvellously fluent.
A large auditorium in the Lehrbauhof, some way out of town, had been adapted
for the purpose, and for the more elaborate demands of the 'concerto grosso'
Repons. There, the 24-strong ensemble sat at the centre, surrounded by the
audience, while the six soloists - pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibes - were
stationed at the perimeter below the speakers. (Boulez was not above leaving
them in darkness until their first collective entry, whereupon they were
dramatically spotlit.) Thus the soloists' 'responses' to one another
criss-crossed the hall, while the central ensemble seethed and the speakers
occasionally erupted.
Much like the Dialogue strophes, the sections of Repons are sharply
characterised by diction and colour - often dense, always clear, sometimes
disarmingly mock-simple.
For long stretches there is a perceptible harmonic base that helps the ear
to keep the incessant flow in order. The work teems with original ideas;
indeed, Boulez has been inclined to regard it as 'unfinished' (like several
other pieces). It made a thrilling, slightly exhausting three-quarters of an
hour.
From late Boulez to the 19-year-old Mozart's La finta giardiniera: would
that the composer's shade could have descended vengefully upon the
production] An excellent, hard-working cast, the fine Mozarteum Orchestra
(wonderful bassoons) with a committed conductor in Sylvain Cambreling, a
charming set - a whole wood of tall, slender trees, apparently real - by
Karl-Ernst Herrmann; and a staging by himself and his partner Ursel of the
utmost silliness.
Whether it was a good idea to incarnate the presiding spirit of Love as a
preening wood-sprite (a female midget in feathers) is perhaps a matter of
taste; but taste had nothing to do with the slapstick antics enjoined upon
all the players. Most of them had at some point to deliver an aria against
maximum comic distraction elsewhere on the stage.
Laurence Dale's romantic hero Belfiore, valiantly sung, was turned into a
ridiculous ass, starting by tripping headlong over a root at his first aria
 -with endless jolly japes to follow.
La finta giardiniera is not a farce, but a 'dramma giocosa' (a label that
would fit Repons too, in fact), in this case an uneasy but fascinating
compound of opera buffa and opera seria.
To wreck its serious side is inevitably to diminish its most forward-looking
dramatic music: real distress and rapture become jokey charades. By sheer
force of conviction Anne Sofie von Otter made a great impression in the
breeches-role of Ramiro, and when given a chance Joanna Kozlowska and
Elzbieta Szmytka sang stylishly as 'Sandrina', the pretend-gardneress, and
Serpetta.
Malvina Major's grande dame Arminda, Ugo Benelli's avuncular Podesta and
Dale Duesing's lusty Nardo completed the team with distinction - though the
it was a disservice to the latter to transfer his main, character-fixing
aria to the last act.
In the dubious circumstances, the score gleamed far better than might have
been expected. All the same, Salzburg has no business producing Mozart as if
for people who know that opera is foolish stuff, and want only to be kept
awake to laugh.

UNCERTAIN UNIONS: MARRIAGE IN ENGLAND 1660-1753 by Lawrence Stone Oxford
Pounds 25, 296 pages
LAWRENCE Stone is a grandmaster of the historical profession. He is learned
and creative, often seeing (and exhausting) new strategies, and with equal
dexterity pounces on old openings to enrich his game.
Cliometrics - depth given to historical scholarship by the use of a computer
 -was brilliantly used in his work on The University in Society. He was
quick, too, to realise that, in a world dominated by a class without
ancestors, social history was bound to proliferate, and his contribution has
been very considerable, if rarely without criticism.
Yet he knows the importance of narrative, indeed has begged for its revival.
And he has withstood radical chic nonsense such as the fashionable (but
fortunately minority) view that the Civil War in England was nothing more
than the last hiccup of the War of the Roses when power mattered and belief
did not. But who would have thought that Professor Stone would write a
brilliant bedside book - rather like Nigel Short taking to draughts?
When he and his research assistants were working on his monumental Road to
Divorce, 1570-1875, they unearthed real-life stories that had been long
banished to the attics of history, yet were of gripping human interest. Most
of the stories of clandestine marriages vanished after the judgment of the
ecclesiastical courts or the litigants gave up. Nevertheless the evidence,
false or true, remained in thousands of documents rarely, if ever,
consulted.
This volume (and we are promised more) deals solely with clandestine
marriage; which, if legal, meant that the woman could claim support and the
man all of his wife's property if she had any. Money (and of course status)
entangled with lust and greed was a heady mixture, ripe for creating
disaster.
Secret marriages were very easy to obtain. An open marriage with banns,
certificate, church ceremony and subsequent feast was expensive even for
craftsmen, let alone for the poor and the riff-raff of society, so many did
not bother to marry except 'in the eye of God', especially in the
ever-changing working population of London. If they did, many preferred to
cut costs.
They could get a parson, imprisoned for debt in the Fleet, or find some
destitute curate to read the marriage service and sign a certificate: they
cost little, and witnesses even less.
The majority of Fleet marriages were of thoroughly ordinary young couples
(often the men were sailors, soldiers or labourers). No doubt the system
bred laxity - registers were ill kept, parsons and witnesses vanished.
Naturally there were golden opportunities here for the dishonest, the
brutal, the men and women of guile, for those who knew how to exploit two of
the deeper passions of mankind, greed and love. Here human nature in the raw
unfolds, a fantastic panorama, as case follows case, some almost
unbelievable, all compulsive reading.
Take Rudd v Rudd. It has everything in three pages. An overheated
16-year-old adolescent but also a baronet, Sir John Rudd, fell hopelessly in
love with the servant of the family of a friend at school (socially speaking
hardly anything lower could be imagined); in return for sex he offered
marriage and she took it. Under age, it had to be clandestine. The scandal
broke and he was banished by an irate mother to Utrecht.
For five years the Rudds brooded on what to do. Sir John, they decided, must
die - at least officially. Lady Rudd announced his death in the South Wales
press, his brother became a baronet, and Lettice, far too poor even to sue
for maintenance, felt free to marry (and did).
A life of poverty followed, so abject that she had to rent out the extra bed
in the room in which she and her husband slept at 6p a week. As in a
Fielding novel, chance brought her a Welshwoman as lodger who knew Lady
Rudd. She went at once to her ladyship, sold her information for Pounds 5.
Bigamy] The Rudds were delighted and a writ followed. Lettice of course, was
utterly ruined. Her misery ended five years later with a private Act of
Parliament that finally wiped out the consequences of a 16-year-old's act of
folly.
This tale of bribery, corruption, buying of witnesses and endless subterfuge
is typical of the stories in this book - none of them takes more than a
quarter of an hour to read. They are all gripping, like stories in the News
of the World, sordid, salacious, very human, sometimes hilarious, but mainly
sad.
Who would have thought that Lawrence Stone would publish a superb bedside
book of Real Life Stories? I cannot think of a better holiday read.

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THEORY: CLASSES, NATIONS, LITERATURES by Aijaz Ahmad Verso Pounds 19.95,
358 pages
SOME years ago, the literary theorist and Urdu poet Aijaz Ahmad engaged in a
celebrated controversy with the American critic Frederic Jameson over 'Third
World Literature'.
Jameson had eloquently advocated a widening of the literature syllabus in
American institutions of higher education to include works from outside the
standard list of Western classics. Ahmad welcomed Jameson's call, but was
deeply disturbed to find him talking of 'Third World Literature' as if it
were a homogeneous category. There is, Ahmad argues, no such category: there
are instead the many diverse literatures of many different countries which,
for reasons of geopolitical theory, tend too glibly to be lumped together as
'the Third World.'
This observation is as profound as it is simple, as Ahmad shows in this
collection of essays woven around his original critique of Jameson. Their
theme is that the notion of 'Third World Literature' connects with views
about nationalism and postmodernist literary theory in deeply revealing
ways.
Ahmad explores these connections in essays on Edward Said's Orientalism,
Salman Rushdie's Shame, Indian literature, and other topics. The opening and
closing essays unify the whole collection into a sustained and searching
polemic.
In Ahmad's view, the 'metropolitan' (First World, Western) propensity to
think in agglomerative terms of 'Third World Culture' generates a false
understanding of recent world history and the way literature relates to it.
The story goes as follows.
In the three decades following 1945, nationalism was a powerful force in
African and Asian countries engaged in throwing off colonial bonds. Literary
theorists applauded the drive to cultural independence associated with these
anti-colonial struggles, but in doing so subsumed them all under the single
'Third World' label.
With the rise of poststructuralist literary theories in the 1970s,
nationalism itself came to be seen as oppressive, coercive and retrograde.
According to poststructuralism, it is nonsensical to think in terms of such
concepts as the origin of national identity and the possession of collective
cultural consciousness; and it is likewise mistaken to interpret the
development of these phenomena by means of determinate historical
narratives.
There are only individuals, poststructuralists argue, each with his own
relative point of view; and there is no independent rationality or
historical truth by whose means sense can be made of national struggles and
the fate of cultures.
Ahmad is opposed both to 'Third-Worldism' and to poststructuralism. His
chief reason is that, despite the fact that the political, economic and
historical analyses offered by Marxism appear to have been exploded by
events, he remains a Marxist none the less, and as such believes that
although nationalism has too often suppressed questions of 'gender' and
class, and has too often been retrogressive, it nevertheless has progressive
forms, and these must be historically understood.
If fellow-critics try to dismiss Ahmad's views on the grounds that the moths
of history have eaten his theoretical garb bare, they will be doing him an
injustice. Marxist theory may be in eclipse, but on this occasion it serves
as a powerful dissenting voice to the two orthodoxies - 'Third-Worldism' and
post-structuralism - which have succeeded each other in misrepresenting, as
Ahmad convincingly shows, the nature of the many different literatures and
cultures flourishing in Africa and Asia. Because of this vigorously argued
claim, Ahmad's voice is one of the most important in the current critical
debate.
One of the best features of Ahmad's account is its disentangling of
geopolitical appearances from cultural realities. At the Bandung Conference
in Indonesia in 1955, presided over by the formidable figures of Nehru and
Zhou En Lai, an effort was made to forge a consensus among nations outside
the immediate hegemonies of the US and Soviet Union.
Writers like Edward Said have mythologised this moment as the birth of the
Third World; but Ahmad shows that for all its importance otherwise, Bandung
does not mark - for nothing could ever mark - the creation of that 'Third
World Culture' which metropolitan criticism, addressing itself to a phantom
of its own making, so vociferously praised and then later attacked.
It is a great pity that Ahmad will not be read by the general educated
public, but only by fellow theorists. He writes too often in the Higher
Gobbledygook which characterises so much academic writing today. Academics
now write solely for their professional colleagues, in a putrefactive jargon
which would turn the stomachs of Hume and Arnold.
If Ahmad were to write for readers outside academic circles he would spread
more widely his message concerning the crudity and complacency of Western
thinking about what lies beyond its cultural borders. In the newly emerging
world such understanding is essential, Ahmad is splendidly equipped to
provide it; one earnestly wishes he would.

THE YEAR OF THE DEATH OF RICARDOREIS by Jose Saramago Harvill Pounds 14.99,
358 pages
SEPARATE ROOMS by Pier Vittorio Tondelli Serpent's Tail Pounds 8.99, 186
pages
THE TROUBLESOME OFFSPRING OF CARDINAL GUZMAN by Louis de Bernieres Secker &amp;
Warburg Pounds 14.99, 388 pages
IT rained a lot in Lisbon in 1936, if The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis
is to be believed. Or perhaps it is the pathetic fallacy at work, a weather
of the spirit that seems to affect externals: gloom not just in the air but
of the heart.
When Ricardo Reis from Rio docks in Lisbon on the Highland Brigade, a famous
Portuguese poet has just died. So, at about the same time in England, have
Kipling and George V. Though local in ambience, the book's range is
international. Clinging like a small limpet to the edge of Europe, Portugal,
already in the grip of a long dictatorship, watches fascism in the ascendant
 -Mussolini conquering Abyssinia, Hitler flexing his muscles, Spain erupting
into civil war. When a sailor is killed in an attempted mutiny, he seems to
embody everything about the humble, underlying decency of resistance.
Reis has made the young man's sister pregnant - a maid at the hotel he
stayed in on first landing. Is this a further exploitation of the humble?
What will happen to her, to him, to the ghost of the dead poet who haunts
him? Behind them, Lisbon looms, a powerful presence, attractive and
menacing, riddled with often friendly-seeming spies and grand, chattering
refugees from the Spanish fighting.
The poetic ghost stalks the streets and cafes, his relations with Reis too
complicated to explain, fact and fiction interwoven, imagery and stylistic
modes that recall Borges used to quirky effect. The translation by Giovanni
Pontiero of what must have been a nightmare to translate (weird punctuation,
curious syntax) reads well, and the whole sombre enigmatic tale gives a
sense not of spiritual portentousness but of importance.
It does Separate Rooms no service to call it, as James Kirkup does, 'a
homosexual Romeo and Juliet'. As the title implies, it is not a story of
love, fulfilled or tragic, but is about being apart rather than being
together, about homosexual life rather than strictly homosexual love.
Leo wants a lifetime of committed separation with (and without) Thomas:
summers travelling together and faithful winters working far apart, Thomas a
musician in Germany, Leo a writer in Italy. He needs space, his own
territory, time and peace for his own thoughts: domesticity and homosexual
marriage are the last things he seeks. But Thomas, in the lonely winter
apart, finds a girl and finally dies of some terrible unnamed illness (to
make it the more poignant, Tondelli himself, the author, died of Aids eight
months ago).
The lifestyle of a homosexual in present-day Europe is shown in an
atmosphere of cosmopolitan greyness, of brooding bad weather not unlike that
of Saramago's Lisbon; in both cases, one feels the determined downbeat
glumness of Latins who dislike their reputation for sunshine and exuberance.
Again, the translation (by Simon Pleasence) reads well. Tondelli's was a
meticulous talent, precise and particular, his writing full of nicely
observed detail and an almost microscopic view of everyday things and
feelings. He showed homosexual life not as a seedy underworld, but as a
simple alternative to the bourgeois provincial life of his parents and
background; yet one in which homosexual partners had no rights, even on a
deathbed being allowed only five minutes of farewell.
In a week of foreign fiction, The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman
is an oddity, being set in South America but written in English by Louis de
Bernieres who, from the note about him on the jacket, sounds British; or
anyway, not Hispanic. Since Colombia is his base, the fictional state he
writes about is as corrupt and high-coloured, as full of churchmen, whores,
terrorists, peasants, drugs, tortures, demons and ebullient beauties as
might be expected.
And very amusing, as well as stomach-turning, much of it is, savagely
indicting every institution, political or ecclesiastical, sparing no
feelings, trampling on all complacency, shocking one by describing physical
and moral horrors which, if taken to heart, should surely tear that heart
out. But it is hard to take it seriously. It seems too much like a spoof of
every fashionable Latin American novel, a carnival of pain and pleasure,
violence, tenderness, high jinks of every sexual sort, quaint customs and
quainter jokes. I wish I knew if it was all a big tease and whether the
author, whose third South American novel this is, had simply hit on a
long-running Latin soap.

THE NETHER WORLD by George Gissing Oxford (World's Classic) Pounds 5.99, 404
pages
NEW GRUB STREET by George Gissing Ryburn (Hunter &amp; Foulis, Edinburgh EH7
4NP) Pounds 30, 439 pages
IT WOULD be sad if George Gissing, who spent much of his time writing novels
about - and experiencing - poverty, were to be priced out of the range of
the common reader, that self-educating reader whose needs were so dear to
his heart. During the so-called Gissing Renaissance, which began in the
early 1970s and lasted well into the 1980s, it looked as if we were to have
two complete editions of his works to choose from: a scholarly one, from
John Spiers's Harvester Press in Sussex, and a 'popular' paperback one from
Carmen Callil's rejuvenated Hogarth Press. Any Gissingite who bought either
of those editions when they came out was shrewd, because both are now out of
print.
Whereas the Harvester Gissing volumes cost on average Pounds 8.50 (for an
originally three-volume novel bound as one), the latest hardback Gissing
reissue from Ryburn costs more than three times as much. This is for a
solidly bound re-setting of the text, not a facsimile of one of the old
editions, but, even so, Pounds 30 seems excessive. Meanwhile, World's
Classics has brought out The Nether World, an important early work set among
the London poor in Victorian times. It is good to see the Gissing flag
flying still in paperback, but again it seems to me overpriced, almost
Pounds 6 for an edition on nasty paper with a greyish type hard on the eyes.
If the pricing of Gissing's fiction is suffering from an inflationary spiral
against the national trend, this prohibitive cost is even more severe in the
case of the much-to-be-desired Collected Letters of George Gissing. Volume
One 1863-1880 appeared in 1990 from the Ohio University Press as part of a
project to produce one volume a year, the whole to end with Gissing's death
in 1903, and eventually making eight or nine volumes. Volume Two 1881-1885
came out last year and Volume Three 1886-1888 has just appeared.( Volume One
now costs Pounds 53.75, and Volumes Two and Three Pounds 60.10 each.)
Gissing's father Thomas first inculcated in George a love of literature. He
used to read from Dickens and Tennyson to the whole family after lunch on
Sundays. Tom Gissing was a hard-working chemist in Wakefield. George and his
two brothers and two sisters were brought up over their father's shop until
Tom died suddenly and they had to move, but luckily it did not disrupt their
schooling. George proved to be an outstandingly clever boy who won many
academic prizes. As he grew up, his able mind and abnormal power of
application accompanied an acute social conscience. He was much concerned by
the plight of the urban poor as he moved among the lowest levels of society
in Manchester and London.
But when Gissing matured as a professional novelist and discovered the
insolubility of the problem of poverty, and at the same time became
acquainted with the kind of people who suffered it, he underwent a violent
revulsion against the poor. Around 1890 he found his material in the rising
middle class and sought a refuge from life's ills in the world of literary
and classical culture.
The nature of the retreat made by Gissing is described in the
semi-fictional, semi-autobiographical The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft
(1903). By contrast The Nether World (1889) represents the lowest depths of
Gissing's immersion in outcast London. It is - as Stephen Gill, who
introduces this edition, admits - a depressing novel, but a powerful one, a
dispassionate depiction of sordid living conditions, crookedness, cruelty,
vain hopes and degradation. It differs from the works of Dickens and George
Eliot in that there is no benevolent alternative, no ultimate salvation
suggested.
Gissing's private salvation was simply to write and write and write. No
sacrifice of his physical and mental health, material well-being, emotional
contentment, family responsibilities, leisure and social life was too great
for him to make in pursuit of his great goal. That was to gain an
established literary reputation and the respect of his peers. Gissing had
certainly won that reputation for himself by the time he died aged 46 - but
at what a cost] That he did what he did with his eyes open, and was fully
aware of the cost, is borne out by a reading of New Grub Street (1891).
As John Halperin, Gissing's most recent biographer, puts it in his
introduction to this edition: 'New Grub Street is perhaps the greatest novel
ever written about the collision of the creative impulse with material
circumstances.' In it, Gissing's fearsome uphill struggle is parcelled out
among the various characters, all of them writers. They are observed with
savage humour slaving away at their manuscripts in the Reading Room of the
British Museum, swapping experiences under the shadow of the great dome.
However fully Gissing may have fictionalised his early experience, no
understanding of it is complete without reference to his letters, many of
them written to his brothers and sisters. The American and French editors of
the collected edition, Paul F. Mattheisen, Arthur C. Young and Pierre
Coustillas, are currently doing a splendid job in preparing what will
certainly become the basis for all future biographies. It was necessary not
only because of the accumulation of unpublished Gissing letters in the US,
but also because the ones that were previously published in 1927 were
horribly mangled and censored by the members of his family anxious to
conceal Gissing's criminal lapse while a student at Owens College and his
subsequent marriage to a young Manchester prostitute.
Unfortunately, nothing that sheds any new light on this hidden period of
Gissing's life emerges. There are no letters referring to his trial for
theft of money from the students' locker-room nor to his harsh sentence (he
was given one month's hard labour which he served in full). There are,
though, some letters that refer to Nell, the street-walker who was the cause
of it all. The editors print a couple of letters to Gissing from a fellow
student. He appears to have been a lusty fellow who had paid for Nell's
favours and made a joke of it to Gissing. In the letters he apologises to
him for his coarseness and ribaldry, saying he did not realise how seriously
Gissing was involved with her.
Another sequence comes from Gissing's brother William, a music scholar
suffering from the consumption which soon would kill him. Polite
conventional phrases like 'I am sorry to hear your wife is unwell' sound
ironic when one reads them in the light of Nell's demise a few years later.
Her death was caused by a combination of starvation, venereal disease,
bronchitis and alcoholism. Gissing's doomed crusade to redeem her had
wrecked his youth; now the injustice of her life would spur on his writing
about the state of the nation.
The Gissing Journal containing fresh appraisals and the latest scholarship
is published quarterly by the Gissing Trust at Pounds 8 a year to private
subscribers. Copies from Ros Stinton, 7 Town Lane, Idle, Bradford BD10 8PR,
a bookseller who specialises in Gissing's works and related material.

<TEXT>
A CIRCLE ROUND THE SUN: A FOREIGNER IN JAPAN by Peregrine Hodson Heinemann
Pounds 16.99, 307 pages
THE OUTNATION: A SEARCH FOR THE SOUL OF JAPAN by Jonathan Rauch Harvard
Business School Press Dollars 18.95, 200 pages
JAPANESE goods have conquered the world. Japanese companies have bought
parts of the Great American Dream. Japan's leaders take their places at the
top table at international gatherings. Its citizens have become familiar
figures in the most fashionable locations in the most cosmopolitan cities of
the world.
Japan nevertheless conjures up conflicting images, because of its mix of
modern occidental practices with the mysticism of the orient. Sometimes it
is presented as an alien country whose inhabitants might have come from
outer space. Such a view is fostered by Yamato nationalists who claim that
Japan is unique, certainly like nowhere else on earth. Eminent Japanese have
written articles claiming that Japanese brains, Japanese intestines and even
Japanese snow are different from any other brains, intestines or snow.
These two authors went to Japan to explore its mysteries. Peregrine Hodson
is British, a barrister, had lived in Japan before, speaks Japanese and
wrote his account after spending three years in Tokyo working for a foreign
bank. Jonathan Rauch is an American on his first visit, who does not speak
Japanese and who spent six months in the country. Both books are highly
personalised and episodic.
Hodson's most frequently used word is 'I'. Possibly Hodson's object is to
get into the Guinness Book of Records for the number of uses of the personal
pronoun. It is slightly more interesting counting the 'I's than reading what
goes in between. There is some interesting material and he has a few vivid
descriptions, but if he spent as much time as he admits breathing into his
tape recorder during office hours it is a surprise that he survived so long.
In contrast, Rauch's observations raise very pertinent issues without an
intrusive 'I'. The book is riveting. Precisely because he does not set
himself up as an expert, but goes to see and learn before drawing his
conclusions, Rauch has written an enjoyable, profound book, perhaps a minor
classic.
He finds a Japan that reminds him of Plato's utopia based on Sparta. He
finds much that reminds him of the US years ago. He demolishes the claim
that the Japanese alone have a distinction between 'tatemae', the feelings
they show to the world, and 'honne', what they really feel. Similar
distinctions, he correctly observes, can be found in most cultures. He
dismisses the myth of Japanese uniqueness: 'The Japanese are precisely as
mysterious and unique as my aunt in Hackensack,' he concludes.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Mountaineering: Rivals join forces on 'infinity ridge' - An
audacious assault on Nanga Parbat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH mountaineers are billing it the battle of the Himalaya. Doug Scott -
legendary climber and the first Briton to ascend Everest - versus Alan
Hinkes, a young thruster with a mission to become as famous as possible as
fast as possible.
There are just 14 peaks over 8,000 metres (26,000ft) in the world and the
ascent of these giants is viewed by many as the ultimate achievement for a
mountaineer.
The race between the Italian Rheinhold Messner and the Pole Jerzy Kukuczka
to be first to complete them all held the climbing world spellbound until
Messner was first over the top in 1986. So far they are the only two to have
climbed all of them.
Hinkes equalled Scott's record of four 8,000m peaks last year when he guided
a Venezuelan to the top of Broad Peak in the Pakistani Himalaya by the
normal route. He does little to disguise his intention of trying to bag as
many more as he can with the aim of proclaiming himself Britain's 'top'
mountaineer.
But for Scott, a man more concerned with climbing hard new routes on
mountains of any height with a group of friends, it is a race that will
never be. At 50 he has succeeded on more original routes in the world's
great ranges than perhaps any Briton, and is uninterested in a game of
numbers.
To scotch any suggestion of joining such a race, he has been quick to invite
Alan Hinkes on his own expedition this month to Nanga Parbat, at 8,150m the
world's ninth highest mountain. The attempt via the unclimbed
eight-mile-long Mazeno ridge is the most ambitious British climb anywhere
this year.
For Hinkes - without an expedition this season after Andy Fanshawe, his
partner for K2 (the world's second-highest peak), was killed in an accident
earlier this year - the offer proved irresistible.
'I looked at the route. I asked what was I letting myself in for with Doug .
. . but he has lasted so long, he doesn't want to die . . . I said Yes,'
says Hinkes.
Located in the Karakoram mountains of northern Pakistan, and bounded to the
north and west by the Indus, Nanga Parbat ('naked mountain' in Sanskrit)
stands in splendid isolation as the dazzling culmination of the western half
of the Himalaya.
Looking to the summit from Scott's base camp in the Rupal valley, it rises
almost sheer for close on 5,000m. Many say it is the most beautiful of the
big Himalayan peaks, but it is famous for savage storms and big avalanches,
the mountaineer's two worst enemies.
So far, the weather has been kind. Hinkes and Scott have spent a month
acclimatising, getting fit, and making a recce of the routes up and down.
Now, with their unusual but highly experienced team of two Russians, two
Nepalis and a British film cameraman (between them they have climbed 14
8,000m peaks), they are setting off for the Mazeno col to start the climb
proper.
At a time when most Himalayan climbers are obsessed with attempting the
steepest faces, the Mazeno ridge sounds like a return to more traditional
mountaineering: all the great Alpine and Himalayan mountains were first
conquered via ridges.
However, what makes this climb unique and highly dangerous is its unusual
length and sustained height. At least eight miles as the crow flies (no one
really knows), the route follows the world's longest unclimbed ridge.
From the Mazeno col, Scott's party will traverse a knife-edge ridge loaded
with dangerous cornices and ascend and descend at least seven mountains,
most of them over 7,000m, to the Mazeno gap. All this before the final
gruelling ascent in the so-called 'death zone' above 8,000 metres to the
summit pyramid of Nanga Parbat at 8,150m. It is hardly surprising that some
mountaineers are calling it 'infinity ridge'.
In comparison, the unclimbed and much coveted north-east ridge of Everest is
4 1/2 miles, little more than half the length of the Mazeno. Even so,
Everest's north-east ridge has long been regarded as the most awesome
Himalayan proposition because of the distance climbers have to travel at a
height where the body functions at less than 30 per cent of normal
capabilities.
The difficulties of the Mazeno ridge have kept all but one team away, and
that by chance. In 1979 a group of 22 of France's top climbers, led by Jean
Pierre Fresafond, were planning a new route on the Rupal face of Nanga
Parbat, but an earthquake denied them the opportunity. At the last minute
they shifted their efforts to the Mazeno ridge. The climb ended in disarray
after only the first of the Mazeno peaks had been scaled.
Says Hinkes: 'I think it is more committing than any route I know. If you
get trapped in a blizzard on the Mazeno ridge no helicopter can fly that
high. There is no easy way off. Both sides are precipitous. If you got sick
in a storm it would quickly become a matter of life and death. You either
have to go on or back. And if you are halfway along that's four miles at an
altitude where every step requires a tremendous effort.'
Nanga Parbat has often been cruel. Over the last century only 101 climbers
have reached its summit and 55 lost their lives trying, making it the most
dangerous mountain in the world after Annapurna. Most famous of all was the
great British mountaineer A F Mummery, who died trying to scale its Diamir
face in 1895 in a climb widely regarded as decades ahead of its time.
It was only last year that the first Britons - Roger Mears and Dave Walsh -
reached its summit. But Scott's attempt is of a different order. If
successful it will go down not only as the greatest British triumph on what
has been regarded as the Austro-German mountain, but the most audacious
achievement in the Himalaya for many years.
Both Hinkes and Scott will then have five 8,000m peaks to their credit. For
Scott, four of them will have been conquered via new routes. At 37, there
seems little doubt that Hinkes will eventually come out on top of any
British Himalayan league table. But success on the Mazeno ridge might make
him think harder about how he does it.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Golf: It's time to quit, Jack - The terminal decline of a
sporting legend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS sad to watch Jack Nicklaus trudging up the 18th fairway in the second
round of the US PGA championship in St Louis. Shoulders hunched slightly,
head forward, plucking at the front of his shirt in that distinctive way of
his, he raised his right arm to acknowledge the applause of his supporters.
But he had missed the cut - the guillotine that falls after 36 holes to
halve the number of competitors. It meant that, for the first time, he had
bowed out at the halfway stage in three of a season's four major
championships. He looked a shadow of the golfer he was. It was one major
tournament too many.
It was not unexpected, though. One reporter wrote off Nicklaus nearly 15
years ago. When taxed about it, he replied, blithely: 'I was right. I just
beat the embargo, that's all.'
After his stunning victory in the 1986 US Masters, Nicklaus himself said:
'If I was smart, I would stop now. The trouble is, I am not smart.'
So he played on. The man relished the thrill of winning a major title at the
age of 46. But that was the moment he should have called it a day. He should
have said then that he no longer considered himself competitive and was
going to concentrate on preparing for the seniors' tour, for which he became
eligible in 1990, as well as on his family and his golf course design
business.
It is hard to know when to stop. Golf makes relatively few physical demands
but it does require a high degree of competitiveness. Nicklaus no longer has
that; nor can he devote the time required to achieve it.
Arnold Palmer did not know when to stop. He played in the PGA in St Louis as
well, looking - frankly - an old man. But then, he is 62 and has a hearing
aid in each ear.
His 83 was his worst round in any of the 35 consecutive PGA championships in
which he has competed since the late 1950s. After two rounds, Palmer was 20
over par.
Even now, Nicklaus on a golf course is a far more acceptable sporting sight
than was boxer Muhammad Ali at the end as he struggled towards one more big
pay-day; or Bjorn Borg, imagining he could make a comeback in the tennis
big-time. But even Nicklaus is mortal. He cannot see very far. He hardly
practises. He plays rarely.
Besides, by devoting almost all his time to his business interests he has,
effectively, announced his retirement. Two years ago, he admitted as much as
a black limousine sped through the Scottish dusk, whisking him from one of
his golf courses to another.
'I have got 73 courses in play around the world,' he told me then. 'I have
more than 200 employees I am responsible for. I cannot carry on much longer
playing golf, being a father and doing all this. I have to decide.'
I want to remember Nicklaus as the thrilling player he was: one of the
longest, straightest hitters the game has seen; a man meticulous in his
attention to detail; and one who not only won 20 major titles but came
second in 19 more, including seven Opens.
His arrival in the game was startling. He stood a hair less than 6 ft and
weighed 15 1/2 stone. As a result, he was nicknamed Blob-O.
He had a high-pitched voice and a crew-cut and hit the ball great distances
 -as long as John Daly now. He was a wonderful putter. As an amateur in the
1960 US Open, Nicklaus led after 66 holes before being overtaken by Palmer.
It was the start of a career that has been unmatched. No one else has played
so well for so long - not Harry Vardon at the turn of the century, Bobby
Jones in the 1920s, Ben Hogan, Sam Snead or Palmer. Frankly, I doubt if
anyone will ever play as well for so long, and I am sure no one will ever
get close to matching his record.
The Open championship next year is to be held at Royal St George's,
Sandwich, Kent. Nicklaus dislikes this course more than any other of those
that make up the roster of Open venues. It could be a good one for him to
miss. Farewell, Jack. Spare us further embarrassment.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Property: Empty flats on Millionaires' Row - A look at the
sluggish market for multi-million-pound properties in London's Kensington
and Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT A single apartment has yet been sold in London's most expensive block of
flats: the discreetly named 3a Palace Green in Kensington Palace Gardens.
This private road, known locally as Millionaires' Row, has the London homes
of the Sultan of Brunei and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, as well as several
embassies and ambassadors' residences.
Five years ago, when Regalian Properties bought less than an acre of the
former Kensington Barracks site from the Crown Estate for an astonishing
Pounds 21.5m, Prince Charles expressed his displeasure at the prospect of
his home at Kensington Palace being overlooked, so Regalian agreed to lower
the height of its block - not by taking it off the top but by excavating the
foundations another 18 inches.
Since the development was completed last year, these air-conditioned
apartments with their elaborate services and security systems have attracted
interest from around the world, but billionaires have resisted Regalian's
prices, which ranged from Pounds 2m to an unheard-of Pounds 13.5m for the
triplex penthouse on the seventh, eighth and ninth floors, decorated by
David Hicks, with Pounds 1m of contents included.
Now Regalian has instructed its agents Savills (071-499-8644), Hamptons
(071-493-8222) and Sotheby's International Realty (071-408-5196) to cut the
prices of the 20 unsold apartments by as much as 50 per cent, so that they
range from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 10m. But Regalian's chairman, David
Goldstone, makes no secret of the fact that he would rather sell the whole
development outright to a single investor.
'An American saw the apartments last year and again this summer,' he says.
'He said he would like to buy one, but he had a problem: if Regalian went
under, what would happen to the management? Now he says he is interested in
buying the whole block, and he is a man of considerable wealth.'
A year ago, the price for the whole of 3a Palace Green was Pounds 120m. Now
it is only Pounds 65m - which is still enough to pay off the group's
borrowings. Lack of sales have forced Regalian's share price down so much
this year that the group is worth less than Pounds 6m.
Next to 3a Palace Green is York House, a block of Edwardian mansion flats
recently restored and modernised by a private property company, Taylor
Clark. Two new penthouses added on the top floor were sold last year in
shell form to a single buyer for about Pounds 8m. One modernised
four-bedroom apartment on the sixth floor has just been sold for nearly
Pounds 1m, and another is for sale at Pounds 975,000 by Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley (071-938-4311), which is joint agent with Mellersh &amp; Harding
(071-499-0866) and Cluttons (071-408-1010).
Some of Kensington's largest and most expensive houses are in the Holland
Park area, where a fully-restored ten-bedroom house with an indoor pool was
recently sold for about Pounds 5m. A few doors away, Aylesford
(071-351-2383) has a similar but unrenovated house for sale at Pounds 2.7m.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, who recently sold a newly-built six-bedroom house in
Cottesmore Gardens for more than Pounds 2.5m to American Airlines for its
new chairman, say that the price of 31 Phillimore Gardens, a ten-bedroom
house formerly occupied by the Libyan ambassador, has been cut from Pounds
2.95m to Pounds 2m. Best Gapp (071-730-9253) is the joint agent for this
property, which needs total refurbishment.
Another large house in Upper Phillimore Gardens is for sale at Pounds 3.25m
through W A Ellis (071-581-7654) and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, while a
renovated house in Phillimore Place is for sale at Pounds 1.65m through
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Russell Simpson (071-225-0277).
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley's Sloane Street office (071-824-8171) is seeking
offers of Pounds 5m for the only detached double-fronted house in the
Boltons, an enclave of large houses in south west Kensington, where
Beauchamp Estates (071-499-7722) has a slightly smaller house for sale at
Pounds 3.5m. Both properties have been restored and modernised.
Houses in Chelsea are generally smaller than those in Kensington, but not
necessarily cheaper. One of the Grade II listed Georgian terraced houses in
Cheyne Walk (similar to that bought two years ago by Ivana Trump for about
Pounds 2m) is for sale at Pounds 1.95m by Strutt &amp; Parker (071-235-9959).
Kevin Maxwell's house at 31 Jubilee Place, off the King's Road, attracted
little interest at Pounds 1.65m, but when the price was reduced to Pounds
1,425,000 in June it found a buyer through Aylesford at what it says is 'an
acceptable figure.' The double-fronted three-storey house has six bedrooms,
three reception rooms, a secluded garden and a garage.
Overseas investors have paid more than Pounds 2m for the seven apartments in
Atlantic Court, a new residential development at 77 King's Road, Chelsea.
These unidentified clients of Lassmans (071-499-3434) then furnished the
seven apartments above the shops and let them to show a rental return of 8
per cent. Behind Atlantic Court is an award-winning scheme of 51 new houses
known as Charles II Place. When its developers, Harry Neal, went into
receivership in 1990, only 12 houses had been sold. Michael Jordan and Robin
Addy of Cork Gully found Singapore investors willing to pay more than Pounds
14m for the unsold development. These were Parkway Holdings and the
Singapore Warehouse Company, who formed a joint-venture company, Validhill,
which is selling the remaining 39 houses through Savills (071-730-0822) and
Allsop (071-584-6106) from Pounds 360,000 to Pounds 625,000.
Another development that is proving attractive to overseas investors is
Kensington Green, the joint-venture between Taylor Woodrow's Capital and
Mitsui Kensetu (UK) to redevelop St Mary Abbot's Hospital in Marloes Road.
An Italian industrialist has just paid nearly Pounds 1m for one of the
largest houses in the development. Christopher Roupell, of the Kensington
office of Winkworth (071-373-5052), who acted for the Italian buyer, says:
'Now that a change in the exchange control regulations has enabled Italians
to take out money from the country legally, the marketing for Kensington
Green has been very much aimed at the Italian market, and this appears to
have paid off.'
One of Kensington's finest houses failed to attract a buyer when it was
placed on the market in the Spring at Pounds 6m. Lord and Lady Glenconner's
Hill Lodge, one of only two large houses (the other is Aubrey Lodge) set in
their own large grounds on the top of Campden Hill, has had its price cut to
Pounds 4.75m by Aylesford.
The most expensive residential property sold this year has gone to a British
buyer. Crosby Hall, the international hall of residence in Cheyne Walk owned
by the British Federation of University Women, has been bought by
Christopher Moran, the former insurance broker who was expelled from Lloyd's
ten years ago. Crosby Hall contains a 16th-century banqueting hall that was
originally part of Sir John Crosby's remarkable house in Bishopsgate. This
was dismantled and re-erected in Chelsea in 1910, and a four-storey hall of
residence and administrative offices were built alongside.
Moran says he intends to spend Pounds 25m converting Crosby Hall into his
London home, but what he paid for the complex of offices and hall of
residence is not known, because the property was not on the open market.
'I cannot discuss the sale in any way at all,' says Val Considine, company
secretary of Crosby Hall Limited, a subsidiary of BFUW that has been a
private company with charitable status since 1971. However, she does say
that the Charity Commissioners have approved the sale. It is not yet known
how the BFUW founded in 1907 will replace its hall of residence for 90
students who come to Britain from all over the world to follow a recognised
postgraduate course.

FT  22 AUG 92 / How to Spend It: Madrid - slinky, elegant, sexy, overpriced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and ANNA CHRISTENSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shopping or going out in Madrid is a big deal. For visitors it is an
expensive city, mainly because the peseta is overvalued. But do not be
frightened. The fish and lobsters at what must be some of Europe's best
seafood restaurants are flown in daily from the coast. Clothes are expensive
but quality has improved as foreign designers have rushed into town and the
locals have responded with new clothes, or derivatives, of their own. Apart
from two department store chains, male and female shopping in Spain are two
distinct activities. Peter Bruce, FT correspondent in Madrid, and his wife,
Anna Christensen, report.
SHE WRITES . . .
A KALEIDOSCOPE of colours tantalises the senses - shocking pink, azure blue,
emerald green, glittering gold, Carmen red, each crinkly, slithery or
sumptuously soft and designed for impact.
This was not the closing ceremony of the Barcelona Olympics. Instead, it was
a shop of Spain's hottest designer, Roberto Verino. The clothes were
dynamite, but I came out empty-handed. They were summer's left-overs and
followed the route to which Spain has stuck with touching faithfulness:
short, tight, slippery, slinky - sexy.
I was not raised for this. I was dressed in twin sets and pearls and
sensible shoes. Yet, soon I am going to be really wicked and, when I do, I
am going to a Spanish designer, probably Verino although there are others
including Jesus del Pozo, Sybilla and Pedro del Hierro to choose from.
Happily, Spanish designers have aligned themselves more closely with the
mainstream of international fashion this year. They are showing flights of
fancy juxtaposed with impeccably-styled classics.
So, if I get cold feet and do not buy Verino's turquoise parka with ostrich
feathers and balloon mini-skirt, I know I will be happy with his classic
camel suit with double-breasted jacket and ankle-revealing straight pants
and, perhaps, the long, flowing evening skirt in slate grey. Loewe, a must
for leather and suede, offers a version of the classic twin set this year.
Before embarking on a shopping spree in Madrid, remember there are two
stumbling blocks to overcome. Spending money should be pleasant, yet there
is a dearth of friendly and helpful staff. If you happen to be female, the
young women who serve you would rather bore holes through you than ask if
you need another size. If you get this treatment, leave.
Second, Madrid is expensive and, normally, there are few bargains. Recently,
I saw a Byblos dress I bought at a sale in London for Pounds 125 selling for
the equivalent of Pounds 275.
Shopping in Madrid centres around Calle Serrano where, in fine weather, I
enjoy watching well-clad Madrilenos promenade. No one pops out in a track
suit and few women even venture out in jeans. On Serrano I visit Max Mara,
Loewe, Boutique Real and Adolfo Dominguez, a designer I favour for his clean
lines and interesting fabrics.
Along the way, you will pass a dizzying array of shoe shops with reasonable
prices. They still lag behind the Italians in quality but they cannot be
beaten for fun seasonal wear. My favourites are Bravo and Los Pequenos
Suizos, both of which offer quality, a wide selection of Spanish and
imported styles, half sizes, and friendly and helpful staff.
I stay away from the antique shops in Calle Lagasca (they are overpriced and
most of the furniture is English) but it is worth looking at the Duran shops
along Serrano. For the best in Spanish furniture, antiques, lace and
ceramics, go to Artespana, which has several shops. But beware: in an
over-priced country, their prices really jar. There is one on Hermosilla,
just up from Serrano and close to the beautiful shop of Spain's premier
interior designer, Gaston y Daniela.
On Claudio Coello, parallel to Serrano, you will find Roberto Verino,
Emporio Armani and Salvador Bachiller, whose classic leather travelling
bags, handbags and shoe collection this year include fanciful zebra-stripe
inlays. I buy my household linen at Linogar or No 47, where the woman will
ask you in which of three weights you would like your white pique summer
bedspread and whether it will cover the pillows or go under them.
Several rather fun antique shops are also on this street and Anmoder is
worth looking at for its Art Noveau exterior, even though its inside is a
bit of a let-down.
As you walk, you will pass cross-streets worth wandering down. One is Calle
Jose Ortega y Gasset, which has Kenzo, Gianni Versace and a wonderful
Spanish boutique, Tres Zetas.
At the Jardin de Serrano, stop in at Abascal for another eye-dazzling
display of colours and textures. There, you may order a unique evening dress
of the type that appears regularly in Spain's glossy gossip magazines (you
need time for fittings, though). Agatha has a superb collection of (mostly
French) costume jewellery. If you want the real thing, Bulgari will give you
pause. Madrid's prestigious men's shop, Azul, is here but for real fun (of
the expensive variety) go to the main shop on Serrano.
At some point, you will want to stroll along the Castellana to savour its
grandness and splendour. You can take your pleasure outside in fine weather
or in the lovely Art Noveau restaurant, El Espejo.
For a truly Spanish break, go to one of the many Mallorca shops (I like the
one on Serrano), where you can enjoy coffee or chocolate, wine, cava and
tapas. Many successful Spanish dinner parties come from behind those glass
cases, as do gifts of ceramic or brass knick-knacks filled with sweets.
There are a few Spanish specialities I cannot live without. The gourmet
olive oils, red peppers, cured Serrano ham, an almond cake called Tarta de
Santiago, coffee Torrefacto-style, turron and Toledo-style marzipan: all
make wonderful gifts if you can bear to give them away.
HE WRITES . . .
I GREW UP up in the sticks in South Africa and, before coming to Madrid four
years ago, had lived only in London (where people wear track suits to
impress each other) and Bonn (where shops close too early for anyone to buy
things).
A pure-bred bumpkin, I mostly window-shop, but rapid improvements in my
Spanish mean I will never again ask a shop assistant for a truck with extra
long sleeves.
There is little point in buying suits in Spain - they are hideously
expensive. On the other hand, this summer's sales have been incredible and a
good man's shop, Blanco Blanco on Calle Marceliano Santamaria, next to the
Real Madrid stadium, has a great blue cotton jacket from Hugo Boss in its
window for about Pounds 30, with more tasty Boss gains inside.
Springfield, a few doors up, is more to my boring taste, though. I like
faded clothes and Springfield (a Spanish company) makes me feel like an
American adventurer every time I walk out of it with another washed denim
shirt or faded grey sweat shirt. Prices now are at rock bottom; good jackets
are going for Pounds 30 or so and sport shirts for about Pounds 15.
A much more expensive 'western' feel is at Charro on Claudio Coello, where I
bought a leather-collared cowpoke jacket for nearly Pounds 200 three years
ago. They have great stuff - yellowing leather gloves and their own jeans.
The Spanish are discovering the great outdoors. I would buy a pair of soft
leather Panama Jack boots or shoes if only they did not have Panama Jack
written all over them in big letters. Instead, I settled last year for a
21-speed Peugeot mountain bike and a beagle puppy - Pta55,000 (Pounds 305)
and Pta80,000 (Pounds 445) respectively from Calmera on Calle Atocha and
Nuestros Amigos los Animales in the La Vaguada shopping mall.
For authentic Spanish furniture, drive about 100km north of Madrid to
Pedraza, a small pueblo. The trip, and lunch at the local parador, are more
than worth it and the town has five or six good shops. A three-drawer pine
chest, about 80 years old, could cost Pounds 1,000.
As for eating and drinking (which is what Madrid was built for), beer and
tapas are best at the bars along the Plaza Santa Ana, just up from the
Palace Hotel. In summer, you can drink until sunrise at sidewalk bars along
the Castellana, but they are so full it takes hours to get service.
Madrid has hundreds of good restaurants although I confine my expeditions to
within a few minutes' walk of my office, just off the Calle Recoletos in the
centre of town. Two doors away is El Borbollon; over the road is a
magnificently-tiled El Espejo. Up the road, on the other side of Serrano, is
Alkalde, for good fish. All of these would cost around Pounds 30 a head for
lunch or dinner with wine.
Easily the very best place to eat in Madrid - and one of the cheapest in the
whole country - is the Centro Cubano on Claudio Coello, a ramshackle haunt
of Cuban exiles. Its fare is simple - lots of black beans, chicken and rice
 -but it goes down very well.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Gardening: Sorbus sets the pace but beware of blight -
Celebrating the glories of small trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend, I stood in the far corner of the marvellous garden at
Kiftsgate Court and found myself, in mid-August, surrounded already by trees
in berry. The chill of autumn might be creeping into the late evenings but
surely it should have kept its nose out of our trees' behaviour.
The fruits on Apricot Lady were looking moderately apricot; around her, two
Chinese dignitaries were about to reach their peak. The grey-green leaves of
the wild sorbus from Hupeh were already set with white berries; beyond it, a
sorbus from Yunnan was covered in fruits with a greyish-pink flush.
Like so much else, these sorbus trees have been in a hurry, but they have
also revelled in this warm and wet summer. The most hurried variety is
actually not so far ahead of itself. In front gardens and on the islands in
motorways, you will find trees of the mountain rowan bent heavily with red
berries. Even the birds cannot strip them so soon: sorbus aucuparia is
having a field day, the first tree to show berries among the usual range of
English garden planting.
In normal years the berries appear by late August, an early intimation of
autumn like the sudden sharp scent on phloxes or the sight of a dahlia
sodden with dew. I am extremely fond of this tree but there are better
cousins further east, as I continue to discover.
This year, my personal best is sorbus hupehensis, a wonderfully easy tree
which has taken a shine to my horribly stony soil. In the dry weather of
1991 its neatly-cut, grey-flushed leaves drooped and looked miserable. In
1992 it flowered stupendously early in June, proving that it has a scent
which books ignore, perhaps because it is decidedly masculine.
Already, it has grown madly two years after planting, and I would recommend
it to anyone who wants leaves, berries and a robust elegance to a height of
20 ft. My trees are set for exceptional berrying, but they have received no
attention from me except for the usual coulis of pig manure when they first
went into position. Sorbus hupehensis is a winner.
So are its other Far Eastern cousins, vilmorinii and the mildly-obstinate
cashmiriana. The latter, I think, dislikes dry gardens but it is a dream in
others when contented, a tree which can be contained at 10 ft or so and
admired for a lovely leaf and its large white berries.
Vilmorinii is much easier, and, if anything, its fern-shaped leaves are
prettier. In a small garden, it has every quality: good leaf, suitable
habit, pink-white fruit and a vibrant autumn colour. Although it is not a
tree to block out neighbours, it is worth anybody's space.
Most of my sorbuses have come from Landford Trees at Landford Lodge,
Landford, Salisbury, Wiltshire. It even lists the most brilliant autuman
sorbus of all, the large-leaved sargentiana, which has lovely buds in
spring, like a horse chestnut, and the most wonderful orange flare in
mid-November. It grows slowly but is an outstanding variety for anyone with
patience and a stable life.
At a much lower height - a mere 5 ft if you clip it - sorbus koehneana is a
newish variety from the same supplier. Its small leaves are cut thinly and
are slightly on the grey side of green, while the berries are white. The
effect of this small tree is well-suited as an emphatic point for a border
or, in my garden, the centre of a bed of old-fashioned roses.
If you want to see young sorbuses competing with turf in fairly hostile
conditions, the place to go is the arboretum at Jodrell Bank, Cheshire.
Early in the 1980s, a collection of the best forms was planted there and, if
you are serious about the sorbus, a visit is highly advisable. It will teach
you to avoid the dull thuringiaca and to think twice about the curious pink
trunk of beissneri. I am also very taken with the prettily-cut green leaves
on the recent Chinese Lace, another Landford offering.
During the next two months, sorbuses are presenting themselves in full
beauty, and the many of you who want smallish trees with as many seasons as
possible could not do better than to size them up.
Until the mid-1980s, I rated Joseph Rock as one of the best of the bunch. It
seemed ideal for smallish sites, but a terror has stolen up on it, moving
east from Somerset up the line of the M5 motorway.
Joseph Rock is prone to the disease of fire blight, which enters through
damaged bark in winter. It is a total killer and can even transfer to prunus
or rose bushes.
I intend to brazen it out and take the greatest care not to prune my Joseph
Rock before winter, nor to leave any broken wood on the tree after the main
season. Experts insist that we should not choose it as our main garden
variety but I cannot bring myself to remove it. You must be warned, though,
that the best of the easier small sorbuses is now potentially blighted.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Gardening: The grass menagerie - Exploring an unusual garden
in Essex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMS unlikely that there is any small garden in Britain, other than
Thorpe Park Cottage at Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex, which grows more than 200
species and varieties of ornamental grass, sedge and rush. This is the
achievement of Trevor Scott, a New Zealander who until recently worked as a
medical researcher in a London hospital. He kept Thorpe Park Cottage as a
weekend retreat and grew grasses and reeds as a hobby.
He was made redundant in 1990 and decided to turn his hobby into a living.
He increased his already considerable collection through his many contacts,
including the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, and began to advertise his
specialities. It is early days yet but the business seems to be working out
favourably.
I found his little garden most charming - and bewildering, because it
contains so many plants I did not know. Thorpe Park Cottage is a genuine
cottage, part of an old farm complex. The garden is planted in the true
cottage manner, almost all the open space being given over to beds filled
with a medley of herbaceous perennials, lilies, roses, a few annuals - and,
of course, grasses which, in this profusion, look their most elegant.
There was the Australian feather grass, Stipa elegantissima, delicate in
effect with narrow leaves and sprays of purplish flowers from June to
September. Scott has produced an excellent catalogue which is strong on
description and makes suggestions for associations between grasses and other
plants. As companions for the Australian feather grass, he suggests
campanulas and yellow anthemis.
I had not realised how many grasses have leaves that colour richly at some
time of the year. One such is the yellow Indian grass, which Scott considers
to be one of the most beautiful Australian species. It is quite tall and
arches gracefully; the grey-green leaves are tipped with purple; and the
drooping sprays of flowers are iridescent bronze with yellow anthers.
Both stems and leaves turn rich purple in autumn. At Thorpe Park Cottage,
this grass was growing beside a deep ruby-red chrysanthemum which was yet to
flower. Scott assured me that the grass would continue to flower until
chrysanthemum time.
Then there was Panicum virgatum Rehbraun, more than 3 ft high with
red-tipped leaves and ample sprays of flowers which start greenish-brown but
in autumn change to rich purple and yellow. Scott says it looks stunning
planted with Rose Iceberg.
Melissa altissima atropurpurea has quite short leaves but tall flowering
stems that are up to 6 ft high carrying narrow, one-sided spikes of deep
purple flowers. It looked wonderful growing through some blue annual
larkspurs.
Completely different is evergreen Ampelodesmos mauri tanicus, which makes
big, dense clumps of arching leaves which retain their lustrous green
throughout the winter. Its flowers, which come in May, are buff and nothing
special; but as an architectural foliage plant, this is unsurpassed.
Different again is the mosquito grass, Bouteloua gracilas, a very
fine-leaved grass which, in spite of its delicate appearance, is
drought-resistant. Scott recommends planting it with alpines or as a
contrast to small growing shrubs.
There were three varieties of the feather reed grass, Cala magrostis
acutiflora, which I admired greatly. The tallest, a good 6 1/2 ft tall, is
called Stricta and was standing bolt upright among some of the tallest
plants in the garden. The flowers, carried in slender spikes, start green
but turn rosy buff. Two other forms of this grass are Karl Foerster, with
brown flowers and leaves that turn yellow in autumn and retain this colour
in winter, and Overdam, which has leaves striped with green and white and
flushed with purple.
The blood grass is well named for its leaves are green at the base and rich
red at the ends, remaining so all summer. Scott says it needs
moisture-retentive soil and some sun to be at its best. He recommends
planting it in groups or as ground cover, preferably where the sun will
shine through it, for it lights up brilliantly.
The cottage is open only by appointment. Mail order catalogue available from
Thorpe Park Cottage, Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex CO16 1HN.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Motoring: A Jaguar that no one needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EVERYONE who reads a tabloid newspaper must know by now, the Jaguar XJ220
is the dearest (Pounds 415,000), fastest (217 mph/350 kmh) and most
sought-after car in the world. No fewer than 1,500 people - more than 400 in
recession-stricken Britain - are said to have applied to buy one within 48
hours of Jaguar's announcement in December 1989 that 350 would be made in a
limited edition.
Last week, two of these precious machines were made available for press
testing. When a journalist accidentally over-revved and damaged the engine
of one of them, it made headlines. You would have thought no one had muffed
a gear-change before.
In essence, the XJ220 is close to being a de-tuned sports/racing car clad in
a strikingly beautiful, if wildly impractical, body. It has two leather
seats and a boot just about big enough for a document case and a packet of
smoked salmon sandwiches.
It is difficult to enter and leave although, once you have strapped yourself
into the full racing harness, the air-conditioned interior seems comfortable
enough. Clutch and brakes (no power assistance or anti-locking system) are
very heavy; the gear-shift is no lightweight, either.
There is no power steering, no traction control system and no spare wheel.
Even if there was room for a spare, which there is not, it would not be much
good because, if you took off one of the monstrous road wheels, either it or
your passenger would have to be left on the roadside. If you get a flat tyre
(a new set cost more than Pounds 2,500), you call up your private helicopter
and have the car collected on a lorry.
The engine, in full view under the rear window, is a 3.5-litre V6 from
Jaguar's XJR11 racing car. Twin turbo-charged, it belts out 548 horsepower -
which makes the XJ220 about 20 per cent more muscular than a five-litre,
12-cylinder Ferrari 512.
The exhaust system with catalytic converters is, of course, road-legal. Even
so, an XJ220 in full song at 6,000 rpm would thrill motor-racing buffs but
have environmental protection officers reaching for their noise meters. At
start-up, the V6 is so coarse and rattly that it makes the XJ220 sound more
like farm machinery than a Pounds 415,000 motor car.
Jaguar racing driver John Nielsen hurtled me round the Salzburg Ring racing
circuit in Austria for three laps before handing over the XJ220. In all
honesty, I cannot pretend to have gained any real idea of its performance in
fewer than 10 minutes on a track. All I can say is that the cornering grip
was sensational, the acceleration head-jerking, the steering razor-sharp and
the brakes very powerful.
Buyers who plan to drive their cars on the road will be relieved to know the
engine is flexible enough to pull in third or even fourth gear at speeds
that will not cause blue lights to flash.
Driving on a deserted circuit is exciting; a wonderful, once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to play with a car-mad millionaire's latest toy. But what would
it be like on a motorway, or in London's Park Lane on a wet Friday
afternoon? Mercifully, I shall never have to find out.
Jaguar stresses, with pride, the XJ220's great structural strength and crash
protection qualities. But, without wishing to be the spectre at the feast,
one has to ask: what business does the company have making a car like this
at all?
As a road-going car it has no relevance. There is nowhere in the world
except a private circuit where it can be allowed to show its potential.
The XJ220 was conceived - originally as a V12 with four-wheel drive before
being watered down to a rear-drive V6 - in the boom days of the mid-1980s.
There might have been no justification for it even then, but at least a
buyer would have had a chance to see how it went on the autobahn (always
providing he had the skill).
Times have changed. Very high speeds on the autobahn are frowned-upon and
many now see a projectile like this - available to anyone with the money to
buy and insure it - as an affront to common sense.
You can argue that there is no compulsion to drive a car like the XJ220 at
illegal speeds. Of course there isn't. But to buy it, and use only one-third
of its potential, is like ordering dinner in a Michelin three-star
restaurant knowing you are going to eat only the pate, toy with the soup,
and send all the other courses back to the kitchen, untouched.
The mere existence of 200 mph-plus cars provides a hostage to fortune. If a
missed gear change and a few bent valves had the tabloids panting with
excitement, just think what a high-speed accident involving an XJ220 would
do.
Isn't it time the motor industry grew up and stopped pretending the public
highway is still a suitable place for rich exhibitionists to indulge their
taste for conspicuous consumption?

FT  22 AUG 92 / Travel: Life and death in an ocean of emptiness - With the
lions of Ngorongoro, in Tanzania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON tip-toe, and with a smiling frown on her broad fawn face, the lioness
danced playfully away from the white-tailed mongoose. This valiant animal,
little bigger than a cat and with a white plume of a tail, repeatedly leaped
at the lioness's chin, snickering with anger as he did so.
The lioness stepped aside. As the mongoose made to run off, his tail like a
beacon in the flat grey light of morning, she flicked out a dinner-plate paw
and swept his feet from under him. The mongoose lay winded for a moment.
As he got up, a second lioness came to tease him further. Like domestic cats
with a shrew, they had no intention of eating their captive, merely of
having a good time.
But this was a terminal mongoose. His chattering so excited one lioness that
she playfully picked him up and tossed him a few feet through the air. He
was dead before he hit the ground.
These were just three of the 100 or so lions which are packed into the
Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania, for they live there at the very high density
of about one to the square mile. As a result, they are remarkably easy to
see but, like lions everywhere, they spend most of their time doing very
little.
To watch interesting lion activity you have to be out early or stay late,
which was possible when I was there (late March), when camping on the crater
floor was officially forbidden. That white-tailed mongoose met his end at
6.30am only 500 yards from our camp just a few days before the ban was
announced. From now on, you will have to rise very much earlier in order to
tackle the tortuous and hour-long descent to the crater floor to be in time
to catch some of this action.
By way of compensation, the Tanzanian government has allowed the
construction of a fourth lodge on the crater rim and a fifth is to follow,
offering between 200 and 400 more bed spaces. To avoid saturation of the
crater floor, access will be rationed by permit with the intention of
encouraging more people to explore the rest of the 3,200-square-mile
Ngorongoro conservation area which lies between the crater and Serengeti
national park.
It is an ocean of short grass plains, apparently endless, gently rolling - a
daunting space. Occasionally there is an island, a rounded granite hillock
exfoliating like an old, tired onion with a growth of whistling thorns and
characteristic umbrella acacias to give shade. These are havens for
predators which occasionally sally forth like pirates to make a raid on
passing prey.
In contrast to the crater, which has permanent water and a mosaic of
habitats and thus contains remarkable concentrations of mammals and birds,
the conservation area appears to be empty. But this is a trick of the
landscape, for its vastness, stretching in every direction, is deceptive,
giving the illusion of a much reduced quantity of game.
In fact, these plains were full of life during my visit, which took place
when the rains were imminent. The herbivores had given birth and the place
was bouncing with wildebeest calves, young Thompson's gazelles, zebra colts
and a host of other species.
Then strings of wildebeest set off to follow the rain. Files of animals
perhaps two or three miles in length came over the far horizon as a tiny
cloud of dust and after 20 minutes or so were barely distinguishable with
binoculars. At that distance they looked almost like North American plains
bison in a western.
Shortly, though, they were passing close at hand, walking, trotting,
cantering, walking again - cow, calf, cow, calf, making that strange
bleating sound and carving yet another groove across the plain. Crossing
these paths is like driving over the lines in a railway marshalling yard.
Gibbs Farm Safaris is run by Nigel Perks, a tall, broad Kiwi fed a love for
Africa on a childhood diet of David Attenborough's Zoo Quest programmes.
From our camp moored against a large rock (you have to link your camp to
something out there - simply to plonk a tent down on the open plain would be
terrifying), we set out every day without coming across another vehicle.
Nigel had an uncanny knack of foretelling what we would see and, with an
excellent eye for wildlife, ensured that the list included both serval and
African wild cat.
On the last day we were to have the privilege of joining a group visiting
Olduvai gorge, which also lies within the richly-endowed conservation area,
in the company of Mary Leakey. Looking round a kopje on the way we found a
dozing cheetah. With time to spare we sat and watched.
The cat lay warming on the rocks and gradually came to life. Cheetahs hunt
by sight, generally in the mornings, so we waited a little longer. Soon it
bounded nonchalantly from the rocks and strode casually on to the grass.
Here it stood for a while and then sat like a large china spotted cat. In
the distance were a group of gambolling, grazing Thompson's gazelles, too
far to stalk.
The cheetah flopped on the grass and stared glassily towards the horizon. A
faint hint of grey dust suggested approaching wildebeest.
The tension in the Land Rover was palpable. Wildebeest after wildebeest went
by. Perhaps we had mistaken the cheetah's intentions. But suddenly it was
flying; there was dust, panic, confusion, running hooves, a walking cheetah
 -it had missed.
Like cars on a packed motorway, wildebeest on the move speed up, slow down,
run, walk, trot, stop, canter, all for no apparent reason. The ones towards
the back had no idea why those further up were making haste and no inkling
that the cheetah was back in doormat mode.
This time there were no mistakes. We saw a spotted buff explosion, a pall of
dust and the waving chestnut legs of a wildebeest calf as the life was
suffocated out of it. We never did get to Olduvai.
Michael Woods' safari to the Ngorongoro conservation area in Tanzania with
Gibb's Farm Safaris was arranged by Art Of Travel of 268 Lavender Hill,
London SW11 1LJ, tel: 071-738-2038. Gibb's Farm Safaris is based at Gibb's
Farm, a lodge between Lake Manyara national park and the crater which is
linked to Ndutu, a second lodge on the edge of the short grass plains.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Travel: Past glory of a parched land - The Karoo, north of
Cape Town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM Cape Town the road to Graaff-Reinet winds north and east. For 100 miles
it runs through the lushest land on earth, through vineyards and pine
forests, alongside fruit orchards and alleys of oaks, over clear rivers and
green mountain ranges.
But somewhere around the town of Montagu, where I stopped for a late
breakfast on the edge of the Little Karoo, the richness starts to give out.
From here on the land takes on a desiccated look. Rainfall diminishes. High
mountain ranges cut off coastal moisture and the valleys bake in clear,
bone-dry air. The earth becomes poorer and flinty. The vegetation is sparse
and hugs the ground.
Near Barrydale, spiky green cactus appeared. Outside Calitzdorp, flocks of
tall ostriches sprinted along in the dry dust beside the car. Seventy miles
past Oudtshoorn the road veered north and entered the Great Karoo. A vast
area of empty skies and sun-struck plain, it is lonelier and more arid still
than the Little Karoo.
On I sped down a flat, die-straight highway, the distant conical hills known
as kopjesshimmering in the late afternoon heat. There were no trees, no
towns, no irrigated vineyards, just a sparse, endless carpet of spiky,
aromatic Karoo bush burned brown by the sun. Here a lonely farmhouse hid in
a kopje's long shadow; there a slowly-turning windmill signalled a water
tank and herd of heat-dazed sheep. For 50 miles before Graaff-Reinet I saw
nothing.
As I rolled into the wide main street I threw sideways glances at the shops
on either side: Peter's Home-Made Pies, the Massey Ferguson tractor repair
shop, the Maison Capri Beauty Parlour, the Ela-Gant Gift Shop, the Reinet
Billiard Hall, the Graaff-Reinet Men's Club, the Salt and Pepper Cafe.
Beyond, down tree-lined side streets, I could see simple white-washed houses
and the spires of half-a-dozen churches.
Graaff-Reinet looked like a stylised dream of small-town life several
decades ago, a place where the clocks tick more slowly than elsewhere. And,
as I discovered over the next few days, appearances are not deceiving - more
than most out-of-the-way places, Graaff-Reinet is not about to be rushed
into the future without thinking twice.
Graaff-Reineters say they like the town for its wide open feel, for the huge
spaces and leisurely rhythms that fill it. Money matters less. Success
matters less. Haste matters less. What does matter is remembering the
lessons of the past.
That the town has reasons for looking to its past became clear when I met
Johann van Zijl at the Drosdty Hotel, a magnificent building of
high-ceilinged, polished-plank reception rooms and flowery courtyards.
Sitting on a shady terrace in 40`C heat, van Zijl, a proud Afrikaner and
elder of the nearby Dutch Reformed Church, told me it was more than just a
hotel.
Built in the early 1800s as the residence of the Dutch landdrost - a
magistrate and chief administrator - the Drosdty stood as a symbol of white
civilisation, the headquarters of a vast, wild frontier district where life
was precarious and encouraged caution and conservatism at every turn. It
still does.
Graaff-Reinet's history is a long dirge of struggle, conflict and death. If
the Boers who brought their sheep to graze here in the 1770s were able, in a
few decades, to destroy the bushmen and hottentots who claimed the land,
their confrontations with more formidable black Xhosa tribes made this
eastern frontier a hostile place.
Nor was it just conflict with black Africans that brought insecurity and
bitterness. When the Cape colony was handed over to the British in 1806,
Afrikaners in Graaff-Reinet found their almost Biblical lifestyle threatened
by another enemy: a new group of white Africans determined to anglicise
them.
In the 1830s many sold their land to English farmers, who hold it still, and
in that great epic of Afrikaner lore, the Great Trek, marched north. Even
today, old rivalries resurface. When the town's Afrikaans and
English-speaking students compete each year on inter-school sports day, the
Boer war is thrashed out all over again.
But history is not the only element that provokes conservatism in the soul
of white Graaff-Reinet; there is also the on-going battle for survival with
the land itself.
Usually life in town revolves around home and family, but on Friday nights
the focus shifts to the Graaff-Reinet Men's Club, a bastion of English
tradition and male camaraderie. It is here, amid mounted game trophies and
the clicking of billiard balls, that sheep farmers from the outlying
districts come to drink and to relieve the loneliness of a week spent miles
from the nearest neighbour.
For most of its 100 years the club's bar-room has been a lively place, as
the bullet holes in its wooden bar suggest. But on the night I wandered in
and began chatting to farmer David Luscombe, the talk among these burly,
sun-burned men in worn khaki was of drought, bankruptcy and hard times.
Even in the best of times the Karoo is a place where merino sheep and angora
goat farming is risky. But farmers have learned to live with regular cycles
of drought. The key to survival, I heard from Luscombe with no surprise, is
to take no chances: make as little investment as possible, keep overheads
low, put food stock aside in the rich years, eke it out in the lean.
In the end, Graaff-Reinet's profound traditionalism may not be of great help
in coming to grips with the inevitable: creating a multi-racial society. The
town is not what it first appears to be: a small, all-white town of about
4,000.
On the other side of the dried-up Sunday's River, only a mile or so away,
are two large and dusty townships, one mixed-race, one black, totalling
24,000 people. Just how, under multi-racial rule, these landless masses will
regard individually-owned 100,000-hectare farms is an issue anticipated with
great anxiety.
In the meantime, there are signs that even Graaff-Reinet knows it cannot
slow the clock for ever. On a Saturday afternoon I went out with John
Luscombe to the township of Kroonvale. Here, on the very edge of the
sun-burned desert, in a brilliant green oval of well-watered grass, the
white farmers were taking on a township cricket team.
Multi-racial sport may be new in Cape Town; here it is revolutionary -
proof, after all, that even in the arid, unchanging Karoo, there is, from
time to time, something new under the sun.

FT  22 AUG 92 / As They Say in Europe: A taste of law and ordures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TO GO on holiday is to be cheated' is not one of the world-weary, cynical
maxims of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld but one of mine. Only in France,
however, has it been given force.
The state secretariat for consumer affairs has set up Operation Vacances 92,
which is sweeping across the land. Attacking beachside shacks which fry
their frites in the same oil many times over is merely one of its tasks.
There are more glamorous malefactors who have been highlighted in
Liberation. 'You could be the manager of a renowned palace on the Cote
d'Azur, welcoming well-off clients with large smiles while providing
contaminated food in luxury dining rooms.'
Apparently this hotel - the identity of which the authorities refuse to
reveal - used products past their sell-by date. 'And worse,' said
Liberation, 'behind the alluring descriptions there hid pre-packed meals
re-heated in an ordinary micro-wave.'
The scope of anti-contamination operations is impressive. Pizza sold at a
'concert' by the pop group Genesis was thrown into dustbins full of chlorine
and bleach to ensure that even music-crazed customers would not touch it.
Hundreds of kilos of charcuterie have been burnt in Ariege, a ton of dirty
meat at a wholesaler in the Dordogne, and thousands of re-frozen ice creams
were destroyed near Marseilles. Liberation even described a haul of holed
snorkel tubes.
International developments reinforced this disturbing picture of France on
holiday: the above revelations coincided with news of illicit imports of
hospital waste from Germany on a colossal scale.
Paris-Normandie put it all in the context of next month's Euro-referendum:
'Whether it is organised by German firms or whether it benefits from the
complicity of French importers, this traffic is all the more revolting
because it gives a supplementary argument to the anti-Maastricht faction.'
For this faction, the communist daily, Humanite replied with the headline:
'Ordures sans frontieres.'
It is perhaps necessary to add that, from my own recent experience, anybody
contemplating a French holiday should not be put off. There is more to
France than rotting meat, contaminated cooking oil, ammonia pizza and
suppurating hospital swabs.
A Swiss holiday will pose no such dangers. But the visitor should understand
the nature of the close-knit society, as revealed in a legal action last
week.
The Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported a case in Neuchatel where a man had built
a spyhole behind a one-way mirror so he could observe the young couple in
the bedsit next door. When the device was discovered, the couple complained
to the police, who took no action.
So, the couple sued, at which point the defendant died but the court awarded
total damages of nearly SFr6,000. The NZZ headline summed up the result:
'Voyeur's widow must pay compensation.'
Keeping an eye on the neighbours is a popular hobby in this part of Europe,
so it is not surprising that it could be backed by law in Bavaria.
Reporting from Munich for the Frankfurter Rundschau, Peter Fahrenholz wrote
of the plans of the state's interior minister, Edmund Stoiber, to establish
'security counsellors, contacts and linkmen' to act as intermediaries
between the population and the police. The idea is to be tested in
Nuremberg.
The socialist opposition sees such officials as successors to Nazi block
wardens Stoiber's spokesman, Gunter Schuster, denies this. He said the aim
was to move from a 'culture of looking away to a culture of looking in.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Food: Bass, a sleek and simple fishy feast - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLEEK and silvery with delicate flesh, sea bass is a fine fish for high
summer. While not cheap, it requires very little effort by the cook to make
a memorable feast.
Like most top-quality meats and fish, sea bass shows to the best advantage
if given very little embellishment. Cook it plainly and sauce it simply.
It seems a great pity to fillet such a handsome fish. For maximum effect,
cook and serve sea bass whole. If the fishmonger has not done so, cut off
the fins; these have sharp spikes, as do the gill covers. Then, gut and
scale it. Impeccable freshness is, of course, paramount.
Rick Stein, whose Seafood Restaurant in Padstow is one of the best reasons
to visit Cornwall, brushes sea bass with butter and roasts it on a thin
pallet of vegetables in a hot oven until the skin is crisp and the flesh is
tender. He serves it with Hollandaise sauce sharpened brilliantly with
sorrel.
Sea bass is suited equally well to oriental treatments.
SEA BASS WITH BLACK BEAN SAUCE (serves 6)
This party piece comes from a tome of favourite recipes from Prue Leith's
cookery school: Leith's Cookery Bible (Bloomsbury Pounds 20). Black beans
can be bought from Chinese supermarkets in tins or vacuum packs. Thicken the
sauce at the end, if you like, with 2 teaspoons cornflour.
Ingredients: 1 x 4 lb sea bass, cleaned and scaled; half a lemon; half a
dozen spring onions; 3 tablespoons fermented black beans; 1 garlic clove; 1
inch of fresh ginger root; 1 tablespoon sunflower oil; 2 teaspoons sesame
oil; 2 tablespoons each soy sauce and sherry; 1 teaspoon sugar.
Lay the fish on a large sheet of oiled foil. Sprinkle with sea salt and
pepper, cover with citrus slices, and crimp the foil to make a baggy (yet
securely-sealed) parcel. Cook on a baking sheet at 375F/190C (gas mark 5)
for 40 minutes.
Wash the beans thoroughly under a cold running tap. Chop finely the garlic,
ginger and half the spring onions.
Warm the sunflower oil in a small saucepan and cook the aromatics for 1
minute.
Add the beans, soy sauce, sherry, sugar and half a pint of cold water. Bring
slowly to simmering point. Cover and cook very gently for 15 minutes so
flavours blend and infuse. Then stir in the sesame oil.
Unwrap and slide the cooked fish on to a warmed dish and scatter with the
remaining spring onions, chopped finely. Hand round the sauce separately.
SEA BASS WITH SESAME &amp; SOY (serves 2)
Here is a dish to which you can turn when you want a fast feast for two. If
times are hard, grey mullet can be used instead of bass.
Ingredients: 1 x 1 1/2 lb sea bass, cleaned and scaled; 1 heaped teaspoon
sesame seeds; 3 1/2 tablespoons peanut or sunflower oil; 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons
ginger root chopped very finely; 3-4 spring onions chopped very finely; soy
sauce.
Make two or three deep slashes obliquely down each side of the fish. Paint
very lightly with oil and season with sea salt and plenty of coarsely-ground
black pepper. Grill for about 15 minutes, turning the fish carefully at
half-time.
Alternatively, steam the fish. This is even quicker (7-8 minutes should be
enough) and is less smelly, making it a wiser choice when the weather is
such that leaving the kitchen windows and back door wide open to waft away
fishy odours does not appeal.
While the fish cooks, toast the sesame seeds in a fat-less pan and reserve
them. Put the ginger and oil into the pan and place over low heat until very
hot and aromatic.
Add the finely-chopped spring onions to the saucepan, cover, and set aside
for 2-3 minutes while you move the cooked fish on to a hot serving dish.
Then add the sesame seeds to the pan and return it to the flame until
bubbling hot. Add a good splash of soy, shake to mix the ingredients, and
pour the sizzling sauce over the fish.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Wine: Twelve green bottles, and the cost can send you to the
wall - The case for mixed delights when buying wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS so special about the number 12? More particularly, why are we
expected to buy a full 12 bottles (or six magnums, or 24 halves) whenever we
buy young wine?
Part of the reason is that, traditionally, wine has been packed 12 bottles
to a case, presumably because this is the maximum number that all but the
puniest adults can be expected to carry at a time. Selling by the unbroken
case allows the merchant to pass on wine by the unit with minimal effort.
But now that merchants can generate more than Pounds 50 of profit from
selling a dozen bottles of wine en primeur, perhaps they ought to think
about doing some more work for their money and offering us mixed or smaller
cases.
For some time now, the Wine Society of Stevenage, Herts, has been offering
top-quality Burgundy by the six-pack. The society also puts together cases
(such as the one delivered to me the other day) of two bottles each of six
different and first-class 1989 clarets. If only more companies would put
themselves in their customers' place - after all, however delicious an
expensive wine might be, 12 bottles of it is quite a commitment.
Smaller lots would also help merchants to allocate the really sought-after
wines to a greater number of satisfied customers. And remember that Oddbins
sells young, smart wine by the bottle.
I approached the highly successful 1990 vintage in Burgundy with all this in
mind, loth to shell out more than Pounds 300 to acquire a single wine.
Almost every merchant used to an influx of en primeur cash has been touting
1990 burgundies, and I have been lucky enough to revel in several memorable
tastings of generally deep-coloured, evocatively scented, richly fruity,
well-structured reds, sometimes enlivened by some surprisingly good whites
(especially from Chablis).
Bibendum London NW1 offered a particularly popular range and, as is often
the case, Justerini &amp; Brooks of London SWl and Edinburgh had one of the best
selections, if few bargains. I was delighted, therefore, that - by waiting
until the wines were in J&amp;B's cellars - I could put together my own mixed
case, and was quite happy to pay a 10 per cent premium for the variety.
(Common advice is to buy wine with your friends, but they are usually
precisely the people whom you wish to delight with it).
All three wines from J&amp;B's new Pommard domaine, Coste-Caumartin, are rich
and exciting, varying in price (duty paid and VAT-inclusive) from Pounds
15.60 for a straight Pommard to Pounds 21.10 for Pommard, Boucherottes. You
could still buy a bottle of Jayer's Echezeaux for Pounds 40.10 but a more
modest and much earlier-maturing choice (in my tasting note for this, I see
I wrote the word 'gorgeous' twice, would be Bruno Clair's Savigny, La
Dominode, from 80-year-old vines, at Pounds 14.60.
I could not resist Dauvissat's grand cru Chablis, Le Clos, at Pounds 22.10 -
another 'gorgeous' wine, I see (I really must take a few lessons in wine
description), with a stupendous conjunction of ripeness, acidity and length
of flavour.
But there are two 1990 red burgundies which made such an impact on me
recently that I am considering giving in not only to the necessity of buying
them by the case but even paying extra for the privilege.
You have to pay Pounds 25 for life membership of the Bin Club - although you
do get a welcoming magnum of Louis Roederer 1985 in return which is worth
far more. The club is a clever continuous wine-buying scheme based in an old
Victorian stone brewery in Wickwar, Gloucestershire (tel: 0454-294085). More
than a dozen of us assembled there to trawl through 74 possibilities for the
club's Burgundy offer, and two of the most exciting wines were not two of
the most expensive.
An almost cheekily rich Vosne-Romanee, Les Suchots, from Domaine Chantal
Lescure, seemed a snip at Pounds 200 a case and the headily dense Clos de
Vougeot, Le Grand Maupertuis, from Anne et Francois Gros, ditto at Pounds
284. But note that these are in-bond prices and do not include VAT, so there
is at least another Pounds 45 to pay per case.
Perhaps I should sign up for some of Armand Rousseau's superlative,
long-lived Chambertins which clever Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex, was
able to include in its recent 1990 Burgundy offer.
Prices vary from Pounds 131.88 for a village wine to Pounds 383.88 for the
Chambertin, but these are even lower approximations to final reality than
the Bin Club's prices as they even exclude delivery to Britain.
And the Chambertin, which is allocated at one case per customer, will have
sold out long ago, thereby infuriating far more people than it pleases.
I asked Hugo Rose, of Lay &amp; Wheeler, if the company had considered making
more flexible offers, but was put firmly in my place. 'Most of our customers
are well-trained,' was how he put it. 'They say they wouldn't dream of
buying fewer than 12 bottles.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Special Report on Courses and Careers: If you failed to make
the grade - Do not despair. Poor A-levels need not be ruinous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Bs or not two Bs? That is the question for the thousands of A-level
students whose examination results will be known this week. Is it time to
decide which favourite CDs to take to university - or which universities
will take C/Ds?
Failure to get the required A-level results can mean shock, disappointment
and the upsetting of cherished plans for higher education. 'The majority of
students will not have considered the possibility that they might fail,'
says Julia Cox, a personal tutor with Mander Portman Woodward (MPW), a
leading London tutorial college originally established to cater for those
retaking A-levels. But it need not mean unqualified disaster.
As a first course of action, Cox recommends a direct approach from students
to their chosen colleges, to see if grade requirements can be relaxed. 'I
find on the whole that admissions tutors are extremely friendly. They are
trying to do a very difficult job as fairly as possible.' An appeal, or even
a personal visit, from a well-organised hopeful, armed with the necessary
information (such as UCCA or PCAS reference numbers) and offering as much
help as possible, can result in the college reconsidering its terms.
Admissions tutors are conscious that the examination system is something of
a lottery, and a demonstration of real commitment by a student can sometimes
offset lower grades. 'It's worth having a go,' insists Cox.
The likelihood of success will be modified by the chosen subject and the
market. Many colleges offering less popular courses - physics, engineering,
most technical subjects - are already beginning to tell students how to
proceed if they do not get their grades. On the other hand, over-subscribed
subjects such as law, English, medicine, and the history of art present more
of a problem, and the universities can call the tune.
'College admissions are a perfect example of the law of supply and demand,'
says Joe Rushton, chairman of MPW. Most institutions now get most of their
money as a direct result of recruiting students. So, within the constraints
of available space, teaching staff, or government quotas, the institutions'
aim is to get as many students as possible. 'If they have a place, they want
a student to fill it. There is a real educational market.'
Students cannot be moved into the UCCA/PCAS clearing system until they have
been rejected on the offers they are currently holding, so it pays to
establish one's position as early as possible. Places may be available on
the same or similar courses elsewhere and the press will be carrying details
of what is available. But the formal clearing process is very slow - it can
take up to six weeks. Cox recommends students to put their areas of interest
in descending order of priority, get on the phone and do their own research.
'Arm yourself with the UCCA or PCAS books, your reference number, some good
things to say about yourself and a lot of patience. Just keep ringing round.
As soon as you get someone who takes down your details, go back to your
tutor and get them to take over from there. It comes down to individual
student motivation a lot of the time. You can't sit back and let the system
grind.' However, she cautions against the temptation to accept a place just
because it has been offered - you can lose future entitlement to a local
authority grant.
A good deal of rapid rethinking and positive action has to be done at a time
when students are still smarting from their disappointment. But an A-level
certificate which fails to 'make the grade' can sometimes be a welcome
opportunity for a change of heart where young people have drifted towards a
particular course on the basis of a generalised interest, or under pressure
from parents or teachers.
If this is the case, what questions should students ask themselves? 'Work
backwards from where you eventually see yourself,' advises Cox. 'Look at the
career indicators, but also look at the fact that you will spend three years
of your life studying.'
Many students have not really thought beyond their interest in a subject for
its own sake. There is nothing wrong with that but, bearing in mind the
thousands of courses available, it may not be as difficult or as
time-consuming to find something equally appealing. 'When they have been
shaken up a bit, students are open to suggestions, if you genuinely offer
help,' says Cox. 'That doesn't mean that we capitalise on the fact that they
are vulnerable. But they are more willing to listen.'
Disappointing A-level results may reinforce a determination to pursue a
particular course; a change of direction can throw up new demands for higher
grades. In either case, the student will be faced with 'retakes'.
'What students see when they are sitting there with their envelope is: same
school, same subjects, same struggle,' says Rushton. What is needed is an
injection of enthusiasm. It is a question of interpreting the certificate in
the most positive way. In most cases, one result will be acceptable and
another can be improved if the exam is retaken. But there is often a subject
which a student rather regrets having chosen in the first place. Many young
people do not discover their real areas of interest until well into their
A-level studies. A different subject, such as politics, statistics or social
biology, which can be studied without prior GCSE, can add freshness and
motivation to a retake course.
Having decided to retake a subject, a short burst of energy can get the exam
out of the way by January, with the prospect of improved results, an
interesting higher education course to look forward to, and eight months
ahead for other pursuits. It is not a bad outlook.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Special Report on Courses and Careers: Make the most of a
year off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARILYN BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE strain of A-levels the idea of taking a year off before further
study is very appealing. But it is important to make good use of the time,
and to do so means deciding on specific objectives and making some realistic
plans.
Perhaps the first question to ask is: is it worth it? As a starting point,
Taking a Year Off (Trotman and Company) contains some useful tests and
checklists as a means of assessing the rewards and pitfalls of various
options, plus general information and case studies.
The possibilities fall broadly into three categories: travel, work and
short-term study. A gap year can provide the travel opportunity of a
lifetime and there are extensive concessionary travel schemes available to
young people. But it is worth investing in a return ticket. Local
emergencies often arise abruptly and extended periods of travel can be
lonely. For the intrepid but indigent, Vacation Work publishes guides to
opportunities and working conditions in various countries to supplement
income en route.
Rod Leith, at Returned Volunteer Action, has some exciting suggestions for
unskilled young people interested in voluntary work abroad. These include
joining work brigades, scientific expeditions, health, environmental and
agricultural schemes, in locations such as Nicaragua and Cuba. Leith
undertakes to field inquiries to the relevant organisations.
The National Youth Agency publishes an information sheet (50p) listing
opportunities for voluntary work within the UK. If the idea of conservation
appeals, the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers trains young people
as volunteer officers on projects such as dry stone walling or hedge laying.
As well as practical skills, volunteers have the opportunity to develop
their abilities for administration, environmental assessment and
negotiation.
'We don't ask anything except enthusiasm and commitment,' says BTCV's
Paulette Cohen. Volunteers are interviewed fully beforehand so that they
know what they are letting themselves in for.
Community Service Volunteers provides accommodation, food, travel expenses
and Pounds 21 per week pocket money to volunteers working in community care
settings. CSV's projects range from independent living schemes, helping
people with disabilities to live comfortably in their own homes, to day
centres and working with the homeless, or young offenders.
A short term study course can be used to acquire an additional skill between
A-levels and higher education. The Directory of Independent Training and
Tutorial Organisations (Trotman and Co) lists courses available in the UK's
private sector, and the Directory of Further Education, (CRAC Learning
Materials) those in local authority colleges. Courses include core skills
such as computing, teaching English as a foreign language, and more exotic
pursuits such as cordon bleu cookery or acupuncture.
For study abroad, The Student Handbook, (Macmillan) is a directory of
courses and institutions in the 12 EC countries, with information on
application procedures, fees, grants, social security and accommodation.
Studying a foreign language in situ can break down the prejudices of the
most confirmed monolinguist, and Cultural and Educational Services Abroad
offers information and advice on language tuition worldwide.
Often the most difficult part of taking a gap year is allaying parents'
fears. However, with sensible planning, it can be a rewarding experience.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE small print of resolutions put to shareholders at company meetings
seldom attracts much attention. Votes go through on the nod. Formalities are
tidied up and everyone goes home.
The small print sometimes bears closer examination, though. By next summer
most UK companies will have asked their shareholders for permission to do
away with share certificates and the transfer forms used when shares are
sold. The changes are needed for companies to join Taurus, the Stock
Exchange's long-delayed paperless trading system, which is due for launch
sometime next year.
Around 30 companies have sought - and got - their shareholders' support for
the switch, among them BT, Lonrho, Yorkshire Water and Argyll. Most
companies, though, have delayed, many because they have yet to be persuaded
that Taurus will get off the drawing board or because they lack confidence
in the system.
Marks and Spencer's chairman, Sir Richard Greenbury, said at the company's
annual general meeting last month that he was not asking shareholders to
approve a switch to Taurus. The system is untried, and it would be better to
wait to see if it works first, he said.
Should shareholders withhold their support when other companies ask them to
vote on the switch? Certainly, there are still many things about Taurus
which are unclear. One is the compensation scheme for investors who lose
money through the system.
The government has bullied the Stock Exchange into agreeing compensation of
up to Pounds 250,000 for each claim. It is not clear yet, though, whether or
how the brokers and others who are plugged into Taurus will be able to
provide this sort of cover. Nor is it clear what types of losses will be
covered, and which will not.
There is also uncertainty about when all the technical obstacles will be
overcome, and whether any computer network that is used by several hundred
banks, stockbrokers and other institutions can be made secure.
There are also other considerations that may give shareholders pause.
Dealing will not be any cheaper, and may even get more expensive as banks
and brokers try to recoup the cost of joining Taurus. Shareholders will be
able to sell shares without signing anything: anyone who wants the added
assurance that shares will only be transferred on his or her written consent
will have to pay for the privilege.
Taurus is not all bad news for the private shareholder. You will no longer
have to worry about the safekeeping of share certificates, or pay for
replacement certificates when old ones are lost.
Not convinced of the benefits? Well, resistance may be useless. Most
companies are largely owned by institutional shareholders, who have more
powerful reasons for supporting Taurus and who have the muscle to out-vote
private shareholders. But that should not stop some brave soul standing up
at an AGM, share certificates clutched to the breast, and shouting: 'What's
in it for me?'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Selling a business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE been in business as a sole trader for the last 10 years. I am 65 and
propose selling the business to two colleagues.
It is a service business and the only asset is the goodwill, which has been
evaluated at Pounds 200,000. Unfortunately the two colleagues do not have
Pounds 100,000 each readily available to make the purchase.
Are there any provisions in capital gains legislation or related case law
which allows a would-be purchaser of a business to repay the purchase price
over a period of time out of profits generated from the business without
affecting the seller's CGT requirement relief.
Yes, there is no problem (so far as CGT is concerned) if the sale agreement
provides for the consideration to be paid by instalments over a number of
years.
The solicitor who draws up the sale agreement will be able to guide you
through the tax maze. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT6 -
Retirement: disposal of a business.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Capital gains on US shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE recently had share certificates from several US investments, which
were previously held on my behalf by overseas nominee banks, transferred
into my sole name in the UK.
As there will be seven quarterly dividends paid to me (28 a year) what is
the most efficient and economical way of processing these? Presenting them
at a bank incurs multiple commission and varying exchange rates.
Would it be possible to open an interest-bearing dollar account in this
country, if so how would UK tax be deducted and recorded? Would you be able
to suggest any American banks I could contact for this purpose?
If you pay the dividends into a dollar account in the UK, the bank will
deduct 10 per cent UK tax (or 25 per cent on dividends which are exempt from
US tax) by reference to the exchange rate for the day.
You may find it is more economical to have the dividends mandated to a bank
in the US. You could then have money sent over (in sterling) to you existing
UK bank account, at convenient intervals or as required.
We cannot recommend particular banks: it may be best to have a chat with
your existing bank.
Bear in mind that each withdrawal from a foreign-currency bank account
produces a chargeable gain or an allowable loss for CGT purposes. If you are
thinking of having more than one dollar bank account, write to the Inland
Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB, and
ask for a copy of SP10/84 - Capital gains tax: foreign banks accounts.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Nominee accounts, are they entirely
safe? - The debate over protection for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY stock market investors are surprised when they discover shares held by
their stockbroker may not be in their own name but in that of a nominee
company.
These companies are formed by brokers or fund managers to hold shares on
behalf of their clients. Investors with personal equity plans often find
their shares held in a nominee account.
Nominee accounts have existed since the 1950s, but their use has grown in
recent years. In 1957, 12.5 per cent of institutional and private
shareholdings was in nominee accounts, rising to 26.1 per cent in 1975. In
the 1980s the proportion rose from 33.4 per cent in 1981 to 61 per cent in
1989.
Stockbrokers favour nominee accounts because they ease administration and
reduces costs. Companies usually have to pay their registrar a fee based on
the number of shareholder accounts. If private investors are held in one
nominee the registrar is paid for only one account.
In the run-up to the introduction of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's paperless
trading system, stockbrokers are urging clients to switch into nominee
accounts. This will ease the administrative headache of the transition to
Taurus for brokers.
Investors also face less paperwork with a nominee account. They do not have
to sign transfer deeds to sell shares, and dividends and rights issues are
handled by the nominee company and the client.
However, there are disadvantages. The investor does not automatically
receive the annual report of the company in which he has bought shares. More
importantly, nominee services fall outside the scope of the Financial
Services Act and technically are not covered by the Investors Compensation
Scheme. This pays up to Pounds 48,000 of losses by an investor in a
FSA-regulated company .
Instead, the investor's only protection is whatever insurance policy the
broker may have, though reputable houses should have adequate insurance for
their clients.
There are two main types of nominee account: a designated nominee, where the
broker's name and that of the client appear together on the company
register; and a pooled nominee account, which groups together shareholders
with only the nominee company's name appearing on the register.
Alison Rennison, Taurus project manager at Barclays, says designated nominee
accounts are preferable, if only because were a stockbroker to go bust,
sorting out who is owed what in a pooled nominee account is more difficult.
David Cresswell, of the Securities and Investments Board, the regulatory
body for the investment industry, says that in practice, if a nominee
company goes into default, the investor is likely to have a claim against
the investment company running it. 'You would probably be covered because of
the close connection between the authorised institution and the nominee
company,' he says.
So long as the investment company, or stockbroker, is authorised by Sib or
one of the self-regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Futures
Authority (as it is legally bound to be), compensation would be available.
The investor can claim against the investment company, for example, if it:
has been negligent in selecting the nominee,
has breached its regulator's rules regarding safe custody of client assets,
or;
has given the investor a guarantee that it stands behind the liabilities of
the nominee company.
This was illustrated last year when Diameter, a low cost stockbroker,
collapsed. Some investors who had instructed shares to be bought for them
could not find them in the nominee company. The ICS compensated them on the
grounds that the authorised company, Diameter Stockbrokers, had been engaged
in wrongdoing because it did not buy stock when it was instructed to do so.
This provides scant reassurance to those in nominee accounts. With this in
mind, Mike Jones of Capel Cure Myers has called for level playing fields.
'We've argued with the SFA that since it is treating nominee clients as part
of the whole stockbroking operation, we see no reason why it should
differentiate between a client in a nominee account and one with their name
on the register.'
APCIMS (the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and
Stockbrokers) has also been discussing the issue with SIB.
This week it secured agreement from Sib that member firms of APCIMS can tell
clients that a nominee meeting 'certain conditions and criteria will be
eligible to apply for compensation under the terms of the Investors
Compensation Scheme in the event of a SFA-regulated firm's default. The
Scheme Rules treat them in the same way as those with stock registered in
their own name.'
These conditions include making sure that the nominee company is well
managed and accepting liability for losses in the nominee as if they had
arisen in the company itself.
Sib announced last month, as a result of the Maxwell affair, that it would
review the supervision of the custody of investor assets, including the
'increasing use by investment firms of nominees.'
The introduction of Taurus also creates opportunities. Details of a
compensation scheme are under discussion, and that could plug the gaps in
the ICS.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Big in a tiny market - A look at
a model train maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Farish muses over the reaction of people when they hear what he does.
'It gets very interesting at cocktail parties. When our company made
speedboats people used to say: 'What, you make boats? That sounds
impressive'. Now that I tell them I make model railways there's this tiny
second when they just look at you. They are thinking of a little guy at the
back of his garage playing around with stuff on a bench. You know, wife,
dog, torn cardigan.'
Well, Graham Farish, the company named after Peter's father, is not quite
like that. From its small factory near Poole, Dorset, it claims to supply 85
per cent of the UK market for tiny N gauge railways and equipment. In the
Lilliputian scale of railway modelling, N gauge is half the size of the
Double-00 of Hornby fame.
Competing with a battery of German manufacturers, Graham Farish makes 20,000
to 30,000 mini locomotives a year and 60,000 models of other rolling stock
as well as supplying complete train sets with track, model buildings and
miniature figures. Some items, such as track and electric motors are bought
in but most are made in-house. 'I like to think of us as a microscopic
vertical corporation,' says Farish.
The recession trimmed turnover to Pounds 800,000 last year from a peak of
Pounds 920,000 in 1989. 'The market is down 20 per cent and I reckon it
could fall another 10 per cent.' UK yearly sales of all forms of miniature
railways fell from Pounds 30m in the 1970s to half that now. Farish says
though that, until the recession, sales were growing steadily. He reckons
three quarters of customers are adults - the man in the council flat who
train spots on Saturdays, the middle class collector with a giant layout in
the play room, finicky club enthusiasts known in the hobby world as 'rivet
counters'.
N gauge forms just 15 per cent of the UK model rail market compared with 45
per cent in Germany. The German market is served by several high quality
German makers including Fleischmann, Minitrix and Marklin. But these German
makers offer few models of British locos and it is British equipment the UK
rail modeller mainly wants.
Graham Farish started in 1919 and once claimed to supply three quarters of
the components used in British radios as well as selling goods from water
sprinklers to fertilisers. It started making model trains in 1947, got into
N gauge in 1970 and dropped out of Double-00 in the late '70s when Airfix
and Mainline piled into an already crowded market, shunting prices downwards
in the process. It now earns all its income from model railways.
Graham Farish's manufacturing plant turns out some 400 different products.
With locomotives composed of more than 100 parts, the company must juggle
with over 4,000 different components. This hardly causes a storage headache
because tracks are less than a third of an inch wide, rolling stock an inch
high and rivets for holding the models together a few millimetres or so
long.
Farish, who co-owns and co-runs the business with his brother Gordon says
manufacturing processes are not up to scratch. 'We have started making
improvements here.'
To manufacture models, copper electrodes are cut to the shape of a
component. This electrode is used to burn through steel by spark erosion -
creating a facsimile of the electrode by 'moltenising' metal. The resulting
'tools' are used to produce components by plastic injection or metal
die-casting. Printing on the rolling stock involves nylon printing plates on
which silicon pads pick up the ink and deposit it on the model's body.
Microscopic brass rivets are inserted by air pressure.
The tool room is rather careworn, the casting machine is of 1940s vintage
and the company purchased a computer design system for drawing components
only this year. Preparing drawings for a wholly new model - like the British
Rail 158 Sprinter - can take up to 10 months. Farish says tooling up for a
complete new loco can cost up to Pounds 30,000 so the company picks rolling
stock chassis on which it can put several bodies and bodies that can take
different liveries.
Model shops say Graham Farish coaches are the best in the business but that
its locos are less detailed and slightly less accurate than those of the
Germans. However, they are Pounds 15 or so cheaper.
'On a Class 47 diesel the steps for the driver from the bogey to the cab are
in a certain position. For the Class 37 it is the same but the cab is set
back a bit so we should reposition the steps by five millimetres. We don't
do it. Marklin would but you pay an arm and a leg for that. We produce good
quality, life-like products. If we did more the cost would go up and the
market would shrink.' Usual retail prices range from Pounds 29 to Pounds 68
for locos, about Pounds 8 for coaches and Pounds 3 to Pounds 7 for wagons.
It also sells complete train sets, and will deliver to your door a rail
system already laid out on block board for Pounds 375.
Recession has cut margins. 'We normally can make about 10 per cent,' says
Farish. 'Now we are just making a profit. If you have a lot of volume you
can make a lot of money. We need more volume.'
To help provide that, Graham Farish two years ago made 100,000 push-along
locos for a Shredded Wheat promotion and has been talking to McDonald's
about something similar. 'I also want to try and utilise our equipment to
make other, quite different products.'

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Children who hold a bank to account -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST MONTH, my two daughters (aged 10 and seven) learned that their National
Westminster World Savers bank accounts had gone the same way as the dodo.
According to the colourful publication produced for them: 'Some World Savers
have been worried over the environmental costs of producing Our World
magazine, the Royal Mint medal and the plastic membership pack' - all of
which focused on assisting the World Wide Fund For Nature.
The bank also pointed out that 'many customers are aware that, more
recently, NatWest has developed a different account, First Reserve, with
several advantages over and above those offered by World Savers. In
particular, First Reserve offers rates of interest which rise to reflect
balances maintained and, even at the lowest balances, pay significantly more
than World Savers.' The bank recommended switching to First Reserve.
At that time, registered non-taxpayers like my daughters had been receiving
World Savers interest of only 3 per cent gross. First Reserve offered 4.25
per cent gross on amounts up to Pounds 99 with rates increasing in stages so
that, for example, accounts with Pounds 1,000 received 6.25 per cent.
NatWest deserves credit for writing to savers explaining its changes in
accounts. Too many banks and building societies allow savers to leave their
money in inappropriate accounts earning little (or no) interest when new and
much better ones are available.
My children feel, though, that banks and building societies should credit
youngsters with more intelligence. Most of the comics which accompany
accounts aimed at children are rather simple (although Our World magazine
was an exception). But why do banks and building societies not use such
publications to explain and promote a greater and more detailed knowledge of
savings and economics?
Why do they not mention how to buy shares and explain what share ownership
means - perhaps using a few well-known companies like Walt Disney and United
Biscuits? They could also explain what the bank does with their money. To
whom is it lent? How does the bank or building society make a profit?
Like many other savers, my children have become more sophisticated over the
years. While 'freebies' such as money boxes, comics and other incentives are
still very welcome, higher rates of interest are even more desirable in
these difficult economic times. So, if it comes to a choice between a
freebie and a good rate of interest, my children know where their priority
lies.
In any case, the number of accounts at building societies offering special
incentives to young savers seems to be decreasing rapidly. This could be due
to children keeping a tiny sum in them to qualify for the freebies but
placing larger sums in other accounts, sometimes with the same society.
The more children who do this, however, the quicker the demise of these
accounts is likely to be as it becomes uneconomic to operate millions of
accounts with very low balances and still provide freebies. Already, we have
seen the end of the Portman building society's Young Generation account,
with its free coloured pencils and other incentives, and the Chelsea Kids
account.
Some types of account still pay more interest to children than adults. While
children can no longer open a Chelsea Kids account, those with money in it
get better interest than an adult with an account of less than Pounds 1,000
at the same society.
Some accounts vary the interest depending upon the age of the child. The
Junior Barclay Plus account for under-11s pays less than a Barclay Plus
account for those between 11-16 (although if those young savers had Pounds
100 or more, they would be better off in an ordinary higher-rate deposit
account).
Many children receive money from grandparents. But sometimes this can give
rise to shocks. I know of one grandparent who had been paying Pounds 2 a
month by direct debit into TSB accounts for each of his grandchildren since
they were born.
When, last month, the father was asked to take control of the passbooks, he
discovered that the interest rate on those accounts was only 2.5 per cent -
and that it was possible to switch those accounts immediately to a First
Save account paying 7.25 per cent gross. He also found that tax had been
deducted from the interest.
I suspect there are millions of accounts like these where people are having
tax deducted unnecessarily from interest when their income is too low to
incur a tax liability.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Rough ride for employee share plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEE share schemes have hit one of the most turbulent patches in their
12-year history, with high drop-out rates as recession and company
restructurings sap investor confidence or force withdrawals. But the schemes
continue to offer some of the highest interest rates available as well as
one of the safer ways of gambling on stock market recovery.
More than 1,900 companies run share/save schemes in association with
building societies or National Savings. Employees agree to save between
Pounds 30 and Pounds 250 a month via a five- or seven-year save-as-you-earn
(SAYE) contract. At the end of the term, a tax-free bonus is added to the
amount saved and employees can either take the cash or use it to buy shares
in the company at a price fixed when the SAYE contract began - up to 20 per
cent below the market price at the time.
The tax-free bonus rates are adjusted periodically by the Treasury. In
October, the five-year bonus drops to 12 1/2 months' payments while the
seven-year bonus goes down to 25 months. This will give a tax-free return
equivalent to 7.49 per cent over five years or 7.83 per cent over seven.
But savers in schemes started within the past two years have locked-in rates
as high as 9.2 per cent over seven years or 8.9 per cent over five.
In some cases, the savings side of the scheme is all that remains after
share price movements destroy the value of the fixed-price options. For
instance, a BICC scheme maturing this month after five years has a
fixed-price option of 284.8p against the market price of 239p.
'Those 1,500 people are under water - they will all be taking the money,'
said Bob Birkhead, manager of corporate business administration at the
Halifax building society, which operates schemes for 350 companies. He added
that the society recently had increased the drop-out rate in its share/saver
computer model from 5 per cent to 7 per cent annually. But he noted that
average savings also were rising, from between Pounds 30 and Pounds 35 a
month to almost Pounds 40.
One of the most dramatic slides in share price has been at Asda, where
employees with share/save contracts hold options priced at 133p, 108p, 84p
and 65p against the recent market price of 24 1/2 p.
The Yorkshire building society, which operates schemes for 182 companies,
has noticed a 40 per cent drop-out rate over the past year. 'If people want
the money, saving is the first thing to go,' said corporate business manager
Maggie Whitmore. Savers who quit during the first year of a scheme receive a
refund of contributions only but interest of 5 per cent, tax-free, is added
in years two to five.
On taking a random sample of schemes maturing soon, Whitmore said she was
surprised by the number still in profit. Silentnight company schemes
maturing this month allow employees to buy shares, now 198p, at 104p and 27p
but only 68 people completed the savings terms out of 301 who started.
How share/save participants fare in mergers depends largely on the rules of
the scheme and the companies involved. Option-holders may have the
frustration of seeing the share price propelled to great heights by takeover
talk, yet still miss out. Like people leaving the company, they may be
forced to exercise their options early, within six months of the merger or
not at all, using only the savings already built-up. If this happens during
the first three years of the a scheme, there may also be an income tax bill.
On the bright side, transfers to a predator company's share/save scheme are
sometimes possible without penalty.
In demergers, which are less common, treatment of employees can be subject
to the company's negotiating skills and, perhaps, generosity. ICI is to meet
the building societies operating its share/save scheme in the next few weeks
to discuss terms for the 20,000 employees holding contracts if the company's
proposed demerger goes ahead. Options on ICI shares are fixed at prices of
Pounds 13.81, Pounds 8.91, Pounds 8.14 and Pounds 11.83 compared with the
recent market price of Pounds 11.05.
Employees in recent demergers have had contrasting experiences. BAT
employees belonging to the demerged Argos and Wiggins Teape Appleton
divisions were 'hard done by' according to Mark Chamberlain, head of
personnel services at BAT Industries, who explained that they had been hit
three ways: losing out by having to exercise their options early on a
reduced number of shares; missing compensation for the lower intrinsic value
of the BAT share caused by the demerger; and then paying extra income tax.
People who stayed with BAT Industries were also 'very disappointed indeed,'
Chamberlain added. Barred from exercising their options early, they saw the
market price of the shares drop to reflect the demerger without any
corresponding adjustment to the option price. The BAT price dropped from
816p in September 1989 to 738p after the Argos demerger in April 1990, and
to 650p after the Wiggins Teape demerger. The BAT share/save option prices
had been fixed at 647p, 393p 631p and 405p in the years back to 1986.
Despite the disappointment, Chamberlain said there had been no mass
defections from the scheme. A further 7,000 employees had joined schemes
launched since the demerger with options at 430p, 524p and 532p.
He explained that the company had wished to adjust the pre-1990 option
prices to take account of the demerger but had failed to win over the Inland
Revenue and John Major, then the chancellor of the exchequer. Officials also
refused to allow BAT employees demerging to Argos and Wiggins Teape to
switch their savings into the schemes to be launched by those companies.
Employees of Racal were more fortunate in last year's demerger of Vodafone.
About 8,000 of them, holding options at prices ranging from 80p to 176p,
were given the right to exercise them early. This meant they were able to
buy Racal Electronics, then worth 229p, in time to qualify for free shares
in Vodafone (57 for 100).
Racal helped to arrange loans for employees so that they could buy the
amount of shares they would have received if the savings contract had run
its full term. The company also compensated employees for any extra income
tax charged as a result.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: BES gets new lease of life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business expansion scheme (BES) is back, with another 16 months to go
before the government bids it adieu. The continued proliferation of
'contracted exit' schemes involving universities and housing associations is
in line with expectations. But the revival of more entrepreneurial schemes
is more surprising.
BES companies which are not backed ultimately by property are very risky.
They cannot be justified as a home for mainstream savings - but they can be
a tax-efficient way to invest money you are prepared to lose. Most such
schemes make for rather more entertaining investments than you can manage
through National Savings.
Offerings at present include Musica Oscura, raising money for a new record
label backed by the Consort of Musicke which will specialise in early music;
Spittoon, a television production vehicle for the makers of the satirical
programme Spitting Image; Beethoven, a chain of classical record shops; and
Artroute, which aims to build a new two-seat British sports car, the Mirach.
None of these companies can be recommended as a secure investment in its own
right compared with the possibilities on offer from the assured tenancy
sector. But the financiers who piece together BES companies have spent the
past four years squeezing as much risk as they can out of the system.
This led to contracted exit schemes where companies buy accommodation for
universities or housing associations in return for a pledge to buy back the
property at a fixed price after five years when BES exemptions expire. Thus,
they could predict a fixed return.
Universities and housing associations are not naturally strong financial
institutions, though. With property prices in reverse, BES sponsors looked
for third-party guarantors and self-financing deals.
The most recent such offering is Bessa Blue Chip, which is sponsored by
Close Brothers. Barclays direct mortgage service, part of Barclays bank, is
contracted to pay Pounds 1.20 for every Pounds 1.00 share after five years.
Top-rate taxpayers will effectively have paid only 60p, so this is
equivalent to Barclays offering to double your money in five years.
A similar offer, The Residences At Manchester (TRAM), sponsored by Hodgson
Martin, will buy accommodation for Manchester university's institute of
science and technology. After five years, Pounds 1.28 will be paid for every
Pounds 1.00 share.
Finally, reversionary schemes, where BES companies buy houses cheaply from
the elderly and then allow them to live there until they die, also seem set
to gain in popularity with Johnson Fry, the leading BES sponsor, planning
new issues. These offer the opportunity to buy properties very cheaply but
there could be problems in exiting from the deals after five years.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE OVERALL impression from our interpretation of the pattern of directors'
dealings is still that the market is cheap. Purchasers far outweigh the
number of sales and the actual cash value of many of these purchases is
rising, reflecting a growing boldness in the boardroom.
Nonetheless, there are still sellers about. Three directors sold a total of
130,000 shares in Dalepak Foods at 287p per share. In the case of all three
it was considerably more than 10 per cent of their respective holdings.
Since the beginning of 1991, these shares have risen strongly from 150p,
touching 430p earlier this year. Final results announced in July revealed
earnings up 30 per cent, but the accompanying chairman's statement warned
that there was still no sign of recovery in the marketplace.
Carlton Communications, the television services group, has been one of the
better performing Footsie stocks, outperforming the market by some 27 per
cent over the last year. Nigel Wray, a non-executive director, has sold
100,000 shares at 550p leaving him with 187,000 shares, still the fourth
largest holder on the board. The group is still expected to show
double-digit earnings growth in the year to September 1992.
Last week we mentioned Ibstock Johnsen and referred to the purchase by Colin
Hope of 20,000 at 47.5p. This week, Paul Hyde-Thompson, the chairman, bought
50,000 at 37p. Given that it was Hyde-Thompson who sold shares to such very
good effect at the end of last year, the purchase is worth noting. It should
be borne in mind, however, that it does not involve a large amount of money.

   BRITISH GAS announces its second quarter results on Tuesday
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the first since it called for a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry
into the UK gas market.
The share price has slipped slightly on the resulting uncertainty and is
unlikely to be boosted by Tuesday's figures. Expectations range widely, from
a historic cost net loss of Pounds 75m to a Pounds 150m profit, reflecting
forecasting difficulties in the first year of quarterly reporting by British
Gas and a changed year-end from March to December.
However, the spring quarter is a period of slacker demand, and so cannot be
compared with the Pounds 658m profit made in the first quarter.
Interest centres on the dividend with the market looking for a signal that
the payout will not be affected by the MMC referral and recent regulatory
changes. Estimates range from 6.4p to 7.7p for the first half, with most
around 6.5p.
W H Smith is expected to report on Wednesday pre-tax profits for the year to
May 31 of Pounds 110m-Pounds 114m. This will be a healthy increase on the
previous year's Pounds 89m, helped by last summer's rights issue and the
disposal of its loss-making television division. The retailer is likely to
raise its full-year dividend to 13p or 14p from 12.5p.
Newspaper wholesaling, the subject of a MMC study launched this past week,
has continued to perform strongly. US operations have been good and UK
retailing reasonably resilient. But Do-It-All, the do-it-yourself chain
owned jointly with Boots, is likely to have made a much lower contribution.
Guardian Royal Exchange, the smallest of the UK's five leading composite
(general and life) insurers, is expected to report a cut in pre-tax losses
on Wednesday, underlining the sector's recent improvement. Pre-tax losses
are expected to fall to between Pounds 45m and Pounds 60m compared with a
deficit of Pounds 88m at the interim stage last year.

<TEXT>
MANY PEOPLE like the idea of investing in the stock market but are scared of
losing their capital. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Marketing is the latest
company to try to attack this problem, with a fund called Protected Capital
Plus. The idea is to give investors exposure to stock market growth while
ensuring that their capital never falls in value.
The Foreign &amp; Colonial product is a new twist on an old concept. The bulk of
the investor's money is invested in interest-bearing deposits, which grow to
repay his capital. The remainder is invested in futures and options to give
fundholders the equity-kicker.
What makes the F&amp;C fund different is that the process happens quarterly. Say
you have invested Pounds 10,000. If after three months the stock market has
fallen, you will still have Pounds 10,000. If, however, a strong stock
market means the fund grows by 10 per cent, you will have Pounds 11,000.
That will be your base capital for the next three months; gains, once made,
cannot be lost. You can withdraw your money, without charge, at the end of
any quarter. That gives the fund an advantage over similar products which
tie-up your capital for years.
Inevitably, these advantages have their costs. The fund does not pay an
income. But when you sell your holding, any gain is subject to income,
rather than capital gains, tax. Since most people do not use up their annual
CGT allowance (now Pounds 5,800), this puts the fund in a worse tax position
than a unit or investment trust.
Furthermore, the fund does not give the investor the full benefit of equity
investment. Much depends on the cost of the options which the fund buys. If
the market has been turbulent, the options will be expensive, limiting the
fund's ability to match the index.
Over three months, F&amp;C reckons that, when the market rises, the fund will
achieve a return equal to about 60 per cent of the increase in the FT-SE 100
index. But the investor will 'catch up' in quarters when the market falls
and the fund's value remains stable.
On that basis, the fund would have earned an average 13.7 per cent gross a
year between 1980 and 1992, compared with a gross return of 11.1 per cent
from a building society over the same period.
There are two caveats about safety. F&amp;C is not guaranteeing the return of
capital - it is possible that the deposit element of the fund might invest
in a bank which goes bust. The fund will strive to avoid this by investing
only in banks rated AA and above.
The second caveat is that this is an offshore fund, based in Jersey and
unrecognised by the Securities and Investments Board. As such, it can be
sold only by professional advisers.
The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. There is an initial charge of 5 per
cent and an annual management charge of 0.9 per cent.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Cash in on Uncle Sam - How to make the
most of a weak dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FANCY A three-bedroom Florida home with a view of the ocean for Pounds
67,000? With the pound worth almost two dollars at the moment, any Briton
who has visited the US for a holiday will have discovered how cheap most
things are - a decent double room in a motel can be had for Pounds 17 a
night, for example.
It seems unlikely that this can last for ever. In 1985, the pound and the
dollar were at virtual parity. And while the pound is tied to the D-mark,
its rate against the dollar is free to fluctuate. According to a survey by
Godwins Cityscope, 88 per cent of investment managers think that sterling
will have a lower value vis-a-vis the US dollar in 12 months.
So, are there ways for UK investors to benefit from the current cheapness of
the dollar, aside from taking the kids to Disneyland?
The first thing to realise is that investing in another currency inevitably
involves a gamble. There is no guarantee that the dollar will not decline
even further. When the time comes to convert your investment back into
sterling, it could fall in value.
A second important factor is that US interest rates are much lower than
those in the UK - indeed, this is one factor behind the dollar's decline.
Dollar bonds pay about 2 percentage points less than gilts and dollar
deposits pay 6 to 7 percentage points less than a building society account.
So buying dollar assets means sacrificing income in the short term in
pursuit of - far from certain - capital gain.
If they are prepared to take that chance, there are ways in which investors
can try to take advantage of a potential rise in the US dollar.
Currency funds. These are dollar deposit accounts and are normally based
offshore. Interest can be paid gross and 'rolled up' so that tax is
postponed until income is brought back into the UK. Most have no initial
charge, so represent quite a low cost way of backing a dollar rise.
But US interest rates are currently extremely low, as the Federal Reserve
attempts to stimulate the American economy. In consequence, the return on
currency funds is pretty meagre - the Fidelity US dollar fund, based in
Bermuda, yields just 2.4 per cent.
Bond funds. A higher return can be achieved by investing in US bonds. Funds
which do so tend to invest in bonds issued by the US government, or other
creditworthy institutions.
However, the extra return reflects an extra layer of risk. The US dollar
might move in the right direction, but a fall in bond prices could cancel
out the benefit for the international investor. Thirty year US treasury
bonds now yield 7.3 per cent, the lowest level for five-and-a-half years.
Five year bonds yield just 5.4 per cent. There is a real chance that yields
might rise (and bond prices fall) from this level if, say, the markets
became convinced that President Bush was not going to be re-elected.
Indeed, Kevin Colglazier, dollar bond fund manager at Guinness Flight in
London, says that one key factor which might lead to a dollar rebound - an
economic recovery - would also be likely to cause bond prices to fall.
Given the current low yield levels, US bond funds do not pay a great return
by UK standards. Guinness Flight's conventional dollar bond fund, for
example, yields 5.73 per cent. It also has a high yield fund, which invests
in riskier securities such as Latin American corporate debt and yields 8.03
per cent. The funds have a front end charge of 5 per cent and an annual
charge of 0.75 per cent.
Managed funds. One can gain exposure to the US dollar, without making a
whole-hearted commitment to US securities. So-called dollar managed funds
are denominated in dollars, but hold assets in many different classes of
currency. They still do not offer particularly attractive yields; the Old
Court fund, for example, based in Guernsey and run by Rothschild Asset
Management, currently yields just 2.28 per cent.
Equity funds. There are 126 unit and four investment trusts which offer
investors the chance of exposure to the US equity market. The problem is
that investing in another country's equity market is normally a much greater
bet on shares than it is on the currency.
Wall Street has survived the recession rather better than many other
markets, thanks to the low interest rates. But the consequence is that many
people think the market could be due to fall - according to Datastream, the
price-earnings ratio is over 20 and the dividend yield is below 3 per cent,
low by historical standards.
For those who do want to back the prospects for US equities, the best 10
year unit trust performance in the sector was produced by Fidelity American;
the best five year record was by Foreign &amp; Colonial's US Smaller Companies.
Property. For the wealthy, this area offers the interesting opportunity of
combining investment and pleasure; many people own villas in Spain or
Tuscany, so why not a holiday home in New England?
According to Dr Sol Rabin, of TCW Realty in Los Angeles, there are three
reasons why US property might represent a historic buying opportunity: the
weak dollar, recent falls in US property prices and low interest rates.
The US real estate market is highly regionalised and individual areas have
their boom and bust periods. New England in particular has seen some
calamitous falls; California - which previously had held up well - is now
suffering from recession.
So, as with shares and bonds, there is the risk that any gain you make on
currency movements will be cancelled out by property prices. Nevertheless,
if you were thinking of buying an overseas holiday home in any case, this
could be the time to consider the US.
There are obvious dangers in buying a property on another continent. Joseph
O'Connor, president and chief executive of Copley Real Estate Advisors,
advises potential homeowners to 'never buy anything without seeing it.' If
you are buying from a corporation, O'Connor says you can check its
reputation with a local better business bureau, which most communities
possess. As a further safety measure, he favours using a local well-known
realtor (the American term for estate agent).
Prices vary enormously from region to region. The three-bedroomed Florida
home for Pounds 67,000 (Dollars 130,000) was mentioned by Alice Petty, of
Host Realty, in Melbourne Beach on the Atlantic coast. An average family
home (three bedrooms, two bathrooms) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts costs around
Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 77,000), according to the Massachusetts Association
of Realtors. If you want a beachfront condominium in California, prices
start from around Dollars 250,000 (Pounds 129,000), according to TCW
Realty's Rabin.
There are additional costs; the cost of air travel to the US is very
variable, depending on competition in the market and the time of year. The
US equivalent of the council tax - local property taxes - tend to cost 1 to
2 per cent per annum of property values, according to Copley's O'Connor.
Some states also impose transaction taxes on house deals. And when you come
to sell, you will find that the realtor's commission is about 5 to 7 per
cent, much higher than a UK estate agents fees.
However, if you are prepared to limit your visits to the spring and autumn,
you may be able to cover a significant part of your running costs by renting
out your home in the summer season. And a home in Florida does sound more
glamorous than a semi in Surbiton . . .

FT  22 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Bank auction offers chance to buy
gilts - Preview of sale of long-dated government bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England is to auction Pounds 2.5bn of long-dated UK government
bonds on Wednesday. The issue, due for repayment in 2017, will pay an
interest rate of 8 3/4 per cent.
Private investors interested in a long-dated issue with a reasonable coupon
must make sure their applications are in by 10am on Wednesday.
Since the government's return last year to borrowing in the gilt-edged
market, the Bank has issued stock using such methods as taps and auctions.
Although the Bank does not have a set calendar for auctions, it tends to
hold them every two months or so.
The auctions are dominated by institutions and dealers, which usually buy
about 99 per cent of the stock. Private investors must complete an
application form.*
There are two ways of taking part - either with a competitive or a
non-competitive bid. Competitive bids are for investors, such as the
institutional buyers, who want Pounds 500,000 or more of stock.
Private investors who want to buy between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 500,000
submit non-competitive bids. The amount they pay is determined by the
outcome of the competitive bidding and is the average allotment price
achieved.
If you want to buy between Pounds 1,000-Pounds 10,000, you must apply to buy
a multiple of Pounds 1,000. If you want between Pounds 10,000-Pounds 50,000,
apply for a multiple of Pounds 5,000. And if you want between Pounds
50,000-Pounds 500,000, your application must be for a multiple of Pounds
25,000.
The gilt issue being auctioned is partly-paid, which means you put up only a
certain amount at the time of the auction. In this case, you pay Pounds 40
for every Pounds 100 of stock for which you have applied. At previous
auctions, investors submitting non-competitive bids have received all they
wanted.
After the auction, the Bank sends out letters of allotment, plus a
registration form with details of the remaining amount to be paid on
September 23.
The stock being sold on Wednesday was created earlier this year to meet
demand from insurance companies for a 'super-long' gilt. You should
remember, though, that you can buy the same issue fully-paid in the gilt
market as Pounds 2.5bn was issued.
The auction stock is trading in the 'grey' (pre-issue) market and is about
1/16 of a point cheaper (on a fully paid-up basis) than the existing stock.
So, in terms of the stock price, you might not make a big saving by buying
at auction.
You could, however save on brokers' commission which you normally pay when
you buy gilts in the secondary market (although you can reduce the cost by
buying at the post office). If you buy a new issue at auction, there is no
commission.
*Application forms were printed in the Financial Times and the Daily
Telegraph on Wednesday. Additional forms are available from the Bank of
England, Registrar's Department, Southgate House, Southgate Street,
Gloucester GL1 1UW, tel. 0452-398-047 or 398-048; the Central Gilts Office,
Bank of England, 1 Bank Buildings, Princes Street, London EC2R 8EU; or the
bank's branches or agencies in Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds,
Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Southampton.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets: BICC begins to bounce back - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN BICC's share price hit a low of 239p on August 11, a dividend cut
seemed on the horizon and there was some alarm about possible property
write-downs.
Not surprisingly, when the cables and construction group announced its
interim results this week, explanation of the property portfolio came high
on the agenda, closely followed by mention of 'the best cash performance for
five years'.
The share price, which had already returned to 262p, gained another 10p by
yesterday. The case for crediting the group with recovery potential,
alongside its high yield, was at least being mentioned even if trepidation
about the economy dictated hold rather than buy.
But how is it that a group that owns one of the world's three largest cables
businesses and a premier name in contracting, in Balfour Beatty, has seen
its share price halved in three years? Having helped to restore BICC's image
from sleeping giant to world-class cables company in the late 1980s, Robin
Biggam, now the chairman, faces another uphill struggle.
BICC's pre-tax profit peaked in 1989 at Pounds 201m on turnover of Pounds
3.79bn. Although it went on to achieve a record interim result of Pounds
100m in 1990 - compared with the Pounds 58m announced this week - doubts had
already crept in.
The group had spent heavily not only to expand its cables business on the
continent and in the US, but also on property development and house
building, leading to a build-up of on- and off-balance-sheet debt.
By June 1990, the chance to start buying into Spain's biggest cables maker
led to an issue of Pounds 177m of convertible capital bonds. As the Spanish
acquisition (complete with Pounds 100m debt) was to be phased in over two
years, the fund-raising looked premature and sparked off much gnashing of
teeth over BICC's gearing and cash flow.
The balance sheet was put into shape this year with post-election
opportunism, via a Pounds 154m rights issue at 285p a share.
Part of the justification for the issue was the acquisition of cables
companies in the US and the former East Germany. But put alongside a stated
intention to maintain the 19.25p dividend, it was clear that something would
have had to give without the injection from shareholders.
What has emerged is a group freshly determined to focus on its core
businesses of energy and communications cables and civil and power
contracting. What holds it back, apart from recession, is the backlog of
property development and houses.
Balfour Beatty, which accounted for nearly half the group's Pounds 1.77bn
interim turnover and a fifth of the Pounds 75m operating profit, is
undergoing a shake-up under the new leadership of Sir Robert Davidson,
chairman, and Peter Mason, chief executive. Job losses include half of the
head office staff.
In cables, the pace of acquisition is being matched by rationalisation. In
the last five years, turnover from the European business has doubled, but
the headcount has hardly changed. Biggam pointed out that the latest US
acquisition would provide a further opportunity to streamline the north
American operation.
Reduced interest costs, profit improvements in north America, Spain and
Australasia, plus a seasonal boost from Balfour Beatty, have been included
in forecasts of around Pounds 130m pre-tax for the full year. About 22p of
earnings would give a prospective p/e of less than 13, a small discount to
the market, while the 9 per cent yield is roughly 75 per cent above the
average.
The sting in the tail of last year's results was a Pounds 42m exceptional
charge for property write-downs and losses on the Channel Tunnel contract.
Will the sting be repeated? The answer is yes, probably, but to a smaller
extent. This time concern focuses on Spitalfields, a long-term joint venture
valued at Pounds 65m in the portfolio.
So long as the charges do not represent a cash drain, the renewed faith in
dividend maintenance is unlikely to be shaken. As for hopes of earnings
recovery, the impression is one of a long haul. This was the case after the
last recession when it took until 1986 to regain the 1981 level of just over
Pounds 100m pre-tax. However, with two quality businesses and yield support,
the arguments look strong for the long-term investor.

THOSE who bought shares in the investment trust launches of the past year or
two could be forgiven for feeling a trifle sick. There are few profits to be
had.
On Friday morning, package units in M&amp;G Recovery, offered at 100p, were down
to 93p; those in M&amp;G Income were 89p. Those who invested in Fidelity
European Values were worse off by around 8 per cent even after adding back
the value of the warrants. And if you bought a capital share in the
Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust at launch, your 25p investment has turned
into 11p.
Of course, these trusts are designed to be long-term investments. That means
they need to be held for at least five years, and probably 10, before their
real advantages come through.
Adding to the problems of the small investor, however, the success or
failure of these trusts is not merely a matter of whether the stock market
performs well. Even if the trust's portfolio rises in value, an investor in
a new issue can lose money because of the discount factor.
It is relatively easy to value an investment trust. You can simply take the
market value of all the shares in its portfolio, deduct the debts, and
divide by the number of shares in issue. The result is the net asset value
(nav) per share.
However, investment trust shares very rarely trade at the nav price.
Normally, they trade below that price - at a discount, as the jargon has it.
The discount is a function of the demand for the shares. If few investors
want to buy the shares (perhaps because the manager's record is poor, or
because the trust's portfolio is expected to fall in value), the discount
will be wide.
It is possible for a trust's shares to trade at a premium. Historically,
this has tended to occur with geographical specialist trusts. A Korea fund,
for example, might be the only way most investors can gain exposure to the
Korean economy; so, if prospects for that area are perceived to be good,
investors will bid the share price above the asset value.
More recently, however, premiums have tended to be associated with split
capital investment trusts. By dividing up the share capital in ways that
offer tax advantages to different sets of investors (zeroes, income shares
etc), enough demand was created to enable the trust as a whole to trade at a
premium.
There is some debate in the industry whether these premiums are 'fool's
gold.' A split capital trust still owns the same sorts of shares as a normal
trust; so, why should someone pay a premium for assets he can buy at a
discount elsewhere?
There is also a more general worry, though. The rediscovered enthusiasm of
private investors for investment trust shares has, by creating extra demand,
narrowed the sector's discount. From more than 23 per cent in 1988, the
discount reduced to just over 11 per cent in 1991.
If the discount widens again, the new shareholder recruits to the sector may
see their savings battered. They might feel as disillusioned as all those
investors who piled into unit trusts at the top of the bull market in 1987.
To date, the news has been relatively encouraging. Although stock markets
have been weak - normally a factor which widens discounts substantially -
the sector discount is only 14 per cent. According to Robbie Robertson of
County NatWest, the sector seems to bounce back when the 15 per cent
discount level is reached.
Perhaps private investors have been convinced of the merits of savings
schemes. Every time prices fall, the monthly payment buys more shares.
Indeed, if savings schemes can be kept as a stable source of demand for
shares, then historical discount levels of 25 per cent might never recur. A
virtuous circle can be created.
* * * A final thought. Most experts seem to think that bonds will be highly
attractive to private investors in the low-inflation, low-growth 1990s. That
might well be true for retired investors who depend on their savings for
income. But the story could be different for those who are saving for the
longer term.
Each investor is entitled to an annual capital gains tax allowance - which
is Pounds 5,800 in the 1992-93 financial year. In other words, your first
Pounds 5,800 of gain is tax-free.
Not only that, but the Revenue also allows investors to index their gains to
avoid the effect of inflation. This is a very useful tax break which makes
it quite hard to pay CGT - just 165,000 people paid it in 1991.
Take a top-rate taxpayer with savings of Pounds 50,000. If the funds were
placed on deposit, he might earn Pounds 5,000 in gross interest this year -
but that would translate to just Pounds 3,000 after tax. If he made Pounds
5,000 of capital gains, the return would be tax-free.
Of course, a building society investor can be reasonably certain of his
income, whereas investing for capital gains is a risky business.
Nevertheless, equities have traditionally outperformed bonds over the long
term.
And even if gross bond returns matched those for equities in the 1990s,
equities would still make the average investor better off in net terms. So,
despite the recent bad news, a broadly-spread investment trust still looks a
good long-term savings vehicle for the small investor.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets: When a bit of financial advice can be a royal pain
 -London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELIEVE ME, being a financial adviser isn't all it's cracked up to be -
mine's a whisky, thanks. I mean, do you ever stop to think what I have to go
through? Take that last trip of mine. OK, you know about fighting off
photographers, goes with the Fimbra membership, right? But can you imagine
having to take a copy of the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin with you?
There I am, trying to keep everyone cheerful, dripping sun-tan oil over a
chapter called 'Negative equity in the housing market'. No joking, if
Stephen King ever falls on hard times, he can take a job in the economics
department of the Bank.
Of course, he's what they call a master of suspense, and Mervyn King - who I
gather is the horror-meister in Threadneedle Street these days - is a bit
lacking in that department. Still, the boy's got the right surname, and he's
learning.
He starts slow, all right ('This situation has left many households with a
home worth less than the value of their mortgage, a phenomenon that has been
termed 'negative equity''), but after a bit you're biting your fingernails
and jumping if a car backfires.
Take this little gem: 'Such estimates suggest that by the second quarter of
this year around 876,000 households faced a situation in which the value of
their home had fallen below the value of their mortgage. For three of the
most severely affected regions - the south east, Greater London and East
Anglia - around two-thirds of all first-time buyers who have entered the
market since 1988 are now likely to have some negative equity.'
OK, it takes a while to get into the swing of the prose style but, believe
me, when I read it out there wasn't a dry eye or pink knuckle around the
pool. Remember, the client is a recently separated upper-middle-class spouse
with a couple of kids and a house in the home counties; and there are a pair
of minders along for the ride, with houses in Essex and mortgages up the
gazoo. I mean, this is strictly bad news time.
Mind you, some people take a while to get the message. 'But I haven't got a
mortgage,' says the client. Read on, sweetheart, say I. 'Since the beginning
of 1988, over 180,000 properties have been taken into possession by lenders
. . .' Just think what that'll do to property values in the Thames Valley.
And if you're contemplating going back to work, now you're on your own, I
point out, think of the damage to the economy: '305,000 borrowers were more
than six months in arrears at the end of June, with 115,000 more than 12
months behind.'
As Mervyn or his blurb-writer says: 'Spending on major purchases has been
particularly weak; consumer confidence has fallen back and households are
repaying consumer borrowing.' I couldn't have put it better myself.
Still, there was some good news round the sun-beds. I mean, the stock market
closed the week up a bit, after rising for four days out of the last six.
The FT-SE index closed at 2,365.7, up 8.9 points on the week. That's a
pretty strong performance, really, considering what the rest of the news
crackling over the World Service was like. The pound was plastered against
the bottom of the ERM, and my dollar travellers' cheques didn't go very far
in the local bar. The Bundesbank made some heavy duty noises about inflation
and the need to keep interest rates up. The second-quarter gdp figures
showed a minuscule increase for the first time in two years, but retail
sales in June turned down. Some guy at the Central Statistical Office
offered a seasonally adjusted joke: 'A recession is when you lose your job;
a depression is when I lose mine.' (Thanks a bunch; that probably sounds
funnier if you work in the civil service.)
And there was another big-company dividend cut - from Sedgwick, the
insurance broker. Just when you think company chairmen have decided they're
too scared of Paddy Lineker at M&amp;G to cut the dividends, another brave soul
plunges in. Corroon and Black, another big broker which seemed to be
suffering just as much from the insurance industry's woes managed to keep
its dividend intact.
But Sedgwick's chairman David Rowland made a few gnomic comments ('Dividend
cuts come about for other reasons than 'disasters in business''), dropped
the interim dividend from 4p to 3p, and went off to run Lloyd's. I guess
he'll feel right at home, since they've taken his approach even further by
introducing negative dividends.
Don't company chairmen realise what all this dividend cutting does when
you're trying to put together a portfolio of income shares for someone who
is about to come into a lump sum? It's not as if the capital-gains side of
things is easy, either. Look at this chart I scratched out on the back of a
corn-flakes packet. It shows the sectors that did worst in the slide from
the end of the post-election blip in May and the ones have done best since
things started looking up a week ago.
There's a strong interest-rate theme in both periods, I'd say, which means
that the motor behind the recent recovery is probably a feeling that the
moment when German rates start to ease isn't too far away. That makes the
equity pickup very vulnerable to more bad interest-rate news from Germany -
or any sign that Norman Lamont will have to push up UK rates to stop the
pound falling out of the bottom of the ERM.
Well, that's what I told the client, anyway. She didn't seem to be paying
attention - said there was some sort of curious reflection over in the
bougainvillea bushes. Ignore it, I said. Who'll care about a few summer
snaps, anyway?

FT  22 AUG 92 / Markets: Bush says sorry but stocks still slide - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS PUBLIC apologies go, it was a big one. President Bush, in the speech Wall
Street had been nervously awaiting all week, said he was sorry for breaking
his pledge and raising taxes in 1990.
He admitted the tax increase was a mistake, he promised he would not do it
again, and to make it up to everyone, he said he would cut taxes in his
second term, but only if Congress would accept a compensatory cut in
government spending.
The President's words drew an ecstatic response from the Republican mob in
Houston, but on Wall Street the reaction was more muted - polite applause
but nothing more. As Newton Zinder, technical market analyst at Shearson
Lehman, put it: 'Nice speech, now get re-elected."
The main emotion yesterday morning was relief that the President had not
made any rash promises on taxes. Demand for Treasury bonds had been
restrained for a week before the speech by concern that Bush would announce
a big tax cutting package - a move that investors feared could revive
inflationary pressures in the economy, as well as hamper the long-term
chances of reducing the budget deficit.
Yesterday's half-point rise in bond prices, therefore, was more a
representation of the market reclaiming the ground it had lost over the
previous week than a positive response to the speech itself.
The stock markets, meanwhile, were far from impressed. The Dow got a quick
15-point lift in the first few minutes, but it could not hold on to its
opening lead, and by early afternoon it was registering a loss of 30 points
under pressure from the falling dollar.
The early consensus among equity analysts and economists was that while the
President's speech may have looked and sounded good on television, it was
short on economic specifics.
There was no explanation of how he would manage to cut taxes and spending,
create jobs and reduce the deficit all at the same time. The markets also
know full well that unless there is a dramatic turnaround in voting
patterns, Congress is unlikely to be controlled by the Republicans in 1993.
The chances that Bush will win approval for his plans if he wins a second
term are slim.
If the reaction from stock and bond markets was less than inspiring, the
response from the foreign exchange markets to the speech was the equivalent
of a big raspberry. It must have been embarrassing for the White House to
see the world's central banks stampeding into the currency markets to save
the plummeting dollar the day after a supposedly triumphant appearance
before the nation by the President.
Luckily for Bush, the US electorate pays no attention to the dollar. The
stock markets, unfortunately, cannot afford to be so easy-going about the
currency situation. The dollar's sustained weakness may help exporters
(sales of US goods overseas set a record in June), but it leaves the Federal
Reserve with less and less room to engineer another reduction in interest
rates.
If the latest economic statistics are anything to go by, the economic could
do with some fresh stimulus. The report on July's housing starts was
released this week showing a 2.8 per cent decline in the number of new homes
being built. The housing starts data are regarded as an important leading
indicator of economic activity, and to see the numbers in decline at a time
when mortgage rates are at historically low levels does not bode well for
the immediate economic outlook.
The housing numbers made it a difficult week for housebuilding stocks. Three
of the biggest, Clayton Homes, Centex and Standard Pacific all posted
notable losses on the data, while another, Kaufman &amp; Broad, underlined the
gloomy short-term future for the sector by warning that its third quarter
profits would be some 20 per cent to 30 per cent below the a year ago.
Bank stocks also had a tough week. Almost all the important money-centre
stocks took a big fall on Wednesday on a variety of rumours: that the US
fund group Fidelity was a big seller of Citicorp stock; that the recent debt
accord between Brazil and international banks was in jeopardy: that
weakening Japanese banks would spell big trouble for US institutions: and
that Citicorp was planning a new stock issue.
None of the rumours turned out to be true, but the sharp sell-off on
Wednesday showed how vulnerable the bank sector remains despite a good
second quarter and talk of much improved balance sheets.

FT  22 AUG 92 / Houston, awakening of the president: The Republican
convention sees a revitalised George Bush train his sights on two elusive
quarries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN George Bush kept defensively insisting that he would hold his fire
until Houston, the assumption was that his target was Bill Clinton, not
Saddam Hussein. Now that he has both the Democratic presidential candidate
and the president of Iraq in his sights, one metaphorically, the other
looking at the wrong end of a barrel, he seems a happier man.
There was a bounce, a snap, to the president of the United States this week
not seen all year. Perhaps it was the coming home to Houston, where he spent
his post-university formative years in the oil 'bidness' and where he now
maintains a room in a bankrupt hotel and a rather small undeveloped lot to
prove his Texan residence.
Perhaps it was the sufficiently adulatory welcome he ultimately received in
the Astrodome from the Republican party convention, which had spent most of
the early part of a fractious week with conservatives and moderates biting
each other's ankles.
But neither explanation really suffices. Nor was there more than tentative
evidence in the ubiquitous public opinion polls, which now dissect and
discern, though with uncertain accuracy, every thought that may or may not
have crossed the mind of the average American citizen, to put the president
in a better frame of mind. Acknowledging their exceptional volatility this
year and allowing that Bush will get his 'bounce' from the convention, they
are still not predicting that he will beat Bill Clinton on November 3.
No, the answer can only lie in something almost chemical. It seemed as if
George Herbert Walker Bush had suddenly woken up from a long sleep and come
to a conclusion about what he had to do to win, at home and abroad. No more,
to quote Martin Luther King, 'the paralysis of analysis,' no more moaning
about political gridlock in Washington, no more complaints that the US was a
country, in his words, 'with the will but not the wallet.'
What he promised this week was war in a good cause, with few, if any, holds
barred. In his acceptance speech he drew his line in the sand with Clinton
and the Democrats in Congress, with the sort of one-liners that only a great
speechwriter - in this case Ray Price - of Nixon vintage can supply.
Opinions about the US president are many but fall into two broad parts. The
indictment is that he is an empty shell, with no agenda for the country
other than his own re-election, a captive of the ways of Washington, a
patrician who has always needed patronage and not cared too much about its
source, a leader without principle, lost unless stiffened from behind the
arras, be it by Margaret Thatcher after Iraq invaded Kuwait or by his old
friend James Baker, already available though he does not formally move back
from the State Department to the White House until tomorrow.
The defence is that Bush is a good man on the important things, a devoted
and experienced public servant whose resolve has been tested in the Second
World War and in the Gulf, a congenital optimist who is kind and loyal to
others, sometimes to a fault. Above all, as the Republican party tried to
get its act together this week after the right wing had had its dominant say
in shaping the party platform, he has the great virtue of not being a
Democrat and not being Bill Clinton.
There is truth in both counts. This itself made him intrinsically the most
interesting person on display in Houston this week, for which title he was
not without competition. That league does not include the delegates
themselves, the usual crowd of button-festooned, funny-hatted faithful often
more intent on the party circuit, profoundly suspicious of, and sometimes
impolite to, anyone wearing a press badge, and overwhelmingly white,
straight and Christian.
But the convention was treated to former president Ronald Reagan at his more
visionary; to Barbara Bush at her most matriarchal; to Pat Buchanan at his
most ferociously ideological; to vice-president Dan Quayle at his most
earnestly combative; to Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, at his most
open-minded; to Phil Gramm, the Texas senator, at his most partisan; to
Governor Bill Weld of Massachussetts at his more provocative, and, above
all, to James Baker, the president's past and hopefully future saviour, at
his most discreetly invisible. And if those who spoke failed to engage, it
was perfectly all right to invoke the Almighty.
Collectively, they put together a convention that started badly, moved
through a tedious middle passage and finished on a reasonable note of hope,
not so much because they had resolved their own manifold internal
differences but because they thought they had found a leader again and had
definitely located the enemy, and he was not within their own ranks.
Bill Clinton, that enemy, has long known he was in for rough treatment at
Republican hands in the election proper and must now understand how rough
that is going to be. The high and low roads will be travelled with abandon.
Much will be heard, legitimately, about his record in Arkansas ('the failed
governor of a small state' was this week's mantra); his lack of formal
foreign policy experience (a youthful internship on the Senate foreign
relations committee, according to one speaker); the costly impracticability
of his economic proposals; his identification with the demon Democrats in
Congress (his health care plans are not his own, the charge goes, but the
work of that 'sultan of the status quo,' George Mitchell, the Senate
majority leader).
But it will be equally commonplace for presidential surrogates to say what
they like about him and his wife, be disowned one minute by the president
and perhaps apologise for overstepping the mark, and then go back to saying
what they like about him. Where one is reined in, another will burst loose.
The litany will run to innuendoes about Bill Clinton's marriage, his alleged
draft dodging and his wife's perceived radical feminism. This week's trial
assaults were purveyed by Catalina Villalpando, the US treasurer, and Robert
Mosbacher, former commerce secretary and party big-wig. Both naturally
apologised, on paper, and seemed not to mind one bit. Their job was done.
And if the media objects to the low road, as it showed signs of doing this
week when the attorney general of California once again raised the
supposedly exorcised spectre of Willie Horton, the criminal treated
leniently by Michael Dukakis, it will be dismissed for its liberal bias.
Barbara Bush herself, trying so hard to appear above the partisan fray while
being plunged into the thick of it with her exposition to the convention of
traditional family values, kept saying in countless interviews that what was
being done to Clinton was only on a par with what the Democrats in New York
had inflicted on her husband. Of course she disapproved of personal attacks,
but, she asked one persistent questioner, 'where were you last month?'
Whether this all works really does come down to the two men on the top of
their tickets, Bill Clinton and George Bush, and, to an infinitely lesser
extent at the margins, to their running mates, Al Gore and Dan Quayle. Since
the prehensile grip of the two parties on the political process has
weakened, presidential elections have become intensely personal.
Money and campaign organisation are factors, but federal funding is a
relative equaliser and, with James Baker back on board, the advantage the
impressive Clinton team once had has probably been neutralised.
Platforms have their day in the sun, but are often discarded once
conventions are over. Rich Bond, the Republican party chief, was quick to
argue that the controversial plank on abortion - demanding that it be
constitutionally banned in all cases, including those where pregnancy is the
result of rape and incest - was 'only 1/150th part' of what the party agreed
to. In this case, he must hope the electorate sees it that way and does not
also pay too much attention to the exclusionary right-wing dogma of much
else in the document.
This brings ultimate consideration back to George Bush, defender of the
faith and the White House, and the trickiest man of the two to judge. That
he likes a fight cannot be doubted. David Broder, the veteran Washington
Post journalist, described him this week as 'a competitor who psyches
himself to a high level of performance for critical tests.'
Bush would concur. He has now taken to likening himself to Harry Truman, the
much derided little man who gets off the floor and bashes Congress and his
opposition into submission. That Truman was a Democrat is irrelevant. But
this posture is 'all window dressing,' Broder went on. 'On the journey from
New Orleans (site of the 1988 convention) to Houston, Americans have learned
two important things about this president: he has no real regard for his own
campaign rhetoric; and while he may hire good speechwriters for occasions
like this week, he has virtually no capacity or interest in regularly using
the forum of the presidency to shape and inform the public debate.'
Tough words, and from a writer who, unlike some counterparts on the right
also disaffected from the president, does not normally shoot from an
ideological hip. Another generally dispassionate dean of the trade, Johnny
Apple of The New York Times, describes Bush as 'a political version of the
19th century Yankee merchant, always genteel and mannerly in private, but
sometimes cunning and ruthless in business.'
Even Bush has conceded that domestic business bores him, not entirely
surprising after a public career devoted, by turn, to China, the United
Nations, the Central Intelligence Agency, and, as vice-president and
president, to great affairs outside the US. A brief stint as a congressman
from Texas and as Republican party national chairman are little more than
footnotes in the resume.
The one counter-argument this week was, essentially, that a president is
principally supposed to preside over the events of the world and, in this
respect, George Bush is supremely qualified. Circumstances may dictate
otherwise, but they must be exceptional, on a par with the Depression
confronting FDR, or the need for social justice addressed by Kennedy and
Johnson, or, as conservatives would maintain, the necessary burst for
individual freedom and less government pursued in Reagan's first term.
If Bush is a late convert to this domestic cause, which will determine the
outcome of the election, then, his supporters argue, it is better to be late
than never. It matters less that he has switched over the years with the
prevailing winds - on taxation, on abortion, and any number of other issues
 -than that he has seen the light at the right time. If ideology sits
lightly on a self-confessedly unreflective man, happier on the golf course
than with a book, then that may be seen as a tribute to his inner sense of
security.
After all, nobody ever accused Truman or Eisenhower or Reagan of being
intellectuals, but their presidencies were considered successful. Nixon,
Johnson and Carter had brains to spare, as may Clinton, but were ultimately
undone by the inner demons and conflicts that so often visit the best, the
brightest and the worst. All Bush has to do is to persuade the country that
he can change his spots and let the heart and mind follow.
But that alone will not be enough. He must also in the process destroy Bill
Clinton, by fair means or foul. That scent of the target, that setting of
the sights on the rifle, albeit directed mostly by the unseen hand of James
Baker, explains why George Bush seemed happy this week. But the quarry looks
tough and elusive, and the economic and societal terrain on which the chase
will take place is not as friendly as it was four years ago. It is possible,
too, that the public appetite for dirty pool has been finally sated. Saddam
Hussein, no easy mark, could be tougher, though not impossible, to bring
down.

FT  22 AUG 92 / The Long View: Cold comfort at below zero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF PRICES can go down there is hope for the present economic strategy. If
not, the only solution is inflation.
Flexibility downwards is the crucial key to making participation in the
exchange rate mechanism work. Already, in the 22 months since the government
hitched sterling to a central rate of DM2.95 (although it has rarely
attained that level in practice), there have been some unheard-of
adjustments. London house prices, for instance, have dropped by around 13
per cent, according to the Halifax Building Society: the conventional wisdom
was that house prices could never fall. As for commercial property, central
London office values have crashed by some 38 per cent.
The big problem, however, was always going to be the labour market, and that
remains stubbornly resistant. Since ERM entry, average earnings have risen
by 15 per cent while the British economy has shrunk by some 3 per cent in
real terms. That 18-point gap is vastly in excess of any productivity gains
and is one measure of the inflationary strains still tearing the economy
apart (involving, for instance, a profits squeeze and an excess of domestic
demand over supply).
Unemployment has risen from 1.7m to 2.7m since October 1990. That is bad
enough, but large numbers of people apparently have left the workforce and
do not appear in the numbers.
In other respects, the impact on the economy of entering a fixed exchange
rate regime has, broadly, been predictable. Money market interest rates have
come down from 15 to 10 per cent. Bonds have outperformed equities
substantially even though shares were particularly low at the time because
of the Gulf crisis: the FT-SE 100 index has shown a capital gain of about 15
per cent while long gilts are up about 25 per cent; on a rate of return
basis (including gross income), the outperformance by gilts has averaged
nearly a point a month. Most of the benefit of this appears, however, to
have gone to foreigners, because British investors have remained devoted to
equities, which served them so well in the past.
Inflation, too, has slowed rapidly. During the 12 months leading up to ERM
entry it was more than 10 per cent. In the subsequent 22 months, prices have
risen by only another 7.5 per cent. By the beginning of 1993, if we stay on
course, it looks as though the annual inflation rate will fall below 3 per
cent.
Monetary growth has also collapsed. Over the past 12 months it has run - on
the M4 measure - at a mere 5 per cent, compared with something like 15 per
cent a year during the 1980s. In fact, the money supply has not been growing
as slowly as it is now since the beginning of the 1970s, which is why the
behaviour of financial markets is surprising so many people (I am thinking,
for instance, of analysts who are trying to value the equity market on the
basis of average bond-equity yield ratios during the past 20 years).
During the 1980s, the financial system became accustomed to double-digit
growth rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities, underpinned by
ever-rising asset values. Only when the government realised that asset price
inflation would feed through to retail prices did it spoil the party.
Indeed, property values have proved adjustable downwards in nominal terms, a
unique departure from British post-war experience. But this does not mean
that the financial system can accommodate a price meltdown safely.
In times of growth, property-based lending tends to improve its own
security. The greater the volume of lending, the higher property prices
rise. But, in reverse, the system turns into a vicious circle. When lenders
seize their security and sell it, prices are driven down further. This
undermines the security of other loans. Meanwhile, potential buyers hold off
because they are afraid of suffering capital losses.
If high percentages of the value of property have, conventionally, been lent
by financial institutions, a financial system must be vulnerable to falling
asset prices. This is true in the UK, although the worst of the losses on
residential property have been borne by the insurance companies which sold
mortgage indemnity policies. If there were another downleg to the bear
market in house prices, the building societies and banks would be much more
exposed - which could be why they have become so much more nervous in recent
weeks.
In commercial property, there is another valuable protection for property
owners and their lenders: the upwards-only lease. This does not help
developers or other owners of untenanted property. Nor does it protect the
landlord if the tenant goes bust. But if your tenant is, say, a public
sector body, the lease is as good as a gilt-edged security even if open
market commercial rents should go spiralling down and down in the future.
This arrangement protects institutional owners and, to some extent, the
banks (although most of their lending was probably on developments). But it
also means that most commercial rents cannot fall in the foreseeable future.
This could put established businesses at risk: for them, the vast amount of
cheap modern space is out of reach.
Similarly, in the labour market, pay is in practice decided on an
upwards-only basis. Employers making losses tend to lay off staff or even
shut up shop rather than attempt to recruit at below the going rate. There
are exceptions, in areas of relatively casual employment such as
construction or catering. But, in more rigid sectors, inflation is no longer
fast enough to cover up the brutal need to cut pay in real terms. The
result, again, is a growing waste of resources as supply and demand cannot
be brought together.
There can be no net zero inflation unless prices are free to move down as
well as up. John Major should have thought about this 22 months ago when he
put the UK into the ERM - and he should be thinking even harder now.
