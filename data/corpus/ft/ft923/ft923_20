FT  20 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The art of seduction
 -Money spent on packaging can go a long way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seducing customers into buying your product and building a loyalty from that
initial purchase are key marketing problems.
Few steps are more important in that seduction than getting the packaging
right. Ugly, old-fashioned presentation can ruin a brand or newly launched
product; first impressions are critical.
But packaging designers in particular are fast learning that in a recession
they need to demonstrate the commercial, bottom-line value of their work;
cosmetic skills alone are not enough.
The traditional UK jam and marmalade market has been in steady long-term
decline - down from 109,000 tonnes in 1984 to 89,500 tonnes in 1991. In the
1980s healthier, lower-sugar diets became fashionable, product innovation
seemed limited, preserves manufacturers waged price wars, and own-label
preserves took market share from brands. All that left little room for
lavish promotional spending.
The only growth niche seemed to be in low-sugar preserves, but consumers
were turned off by unconventional tastes and textures.
Chivers Hartley, a division of Premier Brands and a traditional name in
preserves, decided to develop a low-sugar preserve range which also tasted
good. It set about new product development in conjunction with a London
design consultancy, The Design Bridge.
Chivers developed a new cooking process with a much higher fruit content,
emulating the taste and texture of higher-sugar jams and marmalades. But
equally important was the development of a new packaging design.
Chivers set itself the target of taking 5 per cent of the low-sugar market
last year, the first full year of the new range, called Hartleys Extra
Fruit; it took 7 per cent.
According to Mike Whetter, Chivers Hartley's marketing manager, the
packaging design was 'absolutely fundamental. If you get your design right
you are well on the way to success. If you get it wrong, then you'll never
succeed.'
Perfecting the packaging design can also help make or break product
relaunches. In February 1990 Chivers Hartley took a step into what was then
a relatively new market, ready-made convenience desserts, with a range
called Chivers Fruit Cup. The market has grown to a retail value now of some
Pounds 19m annually.
But the dominant green colour of the original packaging meant that retailers
frequently placed the product - fruit in jelly - on shelves next to canned
fruit. Consumers failed to be tempted, and the product reached only 60 per
cent of all retail outlets.
'We found that the graphics of the pack were totally underselling the
product and were not conveying what was inside the pot. The pack itself was
not exciting them to pick it up and try it,' says Whetter.
Chivers Hartley literally went back to the drawing board. Design Bridge
worked out new colours, graphics and packaging, and the Fruit Cup range was
relaunched earlier this year.
Mike Whetter is confident that the range will increase its market share from
the 5 per cent taken on relaunch to 8 per cent by the end of the year. The
total cost of relaunching Fruit Cup, including design work, he puts at
Pounds 120,000.
'New product launches like this are very difficult; marketing money here is
sacred, we have to make every pound work hard for us. We have a total
marketing spend of about Pounds 2m annually; about 3.5 per cent of
turnover,' says Whetter.
Packaging designers are increasingly being consulted at an early stage of
new product development. The Design Bridge was called in by chocolate
manufacturers Terry's of York, which in 1989 decided to produce a premium
'special treat' chocolate bar. Aimed at 25-44 year old women, the new bar
was designed to capture qualities such as 'indulgence', 'richness' and
'uniqueness' in an already crowded market.
The design brief was to develop packaging which would sell the bar as a
luxurious treat; understated, yet appealing to women purchasers looking for
more than a quick chocolate 'fix'.
The new bar, called Moments, exceeded its first year sales targets by 47 per
cent, with retail sales of Pounds 10m in 1991 - an achievement in a market
where more than four out of five new product launches fail.
Good packaging design helps sell more than food and snacks. Wickens Tutt
Southgate, another London design agency, has worked on several accounts to
re-vamp brands in equally competitive markets, such as paint aimed at
do-it-yourself home owners.
The leading UK brand name for specialist paint for metal is Hammerite, made
by Hunting Specialised Products, based in Northumberland. Hammerite has a 77
per cent share of this market, but at the end of the 1980s it became
concerned that its image was too 'professional' for some purchasers -
particularly women - and decided to re-launch its brand, broadening its
appeal without losing existing customer loyalty.
According to Guy Falkenham, European marketing controller of Hunting, money
used to obtain successful design is as important an ingredient of successful
marketing as advertising spend.
'It is very expensive to sustain a television advertising campaign 12 months
of the year; we spend in excess of Pounds 1m on a six week TV campaign,' he
says. 'TV advertising has terrific influences on sales - we have seen 600
per cent increases for the period during and immediately after television
advertising. That's very good, but you can only sustain it for so long.'
So Hunting briefed Wickens Tutt Southgate to create packaging both more
'aesthetically pleasing and informative and with less of a macho image. We
tried to cut through technical jargon and back-of-pack caveats,' says
Falkenham.
Hunting consolidated two brands - Hammerite and Smoothrite - into one single
brand. The designers came up with a branding device, a shield, to symbolise
strength, protection and durability.
In Falkenham's view, good packaging design is vital but only one element in
an overall sales promotion effort. Nevertheless, get it wrong and it can be
costly: 'Your chances of success with a good design are quite limited, the
consumer will only grasp one or two elements of the design of the pack.'
But given the choice between Pounds 1m for six weeks of television
advertising and Pounds 60,000 for design work on a brand launch, it must
make sense to get the drawing board out before hiring the film crew.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Victaulic holds steady in tough trading
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FAVOURABLE cash position at Victaulic offset difficult trading conditions
enabling the pipes and fittings maker to report unchanged pre-tax profits of
Pounds 6.9m for the six months to June 30.
Turnover fell from Pounds 57.4m to Pounds 51.2m, mainly reflecting reduced
demand for pipelines from British Gas which has cut back heavily on capital
expenditure.
This is because of uncertainties regarding the future structure and
ownership of British Gas's network following the referral of these matters
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The uncertainty is likely to continue into next year.
Mr David Stewart, Victaulic's managing director, said that British Gas had
began to cut back on new projects since the beginning of the year.
In the water industry, the group's other main market, some of the water
companies reduced their investment on the repair and maintainance of mains,
affecting sales of Viking Johnson, which is involved in the refurbishment of
mains.
The difficult trading conditions were reflected in trading profit, which
fell from Pounds 6.79m to Pounds 6.46m.
However, net cash of Pounds 10m resulted in interest received of Pounds
461,000 compared with Pounds 57,000 in the comparable period.
Mr Stewart said cost reductions, a decline in the workforce and increased
margins of 12.6 per cent compared with 11.8 per cent had also helped offset
difficult trading conditions.
The interim dividend is increased from 2.35p to 2.5p.
Earnings per share were unchanged on last time's 10.3p.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Growth in pensions side lifts Britannic
Assurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITANNIC Assurance yesterday announced an interim dividend increased from
9.2p to 10.3p and significant growth in premium income for the first six
months of this year.
In line with the rest of the industry, pensions registered the strongest
results, boosted by rising unemployment as people made redundant transferred
their pension funds.
The ordinary branch's with-profits pension business saw a 60 per cent
increase to Pounds 57.8m (Pounds 36m).
New business in unit-linked pensions more than doubled, to Pounds 6.81m
(Pounds 3.29m).
Ordinary branch life assurance premiums were up almost 20 per cent to Pounds
41.8m (Pounds 34.9m), helped by the company's single-premium with-profits
bond.
Elsewhere in the group, industrial branch assurance new business rose from
Pounds 58m to Pounds 60.7m.
General branch premium income improved from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 15.1m and
the underwriting loss was cut from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 2.3m.
Britannic also announced reductions of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent in
the terminal bonuses payable on 10-year and 15-year with-profits products.
Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, attributed this to the sluggish
markets this year, which had forced the company to make slight reductions
compared to the high returns available in the mid-1980s.
He pointed out that Britannic was able to phase reductions in gradually by
announcing terminal bonuses every six months, rather than annually as used
to be the case.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Minority shareholders in a bakery group controlled by Maple Leaf Foods, the
Canadian subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings, have rejected a buy-out proposal.
Maple Leaf owns 66 per cent of Toronto-based Corporate Foods and had
proposed a merger to facilitate expansion into the US baking market.
Corporate Foods minority shareholders were offered 1.15 Maple Leaf shares or
CDollars 19.9 (Pounds 8.80) in cash for each CF share.
The proposal was defeated by a narrow majority of CF's outside shareholders
at a special meeting. Although Maple Leaf improved its original offer by
adding the cash option, the terms were still criticised by several
institutional shareholders.
Since acquiring a 56 per cent stake in Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers,
in 1990, Hillsdown has moved aggressively to rationalise operations and to
position the company for expansion in selected food-processing sectors in
the US.
Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive of Maple Leaf, said that while the merger
would have 'solidified' the company's position in the bakery industry and
simplified future acquisition opportunities, Maple Leaf was 'quite
satisfied' to retain its present interest.
CF has reported record profits for 11 consecutive years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH LIFE reported a 4.3 per cent drop in premium income for the first six
months of 1992, from IPounds 324.9m to IPounds 311m (Pounds 293m), but
declared a maiden interim dividend of 3p.
The company, privatised in July last year, is the largest life and pensions
insurer market in the Irish Republic, as well as that country's biggest fund
manager.
On the basis of a 1:2 interim/final split, the total dividend will be up by
10 per cent on 1991 according to Mr John Hogan, head of research at Riada
stockbrokers in Dublin. 'This is up to the market's best expectations', he
said.
Irish recurring premiums were up 3 per cent to IPounds 135.9m (IPounds
131.9m).
The overall downturn was due to the combination of a 10 per cent fall in
single premium business in the home market to IPounds 61.3m (IPounds 67.9m),
and a sharp fall in the US where new business at its Interstate Assurance
subsidiary fell to IPounds 26.8m (IPounds 43.7m).

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: TT wins Magnetic Materials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST OVER a year after failing to gain control of Magnetic Materials Group
in a hostile bid, TT Group has secured its target - this time by a
recommended route.
The industrial holding group's 3-for-10 share offer, with a partial cash
alternative, had been accepted by the holders of 10.2 per cent of the shares
yesterday; that gave control to TT, which already owned 40 per cent.
Now unconditional, the offer values MMG, a USM-quoted maker of magnetic
components, at Pounds 11.1m - or 60.6p a share - using TT's closing price of
202p. Last year's cash bid was worth Pounds 9.9m, but more TT shares were on
offer in the 4-for-10 paper alternative.
The earlier bid was blocked by a family holding of 44 per cent, headed by Mr
Eduard Michaelis, the group's nonagenarian founder.
Since then the board had changed entirely, the group had been rationalised,
planned property sales had proved difficult to attain and the economic
climate had worsened.
Mr Nick Walker, finance director, said the new board felt that TT could
offer additional resources to MMG. The predator's tenure of a 40 per cent
stake had created uncertainty over future ownership, inhibiting efforts to
develop the business independently.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources rejects claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE Resources, the Louisiana oil and gas producer, yesterday rejected
claims by its former broker, Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, that it had failed
to respond to demands for payment of fees relating to the company's London
flotation.
Mr John O'Brien, chairman, said: 'The existence of a dispute and the current
investigation has been the subject of correspondence between solicitors
instructed by Alliance and Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.'
He said the board was investigating the Dollars 1.5m fees incurred in
Alliance's flotation at 40p in 1991. Gilbert Eliott claims it is owed Pounds
38,346 - in addition to the Pounds 71,635 already paid - and has served a
petition to wind the company up.
Mr O'Brien also confirmed that Manx Petroleum, where he is also managing
director, had agreed to loan Alliance Dollars 200,000 to develop reserves.
That agreement was officially concluded just two weeks ago, he said, and the
money paid to Alliance. The chairman of Manx is Mr Algy Cluff, the natural
resources entrepreneur.
In addition to the loan agreement, Alliance undertook to pay Manx management
fees of Pounds 10,000 a month. These charges were being accumulated and
treated as debt to be repaid with the Dollars 200,000 loan.
Mr O'Brien, who became chairman of the struggling Alliance on May 5, denied
the management fees were high. He said Alliance shareholders would benefit
from his restructuring of the company. He draws no salary from either Manx
or Alliance, he said.
Before he agreed to become chairman, Mr O'Brien set out the loan and
management fee conditions in an agreement dated April 30. This was passed by
the Alliance board on May 4, the day before he joined. The document also
sets out an agreement in principle which states that 'when Alliance is
sufficiently large to make an offer for Manx without prejudicing Alliance's
listing . . . Alliance will make a recommended all-paper offer for Manx.'
This would involve the issue to Manx shareholders of 11 Alliance shares for
every one of Manx's. Mr O'Brien holds 29.9 per cent of Manx.
The agreement was never made public. But Mr O'Brien said yesterday that
Manx, having completed due diligence at Alliance, was no longer interested
in the offer.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: No 'fire sale' of Mountleigh assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS OF Mountleigh, the property company which collapsed in May with
debts of Pounds 590m, were warned at a meeting in London yesterday not to
expect a swift realisation of assets.
Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James, partners of KPMG Peat Marwick, joint
administrative receivers, told creditors that the affairs of the companies
in the group were so closely interlinked that it was impossible to estimate
the probable distribution until the properties and assets were sold.
Since their appointment, the receivers have raised Pounds 57m from property
sales, part of which was used to discharge overseas borrowings on certain
properties.
The receivers said they were determined to avoid 'fire sales' of the
remaining assets. They have drawn up a 'planned and controlled' disposal
programme for the remaining properties. They plan to sell the UK properties
over the medium term, in the belief that a quick disposal would not realise
the properties' maximum value.
In some cases, they said, work will be necessary to enhance the value of
properties.
The receivers said they were not aware of any moves to have liquidators
appointed to any of the companies in the group which are currently in
receivership. 'We do not believe that it would benefit the creditors to
start liquidation proceedings now,' they said.
Mountleigh's debts comprise Pounds 400m owed to a group of banks holding
debentures and floating charges, Pounds 140m due to bond holders and about
Pounds 50m owed to trade and other creditors. The receivers said they held
out little hope of payment for unsecured creditors.
Mountleigh owns 83 investment, development and trading properties throughout
the UK, most notably the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands.
The group also comprises 60 companies incorporated overseas, based in the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, France and the US. It also owns
Galerias Preciados, which has 29 stores throughout Spain.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help BPP to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-TIME contributions from acquisitions in its publishing division helped
BPP Holdings lift pre-tax profits by 35 per cent, from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds
2.97m, in the first half of 1991.
Turnover at the financial training and publishing group rose to Pounds 23.3m
(Pounds 19m). The publishing side increased profits to Pounds 1.09m (Pounds
191,000) on turnover of Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 2.67m).
Mr Richard Price, chairman, said some Pounds 900,000 of the advance was due
to the inclusion of Melrose, which makes video-based training packages, and
Letts Educational, a publisher of home-study books for A-level and GCSE
exams, though there had also been about Pounds 100,000 of launch write-offs
from a series of titles on financial risk management.
Mr Price said the parts of BPP's training and publishing businesses which
led to the taking of exams had remained 'fairly robust,' but activities not
leading to exams had seen a fall-off in discretionary spending.
He also pointed to the 'virtuous circle' whereby 'student-driven' expansion
in courses for the Stock Exchange, banking, and all types of accountancy
resulted in higher sales of the text books needed for those courses.
Profits in professional training grew to Pounds 522,000 (Pounds 492,000) on
turnover up Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 5.4m.
The language training side - of which two thirds is overseas - increased
profits from Pounds 439,000 - depleted by the Gulf war - to Pounds 620,000
on reduced turnover of Pounds 9.03m (Pounds 9.36m).
Linguarama needed 'a real improvement in business confidence' to fulfil its
potential.
'Softer recruitment' last September in the five independent sixth-form
colleges, or crammers, owned by MPW resulted in lower profits of Pounds
500,000 (Pounds 642,000) in the academic education division.
Earnings were 7.2p (6.4p) and the interim dividend 2.7p (2.4p). The group
has no borrowings.

<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the
property and leisure group, won leave yesterday to put a plan to his
creditors to avoid bankruptcy. He was appearing at the High Court responding
to a petition for personal bankruptcy by TSB Bank claiming more than Pounds
9m, writes Maggie Urry.
Mr Michael Coleman, of Harkavys, Mr Walker's solicitor, said 'the court
today ordered that a creditors' meeting be held on September 10 in order
that certain proposals that Mr Walker has been putting forward can be
carefully considered by those creditors and can be voted on as to whether
they are or are not accepted.'
The vote will require a 75 per cent majority by value of the creditors to be
agreed. The proposals, which have been reviewed by accountants Stoy Hayward
over the past fortnight, are believed to include Mr Walker devoting his next
three years' earnings to his creditors.
Mr Coleman said 'Mr Walker sincerely hopes that upon careful consideration
his creditors will vote in favour of acceptance of those proposals and that
he can effectively get back to work.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / Barclays to raise capital in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank is planning to raise Dollars 500m (Pounds 261m) of capital in
the US using a new hybrid financial instrument which other UK banks are
expected to imitate.
The proposed issue, details of which were filed with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission yesterday, gives the bank access to equity-type capital
while allowing tax savings normally associated with plain debt issues.
'The holy grail is to get tier 1 capital in tax-deductible form,' said Mr
Brian Worsley, assistant treasurer at Barclays Bank. 'This structure is as
close as we can get.'
Under new international capital guidelines which come into effect next year,
banks must hold tier 1 and tier 2 capital totalling 8 per cent of their
assets.
Barclays plans to issue undated, subordinated debt, which qualifies as upper
tier 2 capital. This can be converted later, at the option of the bank, into
preferred stock, which counts as tier 1 capital. As long as the issue
remains in debt form, the interest costs are tax-deductible, providing
considerable cost savings over a conventional preferred stock issue.
Mr Worsley said that the debt would only be converted into preferred stock
if Barclays' tier 2 capital was set to exceed its tier 1 capital, which is
not permitted under the guidelines. Barclays current capital-to-assets ratio
stands at 8.9 per cent, of which 5.9 per cent is tier 1 and 3 per cent tier
2.
National Westminster Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland are among the banks
which have also been looking at this type of structure.
The same tax benefits are also likely to be available to other European
banks, some of which are under considerable pressure to build up capital.
A similar structure has already been used in the US by Bankers Trust, but
the conversion into preferred stock in that case was mandatory. Barclays, on
the other hand, can continue to deduct interest payments from tax until it
decides to convert the debt into preferred stock.
The structure has been developed by Barclays, in conjunction with Merrill
Lynch and Goldman Sachs, but Barclays has not yet mandated either US bank to
arrange the US offering. The structure has been approved by the Bank of
England.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Profits fall at Pioneer and Sony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SONY and Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese consumer electronics groups, each
reported a steep decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the first
quarter of the fiscal year, which ended in June.
The poor performance of both companies reflected weak demand throughout the
world economy and the overcapacity in the consumer electronics industry that
has led to a sharp inventory build-up and severe price competition.
The industry is also suffering from a lack of new products with mass appeal.
However, the declines in profits fell short of the worst fears in the
market, where rumours on Monday that Sony had lost money at the operating
level prompted a steep decline in share prices.
Sony's pre-tax earnings were off 52 per cent to Y27.04bn (Pounds 110m),
compared with the same period last year, while sales increased by 4.2 per
cent to Y900bn.
Pioneer saw its pre-tax profits fall by 38.5 per cent to Y9.87bn. Sales grew
by 2.3 per cent to Y144.5bn.
For Sony, which is a bellwether for the whole industry, the good news was
that the company climbed back into profitability following a consolidated
operating loss in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year amounting to
about Y18bn.
Sony's traditional electronic equipment business saw a year-on-year decline
in profits of 46.7 per cent to Y27.3bn, while on the entertainment side of
the business, which includes films and recorded music, profits grew by 26.3
per cent to Y9.45bn.
The entertainment business, where Sony has enjoyed a string of hit records
and films, has recently provided the only significant growth for Sony's
business.
However, analysts, and the company, say it is too early to tell whether
Sony's expensive purchase of Columbia Pictures entertainment two and a half
years ago has proved to be a success.
Neither Pioneer nor Sony revised profits projections for the fiscal year
ending next March; an indication that both companies are confident their
businesses have stabilised, in spite of the deteriorating economic
environment at home.
For both companies, strong sales in the US helped to compensate for weakness
in Japan.

THE longevity of the UK recession was brought home yesterday as BICC, the
cables and construction group, announced a further fall in first-half
profits.
'We do not expect any improvement in most of our markets until 1993 and even
then volume recovery is likely to be modest,' said Mr Robin Biggam,
chairman. No UK recovery was expected for 12 months.
There was encouraging news on the Channel tunnel contract, which last year
necessitated a Pounds 12m provision. BICC is involved in Transmanche Link,
the consortium building the tunnel, and Mr Biggam said no further provisions
should be necessary.
BICC's interim pre-tax profit fell 12 per cent to Pounds 58m, from a peak of
Pounds 100m in 1990. Sales were reduced in every part of the business,
leaving group turnover at Pounds 1.77bn, against Pounds 1.9bn.
Resilience in infrastructure markets and cost-cutting limited the fall in
operating profit to 4 per cent, a total of Pounds 75m. Mr Biggam said
operating profit was slightly ahead of the second half of last year.
Rationalisation costs of Pounds 9m were taken at the operating level.
Factory closures and other cuts were reducing the workforce at the rate of
10 per cent - or 2,000 jobs - a year. Interest charges rose from Pounds 12m
to Pounds 17m. However, with Pounds 154m of rights issue proceeds arriving
in June, net debt was eased to Pounds 15m going into the second half.
BICC Cables, the European business, saw operating profit fall by 19 per cent
to Pounds 47m on turnover of Pounds 500m. North America - where prices had
at last started to firm - made a Pounds 1m profit, a turnround from a
second-half loss of Pounds 5m. Australasia improved from Pounds 8m to Pounds
13m.
Balfour Beatty, the contractor, increased profit from Pounds 13m to Pounds
15m on Pounds 869m turnover. The 72 per cent of the business in civil
engineering and power had remained resilient.
The group broke down its property portfolio to show Pounds 110m in projects
completed or under construction - of which 40 per cent were rented at a rate
of Pounds 4m a year; Pounds 65m in the Spitalfields joint venture; and
Pounds 50m in frozen schemes.
Earnings per share amounted to 11.2p, against 13.6p. The interim dividend
was held at 6p and Mr Biggam underlined the group's intention to maintain
this year's total at 19.25p after a strong cash performance.
The share price gained 17p to close at 279p, compared with 285p for the
rights issue.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Japanese publisher to take over Berlitz International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLITZ INTERNATIONAL, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell
Communication Corporation, which discovered a majority of its shares were
pledged improperly to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, has
signed a merger agreement with Fukutake Publishing, the Japanese
correspondence course and book publishing concern.
If the deal is completed, existing Berlitz shareholders would own about
one-third of the company's ongoing equity. Fukutake, which is making the
offer through its US subsidiary, would hold the rest.
The deal requires approval from two-thirds of the shareholders. That will be
complicated as ownership of 6.8m of the 20m shares is in dispute and subject
to legal action.
When the formal offer document is issued, it is expected to require approval
from both sides claiming ownership of these shares: Macmillan on one hand;
and Shearson Lehman, Credit Suisse, Swiss Volksbank and Advest on the other.
The announcement follows market speculation, and comes after Berlitz, based
in Princeton, New Jersey, said earlier this month that it was in talks with
parties interested in the possible takeover.
Fukutake acquired 20 per cent of Berlitz's Japanese unit in 1990.
A letter of intent, allowing Fukutake to buy the 56.5 per cent stake in
Berlitz held by Macmillan, MCC's main US subsidiary, for Dollars 265m, was
signed in November 1991.
That was rendered void when MCC went into bankruptcy, following Mr Maxwell's
death late last year. Since then, MCC has been operating under Chapter 11 of
the US Bankruptcy Code.
At present, most of the Macmillan stake in Berlitz is in the hands of five
banks and companies that received stock as collateral for loans to Mr
Maxwell.
Apart from shareholder approval, the deal between Berlitz and Fukutake is
conditional on certain transactions, involving share transfers and the
waiving of claims by MCC.
Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, refused to comment yesterday,
saying the issue was sensitive because ownership of Berlitz shares is still
in dispute.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: Laying low the ghost of rent control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M A PHILCOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Gavin McCrone (Personal View, August 17) correctly identifies
the benefits of an enlivened private rented sector, the help it would
provide in getting out of recession and the critical importance of
persuading institutions to re-enter this market. But he is off the mark in
saying that 'rent controls . . . have now been removed'.
Rent controls still exist and, if anything, are being applied with
increasing intensity. In the east end of London, 'fair rents' on properties
controlled under Section 70 of the Rent Act of 1977 are about 20 per cent of
open market rents - probably the lowest relative level for many years.
Our company has one controlled tenancy dating from 1945 in which, by way of
his subsidised rent, the tenant has received more than twice the capital
value of the property he occupies. The means the DoE uses to maintain
controlled rents at derisory levels amount to an abuse of the legal system.
Institutions abandoned the private rented market because many fingers were
burned by retroactive legislation creating controlled tenancies out of
agreements freely entered into by both parties. The large number of empty
flats above shops and offices in every high street reflects the resolve of
the same institutions not to expose their fingers again.
As long as there are controlled rents for a significant number of tenants,
the private rented sector will never be revitalised. If the government
seriously wants to enliven the private rented sector it could do so at a
stroke by abolishing rent control. But is is unlikely to do so, if only
because this would increase the PSBR through housing benefit claims and,
perhaps, deprive it of the votes of those tenants who would now have to pay
a proper rent.
The government apparently hopes the passage of time will solve the problem:
rent-controlled tenants, many of them elderly, will eventually die off. But
I need hardly point out that landlords are growing old at roughly the same
rate. M A Philcox,

FT  20 AUG 92 / Letter: New law not necessary to achieve board
accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Dr Maurice Gillibrand (Letters, August 11) is wrong in his premises and
his conclusion that further legislation is needed to make company boards
accountable.
First, he is wrong to believe the CBI opposes the Cadbury Committee's
recommendations. Rather, the CBI finds many positive features in the code at
the centre of the Cadbury committee's draft report. Much of it represents
what CBI members consider best practice.
But we reject Cadbury's proposal that a statement of compliance with the
code in the annual report and accounts be made a Stock Exchange listing
obligation. Disclosure in this form will be bureaucratic because a statement
which is both a listing obligation and subject to review by auditors will
have to pass muster with a company's lawyers. Ques-tions of interpretation
will inevitably be raised, and explanatory notes and more detailed rules
will surely follow.
The proposal is also unnecessary because it ignores how compliance will be
achieved in practice. The code is, in effect, a checklist against which
boards can measure themselves. It is also a tool which institutional
investors can use; it is they who can effectively urge reform on boards
which are failing to perform. They do not need the mechanism of a listing
obligation.
Dr Gillibrand asserts that boards have become self-perpetuating. This
scarcely squares with the evidence of changes in the leadership of companies
where shareholders have become dissatis-fied.
For accountability to achieve its purpose, it needs to be exercised by
regular process rather than dramatic intervention. Annual general meetings
can be part of that process; and active participation by shareholders should
be encouraged. We have urged that the responsibilities of shareholders
(especially the institutions), as owners of the business, be spelt out in
the Cadbury code. Institutional shareholders should, whenever possible, use
their voting rights and declare to companies in which they have invested how
they intend to exercise them
Finally, Dr Gillibrand is wrong to conclude that more company legislation is
needed and that two-tier boards should be part of reform. Matters in the
code such as the calibre and independence of non-executive directors cannot
be legislated. It is an error to suppose that the supervisory board can be
transplanted from a country in which it has deep roots (back to the 1920s in
Germany) and be fruitful in quite another tradition.
Cadbury has already prompted many companies to review their board structures
and procedures. The CBI looks forward to carrying the debate forward at its
national conference in Harrogate in November at which Sir Adrian Cadbury
will be presenting his recommendations.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The benefits of lower house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a contradiction in calling for lower inflation and a rise in UK
house prices? Of course, there is. Asset prices, whether of commodities,
houses or shares, are more volatile than the general rate of inflation. When
inflation merely slows down, asset prices fall. When inflation rises
slightly, asset prices rise by leaps and bounds, although there is no neat
synchronisation.
Just as most of the more sensible documents related to popular equity
ownership contain a warning that share prices can go down as well as up,
there should be a similar notice in every house agent's window.
If we are serious in wanting stable prices, then we can hardly want a
revival in house prices at so early a stage in the economic cycle: and
schemes which attempt to bring this about are misconceived.
House prices are on average some 10 to 20 per cent below their 1989 peaks,
depending on the index used. But the regional variations have been large.
According to Nationwide, the price to a first-time buyer in East Anglia is
now a third below its 1989 peak. Any forthcoming economic package should be
limited in intention to trying to discourage further falls and not to
restarting the disastrous housing escalator.
It is time to consider the benefits of lower house prices. In his article in
the Weekend FT of August 8, John Authers mentioned that the initial annual
mortgage payment, expressed as a percentage of average earnings, had fallen
by a third for a first-time buyer from its 1989 peak. This is a great gain.
Such couples are nevertheless still reluctant to buy, partly because of the
general lack of confidence, but also because they are holding out for
further price falls. The worst way to try to overcome this hesitation would
be by an inflationary boost to the housing market. A rising trend of house
prices would make it more expensive for future newly formed households to
acquire accommodation, and thus impede the mobility of labour which ought to
be one aim of housing policy.
Another bonus from lower house prices has been the long-delayed revival of
the rented sector. There have been numerous cases where letting has recently
seemed a better proposition than leaving properties empty or selling them at
a knockdown price. A sitting tenant is no longer always the drag on house
values he or she used to be. The combination of rent decontrol on new
tenancies and the house-price slump has given the rentals market the biggest
kick start it has had for decades.
Rented accommodation is inherently more convenient for many people,
including the young and professionally mobile, than the commitments of home
ownership. Such people were deterred from renting both by the lack of
suitable properties, following decades of rent control, and by the belief
that they would be fools to miss out on an investment which was sure to beat
inflation by a comfortable margin.
It will be a great gain from recent developments if people now regard houses
as places to live rather than as guaranteed double-your-money investments,
and allow the choice between buying and renting to be dictated by
circumstances. People will no longer feel an economic imperative to 'trade
up', and will decorate their homes to suit themselves rather than the estate
agent. An even bigger social gain will be the end of houses as a topic of
dinner table conversation. (If we could banish schools as well, we would
really be getting somewhere.)
Last but by no means least in the litany of benefits has been the puncturing
of the price of urban land. At the end of the last decade, land constituted
nearly 45 per cent of the price of a new dwelling in the south-east and East
Anglia. This was a diversion of the national income from both capital and
labour to the providers of space, for whom it was just a windfall gain.
And one did not have to be an egalitarian to dislike the distributional
effects which diverted an increasing proportion of the national income both
to the owners of landed estates and the pension funds. In Greater London the
average price of a hectare of land shot up from Pounds 390,000 in 1981 to
Pounds 3.096m in 1989. By the first half of 1990 it was down again to Pounds
2.078m. There will be few tears about any further drops.
The main focus of attention in recent discussion has, however, not been
today's buyer, but the plight of those who bought homes in the boom of the
late-1980s, whose dwellings are now worth less than the outstanding value of
their mortgages. The Bank of England has estimated that there are nearly a
million of these householders, with a total negative equity of Pounds 6bn,
three-fifths of whom are to be found in the south-east. But it would be no
more reasonable to restart inflation for their sakes than it would be to
restart it for the benefit of property developers and their banking backers
who are having difficulty in maintaining their policy of upwards-only rent
revisions.
There is an analogy with the victims of commodity price fluctuations. The
latest thinking is to avoid rigging prices and instead to extend direct
credits to the victims. Indeed, a special compensatory finance facility of
the International Monetary Fund exists for this purpose. The aim is to
cushion the well-being and spending power of the victims without impeding
necessary price changes. A similar approach should be applied to homeowners
in difficulties.
An example of the right sort of relief would be to raise the Pounds 10,000
limit on building societies' unsecured lending, so that they can lend to
homeowners who are good credit risks, but have been caught out by recent
developments in the property market. An increase in total mortgage interest
relief should be avoided like the plague, but the existing concession could
be rearranged to make more available in the early years.
It is important not just to avoid panic attempts at house-price boosting
now, but to break the boom and bust cycle in the longer term. It is the boom
that causes the bust as well as troubles of its own.
There is no law of the Medes and Persians that house prices must in the long
run rise at least as fast as earnings and twice as fast as the retail price
index. This apparent trend was due to the rapid growth in households,
'Nimby' planning restrictions, rent controls and fiscal privilege for home
ownership. The Nimby restrictions remain, but many of the other influences
are declining. The restriction of mortgage interest relief to the basic rate
will reduce fiscal privilege. So will the council tax due to start next
year, which will re-establish in small measure some taxation of the benefit
in kind from home ownership.
Obviously the early 1990s have not proved the ideal time for either reform.
But neither could be made while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister, with her
misidentification of home ownership with economic virtue. If we wait for the
ideal time no reform will ever be made.
The task should be not to lose the benefits of the housing shake-out, but to
convert them into long-term structural gain which will remain when recovery
comes.

<TEXT>
Sir, You suggest incorrectly ('Unit trusts faced with hedging restrictions',
August 17) that Imro has issued guidance which permits unit trusts to be
invested on derivatives only in 'rare circumstances'. Imro has issued no
guidance on correlations between portfolios and indices and has not
specified any percentage of congruence to be achieved by portfolio managers
hedging their positions. This would be inappropriate unless the views of
practitioners had been established. The statement attributed to Mr Graham
Dunnachie does not reflect Imro's position.
There is much debate on the subject of 'congruence'. SIB has invited
industry representatives to submit views on how indices may be used for
hedging unit trusts. When those views are received, they will be considered
carefully by Imro and SIB. Policy will not be set before the industry has
been properly consulted.

Isn't it about time somebody conducted a value-for-money investigation into
the Audit Commission, the watchdog charged with promoting efficiency in
local government and the health service?
Its annual report deserves rigorous attention. The fees charged to local
authorities rose by an average of 6.6 per cent during the 1991-92 year,
compared with an inflation rate of 4.1 per cent.
The report tries to justify this by comparing the rise with the 6.7 per cent
rate of salary inflation in the financial sector. Average salaries rose by
more than 10 per cent to Pounds 24,674, despite a fall in staff turnover for
the third successive year.
Meanwhile, Controller Howard Davies took a hardly less generous 9.9 per cent
rise in total remuneration to Pounds 106,018. To be fair, at least one knows
what he was getting, which is more than can be said now that he has moved
over to the CBI.
The Commission has conducted a review of its own central costs which
highlighted a number of areas where there was scope for savings.
Perhaps it would be more convincing if an outside body carried out an
efficiency investigation. How about calling in the National Audit Office,
the Commission's less glamorous rival?

Wherever there is money and celebrity press clippings, it is a near
certainty Alan Dershowitz will not be far behind. So, as the Mia
Farrow-Woody Allen bust-up descends into increasingly murky territory, it is
no surprise to find the 53-year-old lawyer taking centre-stage.
In this case, Dershowitz - author of legal tracts such as Chutzpah 1991 - is
acting for Farrow. So far, his public role has been to act as her spokesman,
emphasising her laudable desire to have the whole business resolved in
private.
It may turn out to be one of his more sympathetic cases: Dershowitz has
recently defended Mike Tyson, who is serving a prison sentence for rape,
hotel queen Leona Helmsley, in prison for tax evasion, Mike Milken, the
jailed junk bond king, and TV preacher Jim Bakker. He certainly gets the
high profile clients. But it's more difficult to judge how well he has done.
Perhaps the irony is that Dershowitz - who sprang to fame when he
successfully defended Claus von Bulow against attempted murder charges in
the early-1980s - has been described in the past as 'a Woody Allen
look-alike'.
It was 'Reversal of Fortune', which starred Jeremy Irons and was based on
the von Bulow case, which made him a household name. How many other Harvard
professors are as well known as Dershowitz?

FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Exam results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, HUNDREDS of thousands of UK school leavers will learn the results of
their A-level examinations. Their future prospects - in higher or further
education and the careers of their choice - will often depend upon the
results. The headline news that entries and pass rates have again risen is
cheering, but it cannot conceal the unacceptable damage which the A-level
exam continues to inflict on the education system in England and Wales.
The A-level exam is a highly refined procedure which successfully selects a
small minority of students to go on to university degree courses, which
reach a world-beating standard in just three years. The hurdle is
necessarily set high, to screen out the three out of four young people for
whom there are no university places. For that majority, there are various
post-16 technical and vocational qualifications which - despite government
reforms - are still a long way from enjoying 'parity of esteem' with
academic qualifications among pupils, parents or employers.
For those permitted to attempt the A-level hurdle, the penalty for failure
is high. One in five entries results in a fail grade, leaving the candidate
with nothing to show for two years' intensive study of the subject. Even the
successful entrants must bend to the system's iron determination to impose
premature and excessive specialisation: the brightest and best are
encouraged to become scientists and engineers who cannot communicate, or
arts specialists who can barely calculate percentages.
Moves to broaden post-16 education have been resisted by ministers, who have
been concerned to defend what they describe as the 'gold standard' of
A-levels. The only concession has been the creation of AS-levels,
examinations which aim to reach the standard of A-levels with around half
the content. While these offer the opportunity for young people to take more
subjects in the sixth form, they have not proved popular with either pupils
or schools (which find them hard to timetable). This year, there were fewer
than 53,000 entries, compared with more than 730,000 at A-level: the
AS-level has clearly failed to catch on.
A broader curriculum is necessary, drawing on the excellent and proven model
of the International Baccalaureate. IB students take six subjects, with
mathematics, English and a foreign language compulsory. Three subjects are
followed at a higher level and three as subsidiaries, with the final grade
depending on performance in all six.
Whether this broader approach is adopted as part of a system which
encompasses similar standards in technical and vocational education (as the
French baccalaureate does) is a secondary matter. But the creation of a
compatible system which provides a convincing range of qualifications suited
to all talents and disciplines is long overdue.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S report that the US government may wind down its funding for
Sematech, the semiconductor research consortium, will cause satisfaction in
various quarters. Set up in 1987 to help US semiconductor manufacturers
tackle Japanese competition, Sematech was an isolated example of US
taxpayers' money being spent on industrial policy in the European manner. If
the semiconductor manufacturers are now to be left to their own devices, the
principle of free markets is apparently reaffirmed.
It may not be that simple. Sematech's demise is far from certain. If it
comes, it will be at least partly because the programme has achieved its
object. In essence, this was to demonstrate that state-of-the-art
semiconductors could be made using only US equipment. This could not have
been said five years ago. According to this week's report from the US
General Accounting Office, it should be true by the end of this year.
The contrast with such EC initiatives as the Jessi semiconductor programme
is instructive. Jessi is bigger, more complex and more diverse in its
objectives. It is also something of a mess. The difference may be traceable
to the fact that Sematech was born in the ideologically hostile environment
of the Reagan years. This gave it three starting advantages: a restricted
budget - Dollars 500m of government money in all, a quarter the size of
Jessi; correspondingly modest and achievable aims; and senior figures from
the semiconductor industry rather than bureaucrats to run it.
Granted, the wider effects of the project are not easy to define. At the
outset, the underlying objective was to stop the US semiconductor industry's
decline in world market share, then running at 3 per cent a year. The
decline has duly been arrested. But this will have more to do with the
achievements of individual US companies than with any technological advances
produced by Sematech. The US industry also has a habit of holding market
share during recessions and losing it again dramatically in the next upturn.
It might be queried whether the Sematech experiment will be repeated in the
US. It is hard to envisage another industry arousing the same protectionist
fervour as semiconductors, which are central to the future of the wider
electronics industry. In addition, the argument that domestic production of
advanced semiconductors is essential to national security has lost some of
its force with the end of the cold war. The Japanese electronics industry,
too, is in a much more chastened mood than five years ago, partly because of
the bursting of the Japanese asset bubble.
It is therefore possible that Sematech will prove a one-off instance of
co-ordinated industrial policy in the US. Either way, it points an awkward
moral: that those countries which have least need of such policies are most
likely to succeed with them.

ACCOUNTING FOR GROWTH By Terry Smith Century Business Pounds 12.99. 223
pages
It's bold, it's brash, it's labelled 'the book they tried to ban'. And a
month before it was due to be published, it is already on the shelves.
Rarely has a technical business book attracted so much advance publicity.
The decision by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, to suspend Terry
Smith, the author and head of its UK research department, has been well
reported. UBS has issued a writ against him and his publisher after
complaints from at least one of the companies cited in the text.
Readers may find that the book does not deliver all it promises. It begins
with a clear and important question: how can a company fail when its most
recent set of accounts show a profit? Recent examples include Polly Peck,
British &amp; Commonwealth and Maxwell Communication Corporation. During the
past decade, there have been many more.
The book sets the scene with a brief historical tour through the 1980s,
which it calls the decade of the deal. Corporate finance activity expanded
sharply, mergers and acquisitions surged and debt soared.
After the party, the hangover of the 1990s. Companies are trying to reduce
their debt burden in favour of raising money through share issues. But many
are too late, says Smith, leaving 'bleeding balance sheets, soaring bad
debts, devastating bank profits and penniless shareholders. The scene is
littered with tarnished reputations and broken careers . . . and jail.'
Accountancy, Smith argues, must take a share of the blame. Its flexible
rules have allowed companies' financial information to be presented in ways
that provide few warning signs to investors of the true position.
In 12 chapters Smith explains a series of accounting techniques which have
had the effect of improving the profits or reducing the significance of the
debt on many UK balance sheets. None breaches existing standards.
Smith does a good job of describing the techniques and their effects,
illustrated with extracts from company accounts. He also provides three more
detailed case studies of collapsed companies in appendices.
The final chapter is probably the most useful. It lists six 'survival
techniques' for investors in the 'accounting jungle'. Above all, Smith
stresses that lack of cash is the reason companies fail - profits are
secondary. He says investors should read accounts from the back forwards,
looking for discontent in the resolutions at the annual general meeting, and
the note on contingent liabilities, while skimming over the often uncritical
chairman's statement at the front.
Most of the controversy surrounding the book has been generated by a single
11-page chapter towards the end. Smith publishes a series of tables showing
the top UK quoted companies, with blobs against each to show which of them
uses the 12 techniques he has described.
He is careful to issue provisos, stressing that inclusion 'does not
automatically mean that the company is indulging in creative accounting'.
But the implication - reinforced throughout the book - is clear: companies
which use the techniques are massaging their figures.
Unfortunately, his case is not proven. The techniques he lists are not only
legal but also widely used. A case can be made for 'capitalising' costs by
putting them on the balance sheet in certain circumstances, for example, a
technique he attacks. Indeed, the practice is compulsory in the US.
Most of the methods he highlights have either been changed or are under
scrutiny by the new Accounting Standards Board and its associated bodies.
This means the book's interest is historical and it is of little use as a
predictive tool for identifying future collapses.
In fact, Smith fails to establish the link between accounting practices and
financial difficulty. He cites the poor share performance last year of a
number of the companies which used at least five of the techniques. Yet his
evidence is selective. He does not compare these figures with the
worst-performing shares on the stock market during the period. He does not
even include all the quoted companies which used at least five techniques.
An analysis by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, shows that the average
share performance of companies which did not use any of the techniques was
worse than those which used at least five.
There is a more fundamental problem. Smith draws heavily on public
information in company accounts. Analysts ought to be able to extract this
information and recalculate if they disagree with the accounting treatment
adopted. Admittedly, this may be more difficult for less-qualified
investors.
The whole thrust of reform by the Accounting Standards Board is that
investors should be less concerned with a single number - particularly
earnings - and more with the accounts as a whole. It is the concentration on
profits which has encouraged companies to inflate that figure. The book
reveals at least as much about the readers of accounts  - particularly
analysts - as it does about their compilers.

Thursday night belongs to BBC2 at present. Do you remember those comforting
stories about the British being really responsible for the post war German
economic miracle thanks to their revolutionising German unions and German
politics? Well now it seems that Japan's modern success can be put down to
American initiative. Business Matters (7.30) investigates the influence of
W. Edwards Deming who, in 1950, went to Japan to teach the natives quality
control.
The opening episode of The Climbers (8.00) promised an engrossing series.
Today Chris Bonington treks to the Diamir face of the Nanga Parbat. The game
show Ps And Qs (8.30) should either take snobbishness seriously and use
Jennifer from 'Jennifer's Diary' and Garter King Of Arms, or whatever, to
head the teams answering questions on etiquette, or it should self destruct.
The opening episode last week was disastrous.
Alan Bennett's series of solo dramas, Talking Heads, was superb and the
episode repeated today, 'A Cream Cracker Under The Settee' (9.40) with Thora
Hird as the house-proud pensioner who has a fall, is one of the best:
marvellous writing and a tremendous performance.

<TEXT>
ALIEN 3 (18) Odeon Leicester Square
WATERLAND (15) Curzon West End
LOVERS (18) MGM Piccadilly, Odeon Mezzanine
JERSEY GIRL (15) Plaza
THE curtains part, the spotlights rake the monumental letters, then the 20th
Century Fox fanfare turns into a long curdled shriek. Yes, the alien has
penetrated that sanctum sanctorum, the Hollywood logo. How long before it
spawns all over Tinseltown and grows too large for studio loyalty? Shall we
see a full-size alien skeeter atop the Paramount mountain, or growl out from
the MGM scroll, or impersonate the Columbia torch lady?
In Alien 3, a film half silly and half splendid, the slobbering reptile with
the curved black head and Meccano jaws once more demonstrates the terrors of
ubiquity. This time it infests a distant planet functioning as an all-male
penal colony under the brutal rule of one Superintendant Andrews. In any
other film Brian Glover as the bald, bad, barking Andrews (no relation)
would be the most charismatically grotesque thing on view. But the alien has
landed, unwittingly brought in by Sigourney Weaver's battle-scarred Ripley,
who crash-lands here from a previous adventure.
By climax time, all is mayhem as before: the sudden glimpse of dripping jaw
or oily tentacle, the starting-gun scream. New Zealand film-maker Vincent
Ward (Vigil), who wrote the story but was ousted as director by pop video
alumnus David Fincher, bequeathed the brilliant conceit of a group of
ex-murderers and rapists living in an interstellar monastic foundry.
Fumbling with their newfound mysticism - 'some sort of apocalyptic
millenarian Christian fundamentalism' vaguely explains Medical Officer
Charles Dance - they are like the cast of The Name Of The Rose flung into
hyperspace. Weaver's grimy, crop-haired Ripley adds to the film's
Rembrandt-goes-to-Hell look and the black comedy is vivid and versatile.
The alien's secret birth is cross-cut with the pious words delivered at a
prisoner's funeral ('There is always new life. . .'); an oxygen mask falls
from a ceiling, its scaly hose momentarily suggesting something far worse;
and a defunct robot is described as having 'negative capability.' (Thank
you, Mr Keats, we will be in touch about the royalties. . .)
But once the chase starts, wit and luminosity are replaced by gimmickry and
pyrotechnics. Worse, the script by Alien veterans David Giler and Walter
Hill with Larry Ferguson expunges the two most interesting male characters
in an early kill, leaving Ripley to orchestrate the also-rans. A film that
starts out as a crackpot masterpiece about cabin fever in the cosmos ends up
as a monster flick comme tous les autres.
                         *       *       *
Though I have not read Graham Swift's fenland novel Waterland, I intuited
that something was wrong with the film from its opening. What are we doing
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania? Short answer: looking for an American audience.
Jeremy Irons, sere of face and cicatriced with moustache, regales his
college history class with trauma-packed memories of boyhood, sex and East
Anglia. 'Sir, sir,' they all but cry, 'why are you telling us this?' 'Well,
children,' he all but replies, 'because screenwriter Peter Prince and
director Stephen Gyllenhaal (Paris Trout) think we should have a framing
device to explain to you transatlantics what fens are and what England was
like when everyone who lived in them went 'Ooohh, eeeggh, aaarrhh.'
Incest, fishing, nude bathing, abortion, the Great War: it is all here. But
what dismays about Waterland is less its off-the-peg pastoral torments - the
village idiot brother, the dark hints of inbreeding, the love trysts in the
barn, the old crone crowing over her abortion patients - than its lunatic
attempt to extract a message for middle America.
When not flashbacking to the fens, Irons pads around Pittsburgh explaining
that his raunchy tales are as bona fide a part of 'history' as, say, the
Battle of Valley Forge. Not surprisingly his fellow teachers disagree and
think he should go. And his wife Sinead Cusack, ruing the infertility
brought on by that long-ago pregnancy termination, has already gone.
One half-admires the film's moments of stark courage: as when it literally
tips Irons and his pupils into early-century Norfolk, driving them through
the past in a vintage multiseater from which they view the beery natives on
the eve of World War I. But even this smacks of Americanisation. The past
used to be a foreign country; now it is a theme park. They speak a universal
language there, one composed of folksy wisdoms about the child fathering the
man and cinegenic proverbs about giving a human, picture-book touch to
public or social history.
                         *       *       *
Victoria Abril, the pouting star of Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down] and High Heels,
is quite wonderful in the Spanish film Lovers. The face at once gaunt and
pixie-ish, the manner distrait and monomaniacal: she was born to play the
beautiful widow who seduces the gullible soldier (Jorge Sanz) in this
truth-based tale of love's young dream turning to nightmare and scandal.
For the young man is courting his commandant's pretty, virginal maid
(Maribel Verdu) when he takes lodgings - ah fatal day] - with Miss Abril.
Soon she has him in bed and is doing unmentionable things with a silk
handkerchief.
Passion and perversity meet in hot embrace and Miss Verdu is left out in the
cold. Even when the young girl gives up her virginity for the cause, she is
no match for the siren. Miss A was trained, after all, in the Pedro
Almodovar School of Absolutely Anything Goes. Sex, jealousy, handkerchiefs,
cut-throat razors: it will be fun for a while and then end in tears or
murder.
Writer-director Vicente Aranda was inspired by a crime of passion in 1950s
Spain, which sent its culprits to jail after Franco had commuted the death
sentence. But the film is inspired by Miss Abril, who won the Best Actress
prize last year at Berlin.
With her moue of a mouth, spiky-lashed eyes and honeyed throatiness of
voice, she is a junior-team Gloria Swanson presiding over her side-street
Sunset Boulevard.
What she and the film and its sex scenes will do to most male filmgoers I
tremble to think. What they should do for Miss Abril's career is make her an
international star.
                         *       *       *
Finally, Jersey Girl. Just for a moment I thought this might be a Lana
Turner bio-pic. Miss Turner, once known as the Sweater Girl, was famous for
making woollen garments bulge in all the right places. But no: this movie
bulges in all the wrong places and the Jersey invoked is the place not the
pullover.
Toby (Jami Gertz) is the working-class out-of-towner who falls for
Mercedes-owning New York yuppie Sal (Dylan McDermott). But can Cinderella
hold on to her Prince Smarmy?
Not until her girlfriends have screamed dire warnings, her gift-happy Pop
(Joseph Bologna) has embarrassed her with his taste in evening dresses, her
snooty Park Avenue rival (Sheryl Fenn) has tried to steal Sal back and - oh
enough, you cannot want me to continue. We thought they did not make films
like this any more, but it is the silly season and we were, alas, wrong.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Airlines face CAA levy on licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW fund to protect customers of failed scheduled airlines should be
financed by an increase in air transport licence fees rather than a
supplement paid by passengers, the Civil Aviation Authority has told
industry representatives.
The CAA said variations in ticket prices would make it difficult to provide
passengers with cash refunds. Instead, it envisages asking other airlines to
honour the tickets of failed carriers, in return for an agreed proportion of
the usual fare from the fund.
The proposals are outlined in a letter from the CAA to airlines and trade
bodies, following the announcement in March by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, then
transport secretary, that the government intended to establish the fund.
Mr Rifkind said protection for scheduled-service passengers would be limited
to those using UK airlines. There are already arrangements to protect
charter passengers.
If the government had proposed protection against failure by foreign
airlines as well, the CAA said it would have imposed a supplement on
passengers at UK airports. It would otherwise have been difficult to collect
contributions from foreign airlines.
The CAA is opposed to the accumulation of a large fund, as investment income
would be taxable. It envisages a fund of less than Pounds 10m - equivalent
to about 25p per passenger over a full year. If the fund were exhausted it
could be replenished by a levy and borrowing.
The primary legislation needed to set up the fund is unlikely to be
introduced before the 1993-94 parliamentary session, according to the CAA.
It said it would consider industry views before making recommendations to
the government.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Barclays to appeal over MCC ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank is to appeal against the High Court's refusal last month to
grant it an injunction stopping the administrators of Maxwell Communication
Corporation suing it in the US bankruptcy court for Dollars 30m (Pounds
15.5m).
The bank received the money, which it had demanded under an overdraft
facility it had given MCC, three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell in
November last year.
Price Waterhouse, the administrators, contended that the payment was an
unlawful preference over the claims of other MCC creditors and asserted the
right to sue for it in New York, where MCC is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Barclays argued that the English court was the natural forum for trial of
the dispute because the overdraft facility was an English commercial
transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an
English company and its UK subsidiaries.
Mr Justice Hoffmann said that, though an English company, MCC's principal
assets - estimated at between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn - were in the US,
and the Dollars 30m had been paid to Barclays out of the proceeds of the
sale of the computer publishing division of Macmillan, MCC's principal US
subsidiary.
He added that an injunction could only antagonise the US court and prejudice
the co-operation between the Chapter 11 proceedings and UK administration.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Move to counter tribunal delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday moved to counter delays in the industrial tribunal
system, but the proposals immediately came under fire for being inadequate.
The employment bill, due to come before parliament in the autumn, will
contain legislation allowing those who chair industrial tribunals to sit on
their own rather than with two lay members in particular categories of cases
which together account for about 25 per cent of hearings. More than half of
the cases brought to English and Welsh industrial tribunals - the
independent judicial bodies that settle disputes mainly between employees
and employers about employment rights  - had waited longer than five months
for a first hearing by last month.
The tribunal chairman or chairwoman has legal qualifications and is aided by
two lay members with practical experience in industrial relations. One is
drawn from a pool nominated by employers' organisations and the other from a
pool nominated by employees' organisations.
The government also said it has offered more women and black people
appointments as lay members. The new appointments will raise the proportion
of women from 24 per cent to more than 27 per cent, while ethnic minority
representation will rise from 3 per cent to more than 4 per cent. However,
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said the figures were still too
low.
The number of cases brought has increased sharply in recent years because of
legal changes, the decline of collective bargaining and the growing
willingness of unions to represent their members at tribunals.
Mr Stephen Cavalier, a partner in Brian Thompson and Partners, the firm of
solicitors most active in tribunals, said more resources should be spent on
the system and added: 'This measure is not sufficient to deal with the
delays endemic in the industrial tribunal process.'
The Confederation of British Industry said it would oppose any move to
excessive legalism in the system.

CUBA said yesterday it was ready to sign a Latin American treaty prohibiting

reports from Havana.
Mr Pedro Nunez Mosquera, director of multilateral affairs at the Cuban

for the sake of Latin American unity.' He said Cuba had remained outside the
1967 Tlatelolco Treaty as it did not want to renounce the right to possess
arms needed for its defence.
This position was justified because of a policy of hostility by the US
against the island and the continuing presence of a US military base in
eastern Cuba at Guantanamo Bay.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US merchandise trade deficit fell 7.7 per cent in June to Dollars
6.59bn, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, providing a modest
fillip to President George Bush and his fellow Republicans at their current
party convention in Houston.
The administration hailed the 7.2 per cent rise in exports to a record
Dollars 38.3bn as a vindication of Mr Bush's trade policies. However,
imports were also a record, at Dollars 44.9bn, and more than 40 per cent of
the increased exports was due to a volatile component, foreign sales of
civilian aircraft, which rose by Dollars 1.1bn during the month to Dollars
2.57bn.
For the first six months of 1992, the adjusted trade deficit totalled
Dollars 35.5bn, compared with Dollars 30.5bn in the equivalent period last
year.
The higher export figure reflected increasing foreign sales of capital
goods, industrial supplies and materials, vehicles, parts and engines,
foods, feeds and beverages, and consumer goods.
Although the rise in exports might not be sustained, foreign sales continue
to provide the best news in the sluggish US recovery. The administration
will use export growth to try to win voters over to the newly negotiated
North American Free Trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.
In June, the US ran a trade surplus of Dollars 334m with Mexico and a
Dollars 440.6m deficit with Canada.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S external debt will rise to Dollars 93bn (Pounds 48.6bn) in five
years from Dollars 74bn now, mostly because of increased foreign aid, the
World Bank said in an annual confidential report to India's aid donors,
Reuter reports from New Delhi.
The bank said India would need about Dollars 10bn a year for the next five
years to finance the current account deficit, repay its debt and increase
foreign exchange reserves.
India's current account deficit in 1992-93 is expected to double to Dollars
6bn from Dollars 3bn the previous year mostly due to the lifting of import
curbs, the report said.
The curbs were imposed in April 1991 when India was in the throes of a
severe balance of payments crisis, amid caste and religious strife and
political upheaval. Foreign bankers refused to extend new loans.
The crisis forced Delhi to borrow Dollars 2.2bn from the International
Monetary Fund and embark on a reform programme.
'Despite the large (debt) repayments, the substantial inflow of official
assistance required to support the adjustment programme would raise India's
external debt. . .to Dollars 93bn in 1996-97,' the report said.
It said much of the aid to India in the past had not been used because of
bureaucratic logjams and the government's inability to raise matching funds
for projects.
Foreign investment has had a small role in India. It averaged Dollars
200m-Dollars 300m a year from 1985-90, as opposed to Dollars 700m to Dollars
1bn a year in Indonesia, Dollars 1bn to Dollars 2bn in Thailand and Brazil
and Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn in China.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Cambodia powerless to prevent plundering of its forests: The
factions that are selling a nation's timber as fast as they can to raise
cash ahead of planned elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON the roads leading south from the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, the logs
seem to be everywhere: heaped in timber yards, lying on the verges, stacked
in lorries or rumbling along slowly, one by one, on carts drawn by water
buffalo.
These days there are few large trees within sight of the roads. Shrugging
off the risk of landmines, Cambodian peasants have brought the hardwood logs
from the hills in the distance. Timber unsuitable or too small for the
sawmill is sold as firewood or baked into charcoal in roadside kilns.
There is no sign here of the Cambodian 'environmental ceasefire' urgently
recommended by a report prepared for the UN in April. Instead, the world's
timber merchants have taken advantage of the power vacuum in Cambodia to
indulge in a frenzy of deforestation all over the country.
The report estimates that legal and illegal exports in 1992 will reach about
1.15m cubic metres, more than four times the probable sustainable yield of
250,000 cubic metres. It also blames deforestation for flash floods a year
ago and for the siltation of rivers and lakes.
'Following the signing of the Paris peace accords in October 1991, an
unprecedented period of 'asset stripping' has begun in the forestry sector
that is having a potentially catastrophic effect on Cambodia's remaining
forest stocks and will further aggravate on-going degradation to the
resource bases of both lowland agriculture and fisheries,' the report says.
Cambodia's plight is made worse by the fact that neighbouring Thailand,
Vietnam and Laos, after damaging their own forests, have imposed logging
bans. 'People are forced to come to Cambodia to get their logs,' says Mr
Rajeev Pillay of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Phnom
Penh.
The loggers can count on the inability of the Vietnamese-installed, lame
duck administration to enforce such laws as there are. They can also depend
on the eagerness of guerrilla factions to make the most of border territory
they control before they yield their authority to the UN, in accordance with
the peace plan leading to elections next year.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas in western Cambodia - and their foreign business
partners - are among the worst offenders. 'Is there anything wrong with
buying wood from Cambodia?' a Thai buyer on the border was quoted by Reuters
as saying recently. 'Or do you just want us to sit idle and allow the
Singaporeans and Japanese to come in and take it all before the election?'
The report, prepared for the Earth Summit, identified Thailand, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and France as buyers of Cambodian timber.
Nor have Cambodians failed to notice the accelerating deforestation of their
homeland. The report says some refugees have been disoriented on returning
home by denuded forested areas made 'as bald as a monk's head'. However, it
will be difficult to translate their concern into action until an effective
government is in power.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the transitional Supreme National Council,
which embraces the four main Cambodian factions, emphasised the urgency of
his country's environmental problems when he addressed a donors' conference
in Tokyo in June.
Shortly afterwards, Funcinpec, the royalist party, announced a complete
logging ban in its territory, although Funcinpec officials acknowledge that
their logging interests are less significant than those of other factions.
'The amount is very little compared to Phnom Penh (the Hun Sen government)
and the Khmer Rouge,' said Mr Ek Sereywath.
The Hun Sen administration has established an environmental committee but
continues to sell timber, which is one of its few sources of income. The
Khmer People's National Liberation Front has split into two factions - one
civilian and one military - and the civilian leadership says it cannot stop
the military officers from behaving 'like wood-eating termites' and selling
trees.
The Khmer Rouge, while refusing to co-operate with the UN and put its forces
into cantonment areas, appears to be selling timber and gems as fast it can
to increase its financial reserves.
Dr Than Sina, one of Prince Sihanouk's palace advisors, says everyone is too
busy with other matters to pay attention to the environment. 'The question
of cantonment, the question of the Khmer Rouge, has overcast the whole
issue. I think it's a matter of setting priorities for the future. I don't
think anything can be done right now.'
Without an effective military ceasefire in Cambodia, the chances of imposing
an environmental ceasefire remain exceptionally slim.

<TEXT>
TALKS between India and Pakistan ended on an optimistic note yesterday. Both
sides agreed to discuss Kashmir and signed two agreements on the prohibition
of chemical weapons and a code of conduct for diplomats in the two
countries.
Mr Shaharyar Khan, Pakistan's foreign secretary, described the sixth round
of secretary-level talks as the 'most productive' so far, saying that
agreement 'on the need to address the Jammu and Kashmir issue' was 'in
itself a step forward.'
Mr R L Bhatia, Indian minister of state for external affairs, yesterday told
parliament that the Indian government believed dialogue with Pakistan was
essential to 'lower temperatures' between the two neighbours. However, he
pointed out that while India was willing to discuss all matters with
Pakistan, 'meaningful discussions on bilateral issues, specially on more
complex questions' could only be held once Pakistan 'stopped its support to
terrorism and subversion in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab'.
Categorically denying that Pakistan was fuelling terrorism in Kashmir, Mr
Khan said that his country also faced a problem of terrorism in Sindh
because of the free availability of arms. He suggested a joint approach to
the problem.
Mr Khan said that the wishes of the Kashmiri people would also be taken into
consideration. When asked if Pakistan would agree to the option of an
independent Kashmir, the foreign secretary said that a framework of the UN
resolution already existed, implying that this was not an option.
Although the confidence-building measures between the two countries have
been more successful this time than before, foreign affairs experts in India
are sceptical the sides will be able to hold meaningful talks on Kashmir,
which has been the main obstacle to peace in the sub-continent for 47 years.

<TEXT>
MR SHIMON Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday the Israeli
government was committed to a 'meaningful dialogue' with its Arab neighbours
and wanted to move quickly to deal with issues of substance.
He also said it would be 'tragic' if Arab participants did not join
constructively in Middle East peace talks due to resume early next week in
Washington.
Arab officials were due to meet in Damascus yesterday to discuss tactics for
the sixth round of talks since the US-sponsored Middle East peace effort was
launched in Madrid last October.
Mr Peres said it was a 'tragic mistake on the part of the Arabs to appear
negative, demanding, conditioning, postponing'. He urged the Palestinians in
particular to join Israel in the search for peace without delay.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, has called for an interim
self rule agreement with the Palestinians within 12 months, and elections
for a 'self-governing authority' in the West Bank and Gaza by next April.
However, he infuriated Palestinians last week when he said that Israel was
pressing ahead with 11,000 homes already under construction in the
territories.
Palestinian officials threatened to postpone participation in the Washington
talks in protest at President Bush's decision to release billions of dollars
in loan guarantees to Israel without securing agreement for a complete
freeze on Jewish settlements.
'We are seeking a unified Arab stand to demand US clarification on the deal
and guarantees of a complete freezing of all settlements on all Arab
occupied lands, including Jerusalem, before the start of the August 24
talks,' Mr Yassir Abed Rabbo, a senior PLO official said in Amman.
The PLO has indicated it will instruct the Palestinian delegation not to
negotiate Palestinian autonomy without unequivocal Israeli commitment to
stop all settlement buildings.
The Palestinians will also demand clarifications from the Israel and the US
on the status of East Jerusalem. The US has stipulated that the holy city be
discussed later. But the Palestinians are demanding that it be dealt with as
part of the occupied territories at all stages of the peace talks.

<TEXT>
BOLIVIA is to supply Brazil with natural gas from the start of 1995, under a
preliminary agreement signed by President Fernando Collor of Brazil and
President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, Christopher Philipsborn reports from
La Paz.
The gas will run through a proposed pipeline from Santa Cruz Department in
eastern Bolivia to Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, 2,000km away. The World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and Eximbank of Japan are said to
be considering loans for part of the pipeline's Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 730m)
cost, with the rest to come from the private sector.
At first, 8m cubic metres of gas a day are planned to reach Brazil, rising
to 16m cu m. Prices will vary with that of fuel oil, at first based on
Dollars 0.90 per 1,000 cu ft at the wellhead, and Dollars 1.22 at the
border.
The deal may help Brazil shift from dependence on poor-quality oil for
making electricity. Most of the Bolivian gas will power part of the
industrial and domestic demand for electricity in Sao Paulo.
Those worried about pollution from burning oil with high sulphur content to
make electricity favour the gas alternative. Gas use by Sao Paulo industry
is set to reach 35m cu m by the year 2000, possibly heralding a gas deal
between Brazil and Argentina, which has an estimated 60bn cu mts of natural
gas in its Salta reserves. For Bolivia, the deal could not come quickly
enough. It was hard hit by the fall this year in the price of its gas sales
to Argentina.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexican meat could be Caribbean poison -
Canute James on concerns that Mexico's presence in Nafta will undermine the
region's economies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE agreement which will link Mexico's economic destiny to that of its US
and Canadian neighbours to the north is being regarded with more than slight
discomfort by the countries in the Caribbean Basin. For the past year, there
has been little doubt in the minds of Caribbean and Central American trade
ministers that the region will be hurt by Mexico being part of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Both the Canadian and US governments have been petitioned repeatedly to
ensure some form of preferential treatment for the region.
Mr Brian Mulroney, Canadian prime minister, on a recent visit to Trinidad,
offered countries in the region some comforting words: 'The Caribbean
countries will lose nothing but there will be greater competition in the
North American market. What we would propose is to evaluate any impacts
after a reasonable time, see what they are and, if there are any, try to
accommodate them in meetings with the Caribbean leaders.'
The problem for the region is based on the fact that, for many years, it has
survived through trade preferences. Most recently, 24 Caribbean and Central
American countries have been benefiting from the Caribbean Basin Initiative
(CBI), a trade programme offered by Washington, which selects countries
which may ship a range of products to the US duty-free.
Several countries also benefit from a similar programme offered by Canada,
while others have preferential access to the European Community market under
the Lome Convention. Mexico in Nafta threatens to remove the advantages of
preferential entry to the US and Canada because small regional economies
cannot compete with Mexico.
Business leaders and government officials in the region say they are already
seeing the effects of Mexico's participation in Nafta. Investment decisions
were delayed as the negotiations for Mexico's entry went on.
'The US is not yet willing to consider the likely impact of an expanded
Nafta on the Caribbean Basin states, but says this will be reviewed in four
to five years,' says Ms Judith Bennett, a promotions officer with Jampro,
Jamaica's economic development agency. 'But, during this period, the
Caribbean states will lose a large part of their industries, particularly
agriculture and garments.'
The region has made much of opportunities to expand exports of garments to
the US in recent years. Although not allowed duty-free access under the CBI
(a concession to the fears of the US domestic industry), countries in the
Caribbean and Central America have been granted quotas under a programme in
which US-made fabric is cut in US plants and then sent to the region for
assembly, with duty paid on the added value on re-entry to the US.
The countries which have benefited from this Dollars 2bn-a-year industry
have asked Washington to ensure that they are allowed duty-free entry to the
Nafta when Mexico becomes a member. 'If this does not happen, then we can
tell this industry good-bye, and face the political price of the anger of
the hundreds of thousands of women who work in the factories,' said one
official from the Dominican Republic.
The region's sugar exporters have also been worried at reports that Mexico
could ship 1.5m tonnes of sugar a year to the US. This would amount to more
than current US imports under quotas from 44 countries, many in the
Caribbean.
There is general agreement in the region that one way to control the damage
would be to join forces. But, for the Caribbean states, such co-operation
has always been slow and difficult.
Mr Norman Garca, executive director of Fide, the Honduran export development
agency, says the start of the Central American common market in January will
allow its members more strength in dealing with Nafta. This should be
followed by discussions with the Caribbean islands to create a wider
economic union, he suggested.
'We must either get out of the way of Nafta, or follow,' Mr Garca said. 'We
must follow Nafta. We have no alternative. The Caribbean Basin countries
must first get together, and then talk to Nafta.'
Mexico is expected to be admitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
group (Apec), the 15-nation regional economic consultative body, officials
at the South Korean foreign ministry said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from
Seoul.
A ministry official said no objections to Mexico's membership were expected
at the group's fourth ministerial meeting in Bangkok on September 10-11.
Apec is made up of Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
South Korea, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore and Brunei.

<TEXT>
THE Bank of Portugal said yesterday it had cut its intervention rate by one
percentage point to 16 per cent for lending to commercial banks, Reuter
reports from Lisbon.
This second sharp cut in a month of the country's key interest rate follows
last week's central bank announcement that all remaining controls on capital
movements would be lifted by the end of 1992.
Economists agree that the three-stage lifting of restrictions on capital
movements was bound to lead to a sharp fall in Portugal's high interest
rates.
Mr Jose Tavares Moreira, who ended a three-year term as Governor of the Bank
of Portugal in May, predicted on Monday that borrowing rates for good risk
companies would fall four to five points to about 13 per cent by the end of
this year.
The governor, Mr Miguel Beleza, declined to quantify the expected fall, but
said Mr Tavares Moreira's estimate was 'probably not far out.'

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in June, according to
official figures, underlining the sluggish state of the economy. The main
reason was the poor performance of the energy and construction sectors,
where output fell by 1.37 per cent and 4.76 per cent respectively.
By contrast, output in the manufacturing sector fell only 0.08 per cent.
The June fall followed one of 1.6 per cent in May.
Many of the largest French industrial companies - including the Suez
industrial group, Thomson-CSF in electronics, Publicis in advertising,
Pernod-Ricard in drink and Lafarge Coppee in building materials - have
recently announced reductions in interim turnover.
The decline in production is also reflected in rising unemployment and a
fragile stock market. The CAC 40 Index fell again yesterday, for the second
successive day, having fallen for most of last week, to close 0.14 per cent
lower at 1,734. France's current account deficit fell to FFr1.92bn (Pounds
200m) in the first half of this year, its lowest level for six years,
according to the finance ministry. This is compared with a deficit of
FFr31.11bn in the equivalent period of 1991.
The June deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted FFr4.39bn, against a
revised figure of FFr9.1bn for May.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Weekend 'Chetniks' on the warpath: Should Nato be fearful of
military involvement in Yugoslavia?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THROUGHOUT the capitals of western Europe, an unequivocal consensus has
emerged over the past week: Europe must not get involved in the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In London, Paris, The Hague and Rome, defence ministries and senior officers
have repeatedly warned their governments that any large-scale military
involvement in Bosnia would incur a high financial and human cost.
Western governments are even reluctant to provide any substantial military
support to protect aid convoys. Moreover, the idea mooted at last month's
Geneva conference on refugees concerning the establishment of security
corridors in Bosnia has now been abandoned, as confirmed by Mr John Major,
the British prime minister on Wednesday night.
Such deep reluctance begs the question of why western governments are so in
awe of the Serb military machine in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Officials at Nato yesterday tried to explain Europe's reluctance to become
involved.
'First, Nato is not ready for such an operation. We have not fought in any
war. But second, leaving aside the terrain, we don't know what kind of army,
or how many armies we would be fighting in Bosnia,' a Nato official said.
The Serb army in Bosnia inherited at least 500 artillery pieces, 300 tanks
and 40,000 soldiers from the former Yugoslav army. It also took over an
indigenous defence industry in Bosnia, a communications network and a senior
officer corps handpicked by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. One of the
key army commanders in Bosnia is General Ratko Mladic.
As former commander of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina, western
Croatia, Gen Mladic helped to organise the Serb insurrection against the
Croats in 1991. But four weeks after the European Community recognised the
independence of Bosnia-Hercegovina last April, Mr Milosevic ordered Gen
Mladic to take command of Sarajevo.
'This is the man who controls the formal army units,' a UN official based in
Belgrade said. 'This is the man you negotiate ceasefires with.'
However, Mr Charles Meynell, editor of the London-based East Europe
Newsletter, says the former JNA units exist uncomfortably alongside bands of
thugs and irregulars.
'Much of the professional officer corps of the JNA, including the most
influential Serbian generals - many of whom have resigned - were, and are
aghast at the mixture of Serbian hoodlums, criminals and 'Ramboesque'
drug-taking delinquents who have been so prominent in the ransacking of
Bosnia,' says Mr Meynell.
The low morale among sections of the army is partly confirmed by the recent
resignation of Major General Vuk Obradovic, once considered a 'hard-nosed'
loyal Serb nationalist. 'This is a measure of how disreputable the Serbian
military machine has become,' added Mr Meynell.
Apart from the army and the irregulars, parts of Bosnia is overrun by
'weekend Chetniks.'
Between Fridays and Sundays they cross the river Drina from Krajujevac, Nis
and Valjevo in Serbia, and from Montenegro. Those captured say they have
been paid DM500 a day for fighting in Bosnia. 'These guys are well fed,
nationalist and ready for a weekend's fight,' said a UK Ministry of Defence
adviser. 'They wreak havoc.'
But what is the combat effectiveness of such a two-tiered force?
'If you look at the way in which 45,000 Croat troops, managed to push back
the Serb army from Mostar (the capital of western Hercegovina, in western
Bosnia) between late May and early July, it begs the question why a combined
western force cannot take on the Serbs in other parts of Bosnia,' a western
military attache said.
A Nato official noted that 'The army is good at bombarding. And they still
have the air-power. But it has no infantry. Look at how long it took them to
flatten Vukovar? (the eastern Croatian city ). In some ways, apart from
Mostar, the army, or the irregulars for that matter, have never been really
tested,' he said.

More than 8.5m Czechoslovak citizens are participating in the mass
distribution programme which aims to turn over Dollars 9.9bn (Pounds 5.18bn)
worth of state-owned equity to private shareholders.
Results of the second round of bidding, which ended on July 28, show that 56
per cent of all shares on offer have been allocated. Most enterprises will
enter subsequent bidding rounds to re-offer their remaining shares, but 142
enterprises have finished their privatisation distribution.
These include Komercni Banka, the largest commercial bank in the country,
which distributed 53 per cent of its shares. Thirty per cent of all
enterprises on offer were over-subscribed.
A third round of bidding is scheduled to start on August 26.

The prison authorities began negotiations with the officers' union to end
the strike which started in Rouen on Tuesday and has since spread to other
jails across France. The talks over the officers' demands for tighter
control of violent inmates lasted two and a half hours before being
suspended.
There were outbreaks of violence at several jails yesterday. Police were

Fleury-Merogis and to jails at Baumettes near Marseille and Gradignan near

<TEXT>
GERMAN economic growth will slow further in the third quarter of this year,
the DIW economics institute said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes. Real
output, which fell by 1.5 per cent in the second three months, will drop
another 0.5 per cent in the period ending September 30, it claimed.
Falling employment and reduced industrial order intake will lower consumer
spending, and investment in the east of the country will suffer from the
loss of management confidence.
Official figures for the second quarter are expected to be published in
early October, although ministers have talked of a 1 per cent decline.
Exports are also on the way down, the institute said, because of weak
investment abroad, lack of consumer confidence, the strength the the D-Mark
against the US dollar, and high interest rates.

John Major's decision to send up to 1,800 troops to Bosnia.
Nor was there much optimism that next week's London conference would ease
the pressures which forced the UK prime minister to reverse his
long-standing opposition to the commitment of British ground forces.
Despite the sharp lines drawn around the commitment - the lightly-armed
troops will operate under United Nations auspices, will escort only those
convoys granted right of passage by the warring factions and may be
withdrawn at any point - no one is sure that it does not mark the beginning
of a much more perilous military entanglement.
Mr Major's sombre demeanour after a six-hour meeting on Tuesday with his
senior ministers and military advisers signalled that he is as concerned as
ever that British soldiers may be dragged into a bloody war which outside
forces could not win.
He does not believe that the conflict can be solved by western military
intervention. Talk of 'surgical' air strikes to force an end to Serbian
sieges of Bosnia's Moslem communities is rejected as 'sheer fantasy'. Many
more innocent civilians than Serbian fighters would be killed, he believes.
British generals estimate that the other large-scale military option
canvassed in an impatient media - that of criss-crossing the disputed
territory with heavily-defended and permanent aid corridors - would involve
up to 300,000 western troops.
'That is a war and no-one should fool themselves otherwise,' Mr Major told
his colleagues before resuming his Spanish holiday.
As Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, emphasised yesterday, Britain's
view that 'in the end this is going to be settled, if it is going to be
settled, by pressure and talks, talks and pressure'.
But that will take time. The best that is hoped of next week's London peace
conference is that it will increase the pressure by tightening the sanctions
net on Serbia; and will set the framework for more talks by publicly
committing the international community to the principles which must guide
future negotiations.
Mr Major was acutely aware that such an outcome would not satisfy public
opinion. The vivid television images of the suffering in Bosnia had begun to
tarnish his political image at home and to threaten the authority of
Britain's EC presidency.
At Tuesday's meeting he was presented with estimates from his advisers
suggesting that up to two million civilians in the former Yugoslavia faced
acute food and medical shortages this winter. As one senior minister put it:
'Inaction was no longer an option'.
So after a painstaking review of all the options the decision was taken that
ground troops were needed to accelerate the humanitarian aid effort.
It was not a decision taken easily. Senior officials denied that the length
of the meeting - which agreed also to send Tornado fighters to secure an air
exclusion zone in southern Iraq - reflected a split. But they agreed that
the prime minister had agonised over every detail.
Although the government insists that the troops, in blue berets, will travel
only with convoys on routes negotiated by UN agencies, it acknowledges that
they will return fire if attacked. If that happens the choice might be to
commit still more troops or withdraw.
For the moment the opposition parties are backing the action. Mr John Smith,
the Labour leader, offered his backing after a telephone call from the prime
minister. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has repeatedly
called for more determined action.
But Mr Major is astute enough to know that the public and political moods
could change. In the appropriately brutal language of one senior Whitehall
official yesterday: 'What will opinion demand when the bodies start coming
back?'

FT  20 AUG 92 / A-level results to reopen education debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIOUS fall in the study of maths and science subjects despite a record
number of A-levels awarded this year will reinforce calls for a broader
post-16 school curriculum.
The principal examination for school leavers entering higher education in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland attracted 730,000 entries, a rise of 4.5
per cent. The results, sent to schools and colleges yesterday, showed a
record overall pass rate of 79.6 per cent.
However, a sharp decline in maths and science subjects in favour of social
and business studies will renew debate about the need for a broader and more
balanced exam.
The fastest growing A-level subjects are business studies (entries up 24 per
cent, after a 21 per cent rise last year), social science topics (up 14 per
cent) and English (up 9.5 per cent).
The number of mathematics students fell 3.9 per cent, and those taking
physics and chemistry dropped 4.9 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. This
follows a 12.8 per cent fall in maths students and a 9.4 per cent fall in
physics students in the previous two years.
Pupils in England and Wales are not obliged to continue with English, maths
or a science subject after the age of 16, unlike most other European
countries which require pupils preparing for university to study a balanced
curriculum. Calls for a reform of A-levels into a broader exam have come
from across the spectrum, from vice-chancellors and the Head Masters'
Conference to the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties.
Critics argue the traditional three subject A-level curriculum is too narrow
and and point to the waste of an exam which is failed by one in five
students.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'Twenty per cent of all A-level and 30 per cent of AS-level
entrants have nothing to show for their efforts, making the introduction of
new vocational qualifications a desperate need.'
The government insists that A-levels set a 'gold standard' and argues that
AS-levels, with half the workload of A-levels, allow students to study more
subjects and keep their future options open. Lady Blatch, the schools
minister, notes that one in ten students in higher educations enter with
vocational qualifications.
However, this year the number of AS-level entries rose by only 2.3 per cent
from an already low base of 52,000.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World News In Brief: Maastricht 'no' vote support grows in
France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two opinion polls yesterday showed swelling support in France for a 'no'
vote on the Maastricht Treaty - but both polls suggest voters will still
back closer European union in next month's referendum. One, for the magazine
L'Evenement du Jeudi, suggested 47 per cent would vote 'no' - a higher
proportion than in previous surveys earlier this month. A second poll, for
Daiwa Securities, forecast a 46 per cent 'no' vote. French support for
Maastricht stood at about 70 per cent in early June.

FT  20 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate hopes help share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate optimism, briefly revived by developments in the German money
markets, helped UK equities yesterday, but gains were trimmed following
discouraging news on last month's domestic retail sales. Trading volume
remained poor but the market was enlivened by a number of special
situations.
UK investors turned cautious in late dealings on reports that a French
public opinion poll was about to disclose reduced support for the Maastricht
proposals; a poll conducted by Daiwa, the Japanese house, published during
trading hours yesterday, showed 54 per cent of French opinion in favour of
the Maastricht treaty.
At the opening of the London market, shares showed every inclination of
extending the losses of the previous session. But a fall of nine points on
the Footsie was quickly replaced by a gain, eventually extending to 12 index
points, when Bundesbank activity in the German money markets calmed fears of
a rise in the Lombard rate today. Interest rate optimism was further
encouraged when the Bank of Portugal cut intervention rates for the second
time within a week.
However, with equity turnover still in the doldrums, share prices began to
falter. The report of a 0.3 per cent dip in UK retail sales in July was seen
as evidence of continued economic gloom, while a 0.1 per cent rise in
non-oil gross domestic product in the second quarter did nothing to lift
spirits in the stock market. Optimism was dampened further after Ford Motor
said two of its UK manufacturing plants were going on part-time working
because of falling car sales.
The Footsie turned back from the day's peak of 2,367.1, taking a fresh knock
when Wall Street made a sluggish start to the new session following a modest
narrowing in the US trade deficit for June.
The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,363.5 with a day's gain of
8.8. Dealers felt that, but for the Bundesbank's actions, UK stocks would
have given back a little more of the attempted recovery which brightened
trading sessions last Friday and on Monday.
The strategy team at Nomura Research Institute maintained their bearish
view, commenting: 'Our advice is to sell the rally - now.' The team's chief
concern remains that of higher UK base rates.
Seaq volume increased only modestly to 393.5m shares; Tuesday's 361.3m
represented retail business worth Pounds 730.1m, still well below acceptable
levels from the industry viewpoint.
Among the day's casualties, Euro Disney shares fell in London, as they did
across the range of European bourses, after a US investment bank expressed
bearish views not dissimilar from those heard in London in recent weeks.
The domestic corporate front, however, was brightened by a positive
reception for trading news from BICC, the cable and construction group,
although the chairman reiterated the need for lower UK interest rates to
prompt recovery in the domestic economy.
With sterling little changed by the end of the session, there was not much
activity yesterday in the blue chip international stocks.

FT  20 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities stage late fall
awaiting Bush speech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices traded listlessly in a narrow range for most of the day
yesterday until late selling of bank, housebuilding and airline stocks left
leading indices notably lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 22.42 down at 3,307.06. The more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 3.15 to 418.19, while the Nasdaq
composite receded 3.26 to 567.61. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to
187m shares.
Financial markets have been full of speculation this week that President
Bush will announce some tax cuts during his acceptance speech as part of a
bold attempt to regain the initiative from his Democratic rival, Governor
Bill Clinton. Although the bond market would react negatively to such a
move, analysts are unsure how equity investors would respond.
On the one hand, tax cuts would have a positive effect on the economy, and
on the President's chances of re-election, but on the other, they would harm
efforts to reduce inflation and the federal budget deficit. Given such
uncertainty, many investors have decided to keep out of the market until
after tonight's speech.
Banks were mostly lower, although analysts could not find an explanation for
the sell-off in the sector. Citicorp fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16 3/4 ,
BankAmerica Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 43 1/8 , Chemical Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 32 3/4 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 22 5/8 .
Berlitz International moved ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 23 1/2 in turnover of
2.2m shares on news that Fukutake Publishing, of Japan, will buy 67 per cent
of the company for cash, new stock and some proceeds of Maxwell
Communication debts.
Airline issues weakened after AMR, parent of American Airlines, retreated
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 on a warning from the company that it would
make a heavy loss in the third quarter.
Commodore International plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 6 7/8 after the
computer and electronic products group announced a fiscal fourth-quarter
loss of 66 cents a share, a dismal performance compared with the 10 cents a
share profit earned a year ago.
Housebuilders were mostly lower in the wake of Tuesday's poor housing starts
data. Kaufman &amp; Broad Homes dropped the furthest, by Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 12 after warning that third-quarter earnings would come in some 20
to 30 per cent below the year-earlier figure.
On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 26
1/2 on news that the stock will replace Wang Laboratories - which filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week - on the S &amp; P 500 index
today.
Canada
THE sudden late setback on Wall Street chopped a few points off the Toronto
market but stocks ended no worse than mixed with help from stronger bank
shares.
A Goldman Sachs report by a New York analyst, recommending Royal Bank of
Canada and Bank of Montreal, pushed banks up. Royal Bank was ahead CDollars
 3/8 at CDollars 24 3/4 , after a day's high of CDollars 25 1/8 , and Bank
of Montreal ended CDollars  7/8 firmer at CDollars 46 1/4 . The TSE 300
index gained a net 7.7 at 3,385.5 in volume of 26m shares.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Liquidity added
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures rallied yesterday morning after the Bundesbank decisively
deflated the expectation of a Lombard rate rise by injecting a generous
amount of liquidity into the German money market.
In the afternoon, however, futures were falling back to their opening levels
as sterling tested its low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
Dealers continue to fear that sterling's predicament in the European
exchange rate mechanism, less than 4 pfennigs above its floor against the
D-Mark, will force a rise in UK base rates in the short term. One commercial
bank dealer suggested yesterday that the British government should now lift
base rates by  1/2 percentage point to avoid signalling an even larger
increase later.
The Bundesbank's decision to inject DM4.2bn into the money market shortly
before 9am eased the strain on the currency and futures. German call money
had been over the Lombard rate level, convincing the market that a Lombard
rate rise was imminent. September short sterling was at a low of 89.59 as
the funds were injected, and immediately rallied 7 basis points to a high of
89.66. December short sterling rose 5 basis points to a high of 89.67.
The mood was later checked. Sterling sank to a low of DM2.8118 against the
D-Mark and, as usual, futures followed. The September contract finished at
89.65 and the December contract at 89.66. Poor retail sales figures in the
UK had no impact. The market has already priced in Britain's economic
plight.
Trade in cash was thinner. The Bank of England was again helpful in its
money market operations, forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn and removing
most of it in the early round. One dealer suggested that the Bank is being
accommodating to keep short dates soft and take pressure off the currency.
One-month money closed yesterday  3/16 per cent down on the offered side at
10 per cent. Three-month Libor was unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent.
In the early round, the Bank bought Pounds 704m of Band 1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent and Pounds 220m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, it bought Pounds 70m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 137m
in Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 180m.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar on brink of all-time low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell to within a pfennig of its historic low against the D-Mark
yesterday, in spite of a decline in short term rates in the German money
market, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank eased pressure on both the dollar and high-yielding European
currencies by adding a generous amount of liquidity in its weekly money
market intervention. The addition of a net DM4.2bn softened call money rates
to around 9.70 per cent after they had touched the Lombard rate level of
9.75 per cent. Dealers believe there is no technical excuse for the
Bundesbank council to raise the Lombard rate when it meets today.
The German operation did not lift the dollar for long, however. After
rallying to DM1.4605 in Europe, it weakened to DM1.4520, less than a pfennig
above the all-time low of DM1.4430 set in February 1991. The US currency
finished in Europe at DM1.4530 (against a previous DM1.4580). In New York it
ended at DM1.4534.
There is a growing belief that the Federal Reserve will let the dollar fall
below the historic low before it intervenes again. Mr Mark Austin, chief
economist at HongKong &amp; Shanghai Banking in London, said intervention can
only work when the market is surprised. 'The Fed will intervene when it is
sure that the market is not expecting it to do so.'
There is lingering uncertainty over how much the Bundesbank is prepared to
help. Yesterday's intervention will make it more difficult for the German
central bank to sell D-Marks in the open market. A measure of the
Bundesbank's capacity will be the July M3 money supply figure, due out today
or tomorrow.
The D-Mark's strength against the dollar was enhanced by the Bank of
Portugal's 1 percentage point cut in its intervention rate to 16 per cent.
Instead of heading for the escudo's high-yielding counterparts, the lira and
peseta, investors opted for the D-Mark as a safe haven.
The escudo dived in early European trading, ending at Es86.90 to the D-Mark
from a previous Es85.84. The Portuguese currency also lost its lead in the
EMS grid, slipping to third place behind the Spanish peseta and Belgian
franc.
Sterling looked increasingly weak at the foot of the grid, closing unchanged
at DM2.8125 but widening the divergence from its central rate against the
Ecu to 73 percentage points. Some dealers say that EMS central banks have a
'moral obligation' to support their currencies in open intervention when the
divergence reaches 75 percentage points - although this is not a fixed rule.
If the dollar goes through its all-time low, the pound could and Bank of
England intervention will become a pressing issue.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Prospectors go for grand slam
in diamonds - The latest rush is raising doubts about De Beers' cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by
miners in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is
in turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the
world's most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.
In Canada's Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some
of gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the
history of the North American industry.
Stakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and
prospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of
the discovery.
In spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will
find enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada's first diamond
mine worthwhile.
The odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond
hunters in Angola. More than Dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day are
being smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.
An estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and their
numbers are being swelled by 500 a day. This rise of illegal mining,
particularly in the Cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of Angola's
diamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in May, 1991,
after the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time
in 16 years.
As well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilian
jobs have made their way to the diamond areas. The onset of the dry season
and the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouraged
what De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond
business, describes as 'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply
of illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market'.
Even though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked
about whether there might be more to this 'explosion.' Did Unita, Angola's
rebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released? Is
Endiama, Angola's state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way? In
the murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.
De Beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is
remarkable.
What is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola
or dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for
granted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up
and make all their efforts worthwhile.
The cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds. They are
composed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in
tough material, but there are substitutes for this use. Gem diamonds are
solely for decoration and serve no useful purpose.
But the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen
steadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession
the price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail
market from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.
The cartel is organised by De Beers' London-based Central Selling
Organisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds.
Apart from De Beers' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSO
handles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia,
Tanzania and Zaire.
The CSO has been mopping up as many of the smuggled Angolan diamonds as
possible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering
severely from soggy demand in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets,
which share about two-thirds of demand between them.
De Beers says that, because times are tough. it will probably have to cut
its annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981. It has also told
the producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contracts
permit at times of stress.
De Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market
through 'sights' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected
buyers. They are offered boxes of diamonds, each worth between Dollars
500,000 and Dollars 25m. The contents are judged by the CSO to balance the
requirements of the buyers with market demand. Buyers have either to accept
all the diamonds or reject the box.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls both De Beers and
its sister group, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, was
defending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the R1.1bn
Venetia diamond mine in the Transvaal. 'The CSO does not, and could not, run
a monopolistic system,' he said. 'In bad times like this, I sometimes wish
that we could. The fact is that the level of world diamond production, which
is carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled. Diamond prices cannot
be fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production
and consumption to be equated.
'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer
pool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand
is in excess of the level of supply. In this way it has been able to
preserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate
luxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and
consumers of this unique natural product.'
All very altruistic. But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamond
business - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn last
year.
The cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s. It was a
time of galloping inflation, a weak dollar and low interest rates.
Merchants, particularly in Israel, stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money as
a hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamonds
faster than the Central Selling Organisation could mop them up. The CSO's
diamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by
1984. Hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at
that time and Australia and Zaire challenged De Beers' near-monopoly.
De Beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been
built for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential
financiers of stockpiling operations, to 'educate' them about the way the
diamond market works.
After the bust came boom. Diamond sales in value terms jumped by 20 per cent
in 1987 and another 37 per cent the following year. To cool the market, the
CSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5
per cent in March 1989. Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demand
for diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people to
display their wealth by buying small but expensive items. The CSO boosted
the trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings are
regularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionally
were celebrated over a cup of rice wine.
It must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift the
diamond market as the present recession ends.
But in the meantime Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers' chairman, insists
that the CSO's control of the diamond market is not slipping.
'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world's rough
diamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,' he says. 'By
applying the deferred purchases clauses in our contracts with producers we
are applying the right medicine to ensure that demand matches supply and
that the diamond market will remain stable'.
The future of De Beers' diamond operations in Namibia were discussed with
the government there yesterday. In the past there have been suggestions that
CDM, De Beers' wholly-owned subsidiary, might be at least partly
nationalised. CDM, has diamond mining operations over a coastal area
extending 100 km north of the Orange River and recently brought the Auchas
and Elizabeth Bay mines into production. Last year Namibian output reached
1.19m carats, up from 750,000.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries recover as fears of tax cut
fade
</HEADLINE>

AFTER worries about a possible announcement of new tax cuts by President
Bush had depressed US Treasury prices in early trading, the market rallied
in the afternoon yesterday although trading activity remained light
throughout.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond had recovered from its
early losses and was up  3/32 at 99 1/8 , yielding 7.317 per cent. The
two-year note was unchanged at 100 13/32 to yield 4.013 per cent.
Since last Thursday, when Mr James Baker, the new chief of staff at the
White House, said tax cuts should be a central plank in President Bush's
re-election campaign and second term, enthusiasm for bonds has been tempered
by fears that if taxes were eventually cut, economic activity might revive,
inflationary pressures pick up and the Federal budget deficit widen further.
AUSTRALIAN government bonds ended the day mostly firmer, although
shorter-dated debt issues fell on signs that the market may have to wait a
while for the next cut in interest rates.
The government bond market climbed following Tuesday evening's government
budget and comments from the Treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, suggesting further
cuts in interest rates would occur provided inflation remained under
control. However, short-dated issues were thrown into confusion by reports
yesterday that Mr Dawkins had said no further rate reductions were planned.
Dealers warned Mr Dawkin's contradictory comments were probably aimed at
stabilising the Australian dollar, which has weakened against the US
currency.
In the futures market, September three-year contracts dropped to 93.16 from
a high of 93.40, before ending at 93.28. The contract closed at 93.23 on
Tuesday night after the budget.
An Australian Treasury official was reported as saying the government was
considering the issue of new Treasury bonds with lower coupons and longer
maturities. According to the budget statement, the government needs to raise
about ADollars 16bn through Treasury bond issues in the 1992/93 fiscal year
to help fund its forecast budget deficit of ADollars 13.39bn.
The government has indicated it plans to hold smaller bond tenders of about
ADollars 750m at regular two-to-three week intervals.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to climb yesterday as Tokyo stock prices
fell further at the start of trading, leading to hopes of an easing in
interest rates. However, as the Nikkei share index recovered later in the
day to close up 341.33 points at 14,650.74, bond market participants took
profits, wiping out most of the day's gains. The benchmark No 129 opened
with a yield of 4.71 per cent and moved to 4.655 per cent before closing in
Tokyo at 4.70 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds weakened on concern over the future of European
economic and monetary union. Dealers said the market was nervous ahead of
the release last night of two polls on the Maastricht Treaty which were
expected to show a drop in support for ratification of the Treaty. The Matif
futures contract edged up from 105.58 to 105.62 while cash bonds ended lower
or unchanged.
German government bonds traded in a narrow range ahead of today's Bundesbank
Council meeting and the possible release of the July money supply figures.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.65 and ended unchanged after
trading between 87.54-87.67.
Dealers said the Bundesbank's tender allocation yesterday was seen as
neutral for the market. The Central Bank added DM4.2bn in funds to the money
market, helping to dampen speculation about a possible rise in the Lombard
interest rate at the Bundesbank's meeting today.
STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed UK government
bond prices, with the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 slipping from 103 3/8 to
103 9/32 . The Liffe gilt futures contract inched up from 97.12 to 97.15.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT looks to a family of
futures contracts - Proposals to rekindle the flagging interest of a deeply
sceptical insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade is considering changes to its plans to launch a
range of insurance futures contracts this year, in an effort to rekindle the
flagging interest of a deeply sceptical insurance industry.
The contracts would allow insurance companies to hedge risks they had
insured without needing to use the more usual route of reinsurance.
One advantage of futures is that they can be traded quickly to take account
of unforeseen events, whereas reinsurance contracts take time to
renegotiate, said Professor Greg Niehaus at the business school of the
University of South Carolina. Also, the futures could be useful to hedge
undiversifiable risk, or what's left over after reinsurance, he said.
The exchange had planned to begin trading the first of a series of insurance
futures in homeowners' (or residential property) policies next month.
But the CBOT's board of directors is now looking at developing a family of
property futures that would be based on catastrophic losses from such events
as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes. These catastrophe contracts, which
are still being researched, would be likely to be regional, according to Mr
Richard Sandor, an executive managing director of Kidder Peabody and a CBOT
board member. These would cover such risks as earthquake futures for the
West Coast, tornado futures for the Midwest and hurricane futures for the
East Coast.
The CBOT has yet to decide whether to postpone the launch on September 25 of
national homeowners' insurance futures so that catastrophe futures can be
started at the same time, which is unlikely to be before December. A dual
launch appeals because catastrophe futures have had a better reception from
the industry than any other proposals for insurance futures made by the
CBOT.
Since proposing the idea in 1990, the CBOT has worked on developing futures
on property and health insurance, with potential contracts to come on motor
and marine insurance. But two years of conversations with the industry have
stirred little enthusiasm.
Mr Marc Rosenberg, vice-president for the Washington-based Insurance
Information Institute, an industry lobby group, says: 'I haven't detected
the slightest sign of interest by any insurer of note.'
Mr Rosenberg, like many in the industry, believes the futures only duplicate
the function of reinsurance, which covers underwriting losses above an
agreed amount. He points out that, with all the current problems of credit
quality in US insurance companies, it is unlikely that insurance regulators
will be willing to embrace untested financial tools.
'Their job is to see that those they regulate aren't too creative,' said Mr
Rosenberg. 'The nature of insurance is to guarantee that the money is there
when the claim must be paid. And regulators are sceptical of anything that
puts further risk into that equation.'
Insurance company executives are loathe to get involved with any new
instruments that regulators will question. Consequently, the CBOT must
persuade regulators that insurance futures are viable risk management
instruments that can improve a company's fortunes rather than harm them.
In the US, insurance is regulated by each state and, to make the contracts
viable, the exchange would have to convince regulators in at least several
key states. So far, the CBOT has had little luck. It has limited approval
from one state regulator, the Illinois department of insurance. And
Illinois, the home state of the CBOT, has said insurance futures can only be
used under its basket clause for 'undefined investments'. Such investments
are restricted overall to a total of less than 10 per cent of assets or 50
per cent of shareholders' equity.
This kind of approval virtually defeats the futures' purpose. If seen as an
investment, they will not reduce underwriting exposure - their main purpose
in the CBOT's view. It says they are not intended as a substitute for
reinsurance, but as a complement to bring down underwriting risks.
Acknowledging that the battle with regulators is uphill, Mr Les Rosenthal,
another CBOT board member who is involved in bringing the contracts to life,
said that once the exchange can educate them, they will not regard futures
as 'a cowboy strategy'.
Seasoned futures industry officials say the insurance industry's complaints
are not new - similar complaints have come from the petroleum industry about
crude oil futures, from the investment banks about bond futures and
Eurodollar futures, and from Wall Street about stock index futures. All
these industries were sceptical and said they wouldn't use the contracts,
but today they are involved in futures for hedging.
Mr Sandor said: 'It is unambiguously incorrect to view this market
differently than other markets.' Those who study the industry say the CBOT
is on the right path, but they believe the caution of the industry and
regulators could yet doom the contracts.
But Professor Stephen D'Arcy at the Department of Finance at the University
of Illinois says the danger for the futures contract is 'the insurance
industry will wait and see if it works, and while it waits, it won't work'.
If that happens, the long-awaited launch of insurance futures - or what Mr
Rosenthal of the CBOT calls 'the event of 1992' for the exchange - could
fizzle out.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
researching the development of insurance futures too, although 'it is not
our highest priority,' said Mr Michael Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive,
writes Tracy Corrigan. The exchange has not yet decided whether it will be
possible to devise a standardised, tradable product which would be
commercially viable.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Court approves Pfizer settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, yesterday said a federal court
had approved its previous agreement to settle a class action suit over
Pfizer's Shiley heart valves.
In January, Pfizer said it would commit up to Dollars 505m to cover claims
of Shiley heart valve recipients, including more than Dollars 200m to settle
the lawsuit plus Dollars 300m in pre-tax reserves. The company has not
admitted the valve is defective.
The settlement includes a fund of Dollars 75m for valve-related research, a
medical consultation fund of up to Dollars 140m to allow class members pay
for consultation with a cardiologist or other health care provider and a
guaranteed compensation programme for any claimants whose valves fracture.
Although the settlement was widely expected, analysts said it was an
important milestone for Pfizer. Mr Viren Mehta, an analyst at Mehta and
Isaly in New York, said: 'Pfizer needs to get Shiley behind it, and this
novel settlement will go a long way towards achieving that goal.'
Pfizer, which estimates the pre-tax cost of the settlement at between
Dollars 165m to Dollars 215m, said the costs would be substantially offset
by other items. It does not expect the settlement to have a material impact
on its 1992 earnings.

<TEXT>
CAROLCO, the cash-strapped Hollywood studio which is struggling to survive
in spite of its inordinately successful films such as Terminator 2,
yesterday posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 14.5m, or 54 cents a
share, against a deficit of Dollars 41m, or Dollars 1.48, a year earlier,
writes Karen Zagor.
Feature film revenues fell to Dollars 39.8m from Dollars 75.6m, largely
because no feature films were released domestically in the latest quarter.
Carolco's total revenues dropped to Dollars 83.5m from Dollars 144.1m.
Carolco's immediate future hinges on the completion of a deal to sell rights
to its film library to Spelling Entertainment for about Dollars 64m. An
earlier agreement with Spelling expired at the beginning of the summer, the
deal but was later revived.
Carolco has reduced its overall debt by about Dollars 108m since the end of
last year

Compaq said the lower prices for the products will substantially lower the

hits sector shares

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
US AIRLINE shares tumbled yesterday after American Airlines, one of the
industry's three 'mega-carriers', warned that it expects to make a sizeable
loss in the third quarter.
American, one of the most tightly-run US carriers, is widely viewed as a
bell-wether for the industry. Like most of its rivals, it has already
reported losses for the second quarter, and for the first six months of
1992.
American's warning came in a conference call between Mr Michael Durham, the
company's finance director, and analysts. 'The industry environment
continues to be extremely difficult,' said Mr Durham. He added that,
although American's effort to rationalise fare structures had boosted
traffic, yields were 'severely depressed'.
'As a result, we expect our third-quarter loss to exceed that of the second
quarter, adjusted for the loss provision relating to the Confirm Reservation
development project,' he said.
In the second quarter, AMR - American's parent company - reported a loss of
Dollars 166m after tax. Part of this deficit came from one-off items -
including a Dollars 109m provision on Confirm, the now-suspended hotel and
car reservation system project. But without these charges, AMR said it would
still have posted a Dollars 48m after-tax loss. Mr Durham's comments suggest
that the third quarter deficit will exceed this Dollars 48m figure.

PETRO-CANADA, the partially privatised Canadian energy group, is further
rationalising its activities by selling its 37 per cent stake in Westcoast
Energy, the Vancouver-based pipeline operator and natural gas producer.
Petrocan said yesterday a group of securities dealers, led by ScotiaMcLeod,
had agreed to buy the Westcoast shares for CDollars 342m (USDollars 285.59m)
or CDollars 16.25 a share. The price will be paid in two near-equal
instalments. Petrocan is Westcoast's largest single shareholder. The
proceeds will be used to reduce Petrocan's CDollars 1.5bn debt. But the
company expects to post a CDollars 54m after-tax charge from the sale
against third-quarter earnings.
Petrocan first bought a stake in Westcoast shortly after its creation in the
mid-1970s as Canada's national energy company. It augmented its holdings in
1988.

<TEXT>
SONY, the Japanese electronics company, reported consolidated operating
profits of Y36.99bn (Dollars 293m) for the first quarter of the year to
June, a fall of 37.1 per cent on the same period a year ago. Sales grew by
4.2 per cent to Y900bn.
The company suffered a loss of Y18bn in the fourth quarter of last year.
Sales in Japan were flat at Y229.46bn, while US sales rose by 14.9 per cent
to Y271.1bn.
However, Sony returned to profitability at the operating level in the first
quarter, although the company's performance remained well down on last year.
The results were lifted by a strong performance in the entertainment field,
where recorded music sales rose by 9.9 per cent to Y100.9bn, while income
from films leapt by 45.8 per cent to Y86.97bn.
Sales in Sony's traditional electronic equipment business, however, were
flat at Y712.2bn. Sales of video equipment were down by 6.9 per cent and
audio equipment sales were off by 1 per cent, while television sales rose by
3.7 per cent and other products by 9 per cent to Y157.4bn. Camcorder sales
remained sluggish, at 900,000 units during the quarter. This was 200,000
below the level a year ago but 50 per cent up on the last quarter of the
1991 fiscal year. Sony can produce 370,000 units a month.
Video recorder sales rose by 100,000 units year-on-year to 900,000 units,
while compact disc player sales advanced from 2.6m to 3.4m units.
Sony has maintained sales, however, by keen pricing that has cut deeply into
margins.
The results were also hurt by an 18.6 per cent rise in the depreciation
charge to Y68.3bn. Capital spending, however, was cut sharply this year, and
the quarterly depreciation charge was expected to peak later this year,
promising to increase profits next year.
The company estimated that the higher value of the US dollar compared with
last year had cut Y21.5bn off the value of sales.
Inventories at the end of June were 2.96 times monthly sales, compared with
2.68 a year earlier. The company's net income after tax fell by 36 per cent
to Y14.93bn, while net income per depositary share fell by 35.1 per cent to
Y37.1.

NORDBANKEN, Sweden's ailing state-owned bank, yesterday announced a group
re-organisation plan which included a cut in staff by 1,400 people over the
next 18 months.
Further details of the bank's rationalisation plans will be revealed within
a week.
The bank's short-term aim was to cut its costs drastically, introduce
substantial savings and improve its customer services with the eventual
objective of being privatised, according to Mr Hans Dalborg, the bank's
chief executive.
In May, the Swedish government was forced to rescue Nordbanken with a
SKr20bn (Dollars 3.76bn) financial package of guarantees and loans and it
will become the sole owner of the bank at the end of this month. In the
first four months of the year the bank suffered a SKr1.97bn operating loss
due to bad debts and non-performing loan provisions, its financial position
remains precarious.
Nordbanken said it planned to widen share ownership in Carnegie, the group's
investment and stockbroking arm as part of an aim to focus the bank more on
its activities inside Sweden.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Shareholders put on a brave face
/ A look at Hafnia's decision to suspend its shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision yesterday by Hafnia, Denmark's second biggest insurer, to
suspend its shares and effectively seek protection from its creditors, will
have widespread repercussions throughout Scandinavia's embattled financial
sector.
Shareholders were putting a brave face on the deal, which transfers assets
of DKr5.9bn (Dollars 1.04bn) to a new holding company, leaving them with
potential liabilities of up to DKr6bn. 'It is still too early to say whether
all the money we have invested in Hafnia shares is lost,' said Mr Flemming
Skov Jensen, of the LD wage-earner pension fund.
He admitted: 'There rarely comes anything good out of a suspension of
payments.'
The old holding company retains formal ownership of the new one. But the
restructuring appears to put the company's bankers in control of the assets
and provides lead bankers Den Danske Bank, whose exposure to Hafnia is
thought to be in the region of DKr1.2bn, with some measure of security, even
though interest payments have been suspended on outstanding loans. Other
bank creditors include Unidanmark, whose exposure amounts to DKr450m.
It casts further uncertainty over the immediate prospects of two of the
region's largest insurance companies, Denmark's Baltica and Sweden's
Skandia, in which Hafnia was a large investor.
Hafnia's former chairman, Mr per Villum Hansen, borrowed heavily to buy into
both companies as part of a bid to create a Scandinavian insurance
conglomerate capable of competing in the newly liberalised European markets.
Hafnia's creditors now control 34 per cent of Baltica and a further 14 per
cent of Skandia's share capital.
Chaos prevails, commented Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the chief executive of Skandia,
who is critical of both Hafnia's management and shareholders.
Earlier this summer, Hafnia's shareholders rejected a deal in which Skandia
would have obtained majority control of the Danish company in exchange for
liquidating Hafnia's outstanding debt.
The deal also has implications for a fourth insurer, Uni Storebrand, of
Norway, which had joined with Hafnia in its bid to take over Skandia. Uni
Storebrand owns 28 per cent of Skandia's shares.
Hafnia's difficulties have their origins in the ambitions of Mr Hansen, who
first pioneered the company's diversification within Denmark into merchant
banking and real estate in the 1980s, before turning his attention to the
broader Scandinavian and European scene in 1990.
Mr Hansen wanted to 'reshape corporate Denmark', said one analyst,
commenting on a DKr3.8bn investment in Baltica in 1990. Baltica's management
balked at joining Hafnia's putative Scandinavian alliance. Nonetheless, Mr
Hansen followed up by joining forces with the Uni Storebrand in a bid to
take control of Skandia at the end of last year, investing DKr2.3bn to
acquire a 14 per cent stake.
'Having found himself in one hole he dug himself into an even bigger one,'
comments Mr Angus Runciman insurance analyst with BNP Securities.
Hafnia's investments in its insurance company rivals, totalled an amount
equal to over a third of Hafnia's equity investment portfolio. More
seriously, the two investments exceeded Hafnia's entire shareholders funds
at the end of 1991 of DKr3.1bn and left the company's balance sheet heavily
exposed to the difficulties of the Scandinavian insurance market as a whole
where trading conditions deteriorated sharply in 1990.
'They should never have been playing around with that size of stake. Hafnia
is a small insurance company which wanted to play with the big boys and
wasn't up to it,' says Mr Runciman.
Matters have deteriorated sharply over the past two months. Following their
rejection of the Skandia deal earlier this summer, shareholders agreed to
support a DKr1.9bn rights issue to rebuild the company's capital.
Within the two months since the share issue the money has evaporated, as
further insurance and investment losses have emerged. Provisions against
losses on the group's credit insurance business amount to DKr250m.
Unrealised capital losses on the Baltica and Skandia shares amount to
DKr700m.
'As things were developing, we have crossed the line where we could continue
no longer. We thought the DKr1.9bn share issue we launched in July would
have solved our problems but it did not,' said Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman
of Hafnia.

FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rescue may be on the way for Uni
Storebrand

<TEXT>
NORWEGIAN authorities are considering a two-step intervention plan to rescue
Uni Storebrand, the troubled insurer, from plunging into deep financial
crisis, Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily, reports today.
According to the report, central finance authorities are considering options
which include state guarantees, a direct cash injection or a state
acquisition of some of Uni's long-term assets.
Once a decision is made, Uni could be split up with its life insurance
business being acquired by Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, in which
the state is a majority owner with a 55.5 per cent stake.
State intervention is being considered because authorities believe that a
NKr1.5bn-NKr2bn (Dollars 263.1m-Dollars 350m) capital expansion being
planned by Uni for the autumn will fail due to the uncertainty surrounding
the company after it acquired a non-voting NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent, stake in
Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer.
Uni's shares plunged yesterday to a record low of NKr15.95 on the Oslo
bourse. The capital expansion puts Uni's nominal share value at NKr20, which
means a capital expansion would have to be undertaken with Uni's shares
written down below nominal value.
Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth biggest banking group, expects a pre-tax loss
for 1992 after posting a DKr479m (Dollars 85m) deficit for the first half of
1992.
The bank gave no estimate for the expected full-year result but forecast a
positive performance for the rest of 1992. The bank last year reported a
DKr178m pre-tax profit.
It attributed its disappointing first-half result to difficult trading
conditions in the Danish finance sector, coupled with high interest rates
and a slump in domestic private demand and business activity.

FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aberfoyle placed in administration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberfoyle Holdings, the agriculture and security products group whose shares
were suspended earlier this month at 2 1/2 p, has been placed in
administration.
The company, with most of its operations in Zimbabwe, asked for the
administration order 11 days ago saying its financial position had
'deteriorated to the point where it had insufficient sterling funds to
enable it to continue to trade.'
Touche Ross have been appointed as administrators.
A group of dissident shareholders won control of the board last November
promising to restructure the company.
Mr Kojo Owusu-Nyantkyi, one of the dissidents and now a member of the board,
and his private company, Crescent Africa, hold a 26 per cent stake in
Aberfoyle. He said yesterday that he had a rescue plan of his own and
suggested the company should be operating out of Zimbabwe.
'We are developing our own plans. I still believe the company has potential
but it has been botched up by successive managements. It hasn't been
developed properly from its base in Africa,' he said.

<TEXT>
FIVE assembly plants in North America including two that were rumoured to be
on GM's 'hit list', will remain open at least until 1995, Reuter reports
from Detroit.
GM officials told almost 18,000 employees affected by the decision that
plants in Doraville, Georgia, Fairfax, Kansas, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and
two facilities in Oshawa, Ontario, will get new products to keep them open
until 1995. The Doraville and Fairfax plants were two locations that
industry experts predicted GM would close as part of its massive
restructuring plan announced last December.
GM said the Doraville facility, near Atlanta, will convert operations in the
summer of 1995 in order to build the company's next generation of minivans
for the 1996 model year.
It said the announcement does not protect the five plants from future
closings. 'That's still an open question.'

FT  20 AUG 92 / Hawkers against hedonism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATE President Calvin Coolidge once said: 'The business of America is
business.' Mr Coolidge was a Republican.
This entrepreneurial thinking is much in evidence at the American Spirit
Pavilion, a hall next door this week to the convention site, where traders
hawk a great range of political paraphernalia, leftward leanings excluded.
The most popular items, of course, are things to be pinned or put on. The
pins, buttons and T-shirts this year are deeply derisive of Governor Bill
Clinton, who is portrayed as a womanising, draft-dodging scoundrel.
But negativity does not rule the whole roost. One trader said his
hottest-selling button was a pink badge reading: 'Year of the Woman '92',
price Dollars 1. Be that as it may, one of the more noticeable buttons at
the convention itself says: 'If Hillary Can't Trust Him, How Can We?'
For the erudite, a publisher in the pavilion is offering the best-selling
'Millie's Book', Barbara Bush's diary of the White House's most renowned dog
(Dollars 9.75 paperback, Dollars 17.95 hardback).
Another hot book is 'What's Cooking With The Republicans' (Dollars 9.98),
which is full of GOP luminaries' favourite dishes. Vice-President Dan Quayle
reveals his romantic strain with Shrimp and Wine Spaghetti Sauce for Two.
The right-wing Congressman Newt Gingrich, the 'Georgia Bulldog' himself,
shares his Newt's Fruit concoction.
Supping across the party divide for a change, there's 'What's Cooking with
the Democrats', featuring the secret recipe for Beer Roast provided by the
former House Speaker Mr 'Tip' O'Neil, an Irish-American liberal whom
Republicans still love to hate.
The Republicans say they won the Cold War, and they have brought back
trophies: Next to pieces of the Berlin Wall (Dollars 5 a time), there is a
classic Russian Matrushka doll - for Dollars 125, the lucky consumer can
discover, one within another, the last five Republican presidents in the
same doll. Even Richard Nixon is included, but can be found nowhere else in
Houston, except as a facemask on some demonstrators.
Succeeding convention sessions so far have been less eventful than the
first, but wordsmiths still can find plenty to chew on.
The trick is to come up with as many turns of phrase to describe Democratic
profligacy as possible and not sound redundant. Governor Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin punched home: 'The only change the Democrats want is the change in
your pocket.'
Mr Gingrich, the House whip, wields a broader brush. He blamed not only high
taxes but also violent crime, decadent moral values, the welfare state,
Fidel Castro, and declining competitiveness on Democratic 'multi-cultural
nihilistic hedonism.'

STRONGER controls on those who park illegally or without permission are
being considered by the government because of concern at the behaviour of
groups such as travellers, Sir George Young, housing and planning minister,
said yesterday.
The proposals include making it a criminal offence to park a caravan on any
land without the landowner's consent, and giving local authorities powers to
tow away illegally parked caravans and seize caravans as an alternative to
fines in the last resort.
Local authorities would no longer be obliged to provide caravan sites for
gypsies. Travellers in England and Wales would have to acquire land for
sites and apply for planning permission in the normal way.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Former oil chief and his wife found dead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER executive of an oil and gas group who shared in one of the biggest
post-takeover payments in British corporate history has been discovered
drowned after apparently battering his wife to death, Jimmy Burns writes.
Police yesterday named the dead man as Mr David Elton, a 48-year-old former
executive director of Ultramar, which was bought by Lasmo after a
three-month Pounds 1.1bn takeover battle last December.
Mr Elton's body was found on Monday morning floating in the sea, a few miles
from his second home in Middleton-on-Sea, West Sussex. Police had earlier
discovered the body of Mr Elton's 43-year-old wife Jane at the house. She
had died from head wounds.
Police said last night that Mrs Elton's death was being treated as murder,
but that following the discovery of Mr Elton's body they were not looking
for anyone else in connection with the murder.
Mr Elton resigned from the Ultramar board in January. Within days Lasmo
announced that he and six other former directors would share an Pounds 8.1m
pay-out, including a top-up to their pension funds. The package included
Pounds 4.8m for termination of contracts, and Pounds 1.9m for pension
contributions.
Mr Elton was thought to be under stress after the takeover and the death of
his mother.

FT  19 AUG 92 / 4-year high in core jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of long-term unemployed, those out of work for more than a year,
rose 64,000 in the quarter to July to 905,000, the highest level since July
1988.
The government, however, said it saw 'grounds for cautious optimism' because
the rate of increase was slower than in the previous two quarters. It also
pointed out that the total was 452,000 lower than the peak in April 1986.
The long-term unemployed now form one third of the total unemployed, with
the largest percentage increases in long-term unemployment in the
south-east, south-west and East Anglia.
In the south-east excluding London the figure has risen 276 per cent since
July 1990, and in Greater London it has risen 139 per cent.
The number of very long-term unemployed  - those without jobs for more than
five years  - continues to fall and is at its lowest level since October
1984.
Among those aged 18 to 24, long-term unemployment is up by 16,500 to 184,700
 - the highest level since January 1988  - but it remains about half of what
it was at its peak in January 1985. Ministers also say that the UK
unemployment rate for under 25s, at 17 per cent, is below the EC average of
18.4 per cent.
In the light of the figures the Labour party and unemployment pressure
groups warned the government not to pursue the idea, rumoured to be under
discussion in Whitehall, of cutting unemployment benefit from one year to
six months. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said that such a
move would now hurt 586,000 people. He also urged Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, to resist cuts in training budgets.
'When she meets the Treasury, instead of offering them cuts in training she
should remind them that every person unemployed for a year costs the
taxpayer Pounds 9,000,' said Mr Dobson. 'She should remind them that if it
wasn't for the Pounds 24bn price that the taxpayer is having to pay for
unemployment they'd need no cuts at all this autumn.'
The Unemployment Unit, the pressure group, said that the government was
preparing to 'abandon' the long-term unemployed.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Writ over home-income plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 27 elderly investors who bought home-income plans through
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society have issued a writ against the
society asking for mortgages with it to be set aside and for payment for
distress and suffering.
Mr Peter Stafford, of Harrison Clark, the Worcester firm of solicitors which
issued the writ, said he expected a further 160 investors to add their names
to the writ when it came before the High Court.
'This is the first multi-party action arising from a home-income plan and we
expect that it will arouse considerable interest,' Mr Stafford said.
The claims arise from the collapse of Aylesbury Associates, a firm of
financial advisers which offered a plan for elderly people to borrow against
the value of their homes and invest the proceeds in equity-linked bonds. The
bonds were intended to provide income as well as to service the loan. When
the scheme collapsed, investors were left with large debts and some had to
sell their homes.
Former clients of the scheme can claim up to Pounds 48,000 from the
Investors Compensation Scheme, and C&amp;G has promised some top-up payments for
investors if they qualify under ICS rules, although it denies liability and
says investors got into trouble because of advice by Aylesbury.
The society said yesterday that it had not yet received the writ from
Harrison Clark and could not comment on it. 'We have done everything we can
and it is up to the ICS to start payments,' it said. 'We don't see what
serving a writ will do to speed up the ICS payments.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Abu Dhabi still bitter about BCCI closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 12 months after the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, Abu Dhabi, its biggest shareholder and creditor, is feeling
confident enough to face direct questions about its role.
Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, a member of the working group established by the
majority shareholders to negotiate with Touche Ross, the liquidators, has
emerged as the emirate's spokesman at time when both Abu Dhabi and Touche
Ross are anxious to obtain the support of creditors for the Dollars 1.7bn
(Pounds 880m) compensation agreement they negotiated over eight months.
Yesterday he gave his first interview. It was at an informal lunch, although
he was flanked by two lawyers, at the London offices of Simmons and Simmons
which acts for the majority shareholders.
Mr al-Sayegh, a director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil company, said the
emirate was fully committed to the compensation deal. 'We believe the
contribution package is a fair agreement,' he said. 'No one else has come up
with a viable alternative. We hope the depositors when consulted feel the
same way.'
He said that Mr Brian Smouha, the Touche Ross accountant in overall charge
of the liquidation, had been a tough bargainer who had won the respect and
co-operation of the working group.
'We decided not to walk away from Mr Smouha,' Mr al-Sayegh said. 'If we had
decided to walk away from him we could have made his life difficult, but we
didn't walk away. We decided to work with him because we decided it was in
the best interests of the depositors and creditors.' Abu Dhabi had already
sought to help depositors by working with the Bank of England on the interim
compensation scheme.
He pointed out that Abu Dhabi had paid for professional councillors for
those BCCI employees in the UK who had lost their jobs in the closure. More
than 50 per cent of those put out of work had found new jobs.
It was clear the emirate remains bitter about the way BCCI was closed after
restructuring negotiations had reached an advanced stage. Mr al-Sayegh said
that before the closure in July last year BCCI had been a 'valuable asset
with a new owner, new management and new capital'. He added: 'I still think
that if it was not for the closure we could have still operated the bank.'
He admitted that Abu Dhabi had been told in April 1990 by Mr Swaleh Naqvi,
the former chief executive of BCCI, that deposits belonging to Sheikh Zayed
al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates,
had been misappropriated, but said that this did not amount to a confession.
'We didn't get evidence for this, we didn't get records, we didn't get
anything.' He said that Mr Naqvi at that time had lacked credibility.
Mr Naqvi is among 17 senior Abu Dhabi executives detained in Abu Dhabi since
the closure. Formal charges have yet to be laid, but preliminary charges of
fraud have been laid against 14 of the men. Mr al-Sayegh hinted that it
would take some years to bring a case to court. 'It took four years in
Guinness to bring a case, which is much simpler than in BCCI.'
He stressed that Abu Dhabi was committed to presenting a case. 'We are the
biggest victims, we have lost billions of dollars, our laws have been
violated, our reputation has been damaged, so we cannot let this pass
without proper investigation or a proper prosecution.'
He added: 'We are going to go after everybody who has conned us.'

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US HOUSING starts fell unexpectedly for a second month in a row in July, the
Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The annual rate of starts declined by 2.8 per cent last month to a
seasonally adjusted 1.12m units. Wall Street economists had expected a
slight rise in construction activity.
The Commerce Department, which previously said housing starts in June had
fallen by 3.2 per cent, also issued a revised figure of 3.8 per cent.
June and July were exceptionally rainy months in the US, which hurt
construction activity. But interest rates for home mortgages are at their
lowest levels since the early 1970s, and that may benefit builders in coming
months.
The fall-off in July was widespread, with only the south reporting a slight
rise in starts on homes. Activity weakened in the northeast, the midwest and
the west. But overall, the July starts level was 10.2 per cent higher than
the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 971,000 units in July 1991.
The US economy has been recovering so weakly that consumers remain reluctant
to spend. In July the Federal Reserve slashed its trend-setting discount
rate to 3 per cent, the lowest since 1963.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bush faces tough transition to domestic warrior
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ronald Reagan, the Republican party's elder statesman, devoted most of
his address on Monday night to familiar themes  - such as his faith in the
greatness of the American people and his single-handed defeat of communism.
But the final few paragraphs were more revealing.
Speaking of the 'great task we have to do together in our own home' Mr
Reagan called for a host of social reforms. Let us 'pledge ourselves to a
new beginning' for those 'who languish in neighbourhoods riddled with crime
and bereft of hope'. Let us 'revolutionise education' so that everyone 'will
have the mental tools to build a better life'. Let us 'strengthen our health
care system so that Americans of all ages can be secure in their futures
without the fear of financial ruin'.
He was faithfully broadcasting what is intended as the central message of
this convention: having won the cold war and brought hope to millions
overseas, President George Bush and the Republican party are now about to
'target America' and address social problems. The question for voters is
whether Mr Bush has the will or the ideas to make a difference at home.
The sight of Mr Reagan, 81, finally climbing aboard the domestic reform
bandwagon was not entirely reassuring. It raises an awkward question: why
have three Republican administrations achieved so little in domestic policy
in 12 years? Claiming preoccupation with foreign affairs for all this time
is not credible.
The usual excuse is that the Democratic Congress stymied reform. But it is
likely that the party will have an even bigger majority in Congress after
November.
If Mr Bush is to appear competitive on domestic policy, he needs to set out
a crystal-clear agenda for reform in tomorrow's acceptance speech and then
win a decisive election victory. Faced with such a presidential mandate for
change, Congress would feel obliged to co-operate.
It is not as though the Bush administration has had no ideas for domestic
reforms. Pressure of events has forced policy pronouncements. Mounting
concern about the low quality of education led to last year's 'America 2000'
educational initiative, which advocates a new national testing system as
well as greater parental choice of schools.
Democratic Senator Harris Wofford's surprise win in a Pennsylvania Senate
race led to an 11th hour Bush plan for reforming health care. The full
details are still not available but it centres on tax credits (up to Dollars
3,750 a year per family) to help poor people buy private health insurance as
well as generous tax relief on health policies for the middle classes.
Many other ideas, including reform of the legal and welfare systems, form
part of the conservative policy platform debated by delegates in yesterday's
sessions.
In trying to make the transition from cold war to domestic warrior, however,
Mr Bush faces severe handicaps. One is the sense that he only proposes
reforms when they seem politically unavoidable. How, for example, does he
justify waiting three years to unveil a health care reform when the
principal problems  - 35m people without insurance and an uncontrolled
escalation of costs  - have been known for a decade?
Another handicap is the piecemeal nature of the proposed reforms  - the lack
of any over-arching theme. Had Mr Bush listened to conservative advisers he
might have made a splash with an innovative, libertarian approach to social
policy, emphasising the importance of individual 'empowerment'.
But he failed to do so, and Governor Bill Clinton has already moved to
occupy part of that fertile ground by using the code word empowerment in his
own acceptance speech.
In Houston, Republicans seek to emphasise the 'experience gap' separating
the candidates. Mr Bush is to be trusted, said Mr Reagan, because he has
'been at the table with Gorbachev and Yeltsin'.
Yet if domestic rather than foreign policy is now the principal battle
ground, the advantage may lie with Mr Clinton; having served 11 years as a
state governor he is as fluent on education and health care as Mr Bush is on
the UN or arms control.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Nafta sets Mexico on the path to industrial unrest: A push
to raise productivity prompts a union backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long, costly company lock-out at Mexico's Volkswagen plant, and a strike
by 22,000 textile workers, may herald increasing confrontation between
Mexican management and unions as they prepare for free trade in North
America.
Both disputes are partly over management attempts to introduce new, flexible
work practices. While managers are struggling to improve productivity to
compete with North American rivals, union leaders are guarding work
practices that maintain their power over management and sometimes over their
own members.
Although the VW strike looked to have been resolved yesterday, the recipe
for strife could be repeated as more companies face up to the consequences
of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), putting President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's government in an awkward position.
It has strongly supported the business sector over the past three years, and
undoubtedly shares the goal of boosting productivity. The administration
was, for example, almost certainly behind Monday's decision by the Federal
Conciliation and Arbitration Board to cancel VW's collective contract with
the unions, letting the company dismiss dissident workers at will and
re-hire on its own terms.
The company said yesterday that the majority of workers were already
returning to work after management reached agreement with official union
leaders to re-hire practically all workers under new labour conditions.
The apparent quashing of the dispute will send a powerful signal to workers
and unions to accept new working practices, or face the consequences.
However, Mr Salinas is still treading carefully, as he cannot afford an open
break with the official union sector, represented by the 3m-strong
Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM). The CTM and its all-powerful
nonagenarian chief, Mr Fidel Velazquez, backs the ruling party in elections,
supplies crowds for political rallies and, above all, suppresses wage
demands from its own members. Were the government to break with the CTM,
there would undoubtedly be an outbreak of labour trouble.
The government has thus pursued a cautious labour strategy, trying not to
upset the union or business sector. It has cracked down on older, corrupt
union leaders while encouraging the rise of more 'modern' ones, such as Mr
Francisco Hernandez Huarez, the telephone workers' chief.
But it has done nothing to revise the country's outdated federal labour law,
responsible for many of the costly, inefficient labour practices, in
deference to Mr Velazquez.
The dispute at VW reveals what is at stake. The group is the leading seller
of cars in Mexico, and a principal foreign investor. Its workers are also
among the best paid, and its work practices the most rigid in the car
sector, partly because workers are represented by a relatively independent
union.
Nafta has forced VW to take a tough stand with its union, provoking the
dispute. Under the trade agreement the company will be vulnerable to imports
of US-made cars aimed at the lower end of the market, which VW dominates.
Nafta also forces VW to meet higher North American content rules, to be able
to export tariff-free to the US. The company is thus bringing about 40
German parts producers to set up shop in Mexico. It hopes to introduce
'just-in-time' inventory methods with these producers, which would require
changes in work practices.
In early July VW appeared to have scored a victory when the official union
leaders accepted Japanese-style work groups and promotion schemes based on
merit rather than seniority, already common practice in the 'Big Three'
US-owned car plants in Mexico.
But soon after this a dissident faction in the union, apparently backed by
most workers, went on strike, claiming not to have been informed about
details of the new contract. The dissident workers, apart from wanting to
take over the union, were concerned that new work practices would diminish
the power of shop stewards in the plant, according to Mr Huberto Juarez
Nunez, a professor at the Autonomous University of Puebla.
Similar disputes in CTM-controlled factories have often been suppressed by
Mr Velazquez, underscoring his value to the government. But the cost of this
support is high: the administration is unable to overturn the federal labour
law.
The law makes it costly to dismiss staff, difficult to hire temporary
workers, and illegal to break strikes by taking on non-union workers and, by
permitting closed-shops, forces companies to sack workers who are expelled
from the official union.
'A change in the federal law', says Mr Carlos Fernandez del Real, legal
adviser to the dissident VW union faction, 'would hurt the power of the
charros (union chiefs), and limit their power to control the workers.'
Mr Salinas seems to hope the CTM will be replaced by modern, but supportive,
unions such as Mr Hernandez's telephone workers. This largely depends on Mr
Velazquez bowing out soon.
However, Mr Velazquez, who turned 92 in April and has run the union for 51
years, likes to remind people that his mother lived to 100.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Republicans direct their vitriol at Clintons: Jurek Martin,
at the party's convention in Houston, spots a campaign trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush, proclaiming himself revived in spirit and 'feeling
positive', is promising to pull no punches in his re-election campaign
against Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic party's nominee.
To that end, yesterday morning's session of the Republican convention was
treated to another invocation of the low blow that so damaged Mr Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate, four years ago.
Mr Dan Lungren, attorney-general of California, said in a speech on crime
that 'the Democratic icon of righteous indignation' consisted of two words
 -Willie Horton. He specifically linked Mr Clinton with Mr Dukakis's
supposed leniency towards the convicted criminal, which featured in
effective, but controversial, Republican commercials in 1988.
There were reports Mr Lungren had come under pressure to excise his comments
about Willie Horton and Mr Bush continues to insist he will engage in no
personal attacks. But the new sharpness in his own tongue combined with the
licence given to his surrogates gives a clear idea of the future direction
of the campaign.
Both Mr and Mrs Clinton are considered fair game. The litany against the
Democratic candidate is that he is 'the failed governor of a small state'
and thus unqualified to be president. His failure to serve in the military
in the Vietnam era will be repeatedly contrasted with Mr Bush's war record.
Armed with an incisive new speechwriter, Mr Bush is also developing some
good new punchlines.
Dismissing Mr Clinton's claim to be the comeback kid, he proclaimed 'we're
running against the karaoke kids, willing to follow any tune, like customers
at a singalong bar, to help them get elected'.
The charge against Mrs Hillary Clinton, given full airing by Mr Patrick
Buchanan on Monday night, is that she is a radical feminist with no
appreciation of true American values. Again the contrast will be made with
Mrs Barbara Bush, who is to address the convention tonight, in an unusual
departure for a president's wife.
But Mr Clinton scoffed yesterday at Mr Bush's claim he would make as big a
comeback in this election campaign as Harry Truman did in 1948.
'Harry Truman at least tried to take responsibility for the country. George
Bush blames everybody else for his problems,' Mr Clinton said. 'Truman had a
sign on his desk that said: 'The buck stops here.' Bush has a sign on his
administration that says: 'The buck stops everywhere else'.'
Undaunted, Mr Bush yesterday boldly told TV viewers that the US was 'poised
for very strong economic growth'.
'I think you are going to see a rather blooming economy,' he said
expansively, adding he would make a 'lot of changes' in top administration
personnel if he won a second term. He also wanted to accomplish change 'on
education, health care and the whole anti-crime and anti-drug front.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Opening-day triumph for party's right wing: Houston may be
seeing the birth of a new strain of conservatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN this election is dead and buried, conservatives may well conclude that
there never was a finer day than Monday August 17 in Houston, Texas.
By mid-morning, abortion rights activists had conceded they could not change
the Republican party platform; shortly after midday the convention had
approved that platform, a testament to conservative ideology; in
mid-afternoon the faithful and the vice-president gathered together in a
'God and Country' rally, unabashed in its religious patriotism.
But the evening was the climax, as first Mr Patrick Buchanan and then Mr
Ronald Reagan, present and past guardians of the flame, provided the verbal
red meat that conservatives believe President George Bush must consume every
day if he is to win re-election in November.
It was the sort of day designed to banish the party's Doubting Thomases and
political professionals who have problems with the notion that 1992 can be a
repeat of the great conservative victories of 1980 and 1984, and even 1988.
It was the sort of triumphal day that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
candidate, never allowed Democratic liberals at his convention last month.
Former President Reagan, in particular, did his part in a near-vintage
performance that made light of the fact that the vast Astrodome is a tough
arena in which even the most skilled public speaker finds problems.
His was a message of endorsement of Mr Bush 'warmly, genuinely,
wholeheartedly'; of excoriation of the Democrats  - 'to hear them talk you'd
never know that the nightmare of nuclear annihilation has been lifted from
our sleep'; and, very typically, of hope for the future.
He ended what may well have been his valedictory address to a Republican
convention much as he had begun his own quest for the presidency, with the
words: 'May every dawn be a great new beginning for America and every
evening bring us closer to that shining city upon a hill.'
Mr Buchanan's speech was as much an encomium to Mr Reagan as anything else,
though his endorsement of Mr Bush, whom he had challenged in the primaries
in uncompromising terms, was all that the president could have expected.
Its biting partisanship was conspicuous. 'There is a religious war going on
in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to
the kind of nation we will one day be as was the cold war itself. And in
that struggle Clinton and Clinton are on the other side and George Bush is
on our side.'
He savaged Mrs Hillary Clinton as the epitome of radical feminism and damned
Mr Clinton for dodging the draft. Repeatedly invoking religious themes, he
insisted that the Clintons' agenda 'is not the kind of change we can
tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country'.
The jam-packed 'God and Country' rally, presided over by the Rev Pat
Robertson, the television evangelist/businessman and one-time presidential
aspirant, with Vice President Dan Quayle in attendance, had heard much more
of the same. Mr Robertson even allowed himself some musings, replete with
biblical quotations, that Mr Clinton was under the illusion that he was the
second Messiah.
The religious right has been widely dismissed as a fading political force,
weighed down by Mr Robertson's own failure in 1988, assorted scandals and
the general decline in influence of the 'moral majority' lobby of the Rev
Jerry Falwell. None of the leading items on its agenda  - an outright ban on
abortion, help for religious education, mandatory prayer in schools, legal
proscriptions against homosexuality, keeping women out of combat roles in
the military  - are on the federal statute books.
But the 60m Americans who profess themselves to be fundamentalists of
differing sorts are a political market no candidate can ignore. Mr Clinton
is not shy about professing his Baptist faith, quotes frequently from the
Bible and called his social policy proposals the New Covenant. Senator Al
Gore, his running mate, was much influenced by his religious education at an
exclusive private school in Washington.
Mr Bush's private doubts about religious absolutism have been well recorded,
but for political purposes there is no doubt that he sees Mr Robertson and
his cohorts as useful allies.
There are other elements of the conservative agenda which make Mr Bush and
the reviving band of Republican moderates profoundly uncomfortable. Though
he diplomatically did not raise it in his speech, Mr Buchanan, under the
protectionist 'America first' banner, has never retracted his demand that a
fence be erected along the southern US border to keep Mexicans out.
More serious in policy terms is the debate over tax cutting, a petard on
which Mr Bush, who broke his notorious 'read my lips, no new taxes' promise
of 1988 two short years later, is now thoroughly hoist. To conservatives,
the president's repetition of the mantra of a balanced budget amendment and
line item veto is simply not enough, even though Mr Reagan on Monday night
faithfully endorsed both.
It is possible this convention is present at the birth of a new strain of
conservatism, whose most interesting advocate is Governor William Weld of
Massachusetts. This combines conservative orthodoxy on tax-cutting with an
almost libertarian approach to social issues, including no restrictions on
abortion and no discrimination against homosexuality.
But Mr Weld could not put together enough votes on Monday to challenge the
party platform on abortion, indicating his time has not yet come. Indeed,
the way the cards were stacked on the opening day of the convention neither
God nor James Baker, were either of the mind, could have changed the script.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Impeachment case against Collor 'inevitable'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IMPEACHMENT proceedings against Brazil's President Fernando Collor are
'inevitable', the head of a congressional inquiry into the country's growing
corruption scandal said yesterday.
Mr Benito Gama heads a commission investigating charges of
influence-peddling and corruption against Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, a
businessman who was Mr Collor's campaign treasurer.
Congress will use the investigators' findings, to be published this weekend,
when considering whether to begin impeachment proceedings. A two-thirds vote
by the 503-member lower house of Congress is needed for proceedings to
begin.
The head of a parallel inquiry, investigating Mr Farias' alleged involvement
in the privatisation of the airline Vasp, asked for the businessman's
preventive detention. Federal Deputy Nilson Gibson said his commission had
uncovered sufficient evidence against Mr Farias on charges of corruption,
tax evasion and influence-peddling to warrant the request.
Mr Farias admitted to the commission that he had lent money to Mr Wagner
Canhedo, who purchased the airline from the state of Sao Paulo in 1990.
Brazil's drastic experiment aimed at ending inflation ended quietly this
week  - and economists judged it a resounding failure, Reuter reports from
Rio de Janeiro.
President Collor astonished Brazil when, the day after taking office in
March 1990, he froze most of the country's liquid assets overnight in a
once-and-for-all effort to beat inflation.
Everyone with bank deposits worth more than Dollars 1,250 (Pounds 655) was
told that the government had 'borrowed' their money and would not give it
back for 18 months. The central bank estimates that Dollars 45.7bn was
sucked out of the economy at a stroke.
The 'Collor plan' left citizens penniless, threw the economy into chaos,
enraged companies and helped cause one of the country's worst recessions,
but failed to kill inflation.
As the government paid back the final instalment of the money on Monday, no
one was celebrating. After an initial dip to 3.3 per cent a month, inflation
quickly bounced back and is now running close to 25 per cent a month.

<TEXT>
THE Democrats are present at their rivals' convention in Houston, both in
body and spirit. Democratic national chairman Ron Brown and Betsey Wright, a
leading aide to Bill Clinton, are here, providing a running commentary and
instant reaction to events on the floor for television.
In addition the party plans to counter Republican attacks on Mr Clinton with
two television ads. 'And now a short break for the facts,' the announcer
says in one. 'On November 5 1990, George Bush signed the second-biggest tax
increase in American history. Under Bill Clinton, Arkansas has the
second-lowest tax burden per person in the country. Those are the facts.
Back to the show.'
Republicans were fuming that TV the night before had not broken into its
regular coverage  - one network was into an update of the Woody Allen/Mia
Farrow drama  - to broadcast live Mr Bush's punchy arrival in Houston. But
the party had only itself to blame for running a loose schedule on Monday
night. That meant Ronald Reagan only got to his feet well after prime time
in the eastern half of the country. Some wags even said he appeared after
his bedtime in California.
Larry Bird, the Boston Celtics basketball star, yesterday announced that
back injuries had forced his retirement, an important enough piece of news
for CNN to interrupt its convention coverage and get an instant reaction
from Vice-President Dan Quayle, whom it was interviewing at the time.
The convention features a programme for foreign visitors, largely comprising
conservative politicians. Not all, it seems, have taken a vow of diplomatic
silence. One British politician was positively unrestrained at a lunch
addressed by Jack Kemp, housing secretary. He kept shouting out 'Kemp in
'96'. Sadly for those wanting to know his identity, British backbenchers are
not exactly familiar faces for foreign correspondents.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S decision last night to contribute six Tornado aircraft to the
multinational forces ranged against President Saddam Hussein in the Gulf is
a political gesture appreciated in Washington but one which makes little
difference to the balance of forces in the region.
The Royal Air Force performed bravely during the Gulf war and suffered
relatively heavy losses as the Tornados initially pressed home low-level
attacks on well-defended Iraqi targets. The six aircraft being sent this
week will probably be again based in Bahrain, although on this occasion
their primary role appears more likely to be surveillance and interdiction.
The US military presence in the Gulf is massive and it will be on American
forces and equipment that the overwhelming burden of the operation will
fall.
According to latest Pentagon statistics the US has 19 ships in the Gulf,
headed by the aircraft carrier Independence, the command vessel LaSalle,
three cruisers, one destroyer, two frigates, six support ships and five
amphibious craft.
No precise figures are provided for aircraft but those based in Saudi Arabia
and on the Independence are known to exceed 200. They provide a range of
options for military commanders and include the F-117 Stealth fighters,
which are supposed to be almost invisible to radar, the F-14 and F-15e,
Awacs surveillance aircraft and the A-10 'tank-busters' that inflicted such
heavy damage on Iraqi armoured concentrations during the final days of the
Gulf war.
In addition the US has ground forces exercising in Kuwait with the 2,800
marines already there due to be augmented soon by 2,400 regular troops. The
Pentagon said yesterday that its military personnel in the Gulf totalled
23,800. Mr Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, added he did not believe
there were any immediate plans to augment those forces.
Once the exclusion zone is officially announced  - probably via a letter
from the US, Britain and France to Iraq's ambassador at the UN - any of
Saddam Hussein's fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters flying south of the 32nd
parallel can expect to be attacked.
Iraq's pilots have not in the past been anxious to risk their aircraft in
combat and there is even less reason this time to believe that they will
challenge the allies. During the eight-year war with Iran, Mr Saddam made
relatively little use of his overwhelming air superiority, reserving it
mainly to attack shipping in the Gulf and fly the occasional high-level
mission over Tehran.
Soon after the outbreak of the Gulf war last year the Iraqi leader ordered
dozens of his front-line aircraft to flee to Iran, where many of them
remain. However, in recent weeks it has been evident to the US that Iraqi
training flights have been increasing, although probably fewer than 100
aircraft are serviceable. While they would be no match for US and British
aircraft, it is their potential role in attacking Shia rebels that the
exclusion zone is meant to prevent.
There have been recent, if limited, cases of helicopter gunships and the
occasional fixed-wing aircraft attacking rebel positions in the marshes area
north of Basra. US officials believe that without a firm western response,
the number of sorties flown by Mr Saddam's air force would have steadily
increased.
However military analysts acknowledge that there is a limited scope for
aircraft to protect the Shia insurgents, without extending the exclusion
zone to include movements of armour and troops. President George Bush
remains anxious to avoid being sucked in further to the Iraqi quagmire, but
the collapse of the Iraqi regime remains the US objective.
Mr Paul Ride, 33, a Briton who disappeared in the Kuwaiti desert in
unexplained circumstances seven weeks ago, was understood to be 'well' in a
Baghdad jail, the Foreign Office said yesterday, writes David Owen in
London. He vanished in June while travelling between two of his employer's
offices in northern Kuwait.

The Commonwealth will send a team of about a dozen prominent citizens to
help end violence in South Africa and facilitate renewed constitutional
negotiations, it was announced yesterday, Michael Holman, Africa Editor,
reports.
The groundwork for the Commonwealth role was carried out last month when
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary general, visited South
Africa for talks with political leaders.
During his visit Chief Anyaoku won government approval for a plan setting
out a Commonwealth contribution to the search for a political settlement.
Many of the elements, including the suggestion that there should be close
liaison with the country's National Peace Secretariat, an independent body
formed last year which monitors political violence, were taken up by Mr
Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to South Africa.
In response to his report, the Security Council has authorised stationing UN
observers in South Africa, expected to number around 30, to help end
township violence. The Organisation of African Unity and the European
Community are also expected to send teams.
Yesterday the South African government accepted the report, saying it would
welcome the stationing of observers in the country.

<TEXT>
JUST four days before the country's first legislative elections in 20 years
are scheduled to begin, the Lebanese cabinet will today discuss a petition
from five influential Christian parliamentarians that the elections be
postponed.
Opponents of the poll  - the majority of them Christians  - say the presence
of 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon will ensure the victory of pro-Syrian
candidates. Syria wants the poll to take place before the scheduled
withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon in September.
More than a dozen members of parliament this week announced that they were
withdrawing their candidacy, citing their wish 'to preserve national unity'.
They include Mr Tammam Salam, the eldest son of former Sunni Moslem Prime
Minister Saeb Salam, who has also spoken out against what he calls 'forced
elections'.
The deputies who petitioned President Elias Hrawi include Mr Fares Boueiz,
the Lebanese foreign minister, who is Mr Hrawi's son-in-law. Never before
has a Maronite president enjoyed so little support from his own religious
community.
Syria's Lebanese allies, including Prime Minister Rashid Solh, have insisted
that voting will begin as planned on August 23. But the divisive issue has
further undermined the ailing Lebanese economy and the decision of the
Christian Phalange party to boycott the poll has ensured that 700,000 of the
country's 2m eligible voters will not participate in the election.
A new legislature therefore risks having even less credibility than the
present assembly, which has repeatedly renewed its own mandate since 1972.

reports from Kabul. The 15-man peace team, sent by Nangarhar province
governor Abdul Qadeer, aims to talk to the Hezb-e-Islami and the coalition
government, rivals in nearly two weeks of fierce fighting around Kabul that
has left hundreds dead and forced tens of thousands to flee the city.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Australia unveils budget to boost growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday unveiled an expansionary budget
intended to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment before the
next election, due by mid-1993.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the
government would provide 'a strong but temporary stimulus' of ADollars 4.5bn
(Pounds 1.7bn) over the next two years to help create hundreds of thousands
of jobs. The stimulus will increase the budget deficit to ADollars 13.4bn in
the year to next July, compared with ADollars 9.3bn in 1991-92.
However, the budget contained few surprises. Most of the job-creation
programmes were announced earlier this year in a series of economic
statements following an 18-month recession.
Mr Dawkins said the economy would grow by only 3 per cent this year, in
spite of the proposed stimulus. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
forecast in February that growth would reach 4.75 per cent in 1992-1993.
Mr Dawkins said the slower-than-expected growth was due to drought, subdued
economic activity in many of Australia's main trading partners, and fragile
business confidence.
He said the weak recovery meant that unemployment was likely to remain above
the politically sensitive level of 10 per cent until June, the last possible
date for an election.
The current account deficit is forecast to increase from 3.1 per cent to 3.3
per cent of gross domestic product as imports grow in line with demand.
Inflation is expected to rise from 1.2 per cent to 3 per cent.
Mr Dawkins said the government would honour an earlier promise to cut income
tax by ADollars 8.6bn over several years, beginning in 1994. However, he
said the cuts might have to be balanced by increases in indirect taxes.
The government has abandoned plans announced in February to balance the
budget by 1996. Mr Dawkins said the deficit would be eliminated 'as soon as
possible'.
Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,
said the budget was 'reasonable and responsible'. The conservative
opposition called it 'a vote-buying spending spree'.
The financial markets reacted favourably to the budget, which was in line
with expectations. However, some economists said the government's revenue
forecasts were optimistic. The budget forecasts privatisation receipts of
ADollars 1.6bn, mostly from the sale of Qantas and Australian Airlines. The
government will also try to sell other assets, including its uranium
stockpile.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Sense of urgency catches up with Tokyo: Bank support
measures aim to ease selling pressure on the stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tsutomu Hata, Japan's finance minister, has come a long way by finally
admitting the extent of the gloom pervading the country's banking system. He
may well have had a long night waiting for reaction to the emergency package
he announced yesterday.
The bank support measures materialised after increasing pressure from
business leaders and continuing sharp declines on the stock market. Until
recently, the government had maintained a complacent stance towards troubles
in the banking sector and financial markets, denying that any real problems
existed.
However, in a complete turnaround, the Finance Ministry yesterday expressed
concern over the health of the Japanese banking system, acknowledging that
the banks faced the 'most severe situation since the second world war'.
Mr Hata's comments reflect the urgency of the rescue measures. The finance
minister said the measures were a part of the government's larger emergency
economic package to be announced this autumn but that an early announcement
had been favoured to increase the effectiveness of the assistance.
The aim of the measures is to introduce stability into the troubled banking
system in order that banks will be able to provide liquidity once the
economy recovers. However, the package is a temporary solution, including
some measures which could be seen as 'window dressing' of accounts.
However, the underlying aim is to support Japan's banks, and consequently
the stock and real estate markets, by reducing the pressure to sell stock
holdings. Profits would be shored up and the squeeze on credit eased by
requesting banks to ease internal rules on property-related loans and
providing banks with new means to raise capital. This would be achieved by
the following means:
The ministry will ask banks not to sell stock holdings to realise gains in
order to shore up interim term profits for the six months to September. Mr
Hata said the ministry wanted banks to break the 'vicious circle' where
stock selling by banks to realise profits on holdings erodes unrealised
gains on share investments, and creates the further need to raise profits by
selling shares. To lift rules limiting the payout of dividends to 40 per
cent of net profits, in order to ease pressure on banks to raise profits.
To allow banks to switch accounting measures where stocks can be carried at
cost, and evaluation losses on share holdings could be reported separately
from the profit and loss statements.
To request banks to ease internal restrictions on real estate lending, thus
ensuring the flow of funds necessary for a healthy economy.
To ensure that the banks meet the capital requirements set by the Bank for
International Settlements by introducing new capital-raising instruments,
such as perpetual subordinated loans.
To enhance securitisation of loans by allowing banks to break up loan assets
into small lot securities.
To study ways to eliminate non-performing debts at non-bank financial
institutions including housing loan companies.
To study ways to activate the stagnating real estate market, thus enabling
banks to sell property held as collateral.
To help banks dispose of their problem loans smoothly, including providing
tax incentives.
To disclose the amount of problem loans at the banks at the end of the
current fiscal year, using new, broader standards. For the coming interim
term to September, however, the ministry will disclose the banks' bad loans
by applying the former standard, where only loans on which interest has not
been paid for six months or more are considered non-performing.
To enhance further deregulation of the financial system and to urge banks to
increase rationalisation efforts.
Japanese bankers welcomed the ministry's proposals, and Mr Tsuneo Wakai,
chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, said he
considered the measures appropriate, adding that the banking industry would
do its best to ensure stability in the financial system.
Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, also
expressed the hope that the measures would help wipe out concerns about the
banking system. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
said that the ministry's steps would be effective in lifting share prices.
While Mr Hata acknowledged that the proposals offered only temporary
solutions, based on the assumption that the Japanese economy and stock
market would recover at the end of the fiscal year to March, he expressed
his confidence of an upturn in both areas. 'The economic support measures
will support the economy, and in effect wipe out uncertainty towards share
prices.'
However, this view is not shared by many economists who forecast a delayed
economic recovery. Also, the stock market still fears that the Nikkei could
fall by a further 1,000 to 2,000 points, to as low as 12,000.

FT  19 AUG 92 / US to begin airlift to dying Somalis: Aid official says
operation may run out of food within 14 days
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED STATES military aircraft and personnel continued arriving in Kenya
yesterday in preparation for the start tomorrow of the biggest airlift of
food so far to millions of Somalis facing death from starvation.
Reflecting the new-found urgency with which the Bush administration is
treating the 'world's worse humanitarian disaster', at least 11 aircraft and
between 250 and 300 military personnel will have arrived in Kenya by
tomorrow evening, five days after President Bush gave the green light for an
operation called 'Provide Relief'.
Many of the aircraft are flying 20 hours non-stop from military bases in the
US and are having to be refueled twice in mid-air. Kenyan officials
yesterday complained that the US had only told them it was sending military
aircraft to their territory after the first one landed on Monday.
US relief officials in Kenya also appear to have been caught off guard by
the speed with which the US has mobilised forces for the operation, which
could eventually cost more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 105m). One senior aid
official said yesterday that the aircraft might run out of food and have to
be grounded until more food arrived at the port of Mombasa. At the moment
there are 11,000 tonnes of food available for the airlift  - an amount which
could be exhausted in two weeks if the aircraft work around the clock.
Brig Gen Frank Libutti, commander of the joint task force, said in Mombasa
yesterday that the airlift would get under way tomorrow, lifting the 11,000
tonnes of food to Wajir, in north-eastern Kenya. The food will initially be
distributed to 300,000 Somali refugees who fled to Kenya. Later the food
will be trucked across the border into Somalia to prevent further refugees
pouring into Kenya. Food will also be distributed to an estimated 700,000
drought-hit Kenyans.
Gen Libutti said his task force, composed of personnel from the air force,
army, navy and marine corps, would evaluate the security and condition of
airstrips in Somalia and would work in close collaboration with aid agencies
already on the ground.
Mr Fred Fisher, the head of USAID, said that 145,000 tonnes of food pledged
by the US for Somalia and Kenya last week was for fiscal year 1993, which
begins on October 1. The first shipments from this pledge could not be
expected to arrive in Mombasa for at least two to three months. US aid
officials were trying to exchange some of this pledged amount for food
already held by other aid agencies, he said. Reuter adds from Washington: At
least a quarter of all Somali children under the age of five are believed to
have died as a result of famine and civil strife, US officials and aid
organisation leaders said yesterday. .
'One-fourth of all children under five are estimated to have perished
already,' said Mr Peter Davies of Interaction, a coalition of 135 relief
organisations working in Somalia.

GERMAN Environment Minister Klaus Topfer yesterday presented a draft

Under the draft, German motorists would be entitled to return their old cars
and lorries free of charge to their dealer for disposal or recycling.
The ministry said the regulation, which must still be approved by the
cabinet, would apply to German as well as foreign manufacturers selling
vehicles in Germany. About 2.6m cars are scrapped annually there, most
ending up in crushing plants.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bosnian winter will place 2m at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bitterly cold winters which sweep across the Balkan peninsula will claim
the lives of many more people in Bosnia-Hercegovina unless conditions
rapidly improve in the former Yugoslav republic, officials from the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday.
The people most affected will be the thousands held in detentions camps, but
as many as 2m people in the Bosnian war zone could be at risk.
'Not only is there massive destruction of buildings but there are no windows
left,' said Mr Charles Lamuniere, director of the UN department of
Humanitarian Affairs.
'So when those winds start blowing  - you know, Sarajevo is in a valley and
the wind will start blowing  - people will die of cold, water will freeze.'
Mr Lamuniere said he was particularly concerned about those prisoners in
detention camps. He specifically referred to 3,000 Moslem men he saw in the
Serbian-run camp at Manjaca, northern Bosnia. He said the detainees were
forced to sleep on cold concrete floors.
Ms Sylvana Foa, of UNHCR said that about 200 homes were being destroyed
every day. 'We're really worried about everyone in the war zone. That's
about 2m pople. Time is very pressing. We probably have another eight weeks
before it gets cold.'
The UNHCR needed personnel, supplies, heating equipment, blankets and
plastic sheeting to cover up the windows, she said.
Getting massive aid supplies into Bosnia will require guarantees of safe
passage, particularly by the Bosnia Serbs and Serb irregulars, a western
diplomat said.
Meanwhile, there was a hopeful sign in the Bosnian conflict last night when
leaders of the warring factions agreed to UN supervision of all heavy
weapons around Sarajevo.
'If this agreement works, there will be no shelling in Sarajevo,' Mr Zaim
Backovic, a deputy commander of the Bosnian forces, said.
The agreement, concentrating heavy weapons in areas under UN supervision,
would enable monitors to determine who is responsible for shelling and to
pressure violators to stop. It was signed by Serb nationalist and Bosnian
government leaders.
However, western caution about the conflict could be enhanced by a threat
yesterday to an RAF relief flight at Sarajevo airport. UNHCR suspended
humanitarian relief flights after the incident, but the airport remained
open.
No military intervention was planned against the forces who apparently
'locked on' to a RAF Hercules transport with radar equipment designed to
target objects for attack, the UN said in New York. It said other flights
would continue, including one due to bring Gen Satish Nambiar, head of UN
peacekeepers in Yugoslavia.
A senior UN source in Sarajevo said earlier that UN headquarters was
evaluating the incident and that it could lead to an air strike against the
gun position.
The incident, less than a week after a UN Security Council resolution
allowing the use of force to get supplies to trapped civilians, seemed sure
to heighten tension and increase the probability of foreign military action
in the area. A strike would have been the first direct foreign military
intervention against one of the warring parties in the four-month-old Bosnia
conflict.
In addition to the problems posed by the pending winter, western diplomats
say that Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, continues to sanction
the process of 'ethnic cleansing', by which whole communities are forced to
leave their homes.
In addition the diplomats say he is not prepared to lift the siege of
Sarajevo, the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde, and the northern city of
Bihac.
'We must not forget that Sarajevo, a European city, is still being
bombarded. People, most Moslems, are being forced to sign away their
property, then they are forced to flee. UN or European Community resolutions
have not stopped the killing,' an EC diplomat said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet president, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and the chairman of
Ukraine's national bank yesterday shared the dubious distinction of a
dressing-down by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president.
Mr Kravchuk followed a stern public rebuke of Mr Vadim Hetman, the bank
chairman, who spoke out over the weekend for a tighter monetary policy, with
the assertion that Mr Gorbachev, as a leader who failed in his efforts to
preserve the Soviet Union, had no right to advise his successors.
'The national bank exists to carry out the will of the state, neither more
nor less,' he warned at a news conference. This suggests he has sided with
neo-communist bureaucrats in the cabinet in their struggle with the
technocratic reformers who run the republic's central bank.
Mr Kravchuk rejected the bank's proposal to reintroduce the rouble into the
Ukrainian economy as a means of bailing out the coupon, Ukraine's faltering
pseudo-currency.
On Saturday Mr Hetman called for a restriction of credits and a
reintroduction of the rouble in a 'tactical retreat' from the nationalist
emotions which have coloured the government's economic policies.
However, Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would follow the opposite course. On
October 1 the coupon would take all the functions of the true currency,
apart from convertibility. It now accounts for 97 per cent of cash
transactions in Ukraine, but cannot be used in non-cash operations.
The Ukrainian leader yesterday advanced a new and tougher interpretation of
the Black Sea Fleet agreement reached earlier this month with his Russian
counterpart, Mr Boris Yeltsin, in a further effort to appease nationalist
complaints that he is weakening in his defence of the republic's
sovereignty.
Mr Kravchuk said that the fleet had to be divided between Ukraine and Russia
by 1995, rather than postponing the division entirely until the 1995
deadline.
He also strongly dismissed Mr Gorbachev's suggestion in an interview
published yesterday that a new union will rise from the ashes of the old.
'To force upon the people this idea, which has compromised itself and which
is responsible for the worst features of our society would be unwise and
tragic,' Mr Kravchuk said.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK takes cautious troops decision: London wants to be seen
doing something to help a settlement in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY, Eastern Europe correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Britain to send up to 1,800 troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina is
a cautious and limited exercise aimed at boosting the UN's already
overstretched capacity to protect international humanitarian relief
operations.
It is also designed to reassure public opinion that Britain, as current
president of the European Community, is prepared to be seen to be doing
something which, in the long term, could form the basis for some negotiated
settlement in Bosnia.
But western diplomats and defence experts last night conceded that the
British gestures would do little in the way of stopping the fighting and
killing in the former Yugoslav republic.
'If London wanted to help in the humanitarian effort, maybe this will help,'
an EC diplomat said. 'But I am doubtful  - and we are all in the same
position  - if this will stop the fighting.'
Mr John Major, the prime minister, had four options:
Provide light military support and escorts for the aid convoys, and with the
consent of the three sides which are fighting in Bosnia;
Provide relief convoys, and go through to besieged towns, but without the
consent of any side. Those convoys would also defend themselves in the
process;
Provide relief supported by heavily armed relief convoys which would fight
their way to their targets;
Set up permanent security corridors in parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The last three options were ruled out partly because it would require at
least 100,000 ground troops and, besides, the UN operations in Bosnia would
have to be withdrawn because their impartiality would be completely
undermined.
Moreover, British officials last night stressed that option one would only
be implemented 'on the understanding that all three sides in the conflict in
Bosnia consented to these forces, which would be operating under the
auspices of the UN blue helmets,' an official said.
Officials from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees had earlier
in the week asked western governments not to endorse any international
military intervention because it would also undermine the UNHCR's own
operations throughout the republic.
'We had to take into consideration all these aspects. We have stuck to the
humanitarian effort because we are afraid of ending up in a Vietnam or
Beirut situation,' a British defence attache said last night.
Indeed, the British government last night insisted that the 'maximum' of
1,800 would be sent to Bosnia, thus confirming Mr Major's reluctance to
become embroiled in the war.
The British response to the bloodshed in Bosnia was greeted with mixed
response by defence specialists and EC diplomats.
Mr James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav army at Centre for Defence
Studies at London's Kings College, said the British initiative did not
really add up to anything substantial.
'The decision by the government gives the impression that it is prepared to
do something. But if you look at it in detail, it does very little. It is
predicated on too many ifs,' he said. British troops will only be sent if
requested by the UNHCR, and they will escort aid convoys which are operating
with the consent of all sides in Bosnia.
Essentially, Britain has decided to act within the strict confines of last
week's UN Security Council meeting which stated that 'all measures
necessary' would be used to protect the aid convoys. Force, or the use of
force, was not mentioned in the resolution.
Moreover, western diplomats last night said that by acting under the UN flag
 - which meant that British troops would wear blue helmets, the UN colours
 -they were bound to remain impartial in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
British diplomats said London's decision corresponded to those of other
European capitals. But the question now facing western governments is how
this decision will be interpreted by Bosnia's Serbs, who continue to besiege
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, and Bihac, in the
north of the republic.
'Is this another green light for the aggressor to grab more land and expel
more people?' a US diplomat asked. 'Will this mean that Bosnia's Moslems
have nothing left to lose so they will fight to the bitter end to defend
themselves?'

GEORGIAN troops yesterday moved into Sukhumi, capital of the breakaway
Abkhazian region, and quickly seized control of government and communication
centres as thousands of residents and holidaymakers fled the city.
Five people were killed when Abkhazian irregular forces resisted the move,
according to the independent Interfax news agency, although Georgian
ministers reported their forces had met no resistance.
Itar-Tass news agency reported that Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, Abkhazia's
parliamentary leader, had resigned. Georgian leaders had demanded his
resignation on Monday under threat of armed intervention.
Abkhazia's parliament effectively declared its independence from Georgia
last month but its claims were dismissed by the country's leaders. Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, Georgia's acting head of government, has stressed repeatedly
that Abkhazia would remain an integral part of the Georgian state.
Russian press commentators yesterday voiced concern that the instability in
Georgia could spark a more widespread conflagration in the Caucasus, an area
plagued by four years of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Chechen region of southern Russia, which has supported Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, the deposed Georgian leader, yesterday put its forces on full
alert to deter possible Georgian military moves.
Krasnaya Zvezda, the military newspaper, expressed outrage at the deaths of
at least three Russian holidaymakers in the Abkhazian conflict. The Russian
Defence Ministry said its paratroopers were guarding the airport and
military facilities in Sukhumi. Lithuania's prime minister, Mr Aleksandras
Abisala, said yesterday that the former Soviet Baltic states might reach
agreement with Russia within two months on a timetable for the withdrawal of
troops from their territories, Reuter reports.
'I think negotiations. . . . will now start seriously. Before, it was only
political show,' he said after a three-day meeting of Nordic and Baltic
premiers on the Danish island of Bornholm.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bank sees little significant growth this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy is unlikely to grow significantly this year, the Bank of
England said yesterday in a report which described prospects of a recovery
as 'elusive'.
The Bank, in its latest quarterly bulletin, said there were indications of
increased business activity, but consumer demand remained weak owing to high
debts, particularly mortgages.
'The post-election recovery in consumer demand has proved fragile with no
clear sign as yet that demand is moving ahead of last year's depressed
level.'
The central bank's depiction of an economy continuing to bump along the
bottom came amid other generally depressing economic news for Britain:
Sterling hit another low against the D-Mark, falling half a pfennig to close
in London at DM2.8125, its weakest level since Britain joined the European
exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. In New York it edged up to
DM2.8153.
The number of people out of work for more than a year increased by 64,000 in
the three months to July to top 900,000 for the first time since mid-1988.
Lower tax receipts owing to the enfeebled economy resulted in a
higher-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement last month of
Pounds 600m.
Government figures today are expected to show that UK output, excluding oil
and gas production, remained flat in the second quarter. This measure has so
far shown a fall for seven quarters.
While stressing the economic gains from lower inflation over the past year,
the Bank said 'the general improvement in business and consumer confidence
in May has not been sustained'.
Consumer spending was flat, while the housing market 'shows few signs of
reviving'. The Bank added: 'The outlook remains very uncertain but slow
growth in the economy should be evident in the remainder of this year.'
The Bank said the signs of weakness should not shake the resolve of Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in refusing to consider a devaluation.
According to Bank officials, keeping sterling within its ERM bands is vital
to the policy of achieving price stability and sustainable growth.
Of the depressed housing market, the Bank said measures taken by building
societies at the end of last year to help people with high arrears on
mortgages had had 'a very modest' impact.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, described the bulletin as 'one of the
gloomiest ever'. The government had 'no further excuse for inaction over
unemployment, the state of industry and the housing market'.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Major orders fighters to Gulf: Britain pledges 1,800 troops
to escort UN relief convoys in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITAIN last night responded to the conflicts in southern Iraq and
Bosnia-Hercegovina by deciding to send warplanes to the Gulf and offering up
to 1,800 troops to escort United Nations aid convoys in the former Yugoslav
republic.
After a six-hour meeting with senior ministers, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, announced that six Tornado jet fighters and two refuelling
aircraft would join an international force to clamp a 'no-fly' zone on
southern Iraq. This will stop Iraq from using its aircraft to attack Shia
Moslems in the area.
Officials said any troops sent to Bosnia would be under the UN flag to
escort convoys operating with the consent of the warring factions. It was
stressed at the highest levels in Downing Street that there was no question
of the troops being used to 'fight a way through to besieged towns' in the
republic, which is torn by ethnic conflict between Serbs, Croats and
Moslems. Troops would not be sent to 'fight their way to Armageddon and
back', one senior minister said.
France yesterday also announced support for the US plan to curb President
Saddam Hussein by enforcing an air exclusion zone in southern Iraq.
Mr Major said the exclusion zone, to be set up within days, was a response
to 'clear evidence' that Mr Saddam had adopted a policy of 'systematic
murder, genocide' of the area's Shia Moslems.
The international coalition of forces ranged against Iraq would fly 24-hour
air patrols over southern Iraq, mainly with US aircraft, but France had
agreed to contribute a force similar in size to that of the UK, he said.
Mr Major expected the Iraqi air force would stop bombing the Shia
communities, but added: 'If they fly in the proscribed area, then they will
be attacked.'
Rejecting suggestions that the operation was being mounted to help the
re-election prospects of President George Bush in November, Mr Major charged
Mr Saddam with repeatedly flouting UN resolutions by 'systematic repression'
of the Shias.
Officials said the Tornados  - which can be used in both combat and
reconnaissance roles  - would be in the region within days. There was
speculation they would be based in Bahrain, from which they operated during
the Gulf war.
The international force would operate under existing UN resolutions but the
precise scope of the zone would be finalised in discussions at the Security
Council in New York, officials said. A note warning Iraq would then be
handed to the Iraqi ambassador at the UN.
Mr Major, who broke off his holiday in Spain to chair yesterday's emergency
ministerial talks, signalled that the plan to send a maximum of 1,800
British forces personnel to Bosnia did not represent a reversal of his
strong opposition to direct western military involvement in the Yugoslav
conflict.
The personnel would form part of an enlarged UN force in the region, and
would be sent only if requested by UN aid agencies.
The offer of troops comes after the Security Council authorised the use of
force if necessary to get humanitarian aid to civilians in Bosnia. France
has already sent troops to Bosnia to help the relief effort.
A range of more ambitious options was considered and rejected at the London
meeting, including a defensive role against light attacks on convoys
operating without the agreement of the protagonists, a defensive role
against heavier attacks and opening up permanently defended aid corridors.
But officials said each had been rejected because of the risk of drawing
western forces into a full-scale conflict.
A British Hercules transport aircraft found itself under threat yesterday as
it was taking off from Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, after delivering
relief supplies. A UN official said irregular forces in the hills locked on
to the aircraft with radar equipment designed to target objects for attack.
The US, meanwhile, is not planning to seek a fresh UN Security Council
mandate before enforcing a ban on Iraqi aircraft flying south of the 32nd
parallel. It believes resolutions passed at the end of the Gulf war are
worded broadly enough to allow military action in defence of the groups
being persecuted by Baghdad.
Shia rebels in southern Iraq have come under intensified military pressure
from Baghdad in recent weeks. US officials say they have detected a large
buildup of Iraqi troops in the south.
Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, said that the exclusion zone
imposed in northern Iraq to protect the Kurdish population had proved
effective. 'So we envisage, among the allies, going about things the same
way over southern Iraq to protect the Shia population,' he said.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Tokyo acts to restore confidence in financial institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government moved to restore confidence in the country's banking
system and securities markets yesterday after share prices in Tokyo plunged
by 4.2 per cent to their lowest level in six years.
In a hastily called press conference, Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister,
announced a series of measures aimed at discouraging financial institutions
from selling shares during the next six weeks.
Many banks were expected to try to realise capital gains on share holdings
during this period to boost reported profits in the first half of the
financial year, which ends next month.
The finance ministry feared that such sales would further depress share
prices and undermine bank balance sheets. Banks face a huge burden of bad
debt, potentially as high as Y56,000bn (Pounds 231bn).
Mr Hata said Japan's financial system was facing its most difficult period
since the second world war, giving rise to questions about its stability and
capacity to supply capital.
'The fall in the stock market is pushing up valuation losses on stock
holdings, and the malfunctioning of the real estate market has triggered
concerns over the health of the financial system.'
Mr Hata's statements are the frankest admission yet by the government that
the plunge in share and property prices, combined with the sharp economic
slowdown, may have placed Japan's financial system in jeopardy. Continued
instability in the financial system could derail any potential recovery.
Mr Hata denied that his announcement of the measures was timed to follow
yesterday's steep fall in share prices, which saw the Nikkei average lose
620.14 to 14,309.41. Prices were moving lower again this morning after an
initial rally. The Nikkei was down some 100 points by mid-morning, having
been 200 points higher at one stage.
The measures will allow financial institutions to postpone the reporting of
unrealised losses on share holdings until the end of the financial year in
March. This will reduce short-term pressure on banks to realise capital
gains by selling other shares to compensate for losses.
In addition, the finance ministry has temporarily suspended an
administrative guidance to institutions under which the dividend payout
ratio could not exceed 40 per cent of profits. This will allow banks to
maintain dividend payments without having to raise money by selling shares.
Mr Tsueno Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations,
welcomed the measures and hoped they would ease doubts about the stability
of the banking system. He nonetheless called for further measures to cope
with the banks' huge volume of non-performing loans.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the leading business
federation, called for government cash to be used to buy land which banks
are holding as collateral for bad loans.
Yesterday's moves are to be followed later this month by a package of fiscal
measures that could pump between Y6,000bn and Y8,000bn into the economy,
through public works spending.
Prospects for economic recovery have grown increasingly bleak. The
Industrial Bank of Japan said that currently excessive inventories of unsold
goods were unlikely to reach normal levels until the second quarter of 1993.
After that capital spending would recover, but only slowly.
A survey published yesterday by the Nihon Keizei Shimbun, the economic
daily, found Japanese companies were continuing to reduce capital spending
plans.

FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES had a dull session, with stock index futures trading in a narrow
range for most of the day as dealers focused on the overnight fall in Tokyo
and poor corporate results from Germany, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,369, a brief rise in the September contract on the FT-SE
soon went into retreat, pulling the underlying cash market lower, with a
Japanese securities house reported to have been an early seller. Attempts at
a mid-morning rally met with little success, and following a brief dip to
2,367 September bounced between 2,369 and 2,374 for the next few hours.
Another sell-off in the last hour of trading caused a further retreat by the
contract and it eventually settled at 2,363, down 26 from its previous close
and around 4 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about
12. Futures traded at a discount to fair value throughout the session.
Turnover, at 6,793 contracts, was thin.
In traded options, total volume reached a mere 21,852 lots, once again
indicating a dull mood. The FT-SE 100 option had 7,120 contracts dealt and
the Euro FT-SE 100 index 1,846 lots. British Gas was the busiest stock
option on 1,398 lots transacted.

FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities give ground in poor trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market gave back about one third of its recent rally as its
revival of confidence was challenged by a heavy fall in Tokyo equities and
unsettling corporate results from Germany, the US and Britain.
Adding to the gloom was the monthly report from the Bundesbank, whose
defence of its high interest rate policy appeared to set the stage for
Thursday's policy meeting. Then the Bank of England, in its Quarterly
Bulletin, predicted only weak growth ahead in the domestic economy. There
was little reaction, however, to the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
figures for last month.
It was a gloomy trading session in London, with stock index futures
providing the lead to a thinly traded equity market. The FT-SE Index closed
21.4 down at 2,354.7, although it had rallied when the 2,350 area was
challenged.
Weakness in the US dollar took its toll of the overseas earning companies,
with BAT Industries, Reed International and Rank Organisation all
relinquishing ground. Increasing tensions in the Middle East failed to bring
support for oil shares.
Most of the bad news hit the stock market early. The 620-point setback in
the Nikkei average made for a poor opening in London, which very soon had to
come to terms with a sharp fall in German markets after Mannesmann,
Germany's leading engineering group, disclosed that profits dropped by 89
per cent in the first half of this year. The hardest blow on the domestic
front came from Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which announced sharply
lower interim profits and cut its dividend, an action which sent tremors
across the market.
Selling of the September stock index contract, said to be by the London arm
of a Japanese house, turned the underlying blue chips downwards. Trading
volume was extremely thin but the market remained fixed on its bearish tack.
A rally at midsession was blotted out when New York came in lower and Wang,
the US computer manufacturer, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
US bankruptcy laws. Once again, the September FT-SE contract led equities
lower.
Share prices extended their losses quite sharply towards the end of the
session and the Footsie dipped to 2,351.9 before rallying in the final
minutes of the session.
Traders took a philosophical view of yesterday's fall, which was not
entirely unexpected after the sharp rally in the Footsie over the previous
two sessions. They also stressed that trading volume had never measured up
to recovery proportions.
Seaq volume reached only 361.3m shares yesterday, while Monday's total of
315.3m reflected only Pounds 643.1m in retail, or customer, business.
Store and retail issues gave back some of recent gains, discouraged by the
Bank of England's references to weak consumer spending. Building and
construction shares, which had rallied after last week's reports of improved
inflation prospects in Europe had prompted hopes that interest rates might
soon be trimmed, turned down again yesterday.

FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei drops 4.2 per
cent to another six-year low

SHARE prices plunged on small-lot selling by individuals and short-selling
by dealers, and the Nikkei average dropped 4.2 per cent to another six-year
low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index fell 620.14 to close at the day's worst of 14,309.41, the lowest
level since March 1986. It opened at the session's high of 14,909.57 and
declined steadily on arbitrage unwinding and small-lot selling.
Volume picked up slightly from 141m shares to 170m. Traders said
institutional investors remained on the sidelines. Life insurers said the
risk of further declines in share prices remained. 'We cannot start buying
when we do not know how much further the market has to fall,' said an
official at Nippon Life.
Declines led advances by 801 to 131, with 128 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 30.01 to 1,102.50, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.02 to 907.90.
New worries about corporate earnings prompted a fresh round of selling
yesterday; there were fears that companies in the high-technology sector may
revise their earnings forecasts downwards.
Heavy selling pulled Sony down Y230 to Y3,560 and Pioneer Electronic Y290 to
Y2,670. The two groups report quarterly corporate earnings today, and fears
that profit figures would be sharply lower than originally forecast
depressed share prices.
Other electricals were also weak, with Hitachi sliding Y34 to Y718 and
Toshiba Y17 to Y547. Traders noted short-selling by investors and dealers.
Nippon Housing Loan, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y27 to Y167.
The home-loan company announ-ced that its leading creditors had agreed to
reduce interest payments on the company's loans.
Non-life insurers were firm on bargain hunting by foreigners. Tokio Marine &amp;
Fire put on Y20 to Y1,000 and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Y17 to Y672.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 427.38 lower at 15,537.22 in turnover of
13.4m shares. Individual investors facing margin calls sold high-priced
issues to raise cash. Ono Pharmaceutical fell Y350 to Y4,830 and Nintendo
shed Y230 to Y9,550.
Roundup
FURTHER weakness in Japanese equities left markets in the Pacific Basin
mixed, but fairly subdued.
AUSTRALIA closed with pared gains, the All Ordinaries index finally standing
6.0 up at 1,565.0 after an intraday peak of 1,568.7. Turnover totalled
ADollars 186.8m.
The feature of the market as it waited for the federal budget, due to be
announced after the close, was the debut of the rights stock to Westpac's
share issue, which closed at 4 cents after peaking at 7 cents in the
morning. The old shares ended a cent above the issue price at ADollars 3.01.
Australian Provincial Newspapers sank 13 cents to ADollars 1.37 after saying
it would be difficult to achieve full-year profit estimates. News Corp
firmed 22 cents to ADollars 23 as speculation continued that its forthcoming
results would be positive and that the company might be considering a share
split.
HONG KONG held its ground in spite of rumours that Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung
Kong was placing 200m new shares. Cheung Kong slipped 20 cents to HKDollars
23 but the Hang Seng index finished 7.31 higher at 5,675.16 after earlier
receding to 5,621.70.
Trading was generally quiet with turnover at HKDollars 2.52bn, but above the
previous day's HKDollars 2.26bn.
SEOUL saw initial gains eroded, but still ended higher, after rumours about
a political role for Daewoo Group chairman Kim Woo-choong had dampened
sentiment. Most Daewoo issues went the day's limit down on the rumours. The
index ended a net 2.82 up at 464.95 in turnover of Won170.6bn.
NEW ZEALAND managed, for once, to rise without help from Fletcher Challenge
(FCL), which closed a cent easier as the NZSE-40 index registered a rise of
10.16 at 1,501.21.
FCL, due to report its annual results today, expects a NZDollars 155m loss.
Telecom, with first-quarter results scheduled for release tomorrow, added 4
cents at NZDollars 2.32.
TAIWAN was lifted off the day's lows by bargain hunting, and the weighted
index, down 49 points at one stage, settled 11.57 off at a closing 19-month
low of 3,772.91. Turnover was thin at TDollars 17.25bn.
SINGAPORE finished at its lowest for this year, with blue chips leading the
losses due to foreign selling. The Straits Times Industrial index dipped
23.47 to 1,310.95 in volume of 59.27m shares.
KUALA LUMPUR fell a further 2.1 per cent, the KLSE index closing 12.01
weaker at 556.24. It has fallen 35.94, or 6.1 per cent, since last Friday on
persistent selling by fund managers.
KARACHI declined for the fourth straight session in dull trading, as
investors stayed on the sidelines. The KSE 100-share index slipped 17.21 to
1,266.89.

FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Italian volume rises as investors sell
 -William Cochrane reviews trends in European equity turnover in July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The summer lull notwithstanding, European stock market turnover registered
at least two serious changes in trend in July, with Italy showing a gain of
39 per cent over June, and France a 25 per cent fall.
Two things have to be said about swings like these: first that, especially
in the case of Italy, they are happening when equity trading activity is at
a very low level, by comparison with earlier years; and secondly, with a
particular eye on France, that they may reflect less the establishment of a
new trend than the return to an old one.
Ms Marie-Christine Keith, an analyst with County NatWest, which produces the
turnover figures, says the Italian figures reflect a market demoralised by
the sickness of the domestic economy. Over the month the Comit index fell
from 450 to 401, having plumbed a new low of 393 in the meantime.
Italian banks, says Ms Keith, were sold quite heavily on their exposure to
the Efim state holding company, which was declared insolvent in July; then
interest rates went up, leaving an increasing awareness that the banks would
be carrying heavy losses on their bond portfolios.
Foreigners were selling as well as domestic investors and, as with banks, it
was liquid stocks which were sold. Telecommunications companies, once the
safe, or certainly the defensive, way for a foreigner to maintain
representation in a vulnerable Milan equity market, were given a caning as
foreign holders sold out.
France, on the other hand, had seen its heaviest selling in the month
before. It boasted the biggest climb in June volume as a consequence of the
heavy liquidation of holdings following the Danish vote against the
Maastricht treaty, and President Francois Mitter-rand's decision to call an
autumn referendum for the French public to back or repudiate his EC
policies.
End-quarter options and window dressing at the end of the first half of the
year also swelled the French figures. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko
Securities says the July downturn has been exaggerated by the French
allegiance to the summer holiday break. 'The market,' he adds, 'is
vacillating at subsistence level.'
Germany, which looks as if it had a useful increase last month, has in fact
been vac-illating itself in a clearly defined up and down turnover pattern
since March. Switzerland, on the other hand, accelerated a decline which it
began in June.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich says turnover is
following share prices down, as well as reflecting the summer low season.
This, he adds, could argue that there is less to be worried about in
Switzerland than in other depressed markets  - that the Swiss inflation
scenario is looking better than the German one, which the Bundesbank,
clearly, is still worried about.

FT  19 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mannesmann falls 11 per cent
on interim results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER initial weakness following the fall in Tokyo, Mannesmann's first-half
results reminded bourses yet again that events this summer have rarely met
expectations, writes Our Markets Staff.
Depressed by start-up losses in its mobile telephone business, and confused
by the impact of extraordinary items, Mannesmann's interims might not be as
bad as they first appeared.
However, after earlier progress reports from Hoogovens, SKF, Peugeot and
Michelin, analysts will be looking carefully at Daimler, Volkswagen, Volvo
and Daf when they come up for consideration next week.
FRANKFURT more than wiped out two hesitant days of gains with a 1.4 per cent
fall, the DAX closing 22.20 lower at 1,533.22. Mannesmann dropped DM29.10,
or 11 per cent, to DM238.20 and other German shares, particularly in the
engineering and steel industries, followed suit.
Analysis of the Mannesmann interim results went to extremes. On the face of
it, profits plunged to DM15m from DM134m; but on one reading, excluding the
mobile phone business, and extraordinary profits in 1991, they could
actually have shown an increase. London took this with a pinch of caution,
quoting the shares at DM240.50 in the post bourse close.
Turnover stayed low, rising from DM3.7bn to D,3.9bn. Among other engineers,
MAN fared particularly badly with a fall of DM15.90 to DM293.60; among the
few advances, Lufthansa's DM5 rise to DM98 followed a long journey down, and
the DAG union's offer of a DM500m cost saving package on Monday.
Siemens fell DM8 to DM603.40. Its Siemens-Nixdorf said yesterday that it
planned to cut 6,000 jobs by 1994/95, but dealers said there was no real
impact on the share price from the news.
PARIS had another quiet day as turnover improved slightly to FFr1.23bn. The
CAC-40 index fell 20.59 to 1,736.72.
Paribas fell FFr11.60 or 3.7 per cent to FFr304.40 after saying that the
issue of 12.5m new preference shares in Ciments Francais last month was
badly received by the market and that it would end up with more than the 20
per cent stake in Ciments Francais that it planned to hold following the
operation. One analyst added that fears that Paribas would have to make
further provisions for its property interests also weighed on the stock.
The insurer Gan dropped to a low of FFr321.20 on news that S &amp; P-ADEF, the
French office of the US credit rating agency, Standard &amp; Poor's, had
downgraded the domestic debt of CIC, Gan's banking subsidiary. It closed
FFr7.50 lower at FFr345.
S &amp; P-ADEF also said that while Gan's more active role in the running of CIC
and the potential synergies between the two groups were positive elements
for the quality of CIC's credit, it also noted that the current
restructuring process was a lengthy task which had not yet resulted in a
real improvement in profitability.
AMSTERDAM ended broadly lower as the CBS Tendency index fell 1.6 to 112.1.
Hunter Douglas dropped Fl 3.60 to Fl 56.00 as investors anticipated
disappointing first-half earnings data. After the close Hunter Douglas
announced a first-half net profit decline of 44 per cent to Fl 23.2m.
The chemical sector was also weak as Akzo lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 145.60 and DSM
slipped Fl 1.30 to Fl 101.40.
MILAN failed to continue Monday's technical rebound and closed broadly lower
in thin volume, which traders estimated at near Monday's paltry L46.2bn. The
Comit index fell 2.66 to 400.77.
All sectors showed losses, with industrial stocks hit the hardest. Fiat lost
L65 to L4,145 while Montedison slid L17 to L1,119. Olivetti lost L63 to
L2,317 while Cir lost L15 to L1,200.
ZURICH regained some ground as the SMI index ended down 11.6 at 1,788.6.
Chemicals were mixed, Ciba-Geigy holding steady ahead of its imminent
half-year results, but Sandoz registered shedding SFr60 to SFr2,810.
STOCKHOLM fell 1.5 per cent in thin trading as the Affarsvarlden General
Index fell 12.4 to 808.3 in thin turnover of SKr341m. Ericsson was the most
active issue ahead of its first-half report today. Its B shares fell SKr2 to
SKr114.
The banking sector, already the scourge of the Nordic equity markets, caused
more trouble elsewhere in Scandinavia. In COPENHAGEN, as the CSE index fell
1.39 to 296.09, Unidanmark dropping DKr5 to DKr145 on a DKr1.48bn pre-tax,
half-year loss.
In OSLO, the all-share index fell 6.61, or almost 2 per cent to another new
low of 345.69, hit by big losses at Den norske Bank. Norway's biggest bank
dropped to a new all-time low of NKr4.2 before closing at NKr4.3, down
NKr1.2.
HELSINKI, meanwhile, saw a 4.4 per cent drop in the bank and finance house
index as the Hex index closed 4.6 lower at 650.5. Bank shares fell on
general concern about the sector, which has been hit by large loan losses.
BRUSSELS closed mixed in moderate trading, as the Bel-20 index ended just
0.71 down at 1,092.74. Petrofina remained weak, losing another BFr120 or 1.3
per cent to BFr9,320.
ISTANBUL's 75-share index lost 24.92 to 4,052.06 as investors stayed away
from the market.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farm minister warns of
'scissors crisis'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VIKTOR Khlystun, Russia's agriculture minister, said yesterday that a
'scissors crisis' of high industrial prices and low farm prices which
accounted for peasants withholding grain could only be dealt with through
continued subsidies and anti-monopoly measures which had not yet
materialised.
He said the government had tried to hold back farm prices but industrial
managers, starting with producers of industrial raw materials, had been
responsible for exorbitant increases that made agricultural machinery and
other industrial goods inaccessible for farmers at current prices.
The minister said that the only tangible result of market-reforms so far had
been a change in people's attitudes. There could be no question for now of
cutting back government subsidies to loss-making farms as initially planned
since 'everybody was losing money' as a result of the high prices for
agricultural machinery and other industrial goods. Reforms, he said, would
take at least 5 to 6 years to show significant results. A significant
obstacle remained continuing restrictions on the free sale and purchase of
land, which prevented banks from holding land as collateral to finance
improvements to it.
He announced that he had obtained an alteration in Russia's privatisation
programme designed to prevent monopolists resurfacing in food-processing as
they had done in manufacturing industry. This gave 40 per cent of shares in
privatised enterprises to employees, and allocated the rest to enterprises
which supplied inputs to it. It was not clear however how this would prevent
them from acting in a monopolistic fashion.
Declining to give new estimates for how much imported grain would be
required, he said imports would remain essential as long as Russia preserved
its extremely wasteful system of using unusually high amounts of grain for
animal feed because of an absence of suitable additives.
He said the livestock and dairy situation was particularly worrying, and had
been dealt a fresh blow from a recent increase in state grain procurement
prices. The number of chickens was down 19 per cent, cows down 2 per cent on
last year's level, while the overall production of meat had fallen 12 per
cent.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forestry policy 'needs
overhaul'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT policy on forestry needs completely overhauling, according to
a survey by Timber Growers United Kingdom, which represents private woodland
owners.
The survey of 341 forest owners with 65,000 hectares (160,000 acres) found
'vacillating' was the most common criticism in an overwhelmingly negative
view of the government measures of the past 20 years.
Mr Peter Wilson, technical director of TGUK, said that since the 1988 budget
changed the tax rules on forestry, traditional commercial planting had
dropped to less than 40 per cent of the 1989 level at less than 10,000
hectares.
He called for a properly thought out forestry strategy and an end to ad hoc
measures. 'Too many mistakes have been made in the past by government
imposing solutions that have not worked. This time we must get it right.'
The TGUK survey shows that 75 per cent of forestry owners considered their
business was not benefitting from any economic upturn and only 13 per cent
intended to invest more in the industry.

shipments

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN Wheat Board has halted shipments of grain to Russia until it
receives satisfactory proposals from Moscow for payment of overdue principal
and interest on a CDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 650m) line of credit.
Russia is the second biggest market for Canadian grain, with shipments so
far this season totalling 4.24m tonnes, including 2.9m tonnes of wheat.
A wheat board official expressed optimism yesterday that the suspension of
exports will be 'very temporary', but said that shipments were being halted
with immediate effect. Nine vessels are either waiting at various Canadian
ports to load grain for Russia, or are expected later this week.
The official said that payments on the line of credit, which was signed
during a visit by president Boris Yeltsin to Ottawa last February, had
fallen off 'significantly' in recent months. According to local reports, the
arrears are now well over CDollars 100m.
Canada and Russia signed the latest in a series of long-term grain
agreements at the end of January. It provides for the purchase of 25m tonnes
of wheat and barley between February 1992 and January 1997.
Grain shipments were disrupted earlier this summer because of the Russians
inability to pay shipping costs. Since June, the wheat board has been
arranging shipments to Russia on a partial cif (cost, insurance and freight)
basis, instead of the traditional fob (free on board).
Poland plans to buy 500,000 tonnes of wheat on world markets to restore
strategic reserves, a government official said yesterday, reports Reuter
from Warsaw. Last week Mr Janusz Bylinski, the deputy agriculture minister,
said Poland would have to buy up to 2m tonnes of grain before the next
harvest to make up for a forecast 25 per cent fall in the domestic crop due
to drought.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian silk industry aims to
boost export appeal - The second biggest producer has to import fibre to
meet overseas demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN EARNINGS from silk goods exports rose by nearly 55 per cent to
Rs6.76bn (Pounds 125m) during the year to March 1992, but the industry and
the federal government remain dissatisfied with the industry's position as a
minor player in the world market.
Although it is the second largest producer of silk after China it has only
about a 6 per cent share of world trade in the commodity and mostly exports
low value silk goods.
The Indian government is thinking of linking up with China in an effort to
correct the technological deficiencies of its silk sector. According to Mr
S. Shah, president of Silk Association of India, the modernisation programme
will have to cover every aspect of sericulture (silk-worm breeding) and silk
processing.
India aims to produce 14,465 tonnes of silk in 1992-93 but it will be
depending almost totally on imports of raw fibre, mainly from China, for the
production of silk goods for the export market.
Indian silk has good lustre, but because of the lack of strength and
unevenness of the yarn it cannot compete with the China's strong, wash-proof
fibre.
Indian processors are allowed to import raw silk against export and value
addition commitments ranging from 75 per cent to 150 per cent.
According to industry representatives, Indian silk production will get a
boost both in terms of quantity and quality provided the Rs5.5bn national
sericulture project funded by the World Bank and the Swiss Development
Corporation is implemented faithfully. Under this project, sericulture is
being introduced in many non-traditional areas. Indian productivity of 37 kg
of raw mulberry silk a hectare is woefully low, experts say, and they
believe it can easily be doubled.
For a long time to come, however, Indian exports of silk goods will have to
depend on import of raw fibre. Besides the poor quality of indigenous silk,
the domestic market for silk goods is large enough not to leave any surplus
for export. Following a 26 per cent devaluation in the Indian currency, the
export target of Rs10bn by 1994-95 appears easily achievable. But Mr Shah
says a breakthrough in exporting will have to await a switch from manual to
machine spinning, weaving, dyeing and finishing.
The Indo-German Export Promotion Project has observed that if India is to
have a bigger share of the German silk market than 6 per cent it must
introduce modern weaving, dyeing and finishing techniques. Germany is the
second biggest market for Indian silk goods after the US. The other big
buyers of Indian silk goods are the UK, Italy, Spain and France.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivian antimony and wolfram
in crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOLIVIAN antimony and wolfram industries are in a state of crisis
following saturation of their markets in North America and Europe.
Up to 3,000 workers in wolfram production, which is under the most immediate
strain, are set to lose their jobs unless a rescue package can be arranged.
Mr Rolando Jordan, general secretary of the Medium Mines Association, an
umbrella organisation for private mining concerns in Bolivia, blames the
situation on the aggressive dumping of these semi-processed metals by China
at rock-bottom prices on the international market since March this year.
'This sophisticated dumping by China has hurt us very badly and has
effectively closed the market for such metals', he says.
A Bolivian delegation is currently lobbying both North America and the
European Community to extend anti-dumping measures against products
containing Chinese metals. In the meantime four or five of the Medium Mines
Association's 22 companies could cease to be members by the year's end
according to Mr Jordan.
As far as the immediate situation is concerned, Bolivian mining minister
Alvaro Rojas says he is 'analysing the possibilities of finding financing
which would maintain wolfram production and thus avoid closures'. One
estimate puts the sum needed at about Dollars 3.5m.
As Comibol, the state mining corporation, no longer produces wolfram, the
sectors hit hardest by the present collapse in the market will be the small
and medium mines and co-operatives.
Total wolfram production last year was 1,264 tonnes, worth some Dollars
6.7m. This figure was up slightly from 1990 but down from 3,195 tonnes
produced in 1982, then worth about Dollars 33.9m.
Antimony production last year was 9,107 tonnes worth Dollars 13.9m, again up
on 1990 but down from 13,612 tonnes in 1982, then worth Dollars 24.4m.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocooned market under threat -
Japanese import restrictions may have to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTURY ago, the humble silkworm led Japan on its march to becoming an
economic superpower. Silk farmers have since been protected by import
restrictions and soaring subsidies.
But they are now wondering how much longer they can survive, reports Reuter
from Tokyo. Their numbers are declining as finished goods flood in from
China and South Korea, while the Uruguay Round of trade talks is opposed to
continued protection of Japanese farm goods.
A recent study by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestries and Fisheries
found that the number of cocoon growers had dropped from 248,000 to 44,000
in the 16 years to 1991. Japan's raw silk production was down from 236,000
bales (60 kg each) in 1981 to 90,000 bales last year and over the same
period cocoon output fell from 65,000 tonnes to 21,000 tonnes, the study
showed.
But ministry officials remain defiant. 'Perhaps we cannot stop the drop in
silk farmers, but our job is to protect the regional economies and the
people who can grow only cocoons,' said one.
'As long as the kimono exists as our national dress, we can expect strong
demand for Japanese silk and people will realise the quality of Japanese
silk,' he added.
Japanese silk is longer-fibred and stronger than foreign silk, making it
suitable for the kimono, the traditional long gown now used mainly for
weddings and ceremonial occasions.
But economics seem to contradict the ministry view. On July 29, August silk
contracts on the Yokohama futures market fell to Y10,400 (Pounds 43) a
kilogram, the lowest since December 1987, despite the fact that domestic
demand for silk had steadily risen to 310,700 bales in 1991, equal to 30 per
cent of the world market.
Mr Iwao Iwamoto, an industry analyst at Commodity Market Research Institute
Company, said the time had come for the government to abandon its import
monopoly.
In 1952, Japan introduced its silk price stabilising system under which the
ministry decides on a price high and low every year as a standard on which
to base market intervention. Since 1974 only the semi-government Silk Agency
has been allowed to import raw silk and dried cocoons.
From 1952 to 1987, Japan spent millions of yen a year to keep domestic
prices high. The precise figure has not been published.
In 1987, the Silk Agency had a cumulative deficit of Y120bn from its market
operations.
Since 1987 and the rise of the yen, the lucrative Japanese market has been
flooded with foreign silk goods, such as thread, textiles and secondary
products, mainly from China and South Korea.
'Japanese weavers have to pay twice as much as international prices for raw
silk, so it is impossible for them to compete in the market,' said Mr
Iwamoto. 'They really suffer, since they receive neither protection nor
subsidies.'
Cocoon farmers and raw silk producers are bitterly opposed to liberalisation
of the domestic market. 'As soon as we open our silk market, prices will
drop to the the international price of Y7,800 per kilogram,' said an
official of the Japan Silk Manufacturers Association. The current price for
domestic silk is about Y10,700 a kilogram.
But pressure for liberalisation is building up from the international
community. If General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposals to turn
protection for farm goods into tariffs are accepted, silk and cocoons are
likely to be the next target for attack on Japan.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price surges as funds
change tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COPPER market burst into life when prices rose very strongly in New York
and London after investment funds, which had been attempting to push the
price down, changed tactics, dealers suggested yesterday.
The funds' selling strategy was unsuccessful because it stimulated buying by
North American consumers and China, said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill
Lynch. 'Consumers see copper as a 'buy' when it is below Dollars 1.10 a lb,'
he said. Also, merchants say the Chinese are looking for up to 200,000
tonnes of copper in the next six to nine months. 'Copper at Dollars 1.05 a
lb is seen as a bargain basement price by the Chinese.'
Ms Karen Norton, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, pointed out that the
copper market was fundamentally well-balanced and there was likely to be a
supply deficit of 70,000 tonnes this year compared with a surplus of 112,000
tonnes in 1991.
Copper's three-month price touched Dollars 2,563 a tonne on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday before closing at Dollars 2,556 (Dollars 1.16 a lb) up
Dollars 57 from Monday's kerb close. Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf
Wolff, said: 'We are looking for it to move to Dollars 2,575. If it goes
through there the upside target is Dollars 2,635.'
Some 8 to 9 cents a lb will be added to the cost of about 347,000 tonnes of
annual aluminium production capacity on the US west coast because of power
restrictions to be imposed for four months from September by the Bonneville
Power Administration, according to Mr Tom Van Leeuwen, analyst at Lehman
Brothers in New York.
He said a maximum of 30,000 tonnes of annual capacity might be temporarily
shut down but, after talking to producers, he believed none would make a
decision before the end of this year when they would know if the drought
conditions  - which are causing a 25 per cent cut in BPA power supplies  -
continued.
Meanwhile, smelters would buy power from other sources at a cost roughly
double that of their contracts with BPA.

GOLD eased to Dollars 336.15 a troy ounce on the London bullion market while
PLATINUM cut earlier losses after Nymex futures edged off early lows. 'Gold
seems to be in real limbo at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised to see a
range between Dollars 330 and Dollars 340 for some time,' one dealer said.
Platinum opened around Dollars 4 below Tuesday's close at Dollars 343 to
Dollars 344 after a sharp fall in the Nikkei share index overnight increased
fears of falling demand from Japan, the world's largest platinum importer. A
report from South Africa's Impala that world consumption would slightly
exceed production in 1992 for the second successive year failed to boost
prices. London COFFEE and COCOA both reversed the morning's weaker trends as
their New York counterparts discovered good trade buying where further long
speculator liquidation had been expected. However traders did not think the
afternoon's rallies marked the start of concrete recoveries; more
fundamental support was needed before either could be said to have turned
the corner. In Chicago WHEAT came under pressure early on from the news that
Canada had suspended grain shipments to Russia.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Market value of Brazilian
foreign debt slips 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market value of Brazil's foreign bank debt has dropped by 10 per cent
since the end of last week, leading a wave of bearishness that has swept
through all less developed country debt markets in recent days.
The slide in the value of Brazilian debt, prompted by the allegations of
corruption that threaten to engulf President Fernando Collor, is widely
regarded by LDC debt traders as one of the main causes for negative
sentiment in the debt of countries from Mexico to Poland.
Fears that Japanese banks may be forced by their capital adequacy problems
to sell debt holdings ahead of the end of their half year on 30 September
have also contributed to the decline.
'When the Japanese banks want to sell, you don't know whether it's going to
be Dollars 10m, or Dollars 10,000m,' said Mr Ric Haller, head of the LDC
debt unit at Morgan Grenfell.
Selling by Japanese banks would be likely to have the biggest effects on
markets such as Mexico and Venezuela, where debt prices are at a level where
they more than cover the banks' provisions against losses.
Inadequate provisioning, on the other hand, would be likely to prevent them
from selling Brazilian debt.
In late trading in London yesterday, Brazilian DFA bank debt was quoted at
27 1/4 per cent of face value. It had hovered at just above 30 per cent
before selling in New York late on Friday pushed it lower.
Traders said yesterday that Brazilian debt now offered the chance of
substantial capital gains, although concern about the political situation
meant that few buyers were likely to emerge. If Brazil converts its debt
into Brady bonds at current levels and on terms so far announced, investors
would receive 'incredibly high yields of more than 30 per cent a year in
dollar terms,' said Mr Peter West, economic adviser at Chartered WestLB in
London.
The market has become increasingly concerned that the threat of impeachment
to President Collor could threaten the debt restructuring deal agreed in
principle with banks earlier this summer. Since the scandal first broke in
June, the value of Brazilian debt has dropped from 40 per cent, returning to
its level at the beginning of the year.
Venezuelan debt dropped from 65 to 63 5/8 per cent yesterday, while the debt
of both Poland and Morocco lost more than a percentage point.
Bondholders of Control Securities, the UK company whose former chief
executive, Mr Nazmu Virani, has been charged in connection with the collapse
of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, have agreed to a delay in
interest payments until October 12. The delay affects two Swiss franc
issues, the 7 1/2 bonds due 1994 and the 8 7/8 due 1997.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: UK institutional investors
warned of risks in foreign exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Association of Corporate Treasurers has warned UK institutional
investors of the need to assess the implications of foreign exchange
management in non-financial companies.
'The risk is that the value of the firm will vary with exchange rates,'
according to Mr John Grout, director of treasury at Cadbury Schweppes, and
Mr Derek Ross, a partner in Touche Ross, who have compiled a checklist for
institutional investors.
The project was undertaken following discussions between the ACT and the
Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension
Funds.
The issue became a subject of concern among investors after Allied Lyons,
the UK food and drinks group, lost Pounds 150m (Dollars 286m) in foreign
exchange dealings early last year.
The guidelines highlight four main types of exposure to foreign exchange
risk: strategic exposure, affecting customers or suppliers, or decisions
such as plant location; pre-transactional exposure, arising before entering
into a commercial contract; transactional exposure, created by purchase,
sales and financing transactions; and translation exposure which arises from
translation for accounting purposes from one currency to another.
The nature and degree of hedging foreign exchange risk is 'a vital element
of shareholder value,' Mr Ross said. An investor might, for example buy
shares in a UK company with large US operations expecting the company to
benefit from a stronger dollar. However, if the company's exposure to the
dollar was already hedged, the investor's intended strategy would be thrown
off course.
However, investors should be able to get a clear idea of the company's
practices 'even in a short meeting with company management,' according to Mr
Grout and Mr Ross.
While certain types of hedging are advisable, it is hazardous to undertake
translation hedging in order to protect a book-keeping item, according to Mr
Ross. He believes it is only valid if a company has come up against
borrowing covenants or has to protect a profits forecast.
A survey of institutional investors undertaken last year by Touche Ross
showed that 63 per cent of respondents would prefer companies not to hedge
translation exposures since it is likely to give results different to those
expected by investors.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines and Sears, Roebuck, the US retailer,
yesterday announced a joint venture through which the companies will merge
their voice-and-data networking businesses into a new service company, to be
called Advantis.
The combined size and strength of Sears and IBM, make Advantis, from its
inception, one of the biggest private data networks in the world. It will be
able to draw upon Sears' huge network in North America, which includes Dean
Witter Reynolds, Allstate Insurance and Coldwell Banker.
The venture will also enable the companies to cut costs. Analysts expect it
to compete with British Telecommunications and Sprint and General Electric
of the US, which also offer voice-and-data communications.
Advantis will be jointly owned by IBM and Sears, with IBM holding a majority
stake through its wholly-owned Integrated Systems Solutions Corporations
(ISSC) subsidiary. First-year revenues are estimated at about Dollars 1bn.
The companies would not reveal the financial terms of the venture.
It will offer voice-and-data network services including design, development,
out-sourcing and the integration of custom networks. It will also offer
value-added network services.
Mr Dennis Welsh, ISSC president, said: 'In the 1990s and into the 21st
century, networking is the single most important factor in the information
technology equation.'

CHRYSLER announced yesterday that a consortium of 152 US and foreign banks
had approved a three-year extension of an Dollars 8.6bn loan for the auto
manufacturer's financial services subsidiary.
The approval of the financing will come as a relief to Chrysler. The closure
of the deal had been delayed for several weeks by two banks which had sought
improved terms on the revolving credit facility.
To win their approval, Chrysler agreed to new terms that included more
restrictive covenants, security interests in Chrysler Financial's US assets,
and higher borrowing rates and commitment fees.
Earning an extension on the loan facility was crucial to the Chrysler
subsidiary, which provides the financing for many of the carmaker's
customers and dealers.
Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, said yesterday: 'Getting (the
negotiations with the lenders) behind us will allow us to focus on keeping
the flow of outstanding new products coming.'

<TEXT>
GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's leading mining
houses, held the decline in earnings in the year to June to 4 per cent in
the face of weak commodity markets.
Pre-tax profit dropped to R342m (Dollars 123m) from R358m while attributable
profit was down at R302m from R314m.
Revenue fell to R505m from R518m in 1991 but the decline was attributable to
a R20m decline in profit on the realisation of investments. Income from
investments  - mostly dividend income from its gold mines  - rose marginally
to R289m from R285m while income from fees, interest and other sources also
increased  - to R215m from R212m.
Gold Fields' main source of income is its large portfolio of investments,
mainly in precious metal mining companies. GFSA has the highest exposure to
gold of all South Africa's mining houses. Its Driefontein and Kloof gold
mines are among the richest in the world.
The dividend was maintained at 200 cents per share on earnings of 314 cents.

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group, the diversified Australian beer producer, has
confirmed market speculation that it will announce major asset write-downs
in its next annual earnings statement, due next month.
The company was replying yesterday to the Australian Stock Exchange which
was seeking reasons for recent heavy falls in its share price.
Foster's directors referred to a statement in June which indicated that the
carrying value of assets was being continually evaluated and further
adjustments may be necessary.
'It is expected that this evaluation will be completed in time for the
preliminary final statement,' they said. 'As a result of the continuing
recession and deterioration of property prices, it is likely that material
reductions in the carrying value of those assets will result.'
Directors declined to make a direct comment on speculation that the company
may require a share issue to top up its capital after any write-downs.

<TEXT>
DAYTON Hudson, one of the largest US retail groups, yesterday reported a
modest improvement in a second-quarter profits, at Dollars 42m after tax.
The figure, for the three months to August 1, compares with Dollars 40m a
year earlier. Sales in the second quarter of 1992 rose to Dollars 3.97bn
(Dollars 3.56bn), and earnings per share totalled 50 cents (47 cents).
The company said the economy was still 'restraining sales momentum', and
attributed the bulk of the improvement to a lower operating expenses.
Comparable store sales rose only 3 per cent in the second quarter.
Dayton's profits for the first half stand at Dollars 77m, compared with
Dollars 74m a year ago. Sales total Dollars 7.69bn, against Dollars 6.91bn.
Kroger, the supermarket chain which took on a large debt load when it
conducted a defensive restructuring in 1986, warned it will do little more
than break even in the third quarter (ahead of extraordinary charges related
to early debt retirement).
The company blamed competitive pressures in key markets, plus the aftermath
of a strike in Michigan. The overall trend in many major markets was
described as favourable but Kroger said profits in Texas and part of the
midwest had been hit by tough competition and price-competition.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sony to set the tone for the
sector - Gordon Cramb previews the results season for Japanese electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONY of Japan's shareholders will not be the only group waiting for signs of
an upturn when it reports its first-quarter results today, after plunging
into a Y20.5bn (Dollars 163m) parent operating loss in the year to last
March.
Keen interest in Sony's fortunes will also be shown by a batch of Japanese
electronics companies, which specialise in the consumer audio-visual sector
and which look to Sony to set a lead in technological innovation.
They will be seeking indications that Sony has products or applications on
the horizon which will aid their recovery from the country's protracted
downturn in consumer spending.
Analysts in Tokyo, however, see a more immediate problem for the dedicated
audio companies. Sony and the larger Matsushita Electric Industrial, they
say, are increasingly going down-market into cheaper domestic ranges to use
surplus production capacity and increase market share. 'This will gradually
hurt other competitors,' said an industry watcher.
Aiwa, partly because it is a 52.5 per cent Sony subsidiary, occupies a
special place among those in the sector. In 1987 it was among the first
Japanese electronics companies to undergo a restructuring when half its
output was moved overseas, mainly to Singapore, and its product line was
pruned.
Mr Hajime Ukoni, brought in from Sony and now Aiwa president, said this week
he expected others in the audio products industry would probably have to
follow a similar route.
Some large and diversified electronics makers have already either quit the
audio sector in the past year or reduced their manufacturing presence.
Toshiba has stopped making cassette and compact disc players. Hitachi is
concentrating domestic output at the top end of the audio market, while
providing marketing support to its loss-making Nippon Columbia affiliate,
maker of the Denon hi-fi brand.
Mr Ukoni argued that Aiwa is better placed than specialist audio producers
which have not yet shed surplus domestic capacity. However, he added: 'We
have turned into a headwind. Unless we handle this wisely, we could end up
the same as five years ago. It's a tough year for me.'
Aiwa's strategy has been to focus on familiar products slightly
differentiated from those of its competitors, and then price them keenly.
Its best line is a compact stereo system including television and video. The
unit is being sold as a household's second system in an otherwise saturated
market.
Along with Sony, the usually slower-moving Matsushita remains a potent force
at the head of the industry because of its size and its strong brand names,
such as Panasonic and Technics.
Against Matsushita's digital compact cassette, Sony places its
next-generation audio hopes on the minidisc, a recordable format intended to
replace compact discs. The company has been attempting to allay fears that
this fight  - which it could lose to Matsushita, as it did with its Betamax
video format versus its rival's VHS  - is inhibiting investment in other
potentially promising directions.
Mr Norio Ohga, Sony president, said earlier this month that 'the burden from
investments in 8mm camcorders and minidiscs has been heavy. To recover
profits on our previous investments we have to lower new investment'.
To counter the domestic downturn, audio producers are stepping up sales in
overseas markets, which already account for around two thirds of all
revenues for companies in the sector.
Many groups are battling at home to contain production costs and swollen
inventories  - cutting overtime and shifting staff to product areas which
are performing better.
Recruitment of engineers and skilled workers is generally being maintained
but advertising budgets have been pared. But in some respects the approaches
of the companies differ markedly.
Pioneer, also due to report quarterly results today, agrees with Aiwa in
principle. 'In Japan there are 42m households. In the past we thought in
terms of one system, one household. Now we are targeting family members
separately,' an official said.
But Pioneer has gone a different route, trying to draw consumers to new
products. It is stressing higher price-tag items aimed at those in their 30s
and 40s.
Pioneer lists laser home karaoke systems and big-screen projection
televisions as growth products. Through its car audio side it has launched a
satellite navigation system and a satellite link which shows a vehicle's
position on an in-car screen.
Kenwood, also aiming for the upper end of the market, said it has maintained
market share partly because it has been generous in its dealer margins. But
both companies, along with others, face increasing volume competition from
Sony.
Non-operating income kept Sony in the black at the parent pre-tax level last
year, while its worldwide entertainment interests held the overall group
comfortably in profit.
Today's figures may indicate how it has fared in rebuilding its domestic
earnings base in the face of an increasingly dull consumer climate. The
tougher its actions in doing so, however, the more other Japanese audio
companies are likely to suffer.

<TEXT>
NIPPON Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, has drawn
up a rationalisation plan, which includes the closure of its overseas
operations and a cut in executive allowances.
The bank plans to cut around Y6bn (Dollars 48m) in costs by closing four of
its overseas operations, consolidating domestic branches, and halving
allowances of executives. The bank will also curb new computer investments,
and plans to sell part of its property assets.
The move is the first among Japanese banks, which are facing an increasing
squeeze in profits due to the rising amount of non-performing loans.
Nippon Credit's leasing affiliates are heavily burdened with doubtful
property loans, and the bank is seeking creditor assistance in restructuring
its subsidiaries.
Japan's image conscious banks have refrained from actively implementing
rationalisation programmes. However, Nippon Credit's announcement could
prompt similar moves at other leading banks.
Nippon Credit, the smallest of Japan's long-term credit banks, has tried to
compensate for its size by lending heavily to property related developments.
Total outstanding bad loans at the bank's three financial subsidiaries are
estimated to be as high as Y1,000bn.
The bank's announcement failed to encourage investors on the Tokyo stock
market yesterday and the shares fell Y20 to Y4,020.

<TEXT>
ITALIAN treasury officials and foreign bank creditors of Efim, the state
holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month, have arranged to
meet in London next week to try to resolve the severe differences which have
emerged over how to treat the group's large borrowings.
However, a treasury official yesterday denied the meeting implied the
Italian authorities were ready to change the conditions on bonds for
creditors announced last week.
The decision to hold a meeting followed a hastily arranged two-hour session
in Rome on Monday night between senior treasury officials and foreign bank
representatives at which the two sides exchanged views, but reached no
immediate decisions.
The meeting was convened after last week's decision by foreign bank
creditors to declare Efim in default on its borrowings and their threat to
take similar action over Italy's four biggest public sector groups, which
have just been transformed into joint stock companies.
The escalating tension between the foreign banks and the Italian authorities
over Efim followed last week's decision by the treasury to set the interest
payments on the bonds to be issued to cover Efim's borrowings at
substantially below current market levels.
While the five-year lira bonds would pay interest at 7.25 per cent annually,
those in Ecu would have a 4 per cent coupon.
Monday night's meeting included Mr Mario Draghi, the senior civil servant in
the treasury, as well as Mr Enrico Granata, one of the ministry's five
director generals and its top lawyer.
Also present were Mr Alberto Predieri, the special administrator appointed
to run Efim, and a representative from the Bank of Italy.
Treasury officials yesterday took pains to point out that no commitment had
been made to raise the interest rate on the bonds, one of the creditor
banks' main demands.
'The aim of the meeting was to exchange views and fix a working programme
for further talks in London,' said a spokesman.
A concession on the interest rates would represent a large climb down by the
Italian authorities, which have argued that creditor banks should have been
aware of Efim's perilous financial position.
However, the heavy borrowings of the four big public sector groups
transformed last week has left the new government exposed
This is particularly the case in view of the role foreign financial
institutions are likely to play in its accelerated privatisation programme.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann bravado is now thin
on the ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of the pioneering bravado has waned in the 2 1/2 years since Mannesmann
won its licence to operate Germany's first cellular telephone system  - a
move which marked its first significant departure from its traditional
engineering business, writes Christopher Parkes.
The initial total investment of Dollars 800m has drained group resources at
a time when profits have been squeezed by international recession and a
slow-down in home markets.
However, the network is up and running. Mannesmann, which owns 51 per cent
of Mobilfunk, along with partners Pacific Telesis of the US (26 per cent),
DG Bank (10 per cent), Cable &amp; Wireless (5 per cent), Lyonnaise des Eaux
(2.5 per cent) expect great things. But not quite yet.
Consumer confidence in Germany is low and falling. National retail sales
fell 6 per cent in July, just as D2 Privat, as it is known, and D1, the
federal telecommunications utility's competitor, made their debut.
So far it has about 10,000 subscribers, and has given itself nine years to
hit 2m. It aims to break even in 1994. But while the partners have been
spending, the Bonn telecommunications ministry has grown increasingly
enchanted by the notion of competition and mobile phones for all. Mr
Christian Schwarz-Schilling, the minister responsible, called in June for
bids for a licence for an E1 network.
It is potentially more flexible and cheaper than D1 and D2 and it is likely
to present a formidable challenge that was unforeseen when Mannesmann took
the plunge.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann down 89% in first
half

<TEXT>
MANNESMANN, the German engineering group, yesterday reported an 89 per cent
slump in first-half profits and placed most of the blame on launch costs for
its D2 Mobilfunk mobile telephone network. Net earnings dived from DM134m
(Dollars 90.50m) to DM15m on sales up 21 per cent to DM12.8bn.
However, underlying turnover stagnated and virtually all the increase was
due to consolidation of newly purchased vehicle component companies. It saw
no possibility of any basic improvement in the second half.
Even excluding costs associated with its entry into telecommunications, net
profits still shrank 27 per cent to DM165m from DM226m last time.
'High costs, global competition with inadequate prices, wide-ranging
declines in our markets and the dollar/D-Mark relationship are putting
earnings under pressure,' said Mr Werner Dieter, group chairman.
Even so, most Mannesmann divisions were doing better than average, he
claimed.
The telephone business, formally launched in July, recorded sales of just
DM1m in the first half. The network covers some 40 per cent of Germany and
70 per cent of the population at present.
The aim is to extend it to within reach of 80 per cent of the population by
the end of this year.
With an estimated 5,000 customers on-line at the launch, the group now has
10,000 and is counting on reaching 100,000 people by the middle of next
year.
Tax benefits related to the investment will not start to come through until
D2 shows its first profits.
Total group orders were up 18 per cent at DM15bn, again thanks mainly to
contracts booked with new acquisitions.
The plant and machinery divisions, which account for almost 40 per cent of
turnover, suffered from flat conditions in export markets and falling sales
at home.
Order intake, up a nominal 2 per cent, was 3 per cent down on a
like-for-like comparison.
Sales of steel tubes fell 10 per cent to DM2.35bn in the January to June
period under review because of heavy price competition from eastern Europe.
About half of the DM3.6bn-worth of new orders for vehicle components stemmed
from newly-consolidated subsidiaries VDO and Boge. In spite of difficulties
in world motor markets, this sector, which is the second biggest in
Mannesmann, showed a profit after losses last time estimated at DM110m.
First-half sales were up 96 per cent at DM3.5bn.
In spite of the boardroom gloom about short-term prospects, particularly in
the domestic market, exports from Germany rose 3 per cent and sales by
foreign subsidiaries increased 32 per cent to almost DM4bn.
Meanwhile, group investments rose by more than half to DM761m.
More than 80 per cent of the total was spent in Germany, mostly on the
mobile telephone network and in motor components.
Cost-cutting continued, and although acquisitions led to a 16 per cent
increase in numbers employed, the underlying figure fell by 4,500 people. At
the end of June the group had 141,000 people on its payroll, 101,000 of them
in Germany.

corporate gloom

<TEXT>
ROUSSEL-UCLAF, the French chemicals group, yesterday announced an 18.7 per
cent fall in interim net profits to FFr188m (Dollars 37.67m) in the first
half of 1992, compared with the same period last year.
The news of Roussel's decline in profits is the latest in a series of gloomy
announcements from the French corporate sector. The CAC-40 Index, yesterday
fell by 1.17 per cent to 1,737.
Roussel fared well in some markets during the first half, notably in health
care products, but suffered in others, particularly in veterinary products
where it has been hit by the economic problems of the former Soviet states.
The group mustered a modest 3.2 per cent increase in sales to FFr7.34bn in
the first half, and held the fall in net profits to 5 per cent on a
comparable basis, allowing for restructuring and exceptional items.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second largest banking group, expects to pass the
dividend for 1992 after making a substantial loss in the first half. The
dividend last year was DKr10 per share, totalling DKr463m (Dollars 82m).
The bank reported a DKr1.48bn first-half loss compared with a DKr728m profit
in the same period last year and a loss for the whole of 1991 of DKr1.55bn.
A substantial contribution to the first-half loss arose in the UK, where the
bank's subsidiary, Unidanmark Holding, reported a DKr508m loss, reflecting
provisions to cover falling property values.
The bank will cut staff at the London arm from 202 people to about 115 in
1993. The London bank's status will be changed from a subsidiary to a branch
of the Danish parent bank. Unidanmark parted company with its chief
executive, Mr Steen Rasborg, earlier this month in anticipation of the poor
first-half result.
No replacement for Mr Rasborg has so far been announced. The bank's
first-half result before provisions was down from DKr2.79bn last year to
DKr1.18bn. The main factor was a swing in the adjustment for the value of
its securities portfolio from a positive DKr1.43bn last year to a negative
DKr314m this year. Provisions climbed to DKr2.44bn from DKr2.00bn last year.
The bank's costs, however, declined from DKr3.33bn to DKr3.26bn.
The balance sheet total was down from DKr263bn at the end of last year to
DKr256bn.
The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the first half was 10.6 per cent,
against 10.4 per cent at the end of last year.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: New chief appointed at Hickson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International, the chemicals group which has been subjected to two
years of management upheaval, yesterday named Mr Dennis Kerrison, former
chief operating officer, as its new chief executive.
Sir Gordon Jones, who became chairman in June last year, said the
appointment of Mr Kerrison left Hickson with a 'very strong professional
board'. There would be 'no more madcap schemes, and no more major
acquisitions,' he said, referring to Hickson's 19 purchases between 1985 and
1989.
Mr Kerrison replaces Mr Ken Schofield, who retired in May after just 18
months in the post. Mr Schofield was responsible for launching a disposal
programme to refocus the group on its core chemicals businesses.
The appointment was announced as the group reported more than doubled
interim profits of Pounds 16.9m, aided by lower interest charges. The
pre-tax outcome compared with Pounds 7.9m last time, although this had been
struck after a Pounds 6.2m exceptional charge for losses on disposals and
restructuring costs.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 960,000, and gearing was
18.2 per cent. The ratio of debt to equity had been reduced from 134 per
cent through the Pounds 70m rights issue in September last year.
Disposals depressed turnover, which fell from Pounds 214m to Pounds 162.4m
for the six months to June 30. Like-for like sales rose by 3 per cent.
Similarly, operating profit fell by 4 per cent to 17.7m, due to disposals.
In the first half, Hickson added a further Pounds 2m in extra-ordinary
charges to the Pounds 9.6m taken last year, to provide for losses on
disposals. The company plans to sell the two remaining floor covering
operations.
The best performance came from protection and coatings, which increased
profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 3.8m. 'Previously, when Hickson made some
of these acquisitions, the company did not manage them,' said Mr Kerrison.
The main fine chemicals operation increased profits by 4 per cent to Pounds
7.5m.
Earnings per share rose from 5.57p to 7.44p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 2.85p.
COMMENT
Sir Gordon is very aware that the City wants to be convinced about the
credibility of the new management team. Until then, Hickson has little hope
 - or even intention  - of returning to shareholders for more cash. The
latest appointment will be seen as the final seal on what should be a more
stable era. Meanwhile, these results show a respectable performance, albeit
largely due to a rescue rights issue. In the short-term, the group sees no
sign of an upturn, and further difficult trading in the US. In the
longer-term, the acquisition of Angus Fine Chemicals in July will provide
good growth from 1993. Annual forecasts were revised downwards following the
group's cautious comments on the second half from about Pounds 35m to Pounds
31.5m. The shares fell in tandem, from 188p to 174p. On a prospective p/e of
about 13 times, the shares appear to be a better investment for
long-termers.

Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computing services group, yesterday denied a report
in a London newspaper which alleged the company's purchase of the remaining
shares in Hoskyns Group, the UK-based computer company, was under review.
CGS bought 69.5 per cent of Hoskyns from GEC/Siemens in 1990 and said it
would offer to buy the remaining shares in 1993.
Mr Michel Jalabert, CGS president, said the company had 'every intention' of
honouring its earlier commitment. In a statement, he said Hoskyns'
shareholders will be offered 'not less than 469p per share'.
Hoskyns' shares closed up 1p at 439p.
Mr Jalabert said the offer would be made within three months after Hoskyns
releases preliminary results, due in mid-December.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of William Bedford, the USM-traded antique restorer and dealer,
yesterday fell 3p to 15p after Mr John Bedford, chairman, issued a strong
warning on future trading.
If the government's deflationary policies continued unchanged and sterling
remained substantially overvalued against the dollar, then the outlook was
'grim', he said in his interim statement to June 30.
In the opening six months sales rose 12 per cent to Pounds 914,000 and
losses before tax were reduced from Pounds 76,000 to Pounds 22,000, after
overheads were cut by nearly 15 per cent. The figures last time included
Pounds 113,000 gain on sale of assets, less Pounds 85,000 compensation for
loss of office.
Losses per share came to 0.5p (1.07p).

Turnover declined to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 1.33m) and there were operating

The pre-tax result was after net interest received of Pounds 202,000 (Pounds

General Cable, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Compagnie Generale des Eaux, has
bought IVS Cable Holdings' 87.5 per cent stake in Sheffield Cable Media for
Pounds 1.9m cash.
IVS is 49.5 per cent owned by Flextech, the USM-quoted company which sold
its original oil services business in May to develop its satellite and cable

Sheffield Cable was awarded the 210,000 home cable franchise for the city in

Flextech's cable interests with those of IVS.
Following the disposal of Sheffield Cable, IVS retains several smaller cable

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Loss at Den Norske Bank
increases to NKr1.162bn

<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday revealed an increase in
first-half net losses to NKr1.162bn (Dollars 201m) from a loss of NKr921m in
the same period last year.
DnB's A-shares plunged 22 per cent to NKr4.30 on the Oslo bourse, following
the news. The bank admitted that increasing losses will make it difficult to
comply with the state's demand that it break even in 1992. The demand was
made in connection with a NKr5.9bn state cash injection received by DnB last
December which gave the state a 55.6 per cent stake.
Non-performing loans increased to NKr10.7bn by the end of June, from
NKr10.3bn at end-March and NKr10.2bn at the end of last year. Gross
non-performing loans rose to NKr19.7bn by end-June from NKr19.1bn at
end-1991.
DnB's first-half figures for this year and last are not directly comparable
because this year's figures include Realkreditt, a mortgage company,
acquired by the bank last December in connection with the state rescue
package. Realkreditt, in the first half, accounted for nearly NKr200m of
DnB's overall losses. The bank warned that loan losses to the shipping
industry would be higher this year than last.
The bank's shipping portfolio is estimated at NKr22bn and first-half loan
loss provisions reached NKr181m, which the bank said would materialise into
losses.
On the bright side, first-half net interest income was up slightly to
NKr2.332bn from NKr2.254bn in the same period last year. Operating expenses
in the period were cut to NKr2.408bn from NKr2.450bn. The bank has set a
goal of maintaining annual operating expenses at NKr4.5bn. Credit losses
fell by NKr241m to NKr1.978bn.
'Although loan losses . . . are at an unacceptably high level, developments
are pointing in the right direction,' said Mr Finn A. Hvistendahl, group
managing director.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, is
continuing its restructuring by selling its electro-plating division to
Elf-Aquitaine, the French state-controlled energy group.
The deal with Elf comes shortly after last month's DM660m (Dollars 445.9m)
sale of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals subsidiaries to Witco of
the US. The two disposals form part of the German group's strategy of
focusing on its core businesses in pharmaceuticals and plant protection
chemicals by selling other interests where it has a smaller market presence.
Schering, which recently reported a fall in earnings of 4 per cent to DM179m
on sales of DM3.4bn for the first half of this year, has been known to be in
discussion with a number of prospective purchasers for the electro-plating
business, which has annualised sales of about FFr1bn (Dollars 202m) and
1,100 employees.
Elf has agreed to buy the business from Schering for an undisclosed sum. It
will integrate it within its Elf-Atochem chemicals division. Elf-Atochem has
significant plating interests, which make annual sales of FFr800m, chiefly
through its M &amp; T Harshaw business in the US.
The Schering electro-plating businesses, which are concentrated in Europe,
will complement Elf-Atochem's existing interests in North America.
Elf-Aquitaine, which staged a successful FFr2.08bn sale of a 2.3 per cent
minority stake in its shares, has been expanding its interests across the
energy and chemicals sphere.
The French group sustained a slight decline in net income from FFr10.6bn in
1990 to FFr9.8bn on sales of FFr200.7bn in 1991. Morgan Stanley, the
securities house, forecast a further fall in earnings per share from FFr35
in 1991 to FFr28 this year because of the sluggish economic backdrop and the
weakness of refined product prices and the US dollar.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford appointed at Pacific
Horizon Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAILLIE GIFFORD is now the investment manager of Pacific Horizon Investment
Trust, after the trust's shareholders overwhelmingly supported the board at
two extraordinary meetings yesterday.
Victory for the board became certain on Monday when Jupiter Tyndall, the
former manager, withdrew its proposals to reorganise the trust.
Jupiter Tyndall did not propose its own resolutions yesterday.
Nevertheless, Mr Garnet Harrison, chairman of Pacific Horizon, went to the
trouble of proposing the Jupiter Tyndall motions himself  - and then voting
against them.
The resolutions were accordingly defeated overwhelmingly, with proxy votes
of about 23.2m shares backing the board, and less than 200,000 supporting
Jupiter Tyndall.
The proposal to install Baillie Gifford as manager was opposed by only 0.004
per cent of shareholders.
Baillie Gifford plans to widen the trust's portfolio to cover markets such
as Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
Mr Harrison said it was a pity that Jupiter Tyndall had not withdrawn its
proposals at an earlier stage.
But he added: 'We are delighted that shareholders have supported the board's
proposals in such a conclusive way and that the long period of uncertainty
has come to an end.'
However, there are still some questions about the future of the trust.
Jupiter Tyndall amassed a substantial stake in the process of blocking a bid
by Martin Currie Pacific, and may yet agree to sell its holding to a
predator.

BRITISH Telecommunications is planning to invest about Dollars 1bn (Pounds
500m) over the next ten years to build a network outside the UK to support
its ambition to become the world's leading telecommunications group.
The investment project, code-named Cyclone, will start with the installation
next year of four large computerised exchanges in New York, Frankfurt,
London and Sydney.
These will be followed by a further 28 switching centres in main business
centres worldwide.
The aim of the project is to put in place infrastructure which several
different BT business units could then use to provide multinational
customers with a range of voice, data and video services.
But it is not clear how the project will interface with other BT global
initiatives  - in particular Syncordia, a US-based subsidiary which provides
sophisticated telecommunications services to multinationals, and Global
Network Services, the international data networking venture.
Mr Graham Wilde, vice president of CIT Research, a UK telecommunications
consultancy, said: 'I am not sure even they know exactly what they are
doing.'
BT refused to comment on the project.
The group is understood to view Cyclone as an important step in its plan to
steal a march in the international telecommunications business over rivals
such as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph of the US, the UK's Cable and
Wireless, Germany's Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom.
As the telecommunications industry opens up to competition, such groups are
considering similar initiatives to BT's. But their plans are mostly not as
definite or advanced.
In most countries, regulations protecting national monopolies would
currently prevent BT from offering the full range of services it envisages.
However, the company has decided to take the initiative by anticipating and
pushing for changes in regulations.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, has repeatedly predicted that international
regulations will change in response to customer demand and advances in
technology.
Mr Wilde said BT's approach was one of 'shoot first and ask questions
later.'
In a separate development, BT announced yesterday that it had signed a
contract to provide BP Chemicals with a fully managed European network.
The network will use services supplied by both Syncordia and GNS.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Pifco shows sharp contraction to
Pounds 1.17m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIFCO HOLDINGS, the electrical appliances group, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.17m for the year to April 30.
The outcome was down on last time's Pounds 3.69m but marked the first annual
result to include Russell Hobbs Tower, the kettle and cookware maker which
had incurred losses of Pounds 30.6m in the 28 months up to its acquisition
in April 1991.
Pifco bought RHT for Pounds 7.75m from the administrators of Polly Peck
International.
Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said that by the year-end RHT 'was trading
close to break-even and should make a profit contribution in the coming
year'.
He ascribed the turnround not to 'restructuring in a major way', but to a
'downsizing' and a 'focus on profitable sales, not volume'.
As a whole, Mr Webber said, Pifco 'was not chasing market share', but 'new
products leading to new prices is the engine of growth'.
Export sales expanded from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 7.6m and accounted for 19
per cent of the group total. He said he was looking to make 'digestible'
acquisitions in Europe.
The group manufactures half its own products, with the other half made by
others to Pifco's specifications. Mr Webber said this gave 'leverage on
capital employed'.
Group turnover rose 71 per cent to Pounds 40m (Pounds 23.3m), though RHT
accounted for all that growth and more, said Mr Webber.
Trading profits were halved at Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 2.61m) before interest
payable of Pounds 62,000, against receivable of Pounds 1.09m accrued on the
pre-RHT Pounds 8.7m cash pile. At the year-end cash balances stood at Pounds
957,000.
Earnings shrank to 13.9p (32.6p) per share but the final dividend is
unchanged at 4.25p for a same-again 7.75p total.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: T Cowie clarifies offer for Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader locked in a fiercely-contested Pounds 32.3m
takeover battle with rival Henlys Group, has written a four page letter to
its target's shareholders following a request from the Takeover Panel to
clarify five points in its latest offer document.
The clarification comes after three earlier statements from Cowie
withdrawing or clarifying remarks made by it or its advisers.
The Panel asked Cowie to redraw a chart in its final offer document to
ensure it was not misleading. It asked for clarification of a sentence about
Henlys' 'falling dividend' to show that Henlys has forecast a maintained
dividend. Cowie was also asked to explain another chart which showed the
share price performance of Henlys' shares relative to the motors sector.
Cowie withdrew the word 'consistently' used in a press release to describe
Henlys' performance against the sector. The chart showed Henlys' shares had
outperformed between 1987 and 1989.
The last point concerned a series of statements made in the Cowie offer
document which, if put together, could amount to a profit forecast for the
current year of not less than Pounds 13.7m.
At the panel's request Cowie has now backed up this forecast with the
assumptions it is based on and with letters from its auditor and merchant
bank. Cowie has already reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 12.1m for the
first half of 1992. The forecast is well below the Pounds 25m pre-tax
estimate analysts have for the company, which Cowie had to distance itself
from.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 11.5% growth at Micro Focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Micro Focus, the computer software company, yesterday rose 90p to
Pounds 15.43, boosted by reassuring first half results showing an 11.5 per
cent lift in pre-tax profit.
The shares, which are also quoted on Nasdaq in the US, had been at a 12
month low of Pounds 14.53 after being as high as Pounds 23.78.
Mr Paul O'Grady, chairman, said he believed that US investors had assumed
the results would be below or at the bottom end of analysts' predictions,
following a series of poor results from US software houses.
In the event, the interim figures were at the top end and maintained the
company's reputation for strong growth despite a tough market.
The company was now reporting its results primarily in dollars, arguing that
currency fluctuations reduce increases in revenues, earnings and cash
deposits when stated in sterling.
Pre-tax profits were up from Dollars 15.4m to Dollars 17.2m (Pounds 8.9m),
earned on revenues 25 per cent higher at Dollars 54.4m (Dollars 43.6m).
Net income per share was 80 cents (70 cents). In keeping with US software
house practice the company did not propose a dividend and Mr O'Grady said it
was not considering changing.
The company specialises in software products which make it easier for other
companies to write programs. Mr O'Grady said direct sales grew by 30 per
cent, while sales to manufacturers such as IBM, Siemens Nixdorf and Groupe
Bull for resale showed slight growth.
Micro Focus expected to be able to exploit a move among users of open or
industry standard systems through a product which makes it easier to write
Cobol business language programs for the Unix operating system.
Although market conditions were tough, he expected the company to maintain
growth of profits and revenues in the second half of the year.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reflex shares are left for the overwriters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While underwriters are being forced to buy up shares left in flotations and
rights issues, Butler &amp; Briscoe, the Dublin stockbrokers, proved the value
of 'overwriters' when a tender offer for shares in Reflex Investments, an
Irish computer company, found no response.
The term overwriters describes people who guarantee to sell shares rather
than buy them. But unlike underwriters, the Reflex overwriters did not get
paid a commission.
Reflex, a loss-making computer leasing group which is transforming itself
into a software company, persuaded Mr Martin Anthony Kilduff to come in as
chairman. Mr Kilduff has won a reputation as a computer wizard after
building up Kindle, his own software group, and selling out to ACT.
Mr Kilduff bought a 5.2 per cent stake in Reflex in May, at prices of about
18p, but wanted to raise this to 29.9 per cent before he would take the
chair.
Earlier this month Reflex agreed to place 780,000 new shares with him and he
launched the tender offer to buy another 3.4m shares, all at 13 1/2 p  -
well below the market price.
Yesterday Butler &amp; Briscoe announced that no shareholders had taken
advantage of the tender. As a result a group of shareholders which had
agreed to overwrite the tender were called on to supply the stock. Reflex
shares were yesterday quoted at 25p.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cost-cuts help Quicks to Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quicks Group, the Manchester-based vehicles and parts distributor, turned in
a more than three-fold increase, from Pounds 310,000 to Pounds 1.11m, in
interim pre-tax profits, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 fell to Pounds 99.4m (Pounds 107.1m),
but cost-cutting and moves to raise margins kept operating profits at Pounds
2.01m, only down Pounds 10,000.
The strong performance ends two years' struggle to reorganise in the
recession. The company made only Pounds 58,000 pre-tax in 1991 after losing
Pounds 896,000 in 1990.
It was hit by difficulties in its leasing division, from which it is
disengaging.
Earnings per share rose to 4.4p (1.4p). The interim dividend is raised to
1.75p (1p), payable from earnings of 4.4p (1.4p) per share.

FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Struggling with the US market - Richard
Lapper on the tough going for insurance brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S decision by Sedgwick to cut its dividend is evidence of just how
difficult trading conditions have become for the leading international
insurance brokers.
Like the other three large publicly-quoted companies  - Marsh McLennan,
Alexander &amp; Alexander and Willis Corroon  - Sedgwick obtains more than 40
per cent of its brokerage revenue in the US and has been badly hit by the
intense competition in that market. While rates in some other insurance
markets have hardened recently, the US market remains stubbornly depressed.
Sedgwick's main competitors have all struggled to increase their income.
Alexander &amp; Alexander, which reported interim results last month, saw
operating revenues dip to Dollars 668m (Pounds 350m) from Dollars 676m.
Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest broker, saw an increase in revenues from
Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.5bn, but this was largely explained by the
inclusion of revenues from Faugere et Jutheau, the Paris-based subsidiary
acquired by Marsh earlier this year. In addition Marsh also benefits from
the income earned by Putnam, its investment management subsidiary.
Willis Corroon, which is tipped to report reduced pre-tax profits when it
reports interim figures tomorrow, is also expected to have found the going
tough in the US. All four companies have also been faced with a fall in
interest rates worldwide, which has dented investment earnings, while
Sedgwick and Willis, in particular, have been badly hit the fall in the
weakness of the dollar. Roughly 60 per cent of Sedgwick's income is in
dollars.
Analysts have been expecting the US insurance companies to begin to increase
premium rates, following a period of intense competition and heavy
underwriting losses.
Instead Mr Quill Healey, chief executive of Sedgwick James USA, said rates
had fallen by a further 30 per cent in some cases.
Mr Healey said Sedgwick had met with 25 of the biggest insurance companies
with which it places business. 'Invariably each company says the other 24
companies are so very competitive and are going broke. The fact is that each
company is fighting hard to maintain existing accounts and win new business.
it is very very competitive,' said Mr healey.
Rates on a typical property policy had fallen by between 10 and 15 per cent.
Rates on contractors' policies 'the sort of thing we would sell in Boise,
Idaho,' had fallen by 30 per cent, said Mr Healey.
He added that low interest rates in the US were partially responsible for
the continued ferocity of rate competition. Falls in interest rates were
increasing the value of bond portfolios, with capital gains from this source
offsetting underwriting losses.

FT  19 AUG 92 / SAS returns to black in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airline Systems (SAS) yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of
SKr502m (Pounds 49.3m) for the first six months of the year, compared with a
SKr1.025bn loss during the same period in 1991.
The airline's operating revenue rose by almost 5 per cent to SKr16.138bn
from SKr15.158bn.
Mr Jan Carlzon, SAS chief executive and president, said the airline had
'bucked the trend amongst most European airlines' during the first half of
the year by moving into profit.
He suggested this was because SAS had 'moved earlier and more forcefully to
realign its cost structure to create a more efficient operating base' in
response to the increasing competitiveness in the European civil aviation
industry and the downturn in demand.
SAS estimated its financial results for the second half of the year would be
close to break even, but the profit for the whole of 1992 would be only
marginally better than the result for the first half.
Mr Carlzon said the result for the second half would be affected by adverse
foreign exchange transactions, a continuing weak market in SAS's main areas
of activity in the Nordic region, western Europe and trans-Atlantic routes,
and the cost of integrating Lineflyg, Sweden's domestic airline, into SAS's
structure.
SAS made a pre-tax profit in its airline operations of SKr492m in the first
six months of the year, compared with a SKr543m loss for the same period of
last year.
Its passenger traffic volume rose by 3 per cent and production by 5 per
cent, as SAS increased its share of a declining business travel market.
Its charter airline business continued to run at a loss. In the first six
months it suffered a deficit of SKr64m, though this was better than the
SKr151m deficit for the first six months of last year which was affected by
the Middle East war.
SAS's losses in its international hotel operations fell to SKr95m from
SKr362m for the first six months of last year, while its service activities
made a SKr78m profit, compared with an SKr18m loss for the same period of
last year.
Mr Carlzon said that SAS would continue to restructure and improve its
efficiency with job cuts and rationalisation of its organisation as it
struggled to increase market share in Scandinavia.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Drug groups launch venture in US: SmithKline and Marion
Merrell Dow link to market OTC medicines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-US pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, is to create a partnership with Marion Merrell Dow to develop and
market over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription medicines in the US.
The new group would have had sales last year of Dollars 660m (Pounds 345.5m)
and operating profits of Dollars 120m, making it the fifth largest OTC group
in the US. SmithKline Beecham's shares closed down 7p at 455p.
SmithKline Beecham will initially own 90 per cent and Marion Merrell Dow 10
per cent of the partnership. SmithKline Beecham's American OTC sales last
year were about Dollars 550m, while Marion Merrell Dow's were Dollars 111m.
The aim is a 50-50 arrangement as new products are licensed. The companies
said they were committed to similar co-operation in other countries. Mr John
Ziegler, North American president of SmithKline Beecham consumer brands,
will lead the partnership.
Mr Bob Bauman, the Anglo-US group's chief executive said: 'When SmithKline
Beecham was created we said our vision was to achieve leadership in
healthcare and in each of our four business segments.' He added that the
partnership with Marion Merrell Dow was another step towards achieving this
goal.
Both groups have prescription products that could be marketed by the new
group. SmithKline Beecham has asked the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for an OTC licence for Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug whose patents run
out in 1994. It had worldwide sales last year of more than Dollars 1bn.
Marion Merrell Dow said it might seek OTC licences for Seldane, an
anti-histamine, and the anti-smoking products, Nicorette and Nicoderm.
Nicoderm, which uses a transdermal patch, was launched in 1991, and had
sales of Dollars 137m during the first six months of this year.
'The deal is rather imprecise,' said Mr Jonathan de Pass, pharmaceuticals
analyst at BZW. 'It all depends on whether they receive FDA approval for
Seldane and Tagamet, and whether they successfully extend the relationship
worldwide. If they do, the implications are enormous.'
Safety concerns about the new partnership's Seldane and Tagamet may delay or
prevent FDA approval.
Seldane is potentially dangerous to patients with a damaged liver or those
taking two other drugs, Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal treatment, and
Erythromycin, an antibiotic. There are also fears that patients with stomach
cancer could mis-diagnose an ulcer and buy Tagamet.

FT  19 AUG 92 / American dream turns sour: Alan Cane on troubles at Wang,
product of a genius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wang Laboratories, which yesterday sought protection from its creditors in
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is an American business dream turned
sour.
Founded in 1951 by Dr An Wang, a Chinese immigrant with a prodigious talent
for invention, the company at one time had annual sales in excess of Dollars
3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and employed more than 31,000 people.
If it had continued to grow at the pace it set in the early 1980s, it would
by now have outstripped International Business Machines, the world's
dominant computer company, and have annual sales in excess of Dollars 100bn.
Revenue projections for small, rapidly growing companies tend to produce
such fantastic scenarios. But Wang seemed destined to become a significant
minicomputer company by any measure.
Dr Wang's genius was to recognise the potential for small computer systems
in the office. He pioneered a way of thinking about office automation that
was exactly right for the time. Wang essentially invented computer-based
word processing and the quality of Wang's word processing software remains
convincing even today.
But times and technology change, and Wang's tragedy lay in failing to keep
pace either with technology or with fast-evolving markets.
Yesterday, when chairman and chief executive Mr Richard W. Miller
reluctantly put the company into bankruptcy, annual revenues had slipped to
less than Dollars 2bn, staff numbers had been reduced to just over 13,000
and debt stood at about Dollars 540m.
For Mr Miller, it was a disappointing end to a three-year battle to return
Wang to profitability. Appointed in 1989 as president and chief operating
officer, he took over as chief executive on Dr Wang's death from cancer in
1990. He cut costs, improved operating efficiency and paid off Dollars 575m
in debt. On its own, the company's resources and cash flow proved
insufficient to complete the restructuring process.
The final straw seems to have been a decision on the part of IBM not to
proceed with a second tranche of funding which it agreed with Wang last
year. The former bitter competitors agreed an iconoclastic deal. IBM would
invest up to Dollars 100m in Wang which would in turn distribute IBM's
mid-range systems alongside its VS minicomputer range.
It seems, however  - and in spite of official denials  - that Wang was not
able to fulfil its part of the bargain. IBM seems to have decided to cut its
losses and refuse further cash injections.
Wang is the most dramatic victim to date of the savage changes within the
computer industry which have damaged growth of revenues and profits for all
the big players. IBM and Digital Equipment, the world's largest mainframe
and minicomputer manufacturers respectively, both lost money last year and
have put in place traumatic restructuring measures.
These include the plummeting costs of computer hardware, a move towards
standard rather than proprietary systems among customers and a questioning
attitude among customers about the value of further investment in computer
systems. The recession in most of the world's developed markets has also put
a cap on capital spending.
Wang's problems, however, can be traced back to at least a decade ago when
analysts first began to realise that the hitherto pace-setting company was
failing to keep pace with some critical technological changes.
Over the succeeding years it continued to lose touch, failing to exploit
industry trends like the move to personal computers  - which essentially
destroyed Wang's market for minicomputer-based word processing systems  -
and the development of open, nonproprietary computer designs. It also built
up debt which in 1989 was close to Dollars 1bn.
Other companies have fallen into the same trap  - Digital Equipment of the
US is one, Norsk Data of Norway another  - but Wang was also plagued by
management changes at the top which cost the company its sense of direction
at the critical time.
Dr Wang relinquished control of the company first to Mr John Cunningham and
then to his son Frederick, taking up the reins himself again in 1989 as the
situation deteriorated. Mr Miller was appointed shortly afterwards as Dr
Wang's illness worsened.
What is the future for the company? A buyer seems doubtful. Mr Miller says
he is committed to staying with Wang and transforming it from debt-laden
manufacturer to finely focused software and services company specialising in
office automation.
Computing services is the only route available to computer companies which
have failed as manufacturers but Wang still commands respect for the
excellence of much of its technology.
It has some 35,000 customers world-wide for its minicomputers, many
fervently loyal to the company, and it can still claim to be a pioneer in
office imaging systems  - potentially a large and profitable market.
In the UK, its best market outside the US, its largest reseller Text Systems
of London pledged support to its customers.
Mr John Podbury, managing director, paid tribute to the company's efforts to
pull back from the brink. But heroics are not enough in computer markets.
For Mr Miller and his greatly reduced company, Chapter 11 is only the

FT  19 AUG 92 / Sedgwick dividend cut after profit fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP and unexpected deterioration in trading conditions in the US and
falling interest rates hit profits at Sedgwick, the UK's second biggest
insurance broker, which yesterday cut its interim dividend. Its shares fell
34p to 110p.
A payout of 3p compares with an interim dividend of 4p at the half-way stage
last year. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 51.7m, down from Pounds 65.3m.
Earnings per share fell to 7.4p compared with 10p per share last year.
Mr David Rowland, the outgoing chairman, said Sedgwick had kept its dividend
at 12p since 1986 when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 136m. But as
profits have fallen steadily since then, Sedgwick has struggled to maintain
cover.
Mr Rowland attributed the cut to difficulties in trading conditions and
further reductions in premium rates, especially in the United States which
generates 40 per cent of operating revenues.
'Dividend cuts come about for other reasons than 'disasters in business','
said Mr Rowland, who is expected to take over as chairman of Lloyd's of
London next year.
Operating income was down by 1 per cent to Pounds 323.3m, with US income
down to Pounds 110m from Pounds 113m. 'Rates are continuing to go downwards.
It is very, very competitive,' said Mr Quill Healey, chief executive
Sedgwick James USA.
In London Sedgwick Payne, the specialist reinsurance broking subsidiary, has
suffered from the virtual disappearance of the retrocession (the reinsurance
of reinsurance) market, following heavy losses in recent years. In spite of
an increase in income from financial reinsurances, reinsurance revenues were
also down.
Expenses remain stubbornly high. Staff numbers were reduced by 89 during the
year, but expenses rose to to Pounds 291.1m from Pounds 286.6m.
Investment income fell 11 per cent to Pounds 26.3m. US interest rates after
hedging were 6.7 per cent compared with 7.6 per cent last year. UK rates
after hedging were 11.3 per cent, compared with 13.1 per cent last year.
Underwriting losses of Pounds 1.9m at the River Thames Insurance depressed
profits earned by associated companies to Pounds 200,000 from Pounds 1.6m.
Interest payable increased to Pounds 7m from Pounds 5.4m.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Cowie must clarify Henlys offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Takeover Panel has told T Cowie, the motor dealer bidding for rival
Henlys Group, to clarify five points in its final offer document issued last
week. The latest request follows other clarifications and withdrawals of
remarks made during the bid which the panel has required.
The first of the five points concerned a bar chart comparing the two groups'
net assets. Cowie's offer document showed the chart (above right) with the
vertical scale starting at Pounds 40m.
The panel asked that it be redrawn (below right) with the scale commencing
at zero 'to ensure there is no misleading impression'.
The panel said the many clarifications  - and the recent knuckle-rap of
Dowty advisers in the TI/Dowty bid  - did not reflect any new get-tough
policy.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Sponsors steer clear of Soviet coup festivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to win private-sector backing for celebrations in Moscow to mark
the defeat of the Soviet coup a year ago have ended in chaos.
The organising committee, taking into account the dire state of Russia's
finances, sought sponsorship for the festivities from the many private
businesses established since the Soviet grip on the economy was loosened.
The committee asked a private company to take on the task of finding
sponsorship for the estimated Rbs70m-90m cost of the 'Vivat Rossiya' (Long
live Russia) celebrations.
But the company failed to deliver, blaming the lack of a role for a
principal sponsor and the absence of an interest-free loan from the state.
Mr Grigory Andreyev, a member of the organising committee, said an afternoon
of band music and entertainment scheduled for Red Square on Saturday was one
of the casualties.
He said the celebrations were important because 'we still hope that what
started in August will prevail . . . that democracy and freedom will
prevail'.
While the state as usual is expected to stump up some money at the last
minute, recriminations are rife over who is responsible for the debacle.
The director of one Moscow advertising agency, who said he stood on the
barricades last year, had advised his clients against providing finance
because there was no principal sponsor slot.
Still to go ahead are a voluntary gathering tonight of people who 'defended'
President Boris Yeltsin's 'White House' against Soviet army tanks, as well
as a rally attended by Russian leaders tomorrow. There will also be a
service tomorrow in memory of the three young people who died when tanks
rumbled through Moscow, followed by brass-band and rock concerts on
Saturday.
More traditional methods have been used in St Petersburg, Russia's second
largest city. The celebrations are to be financed by a Rbs800,000 grant from
the city budget, although the prospect of 'freedom marches' organised by the
city authorities is reminiscent of old-style birthday celebrations for the
Communist Youth League.
Some inhabitants were also bemused by plans to award 600 medals to defenders
of freedom in the city when tanks came nowhere near it. Mayor Anatoly
Sobchak will have returned from a holiday in Barcelona in time to preside
over the proceedings, although his city's economic situation is as dire as
Moscow's.
However, the razzmatazz may fall rather flat. Public indifference has long
replaced the euphoria which followed the coup's collapse on August 21,
suggesting that there is little demand for celebrations.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Experience in greater demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We agree with Mr Kevin Goldstein-Jackson's comments (Diary of a Private
Investor, August 8) that current practices in relation to the selection and
appointment of non-executive directors are not entirely satisfactory.
The IoD's experience is that there has been a change in the specifications
for non-executive directors drawn up by more enlightened chairmen. The
demand now is for experienced, competent executives who know the tough
action that has to be taken when a business begins to decline.
Since Mr Goldstein-Jackson joined the IoD's non-executive director register
in November, it has almost doubled. It now has many people of considerable
ability, including a growing number of women, all of whom are seeking
independent directorships. In a market where only 27 per cent of these
appointments are placed with outside agencies, the competition is
considerable.
Having said that, we are happy to have someone of Mr Goldstein-Jackson's
calibre on our register and will not hesitate to recommend him when the
opportunity arises.
Peter Morgan,
Institute of Directors

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Western corporations should train a class of
business leaders in ex-communist states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BIJAN-DANIEL KHEZRI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Michael Prowse's article ('Slim pickings for the
hungry bear', August 14) on the depth of Russia's economic crisis.
The question it raises is whether western aid to Russia is adequate. He
argues that the G7 could have created a new organisation dedicated solely to
assisting the formerly communist countries.
Unfortunately, his propositions only echo the inadequacies of the west's
involvement in the reform process. It has been following a perspective of
systems and institutions which, among others, emphasises the role of the
IMF. We should, rather, be looking more at aid at the grassroots level.
A grassroots approach, such as the temporary integration of students and
young managers from former communist countries into western corporations,
should be expanded. The extension of such a programme could make an
important contribution to reform.
The experience gained in western business would allow the students to
develop a practical approach and obtain a working understanding of the close
links been a free-market economy and democracy.
Western corporations should consider the integration of qualified students
from former communist countries during the summer as a business strategy,
rather than as a philanthropic gesture. Successful interns could become
prospective management employees at the companies' branches in the former
communist countries.
It would also benefit the reform process if more western students and young
managers participated in a similar internship programme in the former
communist countries.
This is preferable to smothering former communists with advice and pumping
billions of dollars into non-existent macroeconomic structures.
Financial aid alone will not establish the macroeconomic structures that are
so urgently needed for the establishment of a free market.

The job has changed hands five times in the past six years, and became
available again two weeks ago after the autocratic chairman, Rudolph
Sprungli, 72, suddenly married a woman 28 years his junior who had
reportedly been meddling in the selection of company executives.
Fortunately, there are still some members of the family prepared to step in.
Luzius Sprungli, the chairman's younger son, plans to join as assistant
marketing director next year. His older brother, Rudolf, was ejected by his

He did his dissertation at the University of St Gallen on 'The new role of

Why aren't there more small businessmen in Britain's class-ridden honours
system? It is well known that the Cabinet Office is keen to rejig the
honours system and reward people on the basis of merit rather than status.
Observer hears that when the faceless bureaucrats at the Department of Trade
and Industry were asked recently to put forward more names of small
entrepreneurs for the honours list, they had a ready excuse as to why it
would be inadvisable. Apparently, the DTI seems to be under the impression
that most small businessmen, in order to be successful, have to sail close
to the law . . . .
If true, it's an interesting perspective on how civil servants see business,
and why it is difficult to succeed in the UK.

If confirmation were needed that the bottom has fallen out of the market for
ex-tycoons' luxury yachts, then the sad saga of Aristotle Onassis's old
flagship, Christina, is the final word.
Only two buyers turned up at yesterday's auction and neither was prepared to
match the Dollars 4.2m starting price. The Christina is nearly twice as long
as the late Robert Maxwell's Lady Ghislaine, and has been used by everyone
from Marlon Brando and Sir Winston Churchill, to Maria Callas, Jackie
Kennedy and members of the British royal family. It is very much a luxury
item.
Named after Onassis' late daughter, the yacht was given to the Greek
government in 1978 in the hope that it might serve as a presidential yacht.
However, the authorities could not afford the Dollars 1.5m a year
maintenance bills. When it was first put up for sale at the end of 1990, the
sellers were looking for Dollars 15m. Now the price is to be reduced again.
Pity that Peter Clowes is out of circulation. The price is getting down
towards the Dollars 2.5m he paid for Boukephalis, one of Christina Onassis's
other old yachts.

If the users of 'Tecs' were not confused enough by the anonymous acronym for
the new Training and Enterprise Councils, it seems that two of the new
institutions are shaping up for a battle royal over the right to use the
same meaningless name.
Central England Training and Enterprise Council, based in Redditch, and
Central London Tec, both want to call themselves 'Centec'. So far the
exchanges have been polite, if cool. But it is already causing considerable
confusion with confidential papers from government destined for the
respective Tecs ending up on the wrong desks. 'All their budget papers have
been circulated to me by mistake,' says Gwynneth Flower, chief executive of
the London-based Tec. 'I don't know if they have ours.'
The Redditch-based Tec claims it started using the name first. When it was
set-up two years ago it was aware there was a company called Centec and so
it registered itself as the Central England Tec, but quickly became known as
Centec. For its part, the new Tec in London says that it spotted that the
original Centec had gone into liquidation and registered itself as Centec.
At present, there seems little room for negotiation. Flower, a determined
woman who used to work for GKN, says with some irritation: 'Centec is the
registered name of this Tec and any other company using it is doing so
illegally.'
Both sides admit that it would be a waste of public money, and bad for the
image of the struggling Tecs, to end up in the courts. But neither seems
ready to stand down. 'We have taken legal advice,' says Flower ominously.
However, Rodney Skidmore, chief executive of the other Centec, and an
ex-Army officer is not going to be pushed around. 'On a point of law it
doesn't matter who registered the name, it is public usage that matters and
we had that first.' Sounds like time for a government referee to step in
before this dispute gets too silly.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: Relativism on the beach - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE LIVE in an age of relativism. On Sunday, Channel 4 began a three-part
series called The Real Thing which has a script so arch it should be
straddling the Champs Elysees, and that makes it somewhat difficult to
understand. However, the main thrust of its argument seems to be that
science is a lot of nasty stuff dreamed up by a few clever-clogs to
interfere with the instinctive wisdom of the noble savage, and that we are
now, thank goodness, moving from the age of reason back into older habits of
superstition. This programme is quite happy to consider on an equal footing
the claims of the witch doctor and the modern surgeon. Relativism rules, OK?
Only 30 years ago, the need to explain why Keats was a better poet than Bob
Dylan would not have arisen because the question would not have arisen.
Today many members of the younger generation seem not only unsure about the
relative merits of Keats and Dylan (in many cases they would champion Dylan
as the greater poet because they have heard his lyrics whereas they have
never read any Keats), but reluctant to distinguish at all between good and
bad, to admit that scientific medicine is superior to voodoo, or that there
is good art and bad.
The greatest influence in creating this sad state of affairs is surely
television which assesses the significance of its programmes in terms not of
their quality but of their ratings. The modern craze for sociology has
reinforced the tendency. When soap opera is considered at all, it is
considered not in terms of the quality of its drama but as a ratings
contestant or as a jokey social phenomenon: isn't it funny, quite sensible
people get hooked on them; panel investigations suggest that although some
fans like to pretend that they 'really believe', deep down they know
perfectly well that it is all fiction, so that's all right isn't it.
Most insidious of all is the modern relativist's argument that in the end,
when you come right down to it, there is nothing much to choose between
Eldorado and Hedda Gabler: the neighbours come round, there is an argument,
people shout at one another, sex rears its ugly head, everything blows up
into a flaming row, and we all get an exciting climax. What does Henrik
Ibsen have that Julia Smith doesn't? Perhaps the time has come to try to
answer that question. Perhaps the few of us who have always insisted that
there is a considerable quantity of very good material on British
television, and that we should seek it out as we seek out good books and
good operas, should stop being jokily dismissive about soap opera and try to
say why it really is inferior stuff.
Television has not shown any version of Hedda Gabler in the recent past (why
not?), but on Saturday Channel 4 did screen Fellini's astounding 1960 movie
La Dolce Vita which will serve well enough to show the sort of thing that
truly powerful drama can do which soap opera does not even attempt. La Dolce
Vita is knowingly a part of a long artistic continuum which, down the
centuries, has offered Italians, and of course everybody else, vividly
illustrated commentary upon man's moral condition. It opens and closes with
references to Dante. It is scathing not only about the church but about
mankind's weakness for religious hocus pocus. It turns a series of
spotlights on post-war Roman society and exposes the appalling contrast
between material progress  - cars, shops, architecture  - and spiritual
regression.
La Dolce Vita is certainly not beyond criticism: it is nihilistic, too long,
and irritatingly episodic. All its characters are ciphers. It builds a huge
pedestal for the absurdly shaped Anita Ekberg, its central icon (which, of
course, Fellini is mocking) and then turns its back and never takes another
look. It is flawed in other respects too. Yet at the end you could not
possibly be in any doubt that you have been brought right up against the
thinking of one man, and even if you do not agree with his thoughts they
have been conveyed with tremendous vigour. La Dolce Vita does what virtually
all good contemporary drama does: opens your eyes to forces, trends, or
events which you had not noticed or, if you had noticed them and been
puzzled, helps to explain them.
Eldorado does no such thing because that is not its purpose. Its purpose is
to attract a large audience (somewhere between 15m and 20m, though at
present it is managing only about 5m). If it were appearing on a commercial
network, the intention would be the delivery of all those millions to
advertisers and hence, in the end, profits for the shareholders of the
television company.
People frequently ask 'Why does the BBC bother to make soaps at all, given
that it isn't trying to make profits for shareholders?' The answer is that
the BBC has always known it has to run a broad church if it is to stay among
the big boys of broadcasting, which means continuing to win political
agreement to the licence fee. That in turn means avoiding the fate of
American public service broadcasters whose output is limited to worthy
programmes meaning that they cannot command sizeable public funds.
In order to attract large audiences you do not have to make people think,
force them to acknowledge changing morals, or require them to look in a
mirror and identify their own shortcomings. Your work does not have to have
that universality of application and appeal across geographical boundaries
and across the centuries which truly great drama has from Sophocles to
Shakespeare.
You can win huge audiences with the most mundane trivia. In the last few
episodes of Eldorado we have seen the Webbs (and of course Drew Lockhead,
not to mention Dieter) drinking too much. We have found that Bunny is
jealous of the attention paid by young men to his child bride Fizz. Blair,
threatened with parental discipline, disappeared. Someone painted threats on
the walls of Marcus Tandy's flat. The Hindles' mum decided Spain was not for
her and went home.
None of it has any significance other than to serve as the next link in an
endless narrative; it is as desultory and formless as garden fence gossip.
Though it is chiefly concerned with expatriates, it has nothing even mildly
significant to say about the irony of such status in a supposedly united
Europe. Eldorado has a more pictorially interesting background than most
soap operas, but there is never the slightest attempt to produce the sort of
striking images with which La Dolce Vita is packed. Worse, by sheer bad
luck, presumably, Eldorado, which was so heavily promoted as featuring sun,
sea and sangria, seems to be shot on days that are consistently cold and
dull.
Where La Dolce Vita has an outstanding central performance from Marcello
Mastroianni and several other impressive appearances, the acting in Eldorado
is at about the standard we used to expect from Crossroads. That is not to
say that Eldorado will not eventually do what the BBC wants and pull in
great big ratings. It is to say that we ought to begin challenging the
inverted snobs  - relativists all  - who maintain that La Dolce Vita (like
GBH or tomorrow's repeat of Alan Bennett's wonderful Talking Heads) is not
'better' than a soap opera, but merely different. Let's be quite clear about
this: despite the shortcomings of La Dolce Vita, it is in all respects
better. Soap opera should not be banned or even opposed, but we should
recognise it for what it is: rubbish.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: The Voysey Inheritance - Edinburgh International
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARLEY Granville Barker's The Voysey Inheritance has long been regarded as
one of the best English language plays of the 20th century, if only by a
minority of critics. By the standards of Granville Barker, it has been
performed quite often  - more than 100 times before the First World War and
periodically revived since. Some of his plays have not been performed at
all. This year's Edinburgh Festival is doing its utmost to make up for the
neglect.
When he planned it, Brian McMaster, the festival director, can hardly have
known the good fortune that was coming his way. For The Voysey Inheritance
is about fraud. A prominent solicitor invests his client's trust money on
his own account and spends quite a lot of it on his own account as well.
Gradually his family is drawn into the deceit. It is a question of
desperately moving money around faster and faster in order to conceal how
little of it remains.
For trust funds read pension funds and the contemporary ring is obvious.
Line after line could come out of reports of recent fraud cases. As old Mr
Voysey explains, to gain the confidence of his clients a financier needs a
reputation for wealth. 'And if one is not opulent in one's daily life, one
loses that wonderful financier's touch.'
Yet it is not the topicality alone that makes The Voysey Inheritance so
riveting. I have seen it before and admired it almost as much. As a play, it
is so splendidly adult. The theme is the ethics of business and let no one
say that that was a less complex subject in Edwardian times than it is
today. It was arguably more so because more people lived on capital, fraud
was unexpected and there were few regulations to prevent it.
Corruption was just as insidious. When the extent of Voysey's wrongdoing
becomes known, it is notable how many people join in the deceit in order to
protect themselves. Even the vicar, at one remove, goes in for blackmail to
cover his investments.
The strength of the play, however, goes beyond the subject-matter. There is
a mastery of character and dialogue which is unusual in English drama,
including Granville Barker's contemporary, Shaw.
At least four of the relatively minor parts stand out as gems of their kind.
One is Peacey, the faithful office clerk played by Ron Pember, who has known
about the fraud for years but wants a handout in cash to keep his son at
Cambridge. Another is old Mrs Voysey, who has known as well but never
discussed business with her husband. She has great presence but very few
lines; played by Gillian Martell, she scores with every shot.
Then there is Frank Middlemass as George Booth, the old friend of Voysey,
who stands to lose a great deal of money, even though he can afford to do
so. He could be a bit of a stooge, but is played here with dignity and some
feeling. The minor character who excels most of all is Peter Blythe as Major
Voysey, the military member of the family with little brain but loud voice.
'What England wants,' he says, 'is chest]' This part is a masterpiece of
comic writing.
The play has its weaknesses. Edward, the Voysey son, who undertakes to put
right his father's malpractice, starts out as something of a prig and is a
hard role to deliver. Nevertheless, Peter Lindford goes as close as humanly
possible to bringing him off. The other weakness, which has always dogged
the play, is Granville Barker's attempt to drag in an extra theme of sexual
equality. The on-off romance between Edward and his independent cousin and
heiress, Alice, does not quite work. In William Gaskill's production, it is
reduced to a minor impediment.
Gaskill has taken advantage of everything on offer. The beautifully
refurbished Lyceum Theatre is exactly the right place for this play. The
stage, with sets designed by Hayden Griffin, is big enough to accommodate
it. The dinner table, around which all family disputes ultimately take
place, is displayed in all its bourgeois finery. The details are perfect.
After Edinburgh this week the production will go on to tour Bath, Woking,
Oxford, Newcastle and Nottingham. See it wherever you can.

It would be as well if you were interested in American life and culture,
because they are the subjects of all the more promising programmes tonight.
States Of Mind has been a short but fascinating series of documentaries
almost beyond categorisation, each showing what it is like to live and think
in some small American community. The last in the series (8.10 BBC2) looks
at Shoshone, Idaho, full of elderly people, who faced an intense drought at
the time of the Gulf War.
Channel 4's series about rock &amp; roll legends, Mojo Working (11.05) features
Janis Joplin. The billing calls her 'the greatest white blues singer of the
Sixties' which is a bit mean since she was one of the greatest blues singers
of all time, of any colour. Included here is the best number she ever
performed with Big Brother And The Holding Company, 'Ball And Chain'.
At 11.55 ITV repeats the classic western, Shane with Alan Ladd as the
reluctant gun fighter who has to take up his revolver again to protect the
homesteaders against the villainous ranchers, a textbook example of the
western myth. It ends just in time to switch over to BBC2 to catch David
Dimbleby's report on The Road To The White House (2.00 am).

   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE dance of this year's Edinburgh Festival
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the most distinguished, on paper, since 1979  - has begun high on the
applause meter. Cristina Hoyos, the dramatic flamenco dancer, who may be
remembered from the Carlos Saura films of Blood Wedding and El Amor Brujo,
formed her own company in 1988.
Hoyos is a nice mix of opposites  - sleek and explosive, earthy and elegant.
She has an attack that makes her smallest move register powerfully for
miles, and an intense, brooding presence. But if Hoyos is a true flamenco
virtuoso, this programme does not show it. It is designed to promote her
stellar lustre  - no other female dancer is given any important
choreography. But it also suggests Hoyos is deliberately making dances that
will not expose any decline in her technical powers.
She also wants to make flamenco tell stories. Well, maybe it can, but not,
surely, Lorca's Yerma? Yerma, a village wife whose goals are marriage and
parenthood, is childless and unhappy about her husband's refusal to give her
children. How do you convey 'You are not making babies with me, Juan' or
'She is sterile' in dance? Maybe you could mime it, but Hoyos is above that.
She suffers statuesquely, she thrashes about the stage with a portentous
gloom, she slides down her husband's body and, lying flat on the floor,
opens her legs to him. But it looks as if her problem is merely his neglect,
not her childlessness.
This would scarcely matter if Yerma abounded in great dancing. But it's just
a pot-pourri of flamenco moods. And its music, played mainly offstage, is so
heavily amplified that it might as well be a recording. If flamenco music
does not sound live, and if the dancing does not sound like a response to
live music, then it is not flamenco puro.
That goes also for the programme's other item, the all-dance Lo Flamenco.
Here the musicians are onstage throughout  - but the singers still look as
if they're lip-synching. Two male dancers are given big solos, but their
material is blandly academic in its bravura, as if it were designed to pass
a flamenco dance exam (grade 8). They don't have the fantasy or the
individuality that even the three male singers show in the daft little solos
that they offer at encore time.
Still, Lo Flamenco feels like a happy party, with dancers and musicians all
involved in something communal  - until Hoyos herself enters, half-way
through. The show promptly changes identity and becomes a star vehicle.
She's certainly an arresting dancer, perfectly co-ordinated, and her solos
are full of eccentric touches  - zigzag shoulders, sudden switches of
direction. But even this is conceived, not as a response to music, but a
slick exercise in audience manipulation. In that respect, though I myself
found it phoney, it succeeds admirably.
At The Playhouse, Edinburgh, until August 20

FT  19 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Rough time for birdies - Are
golf courses an ecological hazard and a waste of scarce resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Golf courses should be built like billiard tables, with buffers around the
fairways to prevent balls and spiked shoes from damaging the environment.
This rather extreme suggestion was made by a Dutch ecologist who evidently
knows more about the countryside than the role of the rough in golf. But the
growing number of courses around the world has caused alarm among many
environmentalists, conservationists and local communities.
Critics have a long list of complaints. Highly manicured courses ruin the
look of the countryside. Chemicals used to keep the grass perfect cause
pollution and damage wildlife. And the water needed to fill the traps and
keep the grass green constitutes an inappropriate use of a scarce resource.
'Most courses use the spray irrigation system, which is an inefficient way
of watering because most of it evaporates,' says Liana Stupples of Friends
of the Earth.
But FoE is not flatly opposed to golf courses. It acknowledges that some
provide an ideal habitat for wildlife and indigenous plants. This is
especially true when courses are built on land that was previously used for
intensive crop farming.
Nevertheless, there is often strong opposition to new golf courses and
criticism of green-keeping standards. In the US the National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides has highlighted the case of a 30-year-old
naval officer who died as a result of an allergic reaction to fungicide on a
golf course.
The Tokyo-based Global Network for Anti-Golf Course Action accuses Japanese
leisure companies  - which lack suitable land at home and are expanding
overseas  - of exporting environmental destruction. The network's main
complaint is about the over-use of chemicals.
In Hawaii, a favourite destination of Japanese holidaymakers, chemical
run-off from courses has been blamed for killing coral. And a local action
group is aggrieved that the Japanese are planning to build fairways on the
burial ground of the Hawaiian royal family.
In the UK, applications to build courses  - from large companies, such as
Legal &amp; General, to local farmers  - have also spawned protests.
A report published last year by Greene, Belfield-Smith, the leisure
industries arm of Touche Ross Management Consultants, predicted that the
pace of development of European golf schemes will soon overtake that of the
US. Europe would become the world's fastest growing golf market.
The UK already has more than half of the Europe's 3,687 courses. The Royal &amp;
Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews  - the spiritual home of golf - warned in
the late 1980s of an acute shortage of courses. It said about 700 were
needed to satisfy rising demand in the 1990s.
This was good news for farmers who were under pressure from the EC to
withdraw land from agricultural use. It was also greeted enthusiastically by
property developers. They saw big potential profits by buying the newly
available land and building facilities to satisfy golfers who, they
believed, were willing to pay handsomely for the pleasure of bashing a ball.
But the recession has ruined the swing of many golf entrepreneurs. People
can no longer afford big premiums to join new expensive clubs. And the slump
in the property market has killed the expected profits from associated
hotels and housing.
Scores of golf projects are on hold and many new courses have gone bankrupt.
Nevertheless, 60 courses are expected to open in the UK this year and 2,000
are planned.
Environmental concern about golf courses can be divided into three issues:
Course design. The image of the perfect golf course has been created by
television coverage, especially of big US tournaments. These are played on
lush man-made landscapes of minutely manicured lawns that depend heavily on
chemicals to maintain the effect.
'Some designers change the landscape altogether,' says Tim Forrester-Muir,
owner of the Forrester Park course in Essex. 'They mould the course of their
dreams, but others use the existing landscapes.'
It is the television-style courses that antagonise the environmentalists
most. They destroy existing ecosystems and demand a heavy chemical input.
For example, the Moatlands course near Tonbridge, Kent, which is owned by a
Japanese company, is built entirely on shipped-in sand rather than soil.
Course management. There are no recognised environmental standards for
maintaining courses but greenkeepers are becoming aware of the increased
concern about chemicals and water use.
'Greenkeepers see themselves as saviours rather than sinners. They will move
heaven and earth to preserve the flora and fauna,' says David White, editor
of Greenkeeper International.
Jeffrey Collinge, a management and engineering consultant working in the
Netherlands, is developing a model management programme for the Dutch Golf
Federation. 'The problem on a golf course is not limited to pesticides,
water and fertilisers. The largest area of a course  - 40-70 per cent  - is
the rough. The way this area is managed will play a major role in the total
environment impact.'
Collinge says course management needs a standard to which all greenkeepers
can adhere. He is looking at the suitability of the new British Standard on
environmental management (BS7750), which should soon become the basis of an
internationally agreed standard.
'In the Nethlands an environmental impact report is mandatory for permission
to build an 18-hole course. But then there is no compulsion to manage it in
an environmentally friendly manner,' he says.
Development scale. The development debate is coloured by the prevailing view
of what the countryside should be used for and, consequently, what it should
look like. Golfers argue that a course which is sympathetically designed and
includes areas that provide a habitat for animals and plants is far more
acceptable than, say, a field of rape, linseed or wheat.
But local protest groups, who view golf courses as the trojan horse of
developers, want developments that are sympathetic in scale and cater for
locals.
Forrester-Muir thinks courses such as his act as ambassadors for the
environment. 'This is a great introduction for the general public. It is
often their first step from the pavement to the grass. People suddenly start
taking an interest in the land when they walk around a course.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Top scores in the green
ratings game - Ian Rodger looks at a scientific method of assessing
companies on their environmental risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some day, companies may be rated for their environmental risk just as they
are rated now by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poors for their financial risk.
At least that's the hope of Robert Chanson, a Swiss lawyer who has
established Eco-Rating International, a Zurich-based company specialising in
ecology rating.
Chanson says a number of organisations now carry out environmental
assessments and audits on companies or factories, but usually on an ad hoc
basis and often in combination with assessments based on ethical issues,
such as treatment of employees in third world countries.
'We want to establish a scien-tific approach that will bring about a more
rational assessment,' Chanson says.
Eco-Rating's objective is to develop a universally applicable assessment
method so that an Indonesian textile company could be measured against, say,
a British steel company on ecological criteria. For the moment, however, as
a start-up business, it has to concentrate on specific assessments that
clients are willing to pay for. Chanson says his main potential clients are
managers of the so-called green funds which invest in companies providing
products or services that improve the environment.
He is trying to convince these funds to commission his group to make
assessments of the companies they invest in and then to rank their fund
against other green funds. He says there are some 200 green funds around the
world, and they tend to invest in the same pool of roughly 500 environmental
technology companies.
'We have received a signal from the market of interest in comparatively
simple information. They want to know if a product or service offered by a
company really does benefit the environment, and if the technology employed
is of a high or low standard.'
He proposes to make what he calls eco-tech ratings on these companies. To
demonstrate the method, he has recently carried out an assessment of the
Swiss maker of low-emission burners and paints, Elco Looser.
The first task was to examine the company's product portfolio and determine
the proportion of its sales coming from environmentally beneficial products.
In the Elco Looser case, 32 per cent of its products were considered to
produce a net environmental gain and the rest of the products were not
seriously damaging to the environment. Chanson says a company that produces
really nasty things, such as DDT or military explosives, would get a zero
rating even if it also made some environmentally beneficial things.
Then each product or service was rated on a scale from 1 to 5 on its
technological standard, using EC guidelines on the best available
technology. The resulting figures were weighted according to the percentage
of total sales represented by each product, and then converted into an
average rating for the whole company which turned out to be 4.17.
If he were doing ratings for a green fund, the ratings of all the companies
in which the fund held shares would be aggregated to produce an overall
rating for the fund itself. This could then be compared with the ratings of
other green funds.
Chanson said Eco-Rating was close to concluding an agreement with a green
fund operated by one of the Swiss banks to carry out such a rating and was
in negotiations with other funds run by German banks. 'We will get
experi-ence with this, and then we will try to develop other tools,' he
said. Already it has drawn up an outline scheme for rating ordinary
companies, for example those not specialised in environmental products (see
box).
While it is obvious that companies in heavy industries, such as steel, could
not hope to score as well as companies in lighter manufacturing or service
sectors, Chanson argues that the ratings could nevertheless be used to
compare companies within a given sector.
He also admits that the final item in the list, soft issues, does not easily
lend itself to scientific analysis. But he says they are important in
assessing risks. For example, a company selling a pesticide may only advise
users to put exactly one litre in the dispenser, or it may provide a
measuring cup to ensure that the user pours in the proper amount. The latter
would get a higher rating.
Perhaps, as in financial rating, there will have to be an element of
subjectivity in eco-rating.

FT  19 AUG 92 / People: Portuguese to head EBRD infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former director general of the Portuguese treasury, Manuel Franca e
Silva, has arrived at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) as head of the newly created financial infrastructure department.
Having worked on the restructuring of the Portuguese capital markets, a
series of privatisations and the implementation of a new payments system, he
reckons he is well-placed to advise central and eastern European countries
on the urgent reform of the financial sector.
The new department, within the developing banking area, has around ten
professionals.
Until now, the two-year-old EBRD appears to have spent more time on efforts
to encourage private sector initiatives, using professionals from its
merchant banking group.
But little can happen without an adequate public sector framework.
'Mr Franca e Silva brings to the Bank in-depth experience and knowledge of
international finance structure and mechanisms,' says his new boss, Mario
Sarcinelli, vice president of development banking at the EBRD, who
previously held the same position as Franca e Silva at the Italian treasury.
While he has spent most of his career as a treasury official, Franca e Silva
spent a brief interlude in government between 1981 and 1983 as secretary of
state at the ministry of agriculture.
After a year studying at Yale he moved to Washington DC for five years in
the financial institutions division of the Inter-American Development Bank.
Asked how he proposed to embark on his job and which countries would receive
priority for EBRD advice, Franca e Silva said yesterday: 'I have only just
arrived. In a month I will have a better idea.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Business Law: Financing techniques to counter depressed
property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL SEVERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement last month of an imaginative capital-raising exercise,
involving the issue of Pounds 100m zero coupon bonds backed by an agreement
to sell part of the issuer's property portfolio to institutional investors,
heralded new financing techniques which counter the problems posed by the
bear market in property.
The new techniques can be used by companies which are not, in the
traditional sense of the word 'property' companies, such as retailers,
manufacturers and distribution companies, all of which often have
substantial property assets.
Companies in this category historically looked to the banking sector to
provide finance on either a secured or on an unsecured ring-fenced basis. In
view of the UK banking sector reducing its exposure to the property market,
such conventional financing techniques are no longer readily available.
To the extent that this type of financing is on offer it has become much
more expensive and therefore less attractive. The new financing techniques
provide a useful and competitive alternative.
The Pounds 100m zero coupon bond issue is a good example of the innovative
and creative financing techniques which can be used to tap the capital
markets to absorb property risk.
This risk can be removed from the bond holders in the following way. The
property owner  - a company with substantial property assets  - can enter
into a put-option with an investing institution, which entitles the property
owner to require that institution to buy the property at a fixed rate at a
specified date in the future  - five or eight years from the date of the
put-option, for example.
The duration of the put-option matches the maturity term of the bonds. The
price the institution is obliged to pay for the property matches the amount
necessary to redeem the bonds. The bonds are secured on the put-option
rather than on the properties. The institution has therefore absorbed the
property risk while the bondholder's risk becomes a credit risk on the
institution  - which would typically have an AA or AAA credit rating.
Institutional investors would be paid a commission fee to underwrite the
value of the portfolio of properties.
There are a number of advantages to this type of financing. The property
owner raises a sum of 60 to 70 per cent of the property's value at an
attractive rate of interest while retaining total ownership of the
properties, and any increase in value passes only to the company.
Management and letting control, together with the ability to dispose of the
property at any time, are also retained by the company, provided cash
collateral equal to the put-option price of the property can be provided. If
cash collateral equal to the put-option price of the property is provided at
any time prior to the bonds' redemption date, the put-options would fall
away.
From the viewpoint of the institutions, underwriting property values is
attractive business  - being at a discount of 30 to 40 per cent of the
property's current value. The institutions also have the expertise to assess
the property risk and can retain monitoring powers and control to ensure
that the value of the properties is preserved.
While the capital value of the properties is one element of the property
risk, the other element is the rental income stream, where the risk is a
function of the credit rating of the tenants. A zero coupon bond is not
dependent on the rental income stream and this element of risk is
sidestepped. Where a coupon is payable, this would be serviced from rental
income and it is therefore important in this context.
Credit enhancement would almost certainly be required by way of a rental
guarantor with an appropriate credit rating. The rental guarantor would
absorb the credit risk of the underlying rental stream and the bondholders
would ultimately look to the rental guarantor.
The financing structure described above concerns the situation where the
property owner wants to retain the property assets. If a company wants to
dispose of the whole, or a significant part of its interest in a property,
an attractive commercial alternative is the factoring of the rental income
stream.
This simply involves calculating the net present value of the total rental
income stream from a property  - typically this will be equal to a yield of
50 to 80 basis points above the appropriate gilt rate.
Continental investors have shown interest in paying a premium for
appropriate rental streams because they fit in well with the provisions of
annuities. As the buyer is taking a straight credit risk on the tenant's
covenant, the latter's credit rating is fundamental.
Rental stream factoring can be used where a new lease is being created
incorporating guaranteed minimum periodic increases in the rent, for
example, on a new development. By adjusting the rental stream level and
profile, this structure can be tailored relatively easily to meet the
requirements of the company and investor.
The final technique to be considered is that involving the separation of the
right to receive rental income from the property and the right to share in
its capital growth. This technique can be used where a company wants to
retain at least half of its interest in the property.
The structure can best be illustrated in the context of a sale and leaseback
transaction. The property owner occupies the property but wants to realise a
substantial part of its interests in that property. The owner sells the
property to a company incorporated solely for the acquisition of the
property and, once acquired, the latter would lease the property back to the
company. The lease would have guaranteed minimum periodic rent increases.
This part of the financing technique is identical to the factoring
arrangement already described and the same considerations apply in
structural rental levels, the size of rental increases and the rental
profile to meet the investors' and company's needs.
The specially created company would raise the finance to buy the property by
issuing two classes of bearer instruments. One would entitle the holder to
participate in the rental income and the overall value of this class would
equal the net present value of the rental stream. As the investors are
taking a credit risk on the tenant, credit enhancement by means of a rental
guarantor may be appropriate.
The other class of bearer instrument would entitle the holder to participate
in the value of the property after the lease has expired  - the reversionary
interest in the property. As the lease term runs to its maturity the allure
of the property class of instrument would gradually increase while the value
of the rental income instruments would reduce.
The financing techniques outlined illustrate the variety of ways in which a
company can raise finance at competitive rates by utilising its property
assets. By using the appropriate structure, a company can raise the
necessary finance while selling as much or as little of its property
interest as it wishes.
Using such techniques enables a company to make full use of its property
assets. The success of the recent coupon bond issue shows that these types
of structured financing deals are welcomed in the capital markets and can
provide substantial commercial benefits to property-owning companies.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Management: Take the high road - James Buxton and Lisa Wood
assess whether Tecs should have a Scottish-style central body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While English and Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils ponder whether to
press the government to create a new central body to co-ordinate and support
them, they are directing their eyes northwards to Scotland.
In Scotland the equivalent of Tecs, the Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs),
were born at the same time as their umbrella organisations. Outside the
Highlands the Lecs come under Scottish Enterprise, while in the Highlands
their parent body is Highlands and Islands Enterprise. These bodies have
their own strategic development function and also act as a useful buffer
between the Lecs and central government.
It may be partly because of this difference with England  - where Tecs
contract directly with the government  - that the Lecs appear more
successful than the Tecs and on the whole have looked happier than their
southern counterparts.
In Scotland the creation of Lecs was part of a drastic reorganisation of two
long-established bodies, the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands
and Islands Development Board. Their successors, Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, devolved many economic development powers
to the new enterprise companies, which also took over training functions
from the Training Agency.
So although both Tecs and Lecs have responsibility for training and business
development, the 13 Lecs under Scottish Enterprise in lowland Scotland have
a much stronger development function than do the Tecs and they resemble
mini-development agencies.
The Scottish Lecs have larger budgets in relation to their populations than
the Tecs. While nearly half their funds go on training, they also have
substantial budgets for environmental improvement work (including property
development) and business development.
Whereas in England some of the Tecs have had difficulty making themselves
known both to the business community and the public, in Scotland the public
sector has a higher profile, and the SDA and HIDB were already well known.
The creation of Scottish Enterprise's network of Lecs has released a great
deal of human energy into economic development. In Edinburgh, for example,
responsibility for development was devolved by Scottish Enterprise to
Lothian &amp; Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd (known as LEEL), a free-standing body
with a budget of Pounds 45m. LEEL has made an impact by backing projects
which required pulling together other bodies such as Edinburgh district
council and Lothian regional council.
Under its chairman Sir Charles Fraser, an energetic Edinburgh solicitor with
legendary contacts, it has brought Edinburgh's long nurtured dream of
creating an opera house closer to reality.
In Lanarkshire, south-east of Glasgow, the Lanarkshire Development Agency
has been given the task of regenerating the local economy after the closure
of British Steel's Ravenscraig plant. In Ayrshire, to the south-west of
Glasgow, Enterprise Ayrshire is drawing attention to an area of Scotland
which the SDA tended to neglect.
Some critics argue training is becoming a poor relation of high profile
environmental/property projects. The criticism does not apply to all Lecs:
several have made an attempt to integrate training with enterprise
development. At Enterprise Ayrshire training and business development are
interwoven in the management structure.
Under John Lord, its chief executive, Enterprise Ayrshire is trying to
escape the straitjacket of the official training programmes YT and ET, whose
names have been abandoned in favour of Ayrshire Skills Training. The aim is
to use knowledge of local companies to tailor training to their specific
needs.
Other critics fear that a development effort in lowland Scotland which was
formerly closely co-ordinated is being diffused or 'balkanised' as Lecs
pursue their own strategies, some of which may conflict with other Lecs.
Several of the Lecs, on the other hand, complain that they are excessively
constrained by Scottish Enterprise National (as the parent body, is now
known).
At Scottish Enterprise National, Crawford Beveridge, the chief executive,
says that the loose network is 'fulfilling the aim of applying local
solutions to local problems. Solutions are being found that would have been
unthinkable under the old monolithic structure.'
In reply to critics who argue that the network is too loose and that Lecs
are inclined to spend on the easy options such as environmental
improvements, he says that Lecs' budget requests are scrutinised to make
sure that they are in line with Scottish Enterprise's overall plan
Strategies for the 1990s.
In the 1992/93 bidding round for Scottish Enterprise's Pounds 400m budget
for the Lecs, the local enterprise companies overbid on property schemes and
underbid on projects to develop tourism and to 'internationalise' Scottish
business.
Mr Beveridge says the Scottish Enterprise network has 'a much more pragmatic
relationship with the Scottish Office than the Tecs have with the Training,
Enterprise and Education Division (TEED) of the Department of Employment'.
Many of the Tecs' dealings with TEED are very legalistic and they are
related to their contracts, he says, whereas the Lec chairmen only refer to
their contracts 'as a last resort'.
He also says that Scottish Enterprise's ability to get the 13 Lec chief
executives 'in a room together once every three months is a very powerful
management tool'.
As for the counter-criticism that Scottish Enterprise National, which itself
has a budget of Pounds 65m and employs 390 people, exercises too much
control over the Lecs, Beveridge replies: 'The Lecs are ambivalent about
this. When we ask them 'What should we be doing?' we get a longer list than
the list of what we actually do at the moment.
'We look at our support services and ask whether they should be here in
Glasgow or out at the Lecs. Three months ago I offered to split up our legal
department but the Lecs refused  - it would have put their costs up. But
I've promised I will go through all the support services function by
function to make sure that the services are being provided in the right
place.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Early education is the key to effective skills
training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN MACKIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan ('Save us all from the credentialist fad', August 13) is
right to question the scandalous squandering of resources in training. But
he does not get to the heart of the matter.
The strength of the continental system is that education and training are
treated holistically. Studies of the economic effectiveness of training
which do not refer to education, particularly primary education, miss the
point.
The core of the transferable skills Mr Brittan alludes to is the set
acquired in primary and early secondary phases of education. It involves
what the French would call the 'formation' of an individual. It includes
basic literacy and numeracy and, above all, an ability to concentrate. This
produces a trainable, adaptable workforce able to acquire vocational
qualifications. If the educational foundation is sound, the training
function becomes simpler, more directed and less costly, and conflicts
between exogenous and endogenous benefit less acute.
It is the provision of a sound 'formation' to succeeding generations of
school leavers that separates the sheep from the goats in national economic
performance, and it is the neglect of the need to provide all our youngsters
with these basic skills that is at the root of the UK's seemingly terminal
decline.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Air freight takes fright at the gravity of recession: The
cost of air cargo has plummeted over recent months in the face of falling
demand and overcapacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About one-third of all international trade, by value, travels by air  - a
fast-growing business that is worth about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) in
annual revenues to air freight carriers. But in the past few months freight
rates across the Atlantic have halved, threatening to blow off course the
recovery plans of some of the world's biggest airlines, which dominate the
air freight industry.
From a typical price at the beginning of the year of 75p-80p a kilogram on
the London to New York route, prices have fallen  - in the case of one
airline to just 8p a kilo  - as rivals scramble for business. Airlines
calculate that the cost of fuel alone required to take a kilo of cargo
across the Atlantic is almost 7p.
Cargo is big business for airlines. At Lufthansa, the German carrier which
is the world's biggest airline freight operator, cargo accounts for 21 per
cent of sales. Last year, DM2.9bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in revenues were generated
by the division, which employs just 8 per cent of Lufthansa's workforce.
This year, however, Lufthansa and its competitors are operating in a very
different market. The convergence of recession and higher capacity in the
industry has prompted a sharp fall in freight rates.
'The key air freight markets, US and Japan, are suffering from considerable
economic difficulties,' says Mr Wilhelm Althen, Lufthansa's executive
vice-president of cargo. 'With capacity supply higher than demand, the
situation for cargo carriers is characterised by pressure on prices and
profits.'
A blunter assessment comes from Mr John Smith, general manager of cargo
marketing at British Airways, the world's fourth-largest airline freight
operator. 'They (the airlines) are all losing their shirts. The normal rate
from Japan is 700 to 800 yen a kilo. We know of one airline asking 300 yen.'
He acknowledges that BA itself is 'taking a fair amount of pain. We are a
little down on where we would like to have been at this time.' BA has
reduced its quoted price on the New York route from nearly 80p a kilo six
months ago to about 60p now. The discounted rates actually paid by customers
have fallen faster.
The decline has happened suddenly because air freight was temporarily
insulated from the effects of recession. As businesses cut their stocks they
increasingly turned to aircraft to deliver goods at short notice. Lufthansa
increased its cargo revenues by 14 per cent between 1990 and 1991.
However, the persistent international economic slowdown is now taking its
toll. The trade in car parts, for example  - one of the most important
categories of air-freighted goods  - has followed the sharp decline in world
car sales. Freight routes between Japan and Europe have been particularly
affected as Japanese vehicle exports have fallen.
The downturn in air freight threatens to dislodge a central plank of airline
strategy since the Gulf war. 'During the war, the awareness of cargo grew
dramatically,' says Mr Peter White, managing director of cargo at British
Airways. 'The passengers disappeared but the cargo held up. And empty planes
meant more room for the cargo.'
The airlines' response to the fickle passenger was to push the cargo
business higher up the management agenda and increase the profile of
freight. BA's cargo division did not report to the company's main board
until this year. Lufthansa, too, has only recently separated its cargo and
passenger businesses.
Airlines have also invested heavily in an effort to provide a better service
to customers. American Airlines, for which cargo has historically been a low
priority, is in the middle of a Dollars 50m cargo investment programme to
automate accounts and provide a quicker and more efficient service.
The airlines' ambitions extend beyond a simple desire to smooth out uneven
passenger revenues. Air freight volumes have grown faster than passenger
numbers for more than 20 years, and this trend will continue, says Boeing,
the world's biggest aircraft maker. It predicts annual average growth in air
cargo traffic of 6.5 per cent over the next 15 years, compared with barely 5
per cent growth for passengers.
An important reason for the expansion of the industry has been the
development of wide-bodied aircraft, and in particular the Boeing 747. The
amount of space left over in its cargo bay after passengers' baggage is
loaded allows airlines to act as freight carriers without buying specialist
aircraft.
According to Mr Althen at Lufthansa this has created 'a category of carriers
which regard cargo as fill-up, and which has therefore put pressure on
prices'. It was one such 'fill-up' carrier, American Airlines, that last
month briefly offered a North Atlantic rate of 8p a kilo.
Falling freight rates are not completely new. Over most of the past 20
years, rates have declined gradually along with air fares as capacity has
risen. One result is that the range of goods carried by air has grown wider.
The fortnightly BA Boeing 767 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London's
Heathrow airport, carries bundles of clothing and crates of dates, for
instance. It also has five or six copper urns of holy water, en route to
Leicester's Moslem community for use in religious ceremonies. The holy water
business is worth Pounds 15,000 a year to BA.
In the Americas, the latest hybrid grain seeds are shuttled between northern
and southern hemisphere farms to improve yields.
But the most important rise in air cargo has come from four groups of goods:
car and motorcycle parts, pharmaceuticals, textiles and electronics. These
are largely high-value, relatively small goods. In the case of textiles, air
freight might mean getting the latest fashions from Asia into shops six
weeks faster than by ship.
The problem for the airlines, however, is that capacity has risen faster
than increased demand. American Airlines, for example, increased the amount
of cargo it carried by 38 per cent in the past year, while revenues rose by
only 25 per cent.
Airline executives are nervous about recovery in air freight. 'I'm not sure
that Boeing's growth forecasts can be supported fully now,' says Mr Steve
Leonard, vice-president of cargo sales at American Airlines 'There is a
restructuring going on already.'
Restructuring extends to many carriers. Air Canada is selling its freighter
fleet. Lufthansa is seeking to establish and extend joint ventures. In June,
it increased its share in the internationally-owned specialist freight
operator DHL from 5 per cent to 25 per cent in an effort to secure market
share. JAL, the Japanese carrier, increased its stake by the same amount.
Lufthansa has also established links with Air France, Cathay Pacific and JAL
to develop a global communications network for the air cargo market. The
system will allow computerised international cargo bookings. 'Going it alone
was too expensive,' says JAL.
Such moves by Lufthansa and its rivals are evidence of their commitment to
air freight, but also of the squall in which the industry now finds itself.
The airlines hope that it will prove a temporary bout of turbulence and that
prices will soon be stabilised. But that will depend on how quickly its
freight customers recover from recession.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Blurred relations in integrated houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P G MOON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent debacle at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is terrifying in its
implications. Have corporations become so ashamed of their accounting
policies that they need to gag a reference work by Terry Smith?
Does this mean shareholders' needs have been subordinated to the large
corporations by the integrated houses?
Further, has the objectivity of analysis been compromised by the need of the
integrated houses to keep the FT-SE 100 companies sweet?
I understand that no specific recommendations are made in Terry Smith's
book. It merely outlines methods used by companies. Why, then, should any
company be distressed by an analyst pointing out policies sanctioned by its
board?
Is it time for the institutions to review again the blurring of
relationships within the integrated houses? Perhaps the two-way function of
broker and marketmaker is a manageable relationship, but that including
corporate finance is not.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Miras could provide boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN STERN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I believe there is an opportunity for the government to intervene in
the housing market's current problems.
Miras currently costs the exchequer several billion pounds a year. If the
government took the average UK mortgage life of about five to 10 years'
worth of Miras and paid this all in one year, thereafter abolishing Miras
entitlement, it would be equivalent to a massive reduction in mortgage
interest rates for at least one year. And the extra economic activity that
should result would increase the government's tax revenues. While leading to
one year's increased PSBR, it should not be seen as extra borrowing, as it
is only bringing forward already committed and budgeted tax relief.
The scheme might persuade many first-time buyers to try to qualify for the
payment/tax-credit. The increased activity might compensate for any small
drop in house prices. Ian Stern,

FT  19 AUG 92 / Personal View: Feather beds in South Africa's boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir ALAN WALTERS and GEORGE GUISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa is a continental anomaly. A third-world country, with the
tribalism, the violence, the excessive public spending, overregulation, the
overweening bureaucracy, state-owned behemoths, the protection and
politicisation of much economic activity. But superimposed on these is a
convincing presence of the first world in the form of the great mining and
manufacturing corporations. The English-speaking South Africans have
dominated this private business sector, just as Afrikaners have been
predominant in government employment, while blacks have provided the labour.
An oversimplification? A caricature? Perhaps, but it conveys the essence of
South Africa for most of this century.
The incomes generated by the industrial and mining sector produced a large
tax revenue to finance the jobs and sinecures in the public sector. The
stated objective of the leadership of the African National Congress is to
capture control of government in order to secure and expand those public
sector jobs. There has also been much talk of expanding the public sector by
nationalisation, quotas for blacks, Africanisation, and so on. But now there
is growing realisation among black leaders that such measures have been the
root cause of the dismal economic performance of all the second (communist)
world and most of the third-world economies.
If there is a golden rule in economic management, it is that high taxation,
expropriation, regulation and control lead to dilapidated infrastructure,
political turmoil and uncertainty which drives capital and jobs away. That,
in turn, exacerbates both economic and political tensions  - and so leads to
a vicious circle of decline. What can the ANC, Inkatha, the National party
and other groups do to promote wealth and growth, to break out of this
vicious circle? The solution is to send not for Marx and Lenin, but for
Hanson and Goldsmith.
As in any other dirigiste socialist country (and, with its high ratio of
government involvement and interference in economic life, South Africa must
be so classed), the economy is dominated by very large corporations. In
South Africa fewer than 10 conglomerates dominate the first-world industrial
sector. They have pyramidal or interlocking shareholdings which lock out
their external shareholders from any influence over management and protect
their management from any true accountability to shareholders.
As is well documented, conglomeration, especially with monopoly power and
protection against intruders, leads to much inefficiency. The rate of return
on capital in the many peripheral activities is low. This is reflected in
the fact that for most of these conglomerates the share price is less than
the value of their component assets.
In any free market there would be a corrective, namely a takeover bid. Lords
Hanson and White or Sir James Goldsmith would buy up the shares, take
control, strip off the peripheral loss-making companies, change management
and sell them for perhaps more than their acquisition cost, and get the
company back to basics in its mining operations. But few managements in
South Africa fear a takeover bid.
Many reasons explain these feather beds in the boardrooms. The most
important is that everyone is in a feather bed with everyone else. Large
blocks of shares are held by corporations in the same group as well as by
controlled pension and insurance funds. It is virtually impossible for any
outsider to mount a takeover bid against the interlocked interests of the
five conglomerates which account for more than three-quarters of the market
capitalisation of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
It is, however, a moot point whether in the absence of such interlocking
holdings, a protectionist, socialist government of the kind which has been
in power in South Africa for so long would ever allow takeovers. Socialist
governments are characteristically averse to buccaneers like Goldsmith and
Hanson. They prefer their house-trained managers, who are more amenable to
the habits of bureaucracy. Yet, they wonder why foreign capital is so
reluctant to appear.
We believe takeovers would benefit virtually all groups in South Africa. Let
us take the difficult one first: would they benefit the blacks? We believe
they would.
First, such takeovers and unbundling would create, not destroy, jobs. The
efficiency gains that can be made are high  - perhaps reductions in cost of
50 per cent or more. This would make much industry efficient and competitive
in terms of world as well as African markets. Second, South African
manufactures could flood into their natural markets  - displacing Asian
manufactures, but also developing new markets that do not now exist. This is
the basis for real jobs and prosperity in the black townships as well as in
the grassy suburbs.
As for the owners of these conglomerates, their shareholdings would be worth
much more under an open takeover regime. True, some family shareholding
groups as well as entrenched management cliques would lose their power to
decide the fate of industry, but that is the price they must pay for the
opening of the economy  - and how handsome would be the rewards.
The Afrikaners would lose their privileged positions in the public sector
while all races would be free to exploit the opportunities which a
liberalisation of the white cartel-dominated industrial sector will provide.
We suspect that removing the feather beds in both the public and private
sectors will be the making of a new generation of multiracial entrepreneurs.
The main task of a reforming government must be to insist on the
disentanglement of the crossholdings of the conglomerates and the opening up
of South Africa to foreign as well as domestic corporate raiders. The first
step is so simple. It is for the regulatory authorities of government and
the stock exchange to cease the restrictive practice of protecting
entrenched management groups from their disenfranchised private
shareholders. If a takeover appears, the cross-shareholding should have the
option of accepting the offer or of bettering it, but not of turning
complacently away.
Such a simple shift in regulatory policy would not only bring South Africa
into line with most efficient, modern, capitalist economies, but
simultaneously awaken those sleeping assets which form South Africa's hidden
wealth.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Leading Article: More fiddling in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BELATEDLY, the Japanese Ministry of Finance has recognised that it cannot
ignore the continuing collapse of the Tokyo stock market. But yesterday's
rag-bag of short-term palliatives suggests that it still does not understand
the severity of the crisis that Japan faces. The current financial
turbulence could derail the economy for years rather than months. Until the
Ministry of Finance publicly recognises this fact, it will continue to do
more harm than good.
Surely Japan's powerful civil servants should have realised by now that the
stock market is not falling through the floor simply because a normal
healthy recovery has been postponed for a quarter or two. Yet this
assumption underpins yesterday's package. So long as the banks and other
financial institutions can be dissuaded from selling shares to pay their
interim dividends next month, goes the reasoning of the Ministry of Finance,
then all will be well when the recovery arrives.
Yet all will not be well. No amount of balance sheet manipulation can
conceal the stock and property losses that the banks face, whether they
choose to write them off now or at the end of the fiscal year, a fact that
Japanese equity traders understand only too well.
Nor will suspending the guideline ceiling on the percentage of profits that
can be paid in dividends disguise the fact that the earnings outlook looks
increasingly bleak. Bad debts have made the banks unwilling to lend and the
sluggish state of domestic demand means that companies are unwilling to
borrow or invest.
That the health of Japan's banking sector is so closely tied to the stock
market makes a serious situation doubly bad. Most banks would currently fail
the requirement of the Bank of International Settlements that capital exceed
8 per cent of risk-weighted assets which comes into effect in March 1993.
But making it easier to issue debt to meet these capital ratios will do
nothing to stimulate lending. If the Ministry of Finance wants to ease the
pressure on banks, it could do so directly by postponing the date at which
the BIS rules become effective.
Yet only economic growth can simultaneously satisfy the needs of investors,
banks and companies. Moreover, the government is best placed to provide the
necessary boost to domestic demand. Japan's general government budget
surplus allows it plenty of room for an injection of at least Y12,000bn
(Pounds 50bn) in spending and tax cuts in the forthcoming supplementary
budget. Furthermore, while falling long bond yields have eased the pressure
on the corporate sector, Japanese short interest rates are still higher than
they need to be.
Only by showing that it can act effectively can the government hope to
stabilise the stock market. Yet it still prefers cosmetic manipulation to
genuine stimulation. There can be few better ways to undermine the
confidence of Tokyo's battered investors.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Morning after in the pub: Recent efforts to inject more
competition into the UK brewing market have largely backfired
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norfolk Nog was recently judged the champion beer of Britain at the Campaign
for Real Ale's festival in London. Yet the beer, made by Woodforde's of
Norwich, a small, independent brewer, is sold in only 300 of the country's
60,000 pubs and clubs.
'A few more pubs have called us to order the beer since it won the award,'
says Mr Ray Ashworth, Woodforde's managing director. 'The beer is
competitive on price as well as quality. But pubs are so heavily committed
to the national brewers that it is very difficult to increase distribution.'
Three years after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission set out to inject
more competition into the UK's beer market  - worth Pounds 13bn a year in
retail sales  - Woodforde's experience is a sad reflection on what has been
achieved.
The restructuring  - aimed at breaking the dominance of the large national
brewers by loosening the ties between brewing and pub ownership, and carried
out against a recessionary background  - is now almost complete.
So far, the result has been fewer brewers, fewer breweries and fewer beer
brands. Breaking the tie between brewing and pub ownership has brought new
retailers into the market, but it has also led to some big rent increases
and pub closures.
Meanwhile, the commission, in its recent report on the proposed merger of
the brewing operations of Allied-Lyons and Carlsberg, the Danish brewer,
admits: 'The strength of the national brewers is undiminished.'
The price of a pint of bitter, instead of dropping, rose last year by 12.8
per cent before tax, compared with a 4.5 per cent increase in the retail
price index. Brewers blame higher investment and financing costs.
So what has gone wrong? The answer lies in the commission's diagnosis of the
industry's competitive weaknesses and the remedy it prescribed.
Competition already existed between the pubs belonging to the six national
UK brewers  - Bass, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread, Courage, Grand Metropolitan and
Scottish &amp; Newcastle  - according to Mr Leif Mills, head of Bifu, the
banking union, and a member of the commission. He wrote a dissenting note to
the commission's 1989 report recommending the restructuring. The brewers
were responding to changing consumer demands, he said. There were physical
limits to what any pub could offer its customers, and new owners were
unlikely to widen the choice beyond the most profitable, highly advertised
brands.
Mr Mills also warned that wherever brewing had been separated from retailing
 - as in the US  - the result had been to concentrate beer production in
fewer hands.
His predictions have proved remarkably accurate. The nationals' response to
the commission's intervention has been a series of corporate deals
tightening their grip on beer production and enabling them to minimise the
effects of their pub disposals. These include:
A Pounds 2.4bn pubs-for-breweries swap between Grand Metropolitan and
Courage, the Australian brewer, set the pace early last year. Courage took
over GrandMet's breweries to become the country's second-biggest brewer with
a 20 per cent market share. The two companies' 7,000 pubs have gone into a
joint venture managed by GrandMet.
A Pounds 510m merger of the UK brewing operations of Allied-Lyons and
Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, is set to go ahead after minor modifications
demanded by the commission. The new company, Carlsberg-Tetley, will have an
18 per cent share of the market.
Allied and Whitbread have benefited from the decisions of three regional
brewers  - Boddington, Devenish and Greenalls  - to dispose of their
uneconomic breweries and concentrate on pub retailing. Whitbread bought the
Boddington and Devenish brands; Allied now brews Greenalls' beer.
Further brewery closures have come with the nationals' search for production
economies. Bass, the industry leader with a 23 per cent market share, has
led the way by shutting four plants.
As a result of this corporate activity, five national brewers now control 82
per cent of the country's beer production compared with 77 per cent held by
the six national brewers in 1989. Concentration of lager production is even
more marked.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which baulked at the thought of two
brewers controlling 40 per cent of production when it barred the Elders bid
for Scottish &amp; Newcastle at the time of the 1989 report, now apparently
views such concentration with equanimity.
Indeed, the commission almost caused the demise of another regional brewer
that it had sought to protect. Its insistence that Whitbread's associated
investment company should reduce its shareholding in Morland, the
Oxfordshire brewer, exposed that company to a hostile bid from Greene King
that only narrowly failed in July. A similar threat still hangs over
Marston, the Burton-based brewer, in which Whitbread has a 33 per cent
stake.
The concentration of production  - which many City observers believe will go
further  - seems a poor trade-off for what the commission has achieved on
the retail side of the industry. The commission recommended that the big six
brewers should be forced to dispose of 22,000 pubs  - two-thirds of their
total holdings. The government compromised. It ordered them to allow their
tenant licensees, who rent about 21,000 pubs, to buy spirits, cider, soft
drinks and one brand of cask-conditioned ale from any supplier. This 'guest
ale' provision was intended to benefit regional brewers by giving their
products access to the nationals' pubs from which they had generally been
barred.
However, after three years, fewer than a third of the nationals' tenants
have taken advantage of the guest-ale provision to stock a regional brewer's
product. Only a few regionals with strong brands, such as Marston, Greene
King and Fuller, have benefited and they have had to rely on distribution
deals with the nationals.
'The nationals have usurped the guest-ale market,' says Mr Iain Loe of the
Campaign for Real Ale. 'They have padded out their own portfolios with a few
key brands and it is still very difficult for smaller brewers to get a look
in.'
Many of the regionals have struck back, however. Some have strengthened
their trading operations by buying about a quarter of the 11,000 pubs sold
by the nationals. The disposal programme has also enabled many of the
brewers' former tenants to become individual pub owners. New retailers,
whose entry to the trade has been limited by a restrictive licensing system,
have bought pubs throughout the country. Some, such as Enterprise Inns and
Century Inns, have rapidly built up chains of several hundred pubs.
But few of the consumer benefits expected to flow from increased competition
have materialised. Each of the big brewers has retained most of the beer
supplies to the pubs they have sold or leased. They have protected their
positions by means of long-term supply agreements or such inducements as
cheap loans.
Three years ago, the commission concluded that the reliance of supposedly
independent pubs on subsidised loans from their brewer restricted the entry
of new suppliers and adversely affected competition. The commission
recommended prohibiting such loans.
However, the government did not ban the practice, and it has grown despite
its potential pitfalls  - demonstrated by Whitbread's provisions this year
for Pounds 37m of bad debts. National brewers' sales to loan-tied houses
have risen since 1989 from 5.6m to 5.9m barrels.
Long-term supply agreements, designed to maintain the brewer's sales to pubs
that it has sold, are a more recent feature. The Office of Fair Trading has
already taken action to discourage such moves by imposing time limits on
Courage's supplies to GrandMet and to their joint pubs venture, and on
Allied's arrangements to supply Brent Walker, the leisure group to which it
has leased 734 pubs.
In their defence, the national brewers argue that retailers benefit from a
single comprehensive supply service. 'Such agreements are entered into as a
result of negotiation between willing buyers and sellers, involving active
competition between brewers for business, and have contributed to a dramatic
decline in wholesale prices in recent years,' Allied says.
Professor M E Beesley, one of the commission members who inquired into the
Allied-Carlsberg merger proposals, agrees. 'These are methods by which
rivalry is now pursued,' he says. 'They are not the restoration of a
forbidden monopolistic practice.'
Though unconvinced, his colleagues' concerns appear to have been eased by
evidence from many retailers that competition for business with the
independent pub sector  - which now accounts for nearly half of total pub
beer sales compared with 37 per cent in 1989  - has brought real reductions
in wholesale beer prices.
So why have retail prices continued to outpace inflation? The brewers have
several explanations. Substantial sums have been invested in refurbishing
pubs during the past few years. Some of the new, independent pub companies
have borrowed heavily and had to raise cash, in difficult trading
conditions, to meet interest payments. Pub tenants are paying higher rents.
But higher prices have provoked consumer resistance, and with the pub-going
population in decline, many pubs that enjoyed a degree of financial
protection as part of the large brewers' estates face a bleak future as
standalone businesses.
'There are fewer pubs already, and soon there will be fewer still as
retailers find they cannot cope with reduced trade and higher costs,' says
Mr David Thompson, an industry observer analyst at Kleinwort Benson, the
securities house. 'That means less consumer choice.'
The OFT will begin its assessment of the impact of the commission's
intervention this winter. The industry expects further upheavals to follow;
consumers have learned not to expect much from them.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Money advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME HALF a million households in the UK are struggling with multiple debts
that they cannot meet. According to a report published last week by the
National Consumer Council, only one in seven can hope to receive advice on
how best to deal with their difficulties. Such advice cannot solve the
problem. But it would help. Unfortunately, nobody can agree on how it should
be funded.
The NCC's concerns over the inadequate funding of money advice parallels
that of Sir George Blunden, chairman of the Money Advice Trust. Established
to raise money on a voluntary basis from private business, the Trust managed
to obtain only Pounds 252,000 last year. Its three-year target of Pounds 9m
looks as remote as the moon. No wonder Sir George has expressed his
disappointment, singling out building societies for their failure to
contribute.
His complaints are justified. More than three-quarters of the Pounds 417bn
in personal debt outstanding at the end of 1991 was for house purchase. Yet
many building societies simply blame government policy, the behaviour of
other lenders, or the imprudence or ill luck of borrowers. They also argue
that they are dealing with arrears satisfactorily, by providing advice
directly to their customers, even though advice provided by one lender
cannot be enough for people with multiple debts.
The societies conclude that government should provide the funds. Meanwhile,
the Department of Trade and Industry wants funding to come from the private
sector. Yet the government and the private sector do agree that a statutory
levy on private industry is out of the question.
All the while, money advice remains underfunded. The question then is how
advice should be funded. Here three points need to be made.
First, since there is a public interest in the provision of money advice,
the government has a responsibility for ensuring that such advice is
provided. Second, voluntary funding is always likely to be inadequate, since
it is in the interest of each potential donor to be backward in coming
forward. Third, lenders for home purchase bear partial responsibility for
the problem, since their lax lending policies did much to entice individuals
into excessive borrowing.
What is needed, as the NCC argues, is mixed funding of money advice by
central and local government and the private sector. The private sector is
now being asked to make its contribution voluntarily. Since the total sum
required is not large, perhaps the funds will be forthcoming. But this looks
unlikely.
The alternative is compulsion. A statutory levy on lenders would be
arbitrary, but no more so than the current unequal pattern of voluntary
contributions. Moreover, the disadvantages of a modest levy cannot exceed
those of failure to fund advice adequately. Lenders are on trial. If they do
not contribute voluntarily, they should be condemned to compulsion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since President George Bush ordered the Gulf ceasefire, he has faced a
living reminder that his victory over Iraq was less than complete. President
Saddam Hussein's mere survival humiliates; his brazen flouting of United
Nations Security Council resolutions constitutes part of the threat to Mr
Bush's re-election.
That is the stark background against which the latest western activity
against Iraq must be assessed. By leaking threats to bomb government
buildings and mooting establishment of an air exclusion zone to protect Shia
Moslems in the south, the US and its allies signal a desire to step up the
pressure on Mr Saddam. But by implication, they also highlight their own
failure to deal with the Iraqi dictator thus far, and President Bush's
vulnerability. It is a bind from which he is unlikely to free himself
without doing something that may be beyond his capacity before the
presidential election in November: finishing Mr Saddam once and for all.
There are those who argue that the west is now suffering the consequences of
not having gone all the way at the end of the war, that had they marched on
Baghdad 18 months ago the allies might not now be sitting helplessly by
while Mr Saddam cocks a snook at UN weapons inspectors or unleashes
warplanes against his people. But that is far from certain, and even if it
were would be scant consolation today.
The allies' real problem stems from a failure to think creatively, or
consistently, about the consequences of victory. When the Shias of the south
rose up against Baghdad at the end of the war, none of the western nations
came to their aid. Mr Bush adamantly refused to support a rebellion that he
argued might dismember an established state and aggrandise its neighbour,
Iran. Yet at the same time, Britain and the US were prodded by TV coverage
into providing a 'safe haven' in the north for the Kurds.
Unfortunately, current events have the same reactive flavour. Mr Bush was
caught off guard by the recent confrontation over a weapons inspection of
the Iraqi agriculture ministry, and threatens to bomb government buildings
in Baghdad. He is stung by publicity concerning the plight of the Shias, and
persuades his allies to co-operate in banning Iraqi aircraft from the south.
On its own, the latest action can do little to improve the lot of the Shias;
the allies need to go further, and establish a comprehensive security
umbrella with a view to denying Baghdad control as they have with the Kurds.
But they must not lose sight of the ultimate aim, which should be, through a
combination of military, economic and political pressure, to force Mr
Saddam's removal and the installation of a government more representative of
Iraq's diverse peoples. As things stand, almost anything the allies do that
falls short of that goal can be presented by Mr Saddam as a victory over the
west.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Arts: A tribute to Fokine - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILLED as 'A tribute to Michel Fokine' to mark the 50th anniversary of his
death, the final programme in English National Ballet's summer season is a
combination of seance and mugging  - the spirit of the choreographer invoked
and then given a thorough pasting. As an example of the unsuitable in
pursuit of the unlikely, the evening has a weird interest, but as a
celebration of the work of a genius who indelibly marked the ballet of our
century, it is a non-starter.
The trouble is that texts and performance manner are wildly optimistic. The
honourable exception is Dame Alicia Markova's staging of Les Sylphides.
Markova learned the ballet from Fokine. He coached her in all three
ballerina roles, recognising in her exquisite style the essential Romantic
image that lies at the heart of this ravishing and difficult work. In her
several productions, Markova has sought to pass on the physical nuance and
musical finesse that Fokine demanded and which, in her own interpretations,
she so beautifully displayed. On Monday night, ENB's cast tried hard to
seize the dreams and drifting magic of the text: the fascination was in
seeing how moments of Markova's own style  - sweetly floating, so musically
subtle  - surfaced amid the dutiful performance, like happy memories.
The truly distinguished dancing of the evening came from Ludmila Semenyaka
 -who should have been seen in Sylphides  - as The Dying Swan. She does not
show us Fokine's text  - her version is that Soviet recension which Ulanova
used  - but it is potent, and given by Semenyaka with intensest poetry and
an aristocracy of means that are the mark of a great ballerina.
For the rest of the programme we might have been watching  - it would be
better to have watched  - all-in wrestling. Le Spectre de la rose was made
for Karsavina and Nijinsky, whose glory saturated their roles like the scent
of the rose itself. ENB's pair  - who had better remain anonymous  - looked
bemused. They also looked wholly unsuited to their task. A nasty clatter
after the piece ended could have been Le Spectre de Michel Fokine expressing
an opinion on this ludicrous staging.
What Fokine might have said about the programme's finale, Scheherazade, does
not bear contemplation. There was the set, basically lit, with drifting
clouds of dry ice  - doubtless the slaves were having a quick puff before
the main bout of the evening. There were the Bakst costumes, some of them
even looking inhabited. There was Carlos Acosta - who has something of the
right physical lusciousness for the role  - making his debut as the Golden
Slave, and determined to let us see that he could turn multitudinous
pirouettes. There were lifts in an interpolated pas de deux which prove that
necessity is the mother of invention when you have to galvanise an exhausted
old romp  - and I know of no romp older or more exhausted. There were
conventional mime gestures, which Fokine abominated. There were tripping
slaves, eunuchs, a Zobeide (in a role only now to be performed by a Lynn
Seymour or an Asylmuratova) who shimmied like her sister Kate. There were
meagre pearls that had never known an oyster, and guards who had never known
a scimitar (it is not, one of the chaps had better be told, a fly-swat). And
there was all the unbridled sensuality of a game of hop-scotch.
Poor Fokine. Poor ENB.
English National Ballet presents its Fokine programme at the Royal Festival
Hall, London, until August 20

FT  19 AUG 92 / Warning on performance of pooled pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP performance by managers of pooled pension funds cannot be maintained
over a long period, according to a survey which raises questions about the
basis upon which such managers are selected.
Trustees of pension schemes and consultants frequently use past performance
as a guide to future returns. But Hymans Robertson, the firm of consulting
actuaries, attempted to find fund managers who had produced top-quartile
returns for each of three three-year periods between the years 1983 and
1991.
'No managers met this criteria,' it says in its 1992 pooled pension fund
survey.
Several managers were able to produce consistently above-average returns for
the whole period, but none could maintain a ranking in the top 25 per cent
of performers for any length of time.
Henderson Administration and Newton Investment Management were in the top
quartile in two of the three-year periods and had the most consistently good
investment performance.
Two managers, Crown Life and Provident Mutual, after achieving top returns
between 1983 and 1988, fell into the bottom quartile in the 1989-91 period,
while two others, Britannia Life and London and Manchester, ranked in the
top quartile between 1986 and 1991 but neither fund was available in the
1983-85 period.
The survey also found that segregated pension funds  - fund managed as
discreet entities  - tend to out-perform pooled funds run by the same
manager, in spite of the conventional wisdom that economies of scale allow
pooled funds to outperform.
In attempting to explain the divergence, Hymans Robertson said that fees
automatically deducted from clients in pooled funds may affect returns and
that the property exposure of pooled funds may also have undermined
performance.

FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Iran threatens to sue Siemens over N-plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN is threatening to sue Siemens, the German electrical and electronics
group, for refusing to complete a nuclear power plant project.
Mr Mansour Haji-Azim, the vice-president in charge of the power stations of
Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation (AEO), said last week that Iran would be
pursuing its dispute with Siemens in a number of international forums,
including in court.
The dispute revolves around the failure by Siemens to complete the Bushehr
power plant in southern Iran, begun in 1975 as part of the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's nuclear programme.
The project, which was planned to include two 13,000MW reactors, was
abandoned in 1979 when the plant was about 85 per cent completed. It was
later bombed by Iraqi aircraft in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
Iran, which is suffering from an acute shortage of power generation, has
been pushing Siemens to complete the project. It also wants delivery of
components for the plant for which it has already paid.
But Siemens says it is subject to a ban imposed by the German government in
June 1990 denying export licences for components of nuclear power plants. In
June, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, said on a visit to
Tehran that Germany would not help rebuild the plant.
Despite the threat to sue by the AEO, Iran has signed a letter of agreement
with Siemens for a gas-fired power station in the free trade zone area of
Qeshm island in the Gulf.
The agreement was penned during a visit to Iran earlier this month by Mr
Heinrich von Pierer, managing director of Siemens.
The Qeshm Free Trade Authority, formed to encourage inward foreign
investment, has been attacked for the agreement. 'The act of the authorities
of the Qeshm free trade zone should in fact be considered as a kind of
mocking the people,' commented Abrar, a Tehran daily.
Asked by a caller on a radio phone-in programme why the agreement had been
signed, Mr Haj-Sa'id, AEO research vice-president, blamed it on lack of
co-ordination between government ministries.
Calling for more co-ordination, he said: 'We can all unanimously decide then
whether to sign agreements with Siemens or not.'
However, Mr Wolfgang Brieyer of KWU, power generation subsidiary of Siemens,
said yesterday that 'the Iranian authorities understand that it is not
within the grasp of Siemens to complete the project. We have continually
applied for an export licence.'
Calls by the Jomhuri Eslami newspaper for a trade boycott against Germany
seem impractical.
Germany is Iran's largest trading partner with exports of Dollars 4.1bn in
1991 against imports from Iran of Dollars 902m.

ATILLA Dogan, a privately owned Turkish construction group, has signed a
letter of intent to build the second stage of the Ankara natural gas
distribution network, beating competition from British Gas and SAE of
France.
Atilla Dogan, in partnership with SII of Italy, expects to sign a contract
with Ankara Municipality within 30 days, and to complete the construction
within four years.
The project is to connect gas lines to 150,000 city homes, constructing
20-30 gas regulating stations using natural gas supplied under a 20-year
contract from Russia. Istanbul and Bursa are installing similar systems.
The decision to offer the project to Atilla Dogan is a blow to British Gas
which won the first-stage gas network and was closely involved in designing
the system. British Gas was unable to match Atilla Dogan, who came in at
around Dollars 80m compared with the UK bid of Dollars 122m.
Atilla Dogan was yesterday in final negotiation with EGO, the Turkish state
gas company. The company confirmed it was seeking finance from Sace, the
Italian export credit agency.
The company has also been asked to secure a bridging loan from local sources
in US dollars to enable construction to start.

FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Chile leads flow of capital into Argentina
 -Cross-border trade, almost doubled since 1990, is set to top Dollars 1bn
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN capital is flowing once again into Argentina on the back of the
government's economic reform programme. Surprisingly, much is coming from
neighbouring Chile, small by comparison and until recently hostile.
Chileans have invested more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 418m) in Argentina
over the past two-and-a-half years, remarkable considering that Chile's
gross domestic product of Dollars 31bn is less than a third of Argentina's.
Despite the absence of formal integration pacts, cross-border trade has
almost doubled since 1990, and is expected to top Dollars 1bn this year.
President Carlos Menem's privatisation programme has provided most of the
investments, but there has also been a tide of Chilean investment in
retailing and manufacturing, as confidence in Argentina's economic stability
grows. Also, binational infrastructure projects involving billions of
dollars are being planned for the mid-1990s.
Chilean utilities, privatised in the 1980s, have been scooping large chunks
of Argentina's electricity sector now up for sale. A consortium led by
Chilectra will this month take over managing Edesur, a power distribution
company serving the industrial suburbs of Buenos Aires.
Chilectra and its partners bid Dollars 511m for 51 per cent of Edesur, and
plan to invest a further Dollars 100m to cut energy theft and improve
services. This is the largest single Chilean investment in Argentina so far.
Another group led by Endesa, Chile's biggest utility, has bought for Dollars
90m a power generating complex serving Buenos Aires. A rival Chilean
consortium paid Dollars 92m cash for a majority stake in Central Puerto, a
power plant also supplying the Argentine capital. Chilean companies believe
they can turn these loss-making state utilities into profit.
Less spectacular sums are being channelled into shopping malls and
supermarkets, and the food, furniture and copper manufacturing industries.
Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's former debt negotiator and adviser to Finance
Minister Domingo Cavallo on Argentine debt, says Chileans are seeing niches
for enlarging their businesses and reaping benefits of economies of scale.
'After eight years' economic growth, the home market has become too small
for Chile's leading industrial groups,' he explains. 'Argentina is virgin
territory. Its population is over twice that of Chile's, and per capita
incomes are much higher.'
Mr Hernan Somerville, Chile's chief debt negotiator in the 1980s, believes
Chile's export of capital is a permanent trend. 'The first phase of Chile's
export development  - fruit, fish, copper  - is now over. Many cash-rich
Chilean corporations have reached the limits of their expansion in Chile.
Becoming multinationals is the next step.' The gradual opening of Chile's
capital account is helping this trend. Chilean companies wanting to invest
abroad faced many curbs in the past because of the Central Bank's fear of
capital flight, no longer seen as a problem.
Argentine assets are perceived as cheap compared with their Chilean
equivalents. Mr Somerville says Argentine assets are not seen as expensive
in Chile because investors expect higher profits once Argentina's economic
reforms begin to bear fruit. 'Chileans are willing to pay more for Argentine
assets because they don't perceive the same risk factors as European or
Japanese investors.'
Some territorial disputes linger, but the civilian governments on both sides
of the Andes, which almost went to war in 1978 over three islands in the
Beagle Channel, are keen to bury their sabre-rattling days. Chileans have
long been dismissive of the Argentine work ethic. Now businessmen on the
Santiago-Buenos Aires shuttle detect a change. 'Argentines have become more
cost-conscious and more realistic,' one Chilean investor says.
Perhaps the Chilean asset in widest demand is expertise. 'Chile was a
laboratory for free-market reforms, so we are well placed to advise our
neighbours on the good, the bad and the ugly,' says Mr Aninat. His economic
consultancy is setting up a ratings agency in Buenos Aires, as a new law
that comes into effect in October will require all corporate bond issues and
debt paper to be valued by two private rating companies. This has been the
case in Chile for over 10 years.
Chilean pension fund managers are also making a bee-line for Buenos Aires,
where private retirement schemes will be introduced at the end of the year.
Chile privatised its social security system 11 years ago. 'Nobody else in
Latin America has our knowledge in this field,' says Mr Julio Bustamante,
Chile's superintendent of pension companies.
Another sign of fading rivalries is evident in the area of oil exploration.
Chile's state oil concern, Enap, has been authorised to drill for oil on the
Argentine side of the Magellan Straits. By the end of September, a final
decision is expected on construction of a Dollars 200m oil pipeline, linking
the province of Neuquen, Argentina, with Chilean refineries near Concepcion.
The flow of crude will boost bilateral trade by Dollars 400m a year. Also,
two rival Chilean groups are bidding to build a gas pipeline between Neuquen
and Santiago, expected to cost over Dollars 1bn and be ready by 1995.
Finally, both countries want to bore a 16-mile corridor under the Andes to
relieve congestion on the mountain pass linking Santiago and Mendoza.
Presidents Carlos Menem and Patricio Aylwin are expected to launch the
project this month.

Stephen Fidler reports. The increase will raise the rate for laden vessels
from Dollars 2.01 to Dollars 2.21 a ton. The rise is the sixth in the
canal's 78-year operating history, the last taking effect in October 1989.
The increase is needed to meet expenses and finance a capital improvement
programme.

<TEXT>
CUBA is seeking increased economic links with its immediate neighbours, and
has asked to be granted the status of an observer to the 13-nation Caribbean
Economic Community (Caricom).
The request is likely to be followed by an application for full membership,
officials in Caricom states say. But the request for observer status has not
been received with enthusiasm by all community members, and there is some
doubt that it will be granted.
A decision is expected at the community's next summit in July. The Cubans
have been encouraged by Caricom's decision to establish a joint commission
with Havana to investigate areas of possible economic co-operation.
Mr Ramon Sanchez Parodi, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, says Havana has
also taken heart from its recent admission to the Caribbean Tourism
Organisation, over the objections of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands,
two US Caribbean possessions.
'The Cubans do not speak the political language of Caricom members,' said
Dame Eugenia Charles, premier of Dominica. 'They cannot just jump into bed
with us. There must be a courting period.'
Mr Sanchez said his government wanted to increase its limited economic ties
with its Caribbean neighbours: 'There are now opportunities for Cuba to work
with the rest of the Caribbean in tourism, trade and all economic matters.'
'There is also the prospect for collaboration in high-technology and
biotechnology ventures, with firms in the private and public sectors. The US
opposed Cuba's application to join the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, but
the members supported it. Caricom will accept Cuba despite US pressures.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Patten chases prize of compromise in divided Hong Kong:
Simon Holberton on an administrative blueprint that might square a difficult
circle for the colony's new governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, meets Mr Zhou Nan, Beijing's
most senior official in the colony, tomorrow both are likely to shy away
from the subject of domestic Hong Kong politics.
There will no doubt be inconclusive exchanges about the airport, Mr Zhou's
health  - he was unable to attend the governor's swearing-in six weeks ago
because he was ill  - and possibly, the recent troubles in Shenzhen.
But the meeting, which is being billed as a 'get to know you' session, will
avoid anything that hints at negotiation or controversy.
For China, the meeting will be the first opportunity to meet a man who, in
less than two months, has taken Hong Kong by storm. Mr Patten has managed to
redefine the role of governor as populist leader  - with his opinion poll
ratings as high as Mr Zhou's are low.
There is, however, no one in Hong Kong more aware than Mr Patten that his
first weeks in office have been little more than a triumph of style over
content. An early test of his fibre will come when he unveils his plans for
political reform in the colony. These are likely to come in two stages.
The first, which will coincide with his formal opening of the local
legislature on October 7, will be his blueprint for the operation of Hong
Kong's representative and executive branches of government  - the
Legislative and Executive Councils respectively.
The second will be arrangements for the colony's 1995 elections. These will
probably not be decided quickly. However, he may use his October address to
define the options and his preferred solution, and see where the ensuing
public debate leads.
To win Beijing over to his view, Mr Patten will have to show that his plans
for the legislature and the executive are ones with which China can live. He
has already made reassuring noises in Beijing's direction with his firmly
stated position that his administration will be 'executive-led'. China wants
a strong executive to keep the legislature in its place.
Mr Patten's main concern is to have a government which works. After last
September's partially democratic elections, his predecessor, Lord Wilson,
sought a workable solution by inviting appointed conservative members of the
legislature into his cabinet. He hoped this would secure him a majority in
the legislature.
The policy had mixed results, with the conservative group's support for the
government less sure as it has increasingly looked towards its future role,
post-1997. To secure that role it needs to look and act independently,
rather than as a rubber stamp to a British colonial government.
The Wilson solution also failed to accommodate the democrat-ically elected
element within the legislature  - 12 of whom rally to Mr Martin Lee's United
Democrats and six of whom broadly support the governor - which was excluded
from the executive.
Mr Patten is spending the Hong Kong summer thinking about the options. From
what he has said, together with some well placed leaks to test local
reaction, it is possible to see a line of thought which might just enable
him to square a very difficult circle.
Taken together, the elements of such a plan mark a change for the
administration of Hong Kong, which may not win Mr Patten plaudits from many
of the democrats in the colony. These elements include:
The Executive Council. Mr Patten would accept the resignations of the 10
unofficial members that Baroness Dunn secured for him early last month. This
would allow him to recast his cabinet into the advisory body he appears to
want.
The reconstructed cabinet would have a broad based membership, including
businessmen, men and women of ability  - some of whom may have good links
with Beijing  - and leading civic figures. But it might not include any
member of the legislature.
This latter omission may put some leading politicians' noses out of joint.
But Mr Patten may well conclude that no cabinet that includes politicians
will guarantee him a smooth ride through the legislature. Having split the
executive from the legislature, Mr Patten would dissolve the Office of
Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO). This would allow
him to create a committee system for the legislature  - something which most
members want, especially the Democrats.
As in the US Congress, committee members could quiz government officials
about policy and amend bills in committee before they pass to the
legislature for ratification. The committees would also serve other ends.
They would provide local politicians with a platform but one outside the
government. They would also provide a forum for senior Hong Kong Chinese
government officials to essay their political skills.
Mr Patten is keen to appoint a local Hong Kong Chinese to the chief
secretaryship when the incumbent, Sir David Ford, retires around 1994. The
best official in the legislature may well be called upon to succeed Sir
David.
Bolstering the officials will be the governor himself. He will introduce a
form of 'prime minister's questions'  - thereby making good his promise of
'open and accessible government'. He will also be assiduous in working the
telephone to ensure he gets a majority for his policies.
Could he sell such a package to China? Beijing fears change of any sort, so
he will have to convince them that it is for the better. Such a package has
elements which Beijing should like  - executive-led, some of their people in
the cabinet and no Democrats. China would have to compromise on committees
 -which their representatives in the legislature have opposed  - but that
might not be too much to ask.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Lebanese cabinet urged to delay poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARA MARLOWE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUST four days before the country's first legislative elections in 20 years
are scheduled to begin, the Lebanese cabinet will today discuss a petition
from five influential Christian parliamentarians that the elections be
postponed.
Opponents of the poll  - the majority of them Christians  - say the presence
of 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon will ensure the victory of pro-Syrian
candidates. Syria wants the poll to take place before the scheduled
withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon in September.
More than a dozen members of parliament this week announced that they were
withdrawing their candidacy, citing their wish 'to preserve national unity'.
They include Mr Tammam Salam, the eldest son of former Sunni Moslem Prime
Minister Saeb Salam, who has also spoken out against what he calls 'forced
elections'.
The deputies who petitioned President Elias Hrawi include Mr Fares Boueiz,
the Lebanese foreign minister, who is Mr Hrawi's son-in-law. Never before
has a Maronite president enjoyed so little support from his own religious
community.
Syria's Lebanese allies, including Prime Minister Rashid Solh, have insisted
that voting will begin as planned on August 23. But the divisive issue has
further undermined the ailing Lebanese economy and the decision of the
Christian Phalange party to boycott the poll has ensured that 700,000 of the
country's 2m eligible voters will not participate in the election.
A new legislature therefore risks having even less credibility than the
present assembly, which has repeatedly renewed its own mandate since 1972.
Supporters of General Michel Aoun, the exiled anti-Syrian Christian leader,
have threatened to enforce a 'curfew' on the three successive Sundays of the
election and Christian parties have called a three-day general strike
starting on August 21 if the voting goes ahead.
Prime Minister Solh has twice visited Damascus this month to discuss
Christian demands for a postponement with the Syrian vice-president and
prime minister.
On returning from the Syrian capital on Monday night, Mr Solh insisted that
the elections would take place as planned.
The Lebanese pound reached an all-time low of LPounds 2,800 to the dollar
last week, but has since risen to LPounds 2,340 after the Central Bank
resumed intervention on the foreign exchange market. The European Community
yesterday called for Lebanon's forthcoming general election to be free and
fair, saying that only a fully representative government could restore
national and international confidence, Reuter reports. The EC, in a
statement issued by Britain as current president, reaffirmed support for
Lebanon's 'independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity'. It
said the election was crucial for the country's future and called for the
elections to be conducted 'according to democratic principles'.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Commonwealth team to go to South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONWEALTH will send a team of about a dozen prominent citizens to
help end violence in South Africa and facilitate renewed constitutional
negotiations, it was announced yesterday.
The groundwork for the Commonwealth role was carried out last month when
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the organisation's secretary general, visited South
Africa for talks with political leaders.
During his visit Chief Anyaoku won government approval for a plan setting
out a Commonwealth contribution to the search for a political settlement.
Many of the elements, including the suggestion that there should be close
liaison with the country's National Peace Secretariat, an independent body
formed last year which monitors political violence, were taken up by Mr
Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy to South Africa.
In response to his report, the Security Council has authorised stationing UN
observers in South Africa, expected to number around 30, to help end
township violence. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the European
Community are also expected to send teams.
Yesterday the South African government accepted the report, saying it would
welcome the stationing of observers in the country.
'The resolution is acceptable in its main components. Blame is not
apportioned to any party. Even-handedness is maintained,' Mr Pik Botha,the
foreign minister said in a statement.
'The need is emphasised to strengthen South African structures such as the
National Peace Accord. So is the importance of co-operation of all parties
in the resumption of the negotiation process as speedily as possible,' Mr
Botha added.
In its statement the Commonwealth secretariat said that Chief Anyaoku 'is
hoping to constitute a group of prominent Commonwealth citizens and it is
expected they will work in quiet, non-public ways in order to make a
practical contribution to help end the violence.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / Management (Training on Trial): Divisions over uniting
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training and Enterprise Councils will consider a broad range of options over
the next few weeks on how to co-ordinate their operations on a national
basis.
A shortlist of options prepared by Sir Christopher Ball, an academic, has
been presented to G10, the group of Tec chairmen who liase with the
government, and they will put proposals to Tecs this week.
The issue needs to be urgently resolved but because of the diversity of
opinion it is likely to provoke divisions between the 82 Tecs in England and
Wales. Indeed, discussion over a new intermediary body turned into a stormy
debate at the recent national Tec conference. Advocates of a strong
intermediary body, on the lines of Scottish Enterprise, claim it would give
them more clout with government and greater operating freedom.
The issue has risen to the top of Tecs' agendas because:
The National Training Task Force, a committee made up of leading businessmen
such as Sir Bryan Woolfson, chairman of Wembley Stadium, comes to the end of
its remit this year. While its main role has been to advise government on
setting up Tecs, it has taken on a number of other central responsibilities
such as getting the Investors in People Initiative (IIP) off the ground.
There is concern about G10, which is being asked to take on a greater
workload and is becoming over-stretched. Agendas for meetings at national
level have often contained too many topics with too little time for each.
The new national training targets, drawn up by the Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) and endorsed by many other organisations including the
government, need to be monitored nationally and examples of best practice
publicised.
The performance of Tecs vary, and because they have been fiercely
independent, there is a need for them to share best practice.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Management (Health Check): Sobering tips on alcohol - Dr
Michael McGannon urges you to keep tabs on your tipples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF you are over 45 and have at least four drinks a day after work, you
should be concerned. Yet most managers are reluctant to face the problem of
alcohol abuse, despite the quantity and quality of research on the subject.
My own findings suggest that managers have a folkloric understanding of
alcohol's effects. When asked about their weekly consumption of alcohol,
more than 80 per cent ignored wine and beer, counting only spirits as
'alcohol'.
Adding to the misunderstanding are the old wives' tales about alcohol. More
than 60 per cent of interviewed managers believe that alcohol is 'good for
the heart' or 'helps in digestion'.
Alcohol is the principal means by which the highly stressed manager can
anaesthetize himself. Moreover, many executives still see alcohol as a
'lubricant' for contacts and deals, and do plenty of business around
alcohol.
Alcohol can be a source of enjoyment but is it part of your problem or your
solution? The chances are that alcohol is a 'problem' if you are drinking
more than 28 units per week (a 'unit' is a glass of wine, bottle of beer, or
a shot of spirits).
Researchers from Barcelona recently published in the New England Journal of
Medicine results of studies which demonstrated that the muscle fibres of the
heart are weakened by heavy drinking.
The Framingham Study of nearly 5,000 people confirmed that, instead of being
'cardio-protective', heavy alcohol use can be toxic to the heart and
skeletal muscle, causing dangerous enlargement of the pumping chambers of
the heart.
When used injudiciously, alcohol impairs a full range of functions both
cerebral (memory, concentration, judgement and learning) and physical
(sexual, co-ordination, balance and speech).
It has been estimated that more than 60 per cent of liver cirrhosis
(irreparable scarring of the liver) is caused by alcohol, and you need not
be a 'problem drinker' to develop alcoholic's liver disease.
Alcohol is also a rich source of non-nutritive calories and, therefore,
heavy drinking is associated with weight gain and vitamin deficiency.
Moreover, alcohol can cause marked water and mineral losses, leaving you
tired and weak.
Some managers already recognise all this and no longer view drinking as a
rite of passage for advancement in international business life. For the
rest:
The first step is to know where you stand. Start by counting the number of
drinks you have in a typical week, both at work and at home. Maintaining a
ceiling of 3 drinks per day is, by most estimates, probably safe. Binge
drinking is to be avoided.
To gauge your relationship to alcohol, abstain from drinking for two or
three weeks and see how you react. Are you easily irritated? Is your sleep
pattern disturbed? Did you lose weight? If the answer to any of these
questions is yes, consider cutting back to one to two drinks per day with
meals.
As up to 25 per cent of alcohol can be absorbed through the stomach wall,
never drink alcohol on an empty stomach. Buffer the effects with fruit juice
or water before sending down your first drink. This can prevent the gastric
irritation caused by alcohol that can impair digestion.
To avoid the dehydrating effects of alcohol, make every other drink at a
business function a non-alcoholic one. After an evening of drinks, consume
water freely to avoid the dreaded hangover.
By weaving these measures into your working life, you will be able to
'lubricate' business deals while avoiding the slippery slope that can lead
to ill-health, poor professional performance and failed marriages.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Council's video system cuts crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIDEO surveillance system set up by King's Lynn Borough Council, in
Norfolk, has cut car crime in the town centre and may be extended to include
local businesses.
The system was installed earlier this year after the success of a pilot
scheme on a council-owned industrial estate, where crime had been
discouraging businesses from moving in.
Thirty six cameras are now located in car parks, housing estates and leisure
and shopping centres. They are linked by fibre optic cables to a central
control room which is staffed 24 hours a day and which has a direct link to
the police station.
Running the system costs Pounds 200,000 year in staff, maintenance and
leasing costs. This is partly funded by a 5p surcharge on carpark tickets
and service charges for businesses in areas covered by the scheme.
The council claims it is the UK's first multi-application surveillance
system which can be used for management of council facilities as well as
crime prevention and security.
The council is now considering expanding the service to businesses in the
town on a commercial basis.
The low-light cameras can be targeted on a particular place if there are
signs of suspicious activity, and all pictures are recorded. The system has
cut vandalism and reduced car thefts from three a fortnight to three over
the six-month period since it was introduced.
Police attribute 53 arrests directly to the cameras, and the borough council
says people are no longer reluctant to use carparks in shopping centres
because of car crime. It says that any public worries over 'big brother'
surveillance have been offset by the benefits of having increased security.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Jensen Car calls in liquidators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JENSEN CAR Company, the manufacturer of high-performance sports cars for the
rich and sometimes famous, is giving up the struggle against market
indifference and calling in the liquidators.
Officials from Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, yesterday made their
first visit to the Jensen works in West Bromwich, West Midlands, to look
over the books and property. Creditors are owed Pounds 638,000. The
liquidators hope to sell the company as a going concern.
Grant Thornton said: 'It is a very difficult business to value, because of
the nature of the thing  - and who knows really what something with this
reputation is worth on a goodwill basis?'
Jensen cars are hand built. Some parts are made in West Bromwich, others are
bought in from component manufacturers. They have a list price of about
Pounds 100,000 and are sold direct from the factory.
But the small scale of production has not made Jensen a serious contender on
the sports car market in recent years, although early this year the company
introduced a re-engineered model, the first significant change to the Jensen
Interceptor since 1983.
Only one Jensen car has been sold this year, however  - to Germany  - and
there are no outstanding orders.
Jensen, which went into receivership in 1976, has been supported financially
for the past 18 months by Unicon Holdings of Stockport. With no sign of
fresh orders, Unicon has decided to cut its losses. Grant Thornton said:
'The company is a victim not only of recession in the UK, but also recession
worldwide.'
About 20 people work at the factory which once produced cars for the likes
of Clark Gable, Henry Cooper and Cliff Richard. The assets of the company  -
apart from a property and lingering goodwill  - are a mass of jigs, tool and
dies, one M-registered Jensen, another in the process of being rebuilt, a
large parts department and a servicing operation.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Industry cool on timeshare rules: Many people are critical
of the legislation intended to curb sharp practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Timeshare Act, which gives purchasers a cooling-off period of 14
days to cancel their contracts, will be of little comfort to the man from
Staffordshire who fell for the renumbering trick.
The renumbering trick works like this: the buyer purchases time in a
top-floor Tenerife studio flat with a sea view and, in the case of the man
from Staffordshire, pays Pounds 3,300.
A year later he arrives for his holiday and discovers that the flats have
been re-numbered. He now has a basement studio.
He is told he can have a top-floor flat, although a new building has
regrettably appeared between his development and the sea, depriving him of
his sea view. All he has to do to get the flat he originally wanted is to
pay an additional Pounds 1,300. He pays up.
'The Brits,' says Miss Diana Hanks, consumer services manager of the
Timeshare Council, 'have infinite trust.'
The Timeshare Council, which represents owners' groups and the legitimate
industry, is severely critical of the Timeshare Act. Giving purchasers 14
days to pull out of timeshare agreements, deals with only one of the abuses
perpetrated by the less reputable members of the timeshare industry:
high-pressure selling.
The act does not protect those who buy timeshares in properties that are
never built. Nor does it help those who sign contracts on the selling
company's promise, subsequently unfulfilled, that it will sell an existing
timeshare.
In addition, the cooling-off period only applies if the contract is
concluded in the UK. The Timeshare Council estimates that 75 per cent of
timeshare contracts are concluded while the buyers are on holiday abroad.
The act has its defenders. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the
Consumers' Association, says that it has the merit of confining itself to
provisions which can be enforced. 'It is a pretty effective way of dealing
with the difficult problem of selling pressure,' he says.
Abuses which take place outside the UK can only be dealt with by a planned
European Community directive, but not all EC members regard the directive as
urgent.
Mr Ron Haylock, managing director of RCI Europe, which arranges timeshare
exchanges, says he does not expect a directive from the EC before 1994  -
and governments would then have an additional two years to implement it.
However, the delay in devising an effective system of consumer protection
has not retarded the growth of the European timeshare industry.
Mr Haylock estimates that the number of people buying timeshares in Europe
grew by 28 per cent last year to 125,000. This year's figure is expected to
be 138,000. In 1987 it was 46,000.
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France have seen strong growth in
the timeshare industry. However, the most spectacular performer of all, he
says, is Spain. Although the country it is a favoured location for timeshare
apartments, Spaniards have only recently begun to feature among the buyers.
The UK has the largest number of timeshare buyers but, in contrast to the
rest of Europe, the British market has begun to decline. Mr Haylock
estimates that there were 49,000 UK buyers last year, only 1,000 more than
in 1990. In the first eight months of this year the number of UK buyers fell
by 8 per cent. Mr Haylock believes this is the result of the recession
rather than consumer concern about sharp practice.
Miss Hanks, however, argues that legislation is still needed to deal with
sharp practices. The Timeshare Council would like tighter control of
purchasers' money when timeshares have been purchased in property that is
still being built. A common ploy is for rogue vendors to sell timeshares in
flats that have not been built, and then offer buyers holidays in
alternative accommodation.
She says it should be compulsory for timeshare companies to offer potential
buyers full prospectuses which specify whether the property has been
completed.
When villas and apartments have not yet been built, buyers' money should be
paid to trustees, who should then release it in phases as construction work
is completed.
Legislation, she says, should also deal with the problem of buyers who
discover, after paying cash, that they have also acquired a pre-existing
mortgage over the property.
Vendors should have to specify that the timeshare they are selling has no
encumbrances. Selling timeshares which turn out to include additional
financial obligations of this sort, should, she says, be 'a criminal offence
with massive fines and imprisonment'.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Consumers blame banks for card fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMERS blame the banks for not making credit cards more fraud-proof, but
are reluctant to pay extra for photocards or thief-proof 'smart' cards,
according to a Mori survey for Readers' Digest, David Barchard writes.
About 2m payment cards are lost or stolen each year in the UK, with losses
of around Pounds 166m for the banks.
Two out of three people interviewed blamed the banks for failing to do more
to make credit cards fraud-proof. A slightly higher number, 69 per cent,
believed shop assistants should check purchaser identities more thoroughly.
Of 2,049 cardholders interviewed, 58 per cent said they would not pay extra
for a photo-card or a thief-proof smart card. Some 27 per cent said they
would pay Pounds 2 or more for additional security.
A third of cardholders admitted they had written down their personal
identification numbers (PINs), potentially allowing fraudsters to draw money
from their accounts though cash machines. More than one in 20 kept their PIN
with their card.
Barclays, the largest UK card issuer, said yesterday that it was shocked
that such large numbers admitted writing down their PIN and keeping the
number with their card.
The bank added that it was pioneering the use of artificial intelligence
which can detect fraudulent patterns of spending on cards. The system
detects around 40 such cases each week.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Slow growth predicted
for late this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOW economic growth should return to the UK later this year although the
outlook remains uncertain, according to a gloomy assessment published
yesterday by the Bank of England.
In its latest quarterly bulletin the Bank suggests that the recovery is
likely to be held back by the unwillingness of debt-laden consumers to
increase spending, the fragile world economy and thin order books in
industry.
One hopeful sign is falling inflation and low wage settlements. These
factors have aided manufacturing productivity and competitiveness, and were
partly reflected in the small growth in manufacturing output in the first
half of the year.
But the Bank sounds a warning over the widening trade deficit, caused by
increased import volumes. These have been 'surprisingly resilient given the
weakness of domestic demand throughout the recession'.
The assessment by the Bank, which was subject to vetting by the Treasury,
draws a distinction between increased spending by companies and continued
low consumer demand.
Companies spent more on buildings, plant and machinery in the first quarter,
apparently buoyed by hopes of stronger output later this year. This was the
first quarterly rise in investment since early 1990. Companies also stopped
reducing stocks of components and finished goods. Much of this activity
benefited overseas suppliers, showing up in the rise in imports.
But in the same three months consumer spending  - which accounts for two
thirds of gross domestic product  - fell 0.7 per cent compared with the
previous quarter. That was in spite of a 1 per cent rise in real disposable
incomes.
People's reluctance to increase spending is the main reason for the length
and seriousness of this recession. Consumer spending has fallen3.5 per cent
since mid-1990, compared with declines of less than 2 per cent in the
recessions of 1974-75 and 1980-81.
The Bank says 'significant numbers of people are saving more as they attempt
to repay some of the large amounts of debt accumulated in the late 1980s'
rather than increasing purchases of goods and services.
Interest payments on this debt  - a large proportion of which has comprised
mortgages  - have declined due to the 5 percentage-point fall in base rates
over the past two years to 10 per cent.
Even so, the Bank says, 'so far the personal sector has had only limited
success in cutting the scale of its debt in relation to income'.
The ratio of gross consumer debt to income fell by only 0.75 of a percentage
point from its peak of 91 per cent early last year.
Total personal sector borrowing as a proportion of assets  - the gearing
ratio  - increased to nearly 15 per cent at the end of last year (see
chart). Meanwhile, mortgage debt as a proportion of housing assets rose to
29 per cent. This figure has been pushed up by the decline in house prices
over the past four years.
According to the Bank, the fall in prices  - by about a quarter for some
parts of Britain  - has led to up to 1m mortgage holders having a mortgage
greater than the value of their home.
The Bank says falling inflation 'may have altered individuals' expectations
about the rate at which wage increases will enable households to outgrow
their existing debt'.
It adds: 'Highly geared households, which suffered a proportionately greater
squeeze on their incomes from high interest rates, are now suffering a
proportionately greater decline in their wealth as house prices fall.'
The UK outlook has been worsened by the depressed state of the world economy
'which continues to cause concern'. Across western Europe  - where borrowing
costs have been kept high due to high German interest rates  - the outlook
for the rest of this year 'is still fairly bleak'.
With the Japanese and US economies remaining subdued, growth this year among
the Group of Seven industrial nations  - the US, Japan, Germany, Italy,
France, Canada and Britain  - is expected to be less than 2 per cent.
Weakness in overseas markets has depressed export volumes, which are growing
less strongly than a year ago. Between the second half of last year and the
first half of this year non-oil export volumes rose 0.8 per cent. The
equivalent growth in imports was 4.9 per cent.
These changes have increased Britain's trade deficit on visible goods for
each of the past four quarters.
The Bank says the degree of import penetration partly reflects 'a sizeable
turnround in imports of consumer goods following a sharp reduction in such
imports earlier in the recession'.
The Bank draws a contrast with the sharp fall in imports during the previous
recession, when volumes fell 13 per cent between the beginning and the end
of 1980.
While the stronger activity by UK businesses this year  - some of which may
reflect their success in paying off debts and restoring their balance sheets
 - gives some grounds for optimism, the outlook for industry is patchy.
Business confidence was highly volatile in the first six months of this
year, leading to 'cautious hand-to-mouth ordering (which) has intensified
the uncertainties facing many companies'.
The Bank adds: 'Companies will continue to invest only if there is a
prospect of sustained growth of consumption and export demand'.
On the rapid recent increase in the public sector borrowing requirement, the
Bank says 'the uncertainty about the degree of slack in the economy makes it
difficult to judge the underlying fiscal position'. Meeting the Maastricht
standards on public sector debt will, however, require strict control of
public spending over the next few years.

FT  19 AUG 92 / NHS trust sets up pay system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JOB evaluation system for healthcare employers seeking to introduce local
pay bargaining has been developed jointly by Manchester Central Hospitals,
which was in the first wave of National Health Service trusts in April last
year.
Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick developed the system in conjunction with the
Manchester hospitals and hopes to sell it to other NHS trusts that want to
break away from the centralised pay and grading structure.
The Manchester trust employs about 6,000 people and has more than 450 types
of job. The new computerised evaluation system is highly complex because
each department has very different skill requirements for apparently
identical job titles.
The system will form the basis of a single pay spine for all the trust's
medical and non-medical staff.
A progress report by Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says
that the Manchester trust has not yet moved to local bargaining for basic
pay and conditions.
The trust has, however, created 'single-table' bargaining for its 22 staff
organisations on non-pay matters discussed at local level. These are for
grievance procedures, which are covered by deals replacing NHS agreements.
Mr Richard Sugden, trust personnel director, says that the success of the
trust will largely depend on how well it manages its pay bill, which
accounts for 70 per cent of costs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ ARCHER, one of two Lloyd's agencies listed on the stock exchange, has
agreed in principle to acquire the Lloyd's agency businesses of Cuthbert
Heath Holdings, creating one of the largest businesses at the London
insurance market.
This year the Archer and Cuthbert Heath managing agencies administered the
affairs of 16 separate syndicates with a combined capital base  - or stamp
capacity  - of Pounds 500m.
The two members' agencies handle the affairs of more than 500 Names  - the
individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's.
Mr David Hazlewood, chief executive of Cuthbert Heath, said: 'The report of
the Rowland task force underlined the need for the Lloyd's market to
restructure itself into larger, more economic units. We believe our proposed
combination is one of the most significant moves in this direction to date.'
One of the attractions of the deal for Archer is that it gives it control of
Service Motor, one of the biggest motor insurance syndicates.

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY is holding talks with the International Monetary Fund aimed at
unfreezing credits withheld because of Budapest's failure to contain public
spending.
Negotiations began this week in Budapest as it became evident that the Fund
had not disbursed a tranche of SDR79.6m (Pounds 59.5m) due in May as part of
a three-year programme to finance Hungary's economic transition.
The fate of that and a further instalment due in the coming month hinges on
the Hungary's ability to convince the IMF it has turned over a new leaf and
will contain next year's budget deficit even if this year's is beyond
repair.
Budapest is confident the IMF will tolerate a public sector deficit of
Ft180bn (Pounds 1.2bn) or between 6 and 6.5 per cent of gross domestic
product this year, but only if Hungary gives a commitment to keep the 1993
shortfall to that level in nominal terms.
Even though the forecast 1992 deficit is several times the 1.9 per cent IMF
target, achieving even that figure will require a package of spending cuts
and revenue increases amounting to Ft40bn.
The government will have to force its budget proposals through parliament at
a high political price.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Danish opposition urges fiscal expansion: Hilary Barnes on
political reasons behind the nervousness of the country's financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government is facing
strong political pressure to adopt a more expansive fiscal policy in order
to combat 11 per cent unemployment and invigorate an economy which has been
plunged into uncertainty by the electorate's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty on European union in the June 2 referendum.
Although the Folketing, Denmark's parliament, does not meet again until
October, there is speculation about a possible winter election, contributing
to nervousness in the Danish financial markets.
But Mr Poul Schluter, who will celebrate his tenth anniversary as prime
minister in September, denies that he will call an election, which is not
due for another two years. 'I consider it highly unlikely that the
negotiations over the 1993 finance bill will lead to an election,' he said
last week.
The parties calling for a more expansive fiscal policy - the Social
Democrats, the Radicals and the Socialist People's Party - point to the
large current account surplus as evidence that there is plenty of room for
manoeuvre.
The first-half surplus was about DKr12.4bn (Pounds 1.14bn). It is expected
to exceed DKr20bn for the year, or rather more than two per cent of gross
domestic product. However, uncertainty caused by the Maastricht referendum
is the main reason why the government is reluctant to adopt a more expansive
economic policy.
So far, the main impact of the Maastricht vote has been felt in the
financial markets. The yield gap between Danish and German government bonds
has widened from 0.8 percentage points just before the vote to about 1.4
points.
The all-share price index has fallen by over 12 per cent this year, the
worst performance in Europe, with most of the decline taking place since the
referendum.
Several large Danish companies  - among them Lego, the toy company  - have
postponed investment plans because of the referendum result. Mr Knud
Sorensen, chief executive of the country's largest bank, Den Danske Bank,
said recently that business in general has put investment plans back in the
drawer for later reconsideration.
Most economic indicators, however, remain positive.
'We have one of the strongest economies in Europe, and we mean to keep it
that way,' said Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, economy minister.
Inflation this year is about 2.3 per cent, and is expected to be about the
same in 1993. The trade surplus is about 6 per cent of GDP, with the value
of exports so far this year up by about 6 per cent.
The central government budget deficit this year will be about DKr35bn, and
only considerable budget savings will keep it to that level in 1993.
However, the total public sector budget is expected to show a small deficit
this year after several years of surplus.
But Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister, says that as long as the
situation surrounding Denmark's status in the EC remains uncertain the
government cannot relax its tight grip on fiscal policy.
It is thought unlikely that the Radicals, the small centre party which holds
the balance between the socialist and non-socialist parties in the
Folketing, will risk toppling the experienced team of Mr Schluter and Mr
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Liberal Party leader and foreign minister, until the
Maastricht problem has been resolved, more especially as Denmark will hold
the chairmanship of the European Council for six months from January 1.
THE Danish Ministry for the Economy reduced its 1992 GDP growth forecast to
1.3 per cent, as a result of the adverse effects on business confidence of
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty and a severe drought, which has
hit agricultural output.
In April, the Ministry predicted a 2 per cent growth rate this year.
According to a new economic survey published yesterday, exports are still
expected to perform well, rising by 4.3 per cent in real terms. But an April
private consumption growth forecast of 2.5 per cent was cut to 1.5 per cent
and business investment is now expected to fall by 6.2 per cent, compared
with a decline of 3.8 per cent forecast in April.

The Bonn authorities complained that Czechoslovak exports of unwelded steel

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN Environment Minister Klaus Topfer yesterday presented a draft
regulation which would make it compulsory for car makers to take back their
old cars when they are ready for the scrap heap, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Under the draft, German motorists would be entitled to return their old cars
and lorries free of charge to their dealer for disposal or recycling.
'In the past, the emphasis was on developing, making and marketing cars,'
said. 'In future, anyone who produces and markets vehicles should also be
made responsible for their disposal.'
The ministry said the regulation, which must still be approved by the
cabinet, would apply to German as well as foreign manufacturers selling
vehicles in Germany, which is Europe's biggest car market with 36m
registered cars.
'The importer represents the manufacturer,' Mr Topfer said.
The order is aimed primarily at cars registered after it comes into effect
some time next year.
Older cars would be exempt if the manufacturer's costs for their disposal
exceeded the value of their reused parts. Cars crushed in an accident would
also be exempt because it would not be economical to recycle them.
In anticipation of the new rules, leading German car makers have announced
take-back guarantees for their latest models once they are ready to be
scrapped. Car makers around the world are already touting the environmental
features of their cars for consumers increasingly concerned about green
issues.
About 2.6m cars are scrapped annually in Germany, most ending up in crushing
plants. While 75 per cent of metal parts are recycled, components made of
plastic and glass, around 450,000 tonnes a year, are usually dumped.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S troubled wine industry managed to muster a 4.7 per cent increase in
exports to FFr13.1bn (Pounds 1.37bn) in the first half of this year compared
to the same period in 1991.
According to the latest figures from the Centre Francais du Commerce
Exterieur the increase was solely due to higher prices and favourable
currency trends, as the volume of wine exports fell by 7.5 per cent to 5.4m
hectolitres between January and July.
The worst affected area was champagne, which registered falls in both volume
and value sales of 7.2 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively.
The French wine industry has been hit by the combined effects of the global
economic slowdown and a surplus of supply after the bumper harvests of 1988,
1989 and 1990.
The supply situation has been eased by last year's smaller crop and France's
wine producers are now anxiously waiting to assess the 1992 harvest when
they pick the grapes next month.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German economics ministry yesterday laid down strict conditions which
had to be met before the economy returns to the course of stable growth it
maintained for most of the 1980s.
Despite 'great uncertainties', the ministry said it expected average annual
real growth of 2.5 per cent in the west, 9 per cent in the east and 3 per
cent overall until at least the end of 1996.
Western inflation, the key to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, was
unlikely to rise above an annual average of 3.5 per cent in the medium term.
However, the ministry added, meeting its forecasts for the 1992-96 period
depended on responsible wage settlements, restrictive government spending
policy, and diversion of cash transfers to the east from consumption into
capital investment. Worldwide economic recovery and a successful Gatt round
on world trade were also crucial.
Other assumptions in the ministry's model included the restoration of
stability in eastern European markets and the former Soviet Union.
The ministry's heavily hedged forecast coincided with a gloomy report from
the federal banking association complaining that the west German economy had
lost momentum.
Finance ministry figures showed rising demand for federal funds. Social
security spending is expected to rise more than 6 per cent next year to
almost DM150bn and to DM160bn in 1996. The government only recently limited
federal spending growth to a nominal 2.5 per cent a year.
The federal statistics office added to the short-term apprehension with a
report that average hourly wages in west Germany at the end of April were
7.2 per cent more than a year earlier.
Economists, comparing the ministry's inflation forecasts with the central
bank's target of 2 per cent, said that while there were good chances for
growth, inflation would present a 'constant danger'.
Mr Peter Pietsch at Commerzbank said he expected 'a very careful interest
rates policy for the coming years'. He was calculating on average inflation
in 1993 of 4 per cent, unchanged from this year.
For east Germany, where inflation is likely to average 8 per cent, the
economics ministry forecast an average annual increase in capital investment
of 17 per cent. 'In good years', growth in the former GDR could move into
double figures.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Wang seeks protection from creditors and cuts 5,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories, the US company which wrought a revolution in office life
by inventing computerised word processing, yesterday filed for protection
from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
In a last-ditch effort to survive, Wang plans to make about 5,000 employees
redundant during the next 30 days - reducing its already shrunken workforce
to about 8,000.
Mr Richard Miller, chairman, said Wang's aim was to focus on the service
business and the development and sale of software, and to shrink
manufacturing operations. The objective, he said, was to become 'a smaller,
more focused and more competitive company, with revenues of about Dollars
1.4bn (Pounds 729m), compared with Dollars 1.9bn now'.
Wang will, however, continue with the final assembly of its VS
minicomputers, and sell computers made by others, including International
Business Machines.
At a press conference in Massachusetts, Mr Miller admitted that the company
had even considered a Chapter 7 filing - which would have meant a
liquidation of the company's assets. But he said: 'I don't think breaking up
and selling the pieces of the company is in anyone's interests.'
With sale or merger avenues exhausted, he said the company would attempt to
draw up a business plan within weeks under bankruptcy court protection.
The company's future has been uncertain for several years. It was founded in
1951 by Dr An Wang, a Chinese immigrant, and was successful throughout the
1970s with its proprietary minicomputer systems. As chip technology
developed, however, Wang reacted slowly to the changes, and losses and debts
started to mount.
Wang negotiated a marketing and development alliance with IBM a year ago,
with the larger company providing some funding for Wang. Mr Miller said
yesterday he remained pleased with the relationship, and sales of IBM
equipment by Wang salestaff were 'building'.
Restructuring costs, however, compounded the financial problems, with the
result that total debt at March 31 reached Dollars 540m - more than 10 times
the company's 1991 net worth.
The company yesterday announced an after-tax loss of Dollars 139.2m in the
year to June 30, with a Dollars 116.3m deficit in the final quarter. This
compares with a Dollars 385.5m loss in the previous 12 months, and was
struck after restructuring costs and other one-off items of Dollars 51.9m
(Dollars 22.8m). Revenues last year were Dollars 1.9bn (Dollars 2.09bn).
Wang shares returned from suspension yesterday afternoon, and closed another
3/8 lower at 3/8.
Alan Cane writes: Wang's UK subsidiary, which employs some 720 people, said
yesterday it was not affected in the short term by its parent's bankruptcy.
Chapter 11 provisions had no authority in Britain. The company said
customers would still be supported.

FT  19 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick news hits sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE broker Sedgwick opened 15 lower and kept falling as the group's
second-half profits came below the market's worst expectations. The shares,
finally 34 down at 110p, were the most heavily traded in the London market
with turnover of 9.1m. The figures prompted sharp downgrades by analysts and
led to a slide across the remainder of the sector.
The group reduced its dividend to 3p from 4p and announced a profit of
Pounds 51.7m. Analysts had expected a dividend cut and also bad news from
the US but said the real surprise was that revenues were under pressure
right across the board.
Ms Karen Neale of Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut her full-year estimate to
Pounds 52m from Pounds 82.4m and said the stock remained a sell at its
current low level. Mr Simon Willis of County NatWest was slightly more
optimistic, going for Pounds 60m and arguing that the shares were a hold
around the 110p mark.
In the rest of the sector, Willis Corroon, which is heavily exposed to the
US, fell 14 to 177p; CE Heath, whose dividend is believed to be vulnerable,
lost 24 to 268p; and Steel Burrill Jones shed 16 to 179p.
Carlton firmer
Optimism for the video arm of Carlton Communications, the television
production and services group, was highlighted by one securities house and
the shares bucked the market to close 7 higher at 584p.
Hoare Govett pointed out an article in the trade press which said that the
video of the film Batman Returns, to be marketed by Carlton, will be
released early next month and thus boost this year's profits. The video of
the previous film achieved one of the most successful market results on
record.
The Batman Returns video is to go on direct sale immediately, rather than
following the traditional route of first appearing in video hire shops. This
indicates that profits for Carlton will not be diluted.
Food manufacturer Hillsdown Holdings, which dropped 13 to 105p with 4.2m
shares changing hands, proved to be one of the chief sufferers from the
nervousness in the market caused by the dividend cut by insurance broker
Sedgwick.
The fear that Hillsdown's dividend was in danger further undermined the
stock. However, most houses have been predicting a small increase, and few
seem willing to change their stance as yet. BZW said: 'There is over-anxiety
on the dividend, which was to be expected in any high-yielding stock after
the Sedgwick cut. The cover remains good and we believe the dividend will be
slightly increased.'
Hillsdown was also troubled by other concerns yesterday. A surplus of stock,
which had followed downgrades from BZW on Monday and James Capel and Smith
New Court last week, had already put marketmakers under pressure to mark
down the price. There was also a belief in some quarters that Hillsdown will
leave the FT-SE 100 Index list at the next review.
Dividend worries elsewhere in the market rebounded to the favour of the
water and electricity sectors, where the dividend growth is seen as safe
because of company commitments and high levels of cover respectively.
Of the main movers yesterday, Anglian Water rose 10 to 425p, Welsh 6 to 434p
and Yorkshire 7 to 449p. Among the Recs, Norweb gained 11 to 349p, Yorkshire
10 to 354p and Southern 8 to 315p.
News that SmithKline Beecham is to create a partnership with US group Marion

Vodafone weakened 8 to 320p as Smith New Court issued a sell note, arguing
that profits looked vulnerable to new competition.
Mining group RTZ was a penny firmer at 527p after copper prices surged on
investment fund buying and technical reasons.
A research note from County NatWest describing an eventual merger of
Whitbread and Scottish &amp; Newcastle as 'inevitable' met with some investor

Credit Lyonnais Laing told clients the shares were oversold. Smith jumped 9
to 256p and Bunzl firmed 2 to 93p.
Vague talk of financial worries at Eurotunnel was heard and the shares
slipped 12 to 349p. Financial worries also depressed Davies &amp; Newman, which
shed a further 3 to 18p.
A squeeze in Kwik-Fit, the car repair group, caused the shares to bounce 7
1/2 to 105 1/2 p.
Press comment on British Aerospace, following Monday's resignation of the
chairman of the property division, left the shares 8 lighter at 200p in
reasonable trade of 2.8m.
Motor distributor Quicks bucked the market trend, firming 2 to 121p after
the company reported a jump in interim profits from Pounds 328,000 to Pounds
1.1m and a 75 per cent increase in the dividend to 1.75p. Bargain hunting
sent Whessoe climbing 6 to 139p.
Shortage of stock in BET left the business services group 2 higher at 120p.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings eased 7 to 242p on profit-taking.
A 5 per cent improvement in interim profits to Dollars 17.2m (Pounds 9m) at

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Russia struggles to cast
off its own chains - Potential for vast change is there, but not the means
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR after the failed coup, Russia has all the preconditions for freedom,
but is not yet free. Through their actions many of its leaders have
attempted to further the cause of freedom. But they are constrained, often
very severely, by forces which the Soviet state created and sustained, and
which the new leadership appears unable to change.
This has been the legacy of last August's coup: the injection into the body
politic of the former Soviet Union of the potential for vast change  -
without the means, the experience or the institutions.
The coup destroyed the already tottering edifice of the Soviet Union and the
coercive apparatus of Soviet power. But it had little effect on the real
constraints on the construction of a democratic state: the economic
networks, the feudal-style provision of social and other services, and the
psychological reflexes which seven Soviet decades had inscribed into the 15
member states.
Thus the second 'Russian Revolution' can be called so only with
qualifications. After all, so many of its citizens  - even its political
class  - experienced it only through the media. In the industrial city of
Cherepovets 400km north of Moscow, Mr Vassiliy Kovalov, the deputy mayor,
heard the news on the radio and expected tanks, soldiers or at least party
functionaries to appear on the square in front of the city hall. But nothing
happened.
Likewise in Perm, where Mr Andrei Klimov and other city deputies passed, on
the second day of the coup, a motion defiant of the state of emergency  -
and found their activity to have been the only coup-related move the city
saw.
By contrast, a group of businessmen from the southern city of Rostov-on-Don
found themselves in the thick of it because they were attending a conference
in Moscow on new economic structures, and were staying at the mammoth
Rossiya Hotel just off Red Square.
Yet, even at the epicentre, there was confusion. Says Mr Vadim Polovnikov,
head of the Don Union of Businessmen: 'We went up to Red Square and asked
one of the soldiers in the tanks what was happening. He said, 'You tell me,
brother'.'
The coup, whose competing symbolic centres were the Russian White House and
the Soviet Kremlin, tilted the uneasy balance between these two sharply
towards the former. The Kremlin then again became what it had been before
the 1917 revolution  - the citadel of Russian power.
The coup destroyed a Soviet president  - Mr Mikhail Gorbachev  - who
dithered about the consequences of the reform process he had begun. It
elevated to the position of first post-Soviet leader Mr Boris Yeltsin, who
committed himself and his country to democratic and market change.
The consequences are everywhere to be seen. In Cherepovets, Mr Kovalov
backed the idea of hiring a western consultancy to advise on diversifying
the town's economy, heavily skewed towards iron and steel and chemicals. It
was the first such initiative in Russia.
In Perm, Mr Klimov was the moving spirit behind the founding in January of
the Perm Business Club, which took into its membership the new men of the
banks and the exchanges, as well as the older heads of the big engineering
and defence enterprises on which the economy of the town still depends.
In Rostov, Mr Polovnikov took the chemical company he heads into 'private'
ownership by creating a joint stock company whose shares were owned by the
workforce. All felt themselves to be working in a new environment, taking
risks, sailing into new oceans without charts.
Throughout the central part of European Russia, the same processes are
taking place. Foreign companies making deals for the export of metals are
doing a roaring trade in Ekaterinburg, formerly Sverdlovsk, Mr Yeltsin's
fief.
In St Petersburg, joint ventures for the production of food and cigarettes
are being concluded, a model private farm has been set up and a western
store is about to open on the Nevsky Prospekt.
In Moscow, private trading filled the city centre's pavements until it was
chased into the side streets. The Ismailovo market for carpets, paintings,
antiques and junk doubled, tripled, then quintupled in size. Western shops
and restaurants open up at an accelerating rate.
The market habit is spreading. But it is doing so within an overall
framework of collapse, of colossal debt, and of increasingly ferocious
in-fighting within the very circles which were victorious after the coup. In
a year, the defenders of the White House have discovered that the prestige
which accompanied them as they took office was ephemeral.
For much of the past year, Mr Yeltsin the popularly elected President of
Russia, retained a political dominance and a personal popularity. He now
barely has the latter. Indeed, the latest opinion poll, commissioned by the
Russian parliament, shows him outstripped for the first time by his vice
president, General Alexander Rutskoi.
To build on the breakthrough to democracy which the coup seemed to presage
he will need to find support quickly, not just personally and in his
presidential power, but in institutions independent of him. That means an
elected parliament with which he can work; an independent judiciary to which
his decisions can be submitted with a reasonable hope of being independently
judged; and a constitution which both defines and constrains his powers.
These are at best in embryo.
The possibilities of August 1991 are now changing into the harder facts of
August 1992. Russia is in rapid economic decline: there is no easy way out,
no way of making the mass of people other than poorer, nor  - short of a
reversion to a command economy  - any way of stopping the rich becoming
conspicuously richer.
Russia remains a nuclear state and a vast landmass. It can no longer pretend
to be a genial giant which is everyone's friend, but must define its
interests and alliances, especially with the other former Soviet states.
Russia has almost no institutional structures for the pluralist market
economy it says it wants to be, and is little nearer acquiring any.
In Pravda, the former communist party newspaper, the voice of Mr Valentin
Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister during the coup and a flaccid
co-conspirator in it, was recently heard from behind the walls of the
Matrosskaya Tishina jail where he has languished for nearly a year. Heavily
underscoring the worsening economic indicators since he was removed from the
scene, Mr Pavlov said: 'The issue is one of the survival of Russia'.
He is right there. The coup has ensured that 'Russia' rather than the Soviet
Union is the central issue. But the survival of the transformation which the
coup appeared to presage is still in doubt.

door
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IN NEARLY every city of the former Soviet Union, cells of capitalism are
forming. These are the germs of a new order: the more they spread, the less
easy it will be to reverse. The coup was an important contributory factor.
There are western oilmen in Sakhalin in the Far East, Murmansk in the Far
North and Baku in the Caucasian south. There are private coal mines in the
fields of the Donbass in Ukraine, the Kuzbass in Russia and Karaganda in
Kazakhstan.
There are joint venture advertising agencies in St Petersburg; Turkish
traders in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi; and in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan, though electricity and water supply is only intermittent, a host of
commercial shops have sprung up to replace the state stores.
In Alma Ata, Kazakhstan, big foreign consultancies are establishing offices.
In Tallinn, Estonia, private restaurants cluster round the beautiful square
of the old town, and the music festivals are sponsored by German breweries.
Everywhere, people turn out with a table, or a piece of newspaper on the
ground, and sell what they can: vegetables, a can of petrol, champagne.
A new stratum is being created, composed of people who have little or more
often no other source of income than what they are able to trade, sell, make
or exchange. In a state where most such activity was illegal a few years
ago, the activity is remarkable.
The coup gave it a boost in Russia, and then in other republics. When the
constraining hand of the centralised Soviet state was removed, Russia went
for immediate and radical economic reform: trade was wholly legalised,
company formation by foreigners and Russians was simplified, and
privatisation plans were drawn up and introduced. Entrepreneurship is now
officially sanctioned, even if it is not generally liked, or encouraged.
Free enterprise has arrived chaotically, and through often crooked channels.
Monopolisation of capital by the state and the party until the last part of
the 1980s means those now wanting to open banks, exchanges or companies are
forced towards criminality. Workers and managers have turned over to
themselves most of the companies now in private hands; the state has been
too weak to intervene. Much of the oil and metals being exported from Russia
belongs to the state but enriches those who can control it. Many goods sold
by the roadside have been diverted from state networks.
Private business began, in 1987, with co-operatives and joint ventures
between foreign and soviet companies. By 1990, private banks and commodity
exchanges began to be established. Now, Russian businessmen are starting to
see themselves as capable of matching foreign business.
The movement towards the market, for all its vulnerability, has gone beyond
the fringe. In another year, short of terror, it will be irreversible.

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Coup's leaders exploit
conservative backlash from behind prison bars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENGEFUL rattling from Moscow prison cells is growing louder as the coup
leaders, awaiting trial for their part in the failed putsch, rejoice over
the troubles of President Boris Yeltsin and the newly-independent republics.
'As the economic situation in the country worsens, many people have problems
remembering why the inmates at Sailors Rest (jail) are being given a hard
time,' says Mr Andrei Makarov, a progressive lawyer defending Mr Yeltsin's
ban on the Communist party in a parallel trial. 'Very few people remember
the coup, the tanks, and the horror of those August nights.'
Even Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, who played a prominent role in the
'resistance' to the coup but is now successfully exploiting a conservative
backlash, has suggested letting them off.
Mr Nikolai Pechenkin, an affable 44-year-old lawyer for Marshal Dmitry
Yazov, the former defence minister, warns: 'This trial will split the
country in two camps and it is not clear which camp will be bigger. Remember
Chile. The media are now presenting Pinochet as a saviour. What is happening
in this country now is collapse, ruin and chaos.'
But with characteristic elements of a tragi-comedy, the trial is unlikely to
happen before next year, if at all.
After several false starts  - including the embarrassing leak of
interrogation videos and the sacking last week of the deputy prosecutor in
charge of the case  - the prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, has so
far been unable to bring the matter to court. Only on Friday, he ordered the
investigation to be restarted because he is unlikely to make the present
charge of treason stick to the 15 defendants, since they will argue that
they were, on the contrary, trying to save their country from collapse.
One year after the coup leaders were ridiculed and villified for their
vodka-fuelled attempt to prevent the signing of a union treaty which would
have reshaped the Soviet Union, they are flourishing in political terms.
Although most claim to be too unwell to stay in jail, most have found enough
energy to defend their records and voice vitriolic criticism of the
government in newspaper articles. Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the parliamentary
speaker who issued a sinister policy statement defending the coup, had no
qualms in accusing the government last week of trying to ram capitalism down
people's throats.
Mr Valentin Pavlov, the former prime minister who used to compare running
the Soviet economy to managing a western corporation, has been offered a job
at the country's biggest commodity exchange if he comes out of jail. He is
now blasting government policies in Pravda (the former Communist mouthpiece
which has survived thanks to government subsidies) with defences of his
disastrous economic policies which debauched the currency and robbed people
of their savings.
The role of President Mikhail Gorbachev, who was isolated at his holiday
dacha in the Crimea from August 18-21, has also been subjected to closer
scrutiny.
Some defendants have said they believed he might support the coup, but there
is no question of his facing trial. It seems most likely that his constant
compromising made the coup possible but that he was genuinely taken aback by
his ministers' action against him.
'I don't think the coup took place with his agreement,' says Mr Makarov.
'But I am deeply convinced that Gorbachev is guilty of having removed the
real democratic forces around him and of promoting the reactionary forces
which finally toppled him, of not pursuing reforms which he could have
pursued, and of not speaking up clearly when he should have done so. . . .
This all helped pave the way for the putsch.'
Despite the incompetence of the prosecution and accusations that this is
going to be a political trial whose outcome has been decided in advance, it
is a triumph for Russia's fledgling democracy that any of this is happening
at all. Unfortunately, as often is the case in Russia, it is all happening
far too late.

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Industry wants course
change - Business interests are pulling Yeltsin in opposite directions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO years ago, Russian plant managers bullied President Mikhail Gorbachev
into a conservative U-turn which paved the way for the abortive coup. Today,
industrialists are once more in the limelight as they openly call on
President Boris Yeltsin's radical government to change course or resign.
The most active of these industrial politicians is Mr Arkady Volsky, head of
the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who claims he has no
designs on high office but seems to be doing all he can to achieve gain it.
'He has even picked a cabinet, although they are having trouble finding
young people to join it,' says one usually well-informed sympathiser.
Mr Konstantin Zatulin, director of a rival business association, says: 'Now
he (Volsky) has to make President Yeltsin fall in love with him.'
Although it is not clear how far they support him personally, the directors
he credits with 'keeping angry workers off the street' have had very real
grievances against the government. First there was the banknote shortage
which meant workers were not paid; that is now being sorted out. Then there
was the uncertainty of legislation, which for instance has meant constant
changes in foreign trade rules.
Now there is a trio of industrialists in the cabinet, the main problem is
how far it will give in to enterprises' demands for new credit as it tries
to sort out a crisis over more than Rbs2 trillion in arrears.
On Thursday, a group of 1,640 manufacturers attended a conference organised
by Mr Yuri Gekht, leader of the parliamentary Industrial Union who made them
vote for reversal of the government's financial austerity and radical
privatisation plans.
'We have been bankrupted by its policies,' warned Mr Shamil Menzeleyev,
manager of the 2nd Moscow Watch Factory. 'If the government does not heed
what we have said here today, we will bankrupt it politically.'
Many object to the privatisation programme  - mainly because it reserves
only a minority of shares for management and workforce. There is growing
alarm at the possibility of foreigners buying up their shares or taking over
their markets. Many are angry about the government's chaotic approach to the
conversion of military factories to civilian output. Many managers are also
disappointed by the fact that foreign investors (often seen as auxiliaries
of their government) have not rushed in to do business with them.
But some will also admit that the reforms they hate have not been totally in
vain. Says the head of a fishing conglomerate on Sakhalin island: 'We're
starting to tell our customers to pay for goods and it is working. Things
will get better but it will take time.'

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: History bears down on
states of the Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, CHRYSTIA FREELAND and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DESTRUCTION of a tottering Union was the most important geopolitical
effect of the August coup: it now becomes clear how ambiguous the legacy is.
For in destroying the shreds of all-Union clothing it stimulated the naked
power struggle between and among them, which the creation of the
Commonwealth of Independent States last December has only moderated. It put
Russia in centre stage, and returned its neighbours to their centuries-old
dilemma: how to live with the Bear as a neighbour?
For the Baltic states, the answer was always clear: assert independence. Yet
independence, supported by Russia, is harder to realise than to assert.
Relations between Russia and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are much worse
now than they were a year ago. The Baltic states demand the rapid pullout of
the 130,000 strong forces based on their territories; the Russians promise
to do so, but demand time to construct flats for displaced officers. Neither
side trusts the other.
The sufferers are the Baltic Russians, especially in Estonia and Latvia,
where the largest populations are. The new constitutions deprive them of
citizenship if they are recent immmigrants, and impose the necessity to
learn the native language if they are to keep their jobs.
Russian schools and cultural centres have been closed. Resentment and
dislike of Russians now has a political expression, and is played upon by
politicians. In Moscow, meanwhile, the parliament fumes that the foreign
ministry does not protect the rights of a russophone population under
pressure.
Russians spread throughout the former Union, and the former empire. Their
strongholds include Crimea (Ukrainian since 1954), TransDnestr (Moldovan
since after the last war) and Northern Kazakhstan (with a large Russian
population before the creation of the Soviet state in 1920).
Only in the second of these has there been armed conflict, now under a very
fragile ceasefire. But Crimea remains a presently muted quarrel between
Russia and Ukraine, likely to flare up once more.
Most of the other states have developed a position of modified dependence.
Belarus last month signed an agreement with Russia hailed by both sides as a
return to traditional ties of friendship; it includes a military pact which
envisages joint manoeuvres and a measure of joint (that is, Russian)
control.
The four economically dependent Central Asian states and Kazakhstan have
also all signed friendship or co-operation treaties of varying degrees of
closeness  - their economies, leaning shakily against the Russian one, need
at least a common currency and whatever subsidised energy and other products
Russia still provides.
The three Caucasian states seem set to return to their old ways, with the
two Christian nations, Armenia and Georgia, seeking Russian protection
against the 'Turks' (the Moslems) in the third, Azerbaijan. Armenia last
week invoked a collective security pact to beseech CIS (that is, Russian)
military aid against an advance by Azerbaijan into Armenian territory.
Russia did not and will not soon oblige, but it is clear that its continued
influence in the Caucasus depends on taking sides.
Ukraine remains the central enigma. It was always seen by Russian and Soviet
leaders as the indispensable possession for the achievement of superpower
status. Relations have recently improved: Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk
have masked their previous distaste, and at their meeting in Yalta earlier
this month called each other 'Boris' and 'Leonid'.
But a Ukrainian cabinet minister privately described that meeting as merely
an effort to calm western worries. And the deal reached at Yalta, for
three-year joint control of the Black Sea Fleet, is fraught with the
possibility of misunderstanding.
When Ukraine's economy worsens sharply, as it is expected to do in the
autumn, Russia is likely to move again to the central role of national
bogey.
The coup's failure saw Soviet power collapse utterly; Russian power has not
expanded to fill the space vacated. Its oil-producing autonomous republics
of Tatarstan and Chechenia have both declared a formal independence which
they have yet to negotiate in practice.
Other republics or regions in Russia, like Yakutia (with diamonds), Komi
(gas) and Tyumen (oil) are also claiming authority at least over their
exportable resources.
This is less an ethnic matter than an effort by the elites who were thrown
up by the putsch (or who survived it) to extend their control over a
population and resources over which they had hitherto only a titular
authority.
After a year  - and more  - of looking outward, in particular westwards, the
aniversary sees all of the former Soviet states looking inward, increasingly
aware that the imperatives of geography and of history are less amenable to
transformation than they had bravely proclaimed in the aftermath of August
1991.

THE NEW POLITICAL LINE-UP:
The coup destroyed the Communist Party. But it has not stimulated the growth
of other strong, independent parties. The parties in Russia are weak,
usually dependent on one or a handful of political personalities.
The most powerful political force at present is the Civic Union, composed of
three parties built round prominent individuals; Free Russia (formerly
Communists for Democracy), created by Vice President Alexander Rutskoi;
Obnovlenie ("Renewal") headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, chairman of the Russian
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; and the Democratic Party, headed
by Mr Nikolai Travkin, who claims the largest membership, of about 50,000.
Their motto: reforms, with a strong central power.
In the Russian parliament, factions dominate. They range from the Democratic
Russia faction (liberal democratic) through the Industrial and Agricultural
Union (corporatists) to the Rossiya (nationalist). During the Congress of
People's Deputies in April, pro- and anti- government sides were reasonably
well-balanced. Now, a majority is anti-government.
The political parties cover the same spectrum. Democratic Russia, which was
an umbrella for a number of groups and parties, is hopelessly split: its
radical liberal wing opposes the government from the so-called 'left', while
constituent members like the Constitutional Democrats and Christian
Democrats have left to join the nationalists. On the old left are a clutch
of neo-communist parties - including the Bolshevik Party, headed by Mrs Nina
Andreeva, and the Socialist Labour Party, headed by Mr Roy Medvedev.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bundesbank defends rate increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank has delivered a ringing justification of last month's
decision to raise the discount rate by 0.75 points to 8.75 per cent, and
emphasised that the German inflation outlook is still far from bright.
In its monthly report issued today the Bundesbank makes a sternly orthodox
defence of its monetary policies. It appears to be partly aimed at lowering
expectations of an early easing of credit policies following last month's
fall in the 'headline' inflation rate.
Insisting that the underlying level of German inflation  - at around 4 per
cent  - is still too high, the Bundesbank said that tolerance of inflation
at current levels would damage German economic prospects. This applied
especially in eastern Germany, where higher inflation would damage the
outlook for investment and jobs.
The Bundesbank's unbending stance on inflation supports the view that the
central bank will remain reluctant to carry out large-scale intervention to
support the dollar at its current low levels.
Analysts have suggested that the Bundesbank's half-hearted participation in
dollar support operations reflects its conviction that a strong D-Mark helps
bring down inflation.
On last month's 0.75 points interest rate rise, the bank said: 'Had we
delayed, there would have been negative consequences.' This would have
involved the risk of 'losing the credibility' of its policy of monetary
stability.
Despite signs of a German economic downturn, the Bundesbank argued that it
was not taking any 'indefensible risks' with the German economy.
As for European partners which have complained about the Bundesbank's
policies, the bank said further currency integration would be helped by a
convergence of inflation at the lowest possible level.
It said there was no justification for growth in money supply substantially
above the 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range, even though a number of special
factors help to explain this year's overshooting.
'There is no question that (the outlook for) money supply growth is too
strong in the medium-term', the Bundesbank said. In May and June money
supply growth ran at 8.8 and 8.7 per cent respectively and analysts are
expecting the figure for July, to be published in the next week, to be
around 8.4 per cent.
The outlook for inflation is still a cause for concern, especially because
of this year's wage rises and introduction of higher value added tax next
January, the Bundesbank said.

Dow recovery

Wall Street
HOPES OF another cut in interest rates enabled US stock markets to recover
from early losses caused by the steep fall in Tokyo equities and an
unexpectedly weak July housing report, but price gains were limited to a
minimum, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 4.59 at 3,329.48. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained a slight 0.60 on balance at 421.34, but the
Nasdaq composite ended 1.60 off at 570.87. Turnover on the New York SE
remained thin, but at 171.7m shares exceeded Monday's 153m.
July housing starts fell by 2.8 per cent, contrasting with analysts'
expectations of a modest increase. The figures confirmed that the housing
market remained weak in spite of the lowest interest rates in almost 30
years.
The market began to recover just before midday as speculation mounted that
the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee, which was meeting
in Washington DC, might respond to continued economic weakness by
sanctioning another reduction in interest rates.
Sentiment was also helped by the generally positive reviews given to the
opening night of the Republican convention in Houston  - a good convention
is required if President George Bush is to have any chance of making up
ground in the polls on his Democratic rival, Governor Bill Clinton.
Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 after the big computer
group reported fiscal third-quarter profits of 74 cents a share, virtually
unchanged from a year ago and at the low end of expectations.
Kroger dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 11 1/2 on 3.3m shares traded after the
supermarket and stores group warned that third-quarter earnings per share,
excluding charges, will only just break even. At the same stage a year ago
Kroger made a pre-charge profit of 18 cents a share.
On the American SE, American Exploration rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 3 in
active trading after a joint venture in which the company holds a 40 per
cent stake discovered oil at its first exploration well in Tunisia.
On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 3/8
on second-quarter net income of 57 cents a share, up sharply from the 34
cents registered a year earlier.
Durr-Fillauer put on Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 after Bergen Brunswig
settled litigation with Durr and raised its bid for the company from Dollars
26 a share to Dollars 33.
Canada
TORONTO stocks settled back to a mixed finish as market participants mainly
held the sidelines ahead of further political developments. Both the
Republican convention in the US and talks on the constitution in Canada are
being watched closely.
The TSE 300 index ended just 1.96 off at 3,377.82 after modest volume of
21.2m shares. Rises and falls were almost even at 265 to 264.
Air Canada advanced 25 cents to CDollars 4.55. After the close it surprised
the market by announcing an alliance with UAL's United Airlines. PWA let
pass a deadline for a merger offer with Air Canada last weekend, but it was
unclear whether the two were still negotiating. PWA ended 3 cents easier at
CDollars 2.87.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Futures dip sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures dipped sharply in afternoon trading as the pound tested new
lows against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. By the late evening,
dealers were again becoming bearish about the currency's predicament,
wondering whether it will force a rise in UK base rates in the immediate
future.
The September short sterling contract was traded 3 basis points down from
its previous close, at 89.66, in the morning. But sterling dropped
momentarily below DM2.8100 in the afternoon and the contract declined
another 3 basis points in heavy trading to close at 89.63. The December
contract ended 8 basis points off from its previous close at 89.70.
Trade in Euro-Deutschmark futures was also volatile, due to fears of a
possible rise in the Bundesbank's Lombard rate. Once again, dealers fear
that the German central bank's council, which meets tomorrow, could spring a
surprise and lift the emergency rate, especially if call money rises above
the Lombard rate level. There is anxiety about the July figure for M3 money
supply in Germany, due out tomorrow, which is certain to show the rate of
money growth falling outside the Bundesbank's target zone.
The September contract in Euro-Deutschmark futures fell 5 basis points on
these fears, bottoming out at 90.13 and closing at 90.14. The December
contract finished the day down 6 basis points at 90.27.
The UK's higher than expected public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds
0.6bn had little effect on the market, as the poor state of the government's
finances has already been discounted. Instead, trade in the sterling cash
market was thin.
The Bank of England forecast a small shortage of only Pounds 350m, and
dealers said they were content to go on dealing in small sums in the short
dates. One-month money closed  1/32 softer on the offered side at 9 31/32
per cent and three-month money was also easier, at 10 7/32 per cent offered
from a previous finish of 10 1/4 per cent.
The Bank of England did not intervene in the discount market in the morning.
In the afternoon, the shortage was revised to Pounds 400m and the Bank
bought Pounds 35m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late
assistance of Pounds 220m.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Concern on Bundesbank policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the dollar and sterling drifted lower against the D-Mark yesterday,
amid fears that the Bundesbank will keep a tight grip on conditions in the
German money market, writes James Blitz.
German inflation is falling but the Bundesbank's tone on money supply still
seems hawkish. The particular fear driving the dollar/D-Mark rate down
yesterday was that the German central bank will not add liquidity to the
money market in its weekly intervention today, allowing cash rates to rise.
German call money was being traded yesterday just below the Lombard rate
level of 9.75 per cent. If the German central bank fails to add reserves,
call money will rise and the Bundesbank will be forced to raise the Lombard
rate. This is because the Bank would want to stop the phenomenon of 'round
tripping', in which a commercial bank borrows money through the Bundesbank's
emergency window and sells it at the higher call money rate in the open
market.
If the Lombard rate rises, the differential between short-term interest
rates in Germany and the US will widen and the dollar will fall. But the
Bundesbank's hands may be tied, because of difficulties bringing M3 money
supply growth into its target range. The suspicion is that the central bank
wants to 'sterilise' its recent interventions on behalf of the dollar on the
foreign exchanges by withholding reserves. Dealers say that every DM3bn of
intervention has added 1 per cent to M3 growth.
The dollar's only support is the threat of central bank intervention.
According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
in London, the US Federal Reserve's next intervention will have to be on the
scale of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn if it is to turn the market, and would
be one of the largest central bank interventions of recent years.
In Europe, the dollar fell to DM1.4555 before closing at DM1.4580, compared
with Monday's DM1.4630 finish. Sterling briefly dipped below DM2.8100 in
intra-day trading and ended at DM2.8125, also down  1/2 pfennig on the day
and at its lowest close against the D-Mark since the UK joined the European
exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. At the end of New York trading the
US currency stood at DM1.4575.
The yen lost ground against the German unit following the latest fall on the
Japanese stock market and fears that the official discount rate will be cut
again. It closed at Y86.59 to the D-Mark from Y85.98. Falling long bond
yields may push the yen further downwards if European bond markets stabilise
after France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Japanese bonds currently
yield only 4.7 per cent compared to better returns in Europe.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Bonds: South-east Asia leads demand for German
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LACK of supply during the latest rally in the US Treasury market has led to
a dearth of fixed rate Euro-dollar bonds trading around par.
Yesterday's Dollars 500m issue of fixed-rate Eurobonds for Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau provided investors with a welcome opportunity to stock up on
paper which pays a coupon reflecting current interest rate levels.
Demand was particularly strong among investors in south-east Asia, including
a number of central banks, many of which view the KFW issue as quasi-German
government, although it is not explicitly guaranteed by the government.
The issue of 5 3/4 per cent bonds, arranged by Deutsche Bank, was considered
fairly priced to yield 24 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury.
The spread widened by one basis point yesterday, due to the rally in the
underlying US Treasury market.
A recent Dollars 500m five-year Eurobond offering for the Inter-American
Development Bank was trading at a spread of 21 basis points yesterday,
having previously widened to 25 basis points from an aggressive launch
spread of 18 basis points two weeks ago.
Interest in dollar bonds has been stimulated by increasingly positive
sentiment on the dollar, which most investors view as cheap at current
levels. Investors in the Far East in particular see shorter-dated Eurobonds
as a suitable instrument for taking a view on the currency.
European investors, however, are also focusing on yield levels, and are
consequently tending to buy longer-dated paper at substantially higher
yields due to the very positive US yield curve. In addition, many European
investors feel that if short-term US interest rates start to bottom out, the
long end of the market will not suffer, because of the steepness of the the
curve.
Redemption levels in US dollar bonds are heavy over the next few months  -
Dollars 6.6bn in August, Dollars 7.9bn in September and Dollars 6.8bn in
October. While the level of reinvestment in dollar securities is likely to
be high, the pattern of reinvestment is unpredictable as the majority of the
paper consists of maturing ex-warrant bonds, largely held by Japanese banks.
Barclays Bank has set up an Ecu2bn Euro medium-term note programme, arranged
by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Under the programme, deposit and medium-term
notes with maturities ranging from 30 days to 30-years can be issued.
The multi-currency programme includes a D-Mark option, taking advantage of
the recent lifting of Bundesbank restrictions.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Tokyo hits record high on hopes of rate
cut

JAPANESE government bonds climbed to new highs as yesterday's tumble in the
Tokyo stock market raised hopes of further cut in interest rates.
The Nikkei average index dropped another 620.14 points to close at
14,309.41, its lowest close since March 1986. Dealers said the bond market
rallied steadily in response to the stock market's free-fall.
'People are pouring money into the (Japanese) government bond market as they
expect to see an easing in interest rates,' said one dealer. Short-term
interest rates edged lower, with the rate on three-month certificates of
deposit slipping from 3.90 per cent to 3.88 per cent yesterday.
The price of the December futures contract for 10-year government bonds
traded as high as 106.10, the highest level for the since August 1989.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 4.80 per
cent to 4.71 per cent before closing at 4.725 per cent in Tokyo. The No 129
continued to rally in London trading, taking its cue from the strong opening
in the US treasury bond market.
Dealers said yesterday's announcement by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance
minister, of a package of emergency measures yesterday to restore confidence
in the stock market had little impact on the bond market.
AN unexpected decline in July housing starts lifted US Treasury prices
across the maturity range yesterday, temporarily eclipsing the market's
concerns about politically-motivated tax cuts.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 98,
yielding 7.328 per cent. The two-year note was markedly firmer, up 1/8 at
100 7/16 , to yield 3.996 per cent.
Prices gained ground after the Commerce department reported that housing
starts fell 2.8 per cent last month, and that June's housing starts fell a
revised 3.8 per cent (they were originally reported to have declined by 3.2
per cent). Analysts had predicted a modest upturn in housing starts for
July, so the figures immediately triggered a spate of buying, especially at
the short end of the yield curve.
Short-dated securities were also buoyed by speculation about another policy
ease. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee began its
monthly meeting yesterday, and investors were hoping that continued economic
weakness would persuade the FOMC to sanction another interest rate cut.
AUSTRALIAN government bonds staged a strong rally following the government's
annual budget announcement and promises of further cuts in interest rates.
The government forecast a budget deficit for the 1992/93 fiscal year of
ADollars 13.39bn, towards the low end of expectations. The statement added
that 'further reductions in interest rates will be possible if the decline
in inflation and expectations of inflation is sustained,' prompting a surge
in the bond market, with shorter-dated issues showing the biggest gains.
Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, forecast that inflation would average 2 per
cent in the year ending June 30 1993, from 1.9 per cent last year. The
government expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year.
The three-year bond futures contract, which had traded at around 93.08
before the announcement, climbed to 93.24. In the cash market, the yield on
the 10 per cent bond due October 2002 moved to 8.28 per cent after the
budget, from 8.37 per cent before the announcement.
GERMAN government bonds ended slightly weaker with the market awaiting
today's Bundesbank tender allocation and the release of the July money
supply figures.
The Liffe bund futures contract traded in a fairly narrow range of
87.64-87.78, ending the day at around 87.68.
Dealers warned the market would be watching the Bundesbank's tender
allocation for signs of any move in interest rates.
STERLING'S weakness in the foreign exchange markets depressed the UK
government bond market yesterday with gilts ending the day slightly lower.
The Liffe futures contract slipped from 97.20 at the opening to 97.17 while
the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 drifted from 115 23/32 to 115 21/32 .
The Bank of England announced details of its next auction which met market
expectations  - the Bank will auction Pounds 2.5bn of the 8 3/4 per cent
gilt due 2017 on August 26.

AIR CANADA, frustrated in its second attempt to take over its rival Canadian
Airlines International, has turned to United Airlines of the US for a
commercial alliance.
The operational link-up, which becomes effective on October 25, will improve
service and cut connection time at the airlines' hubs in North America,
Europe, Latin America and the Pacific.
An equity link is not planned.
The two airlines will merge their frequent-flyer programmes and co-operate
in computer reservation systems and marketing.
United, four times the size of Air Canada, said further benefits would come
to both airlines from the 'open skies' agreement being negotiated by Canada
and the US. This will allow limited entry of US airlines to the Canadian
domestic market and greater access for Canadian carriers to the huge US
market.
Air Canada had a first-half loss of CDollars 293m (USDollars 246.2m), or
Dollars 3.96 a share, including restructuring charges. Second-quarter
traffic rose 14 per cent, but with larger capacity its yields fell.
Canadian is now considering an offer from its employees to put up CDollars
200m in new equity.

profit of NZDollars 481.9m last year.
The result was broadly in line with the forecast in May when the company,
New Zealand's biggest, reported it was adopting new international accounting
policies and that its operating earnings were under pressure because of
problems with its interests in pulp, paper and building subsidiaries.
The loss came after abnormal losses of NZDollars 462.6m (NZDollars 472.8m
before tax and minority interests). The abnormals included the provision of
NZDollars 400m for potential property write-downs relating mainly to its
Australian subsidiary Jennings.
Audited group earnings, excluding abnormals, were somewhat better than
expected at NZDollars 305.1m.
The dividend for the year is 14 cents a share, compared with 27 cents last
year. Return on shareholders' funds was minus 3.2 per cent (11.1 per cent)
and earnings per share was minus 16.6 cents (41 cents).

financing

<TEXT>
AMERICA West, the bankrupt US carrier, is asking the bankruptcy court to
approve a new tranche of financing, which could bring the Phoenix-based
airline up to Dollars 60m of funds.
The money is being put up by a consortium of Arizona investors, assembled by
a Phoenix businessman  - Mr William Franke  - at the request of Arizona's
governor, and by GPA International, the Irish aircraft leasing company. GPA
has been keenly involved in the America West bankruptcy, as the lessor of 16
of its aircraft.
America West said GPA had committed to provide Dollars 35m of new financing.
A US bankruptcy court judge granted Continental Airlines a 45-day extension
during which the carrier has the exclusive right to file a reorganisation
plan, Reuter reports. It was the sixth extension in over two years.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SHARES in Hewlett-Packard took a beating for the second time this month
after the computer and electronic equipment manufacturer turned in
third-quarter earnings that were at the bottom of its projections.
Shares in the company tumbled Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 in active
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock lost more than Dollars 12
earlier in the month when Hewlett warned its third-quarter results would be
between 76 cent to 87 cents a share, well below Wall Street's expectations
of Dollars 1.12 a share.
In the end, net income for the three months to July 31 was Dollars 191m, or
76 cents a share, compared with Dollars 192m, or 76 cents a year earlier.
Revenues rose to Dollars 4bn from Dollars 3.5bn in the quarter.
The company blamed the higher costs of sales for its disappointing earnings.
Although sales remained strong in the quarter, gross margins were squeezed.
by lower prices and a shift towards products with lower gross margins.
Mr John Young, chief executive, said: 'The short term looks very
challenging.
Worldwide economic conditions are a concern, with weak levels of capital
spending still affecting many parts of our business.'
Nevertheless, Mr Young said the company was in an excellent competitive
position. He added that they were making structural adjustments to parts of
the business and there were new products on the way that should strengthen
their portfolio.
For the first nine months, net earnings rose 31 per cent to Dollars 823m, or
Dollars 3.25, from Dollars 630m, or Dollars 2.52 a year ago.
Revenues increased 13 per cent to Dollars 12.1bn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one way, Wang's fall into chapter 11 bankruptcy is testament to the
savage competition facing computer manufacturers. In another it highlights
the weakness of the 1980s argument that high debt is a useful spur to
management.
Wang made a strategic error when it fell behind in technological development
and was slow to move into 'open' interchangeable systems like those of the
IBM personal computer. But with the recession upon it, Wang was trapped
between high debts and resulting poor cash flow on the one hand and the need
to invest in new products on the other. The cause of failure was the
inflexibility of debt, as much as management error.

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's finance minister may insist that his rapidly-unveiled package of
economic measures was not a response to the further fall in Japanese
equities, but the markets believe otherwise. Tuesday's fall was precipitated
by the current twin obsessions of Japanese investors: falling earnings and
the parlous state of the financial system.
Mr Hata's remarks only underline the seriousness of the banks' position.
With the Nikkei average at these depressed levels, there is a real threat
that Japanese banks will be unable to meet new capital adequacy requirements
next March.
The government's position deserves some sympathy. A large package of fiscal
measures including substantial public works is being prepared for the end of
the month. In advance of this stimulatory boost the finance minister is
trying to prevent banks bolstering their balance sheets by selling
profitable stock holdings. However, Mr Hata's specific suggestions are not
reassuring.
By allowing banks to value securities at cost, rather than market value, the
government is merely disguising the hole blown in bank balance sheets.
Making it easier for banks to sell loans to insurance companies may also
transfer some of the credit squeeze on to companies without the banks'
capital constraints. However, that raises the question of which loans to
sell. Disposing of good loans will degrade the banks portfolio, poor loans
may only be sold at a discount, which means write-offs of the banks' core
capital unless hidden by off-balance sheet shenanegans.
One thing in favour of the package is that it may temporarily ease the risk
of a credit crunch. But that is little enough to set against an equity
market locked into a bearish psychology.

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Mannesmann
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 11 per cent slide in Mannesmann's share price suggests the
market was caught offguard by an 89 per cent fall in first-half net profits.
In fact, the decline in earnings is less dramatic if the investment in
mobile telephones is stripped out. The comparable period was also flattered
by an exceptional disposal gain, although the company has never revealed the
exact amount. But even German disclosure practice cannot disguise a poor
performance by the core engineering business. The company's gloomy statement
on the trading outlook underlines that the market is right to err on the
side of caution.
With 60 per cent of sales coming from export markets, Mannesmann is a fair
barometer of cyclical trends both in Germany and across the European capital
goods sector. In common with its peers, yesterday's results show some
benefits from restructuring and cost-cutting. The automotive division has
moved back into profit, despite intense pricing pressure from manufacturers.
The Brazilian operations have also been turned around. Yet these one-off
gains only highlight some serious cyclical weakness in tubes, plant
engineering and machinery  - which together account for more than half of
sales. Without contributions from acquisitions, plant and machinery orders
are running at a lower level than last year.
Mannesmann's diversity may leave it better placed than the competition to
ride out recession. With around DM3bn in the bank it appears to have pockets
deep enough to maintain the dividend  - albeit at a cost of DM290m this year
 - until the upturn. The prospect of profits from telecoms also argues for a
higher multiple than for pure engineering stocks, although the message
yesterday was that this argument can only be stretched so far.

FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Brokers at risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market yesterday was prepared neither for the size of Sedgwick's
dividend cut nor for such stark evidence of the damage which economic
stagnation on both sides of the Atlantic is doing to international insurance
brokers. Investors perhaps have been confused by recent signals from UK
insurers that London market rates are hardening, a development which
Sedgwick does not deny. What yesterday's 55 per cent fall in its
second-quarter profits underlines, though, is that premiums in the important
US retail market are tumbling and that rate rises where they do occur
elsewhere do not necessarily flow through into increased brokerage income.
Apart from a tendency by companies to self-insure in difficult times, the
fact is that commercial risks have been shrinking as the value of assets and
the size of payrolls and turnover have declined. The issue remains, though,
how far the general savaging of broking shares yesterday was justified.
Given its similarly large US exposure there may be further nervousness ahead
of tomorrow's results from Willis Corroon, whose price yesterday fell a mere
7 per cent against 24 per cent for Sedgwick.
The former's dividend may not be in such immediate jeopardy, but the squeeze
on dollar earners is painfully evident from Sedgwick's figures. Thanks to
accelerating the closure of hedging positions, it has managed to limit the
first-half fall in interest and investment income to 10 per cent; with 60
per cent of its cash in dollars the decline is likely to be more than 20 per
cent in the second half. Without a strengthening of the dollar the
translation rate of US profits will also deteriorate. A halved dividend for
the year now seems inescapable, if sustainable. Given the wafer-thin cover
of recent years, the question is whether some form of cut was not always
inevitable.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Abu Dhabi to hold BCCI trial: Preliminary fraud charges laid
against former bank executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABU DHABI has laid preliminary fraud charges against 14 former executives of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and intends to hold a formal
trial in the emirate.
In the first press interview given by the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in
BCCI since the bank was closed in July 1991, Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, one of the
officials investigating the affair, said yesterday that Abu Dhabi intended
to give all the former BCCI officers it had detained a fair trial.
Formal charges have yet to be laid against the former executives and
discussions are still being held about three others detained in the emirate.
Mr al-Sayegh said Abu Dhabi would seek to pursue individuals whom it
believed had defrauded the state. 'We are going to go after everybody who
has conned us,' he said.
He assured depositors that the emirate would honour the compensation
agreement it had negotiated with Touche Ross, the bank's liquidator.
Mr al-Sayegh also promised that Abu Dhabi intended to take a tough stance in
civil actions against third parties. He said it was fully committed to suing
Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, which the majority shareholders believed
did not keep them adequately informed about the bank's problems.
Abu Dhabi has told Lord Justice Bingham, whose report into the regulation of
BCCI is expected to be published next month, that Price Waterhouse was
involved in a conflict of interest in accepting various roles in the
investigation of the bank.
Mr al-Sayegh said Price Waterhouse was serving in four different capacities
 - as adviser on the restructuring plan for BCCI, in the investigation into
allegations of fraud, as auditor to BCCI, and in its capacity as the
reporting accountant to the Bank of England.
Price Waterhouse said yesterday it felt confident it could defend any
conflict of interest accusations. It said its membership of the
restructuring and investigation committees was with the consent and approval
of Abu Dhabi. Its reporting duties to the Bank of England had been fully
understood by the Abu Dhabi officials then involved.
US prosecutors asked a federal judge yesterday to postpone the trial of Mr
Clark Clifford, former defence secretary, so that New York prosecutors could
try him first on charges that he took bribes and lied to banking regulators,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The request ended a battle between federal and New York prosecutors over
which jurisdiction would first try Mr Clifford  - a former adviser to
several US presidents - and his law partner Mr Robert Altman.
The two have been accused of accepting bribes to hide BCCI's illegal
ownership of First American, Washington's biggest bank, before BCCI was shut
last year.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Bundesbank attacks Bonn's policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank is intensifying its attack on the Bonn government's economic
policies in east Germany, claiming that large subsidies east of the Elbe are
stoking inflation.
In its August monthly report, published today, the independent German
central bank urges a 'step by step' reduction of subsidies for investment in
the east.
Attempting to shift part of the responsibility to the government for last
month's  3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, the Bundesbank says
eastern subsidies are blunting the effects of its monetary policy.
'The east German economy is almost totally shielded from the effects of
interest rate policy,' the report says. 'This impairs the efficacy of
monetary policy instruments and the monetary braking distance becomes
longer.'
Investment incentives are in any case no panacea for east Germany's economic
problems, the Bundesbank argues.
Recovery in the east is not linked simply to the sheer volume of investment,
the bank argues, but to the quality of investments and their commercial
viability.
'The more an investment decision is distorted or eliminated,' the central
bank says, 'the greater the danger of misinvestment and at the same time the
waste of already scarce resources.'
The attack on the subsidies is consistent with the Bundesbank's opposition
to excessive spending. Net transfers from the western part of Germany to the
east are likely to amount to DM143bn (Pounds 50.7bn) this year, falling to
DM131bn in 1993.
The broadside criticism also reflects the bank's general frustration that
easy corporate access to borrowing for eastern investments is lowering the
efficacy of its anti-inflation strategy.
Because of the considerable impact of government-stimulated borrowing on
monetary growth, the bank argues, interest rates have to be higher to
achieve the same effect. This is especially noticeable now when it is in the
interests of the economy as a whole to promote stability-orientated monetary
policy.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Letter: Less lucre from the law of libel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM TURNBULL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As your Justinian column (August 10) observes, the cost of libel
actions both in legal fees and damages is unsatisfactory. The cost of
representation places the ordinary citizen at a disadvantage when faced with
the resources of a newspaper or broadcaster, while damages often appear out
of proportion to the hurt inflicted.
The law of libel is basically concerned with balancing the private right to
reputation and the private right to free speech. It fails to address the
public right to receive timely and accurate information on matters of public
interest.
There is, thus, a considerable public interest in newspapers (and
broadcasters) getting their facts right and, when wrong, correcting them at
the earliest opportunity. Most libels result from errors, but the law of
libel does not encourage publishers to correct them unless as part of a
settlement with the person defamed. It is unsatisfactory both for a
plaintiff to wait years for his good name to be vindicated and for the
public to wait for the facts to be corrected.
One possible change would be to provide that, where a publisher corrects and
apologises for the libel promptly, the plaintiff would only be entitled to
recover actual damages. An exception could be made in cases of proven
malice. This would give publishers a very real incentive to correct mistakes
quickly without fear that they are abandoning possible defences to a libel
action. Where a person has suffered real financial loss that could be
recovered, but actual financial loss in defamation is rare.
This sort of proposal has met with criticism from the legal profession (who
have a vested interest in defamation laws as they stand). Others may
consider such a change too generous to sloppy publishers. But the loss of a
right to general damages by the victims of sloppy journalists would be
outweighed by the benefits of early correction. Malcom Turnbull,
1 Chifley Square
Sydney
Australia.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Council's video system cuts crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIDEO surveillance system set up by King's Lynn Borough Council in Norfolk
has cut car crime in the town centre and may be extended to include local
businesses.
The system was installed in February after the success of a pilot scheme on
a council-owned industrial estate where crime had been discouraging
businesses from moving in.
There are 36 cameras in car parks, housing estates and leisure and shopping
centres, linked by fibre-optic cables to a control room which is staffed 24
hours a day and has a direct link to the police.
Running the system costs Pounds 200,000 a year in staff, maintenance and
leasing costs. This is partly funded by a 5p surcharge on car-park tickets
and service charges for businesses covered by the scheme.
The system has cut vandalism and reduced car thefts from three a fortnight
to three in the six months since it was introduced. Police attribute 53
arrests directly to the cameras.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Industry cool on timeshare rules: New legislation may not go
far enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Timeshare Act, which gives purchasers a cooling-off period of 14
days to cancel their contracts, will be of little comfort to the man from
Staffordshire who fell for the renumbering trick.
The renumbering trick works like this: the buyer purchases time in a
top-floor Tenerife studio flat with a sea view and, in the case of the man
from Staffordshire, pays Pounds 3,300. A year later he arrives for his
holiday and discovers that the flats have been re-numbered. He now has a
basement studio. He is told he can have a top-floor flat, although a new
building has regrettably appeared between his development and the sea,
depriving him of his sea view. All he has to do to get the flat he
originally wanted is to pay an additional Pounds 1,300. He pays up.
The Timeshare Council, which represents owners' groups and the legitimate
industry, is severely critical of the Timeshare Act. Giving purchasers 14
days to pull out of timeshare agreements deals with only one of the abuses
perpetrated by the less reputable members of the timeshare industry:
high-pressure selling.
The act does not protect those who buy timeshares in properties that are
never built. Nor does it help those who sign contracts on the selling
company's promise, subsequently unfulfilled, that it will sell an existing
timeshare.
In addition, the cooling-off period only applies if the contract is
concluded in the UK. The Timeshare Council estimates that 75 per cent of
contracts are concluded while buyers are on holiday abroad.
The act has its defenders. Mr Derek Prentice, assistant director of the
Consumers' Association, says it has the merit of confining itself to
provisions which can be enforced.
Abuses which take place outside the UK can be dealt with only by a planned
European Community directive, but not all EC members regard the directive as
urgent.
Mr Ron Haylock, managing director of RCI Europe, which arranges timeshare
exchanges, says he does not expect a directive from the EC before 1994  -
and governments would then have an additional two years to implement it.
However, the delay in devising an effective system of consumer protection
has not retarded the growth of the European timeshare industry. Mr Haylock
estimates that the number of people buying timeshares in Europe grew by 28
per cent last year to 125,000. This year's figure is expected to be 138,000.
In 1987 it was 46,000.
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France have seen strong growth in
the timeshare industry. However, the most spectacular performer of all, he
says, is Spain. Although the country is a favoured location for timeshare
apartments, Spaniards have only recently begun to feature among the buyers.
The UK has the largest number of timeshare buyers but, in contrast to the
rest of Europe, the British market has begun to decline. Mr Haylock
estimates that there were 49,000 UK buyers last year, only 1,000 more than
in 1990. In the first eight months of this year the number of UK buyers fell
by 8 per cent. Mr Haylock believes this is the result of the recession
rather than consumer concern about sharp practice.
Miss Diana Hanks, consumer services manager of the Timeshare Council,
argues, however, that legislation is still needed to deal with sharp
practices. The council would like tighter control of purchasers' money when
timeshares have been purchased in property that is still being built. A
common ploy is for rogue vendors to sell timeshares in flats that have not
been built, and then offer buyers holidays in alternative accommodation.
She says it should be compulsory for timeshare companies to offer potential
buyers full prospectuses which specify whether the property has been
completed. When villas and apartments have not yet been built, buyers' money
should be paid to trustees to be released in phases as construction work is
completed.
Legislation, says Miss Hanks, should deal with the problem of buyers who
discover, after paying cash, that they have also acquired a pre-existing
mortgage over the property.
Selling timeshares which turn out to include additional financial
obligations of this sort, should, she says, be 'a criminal offence with
massive fines and imprisonment'.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Support for small businesses urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is urging the banks to think hard about the longer-term
viability of small-business customers before deciding to withdraw support
from them.
With the government under mounting pressure to stimulate the economy,
Baroness Denton, small-business minister, is holding meetings with the
leading clearing banks to discuss the problems facing small businesses.
In an effort to stem mounting bankruptcies she is asking banks to 'spend
more time working out whether there is a future' before pulling the plug on
small-business customers. Insolvencies totalled 40,000 in the first half of
this year compared with 30,000 in the first six months of last year.
She has also extracted a commitment from all leading clearers to investigate
specific cases referred to them by her office. In keeping with a suggestion
made last year by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, she is working towards a
voluntary code of best practice for banks in their dealings with
small-business customers.
Such a code might include recommendations such as a minimum warning period
to businesses before support is withdrawn, although the minister said she
was 'still listening at the moment'.
She said: 'I don't think the banks are unaware of their responsibilities.'
She emphasised that the banks would inevitably be the principal source of
funding for small businesses.
The initiative comes 10 months after the banks were criticised by the Office
of Fair Trading for their 'insensitive, high-handed' treatment of
small-business customers. Nevertheless it was decided to take no action
against them on competition grounds.
The watchdog's investigation followed a Treasury and Bank of England report,
commissioned by the government, which cleared the banks of colluding on
interest rates so as not to pass on to customers the benefit of lower
interest charges.
The banks yesterday insisted that withdrawal of their support was always a
last resort. Lloyds said it had made it clear to Baroness Denton that it was
'not in our interest to close down any viable business'. Barclays said: 'If
it is a viable business, we are never going to pull the plug.'

CONSUMERS blame the banks for not making credit cards more fraud-proof,
according to a Mori survey for Readers' Digest, David Barchard writes.
About 2m payment cards are lost or stolen each year in the UK, with losses
of around Pounds 166m for the banks.
Two out of three people interviewed blamed the banks for failing to do more
to make cards fraud-proof, while 69 per cent believed shops should make more
rigorous checks.
Of 2,049 cardholders interviewed, 58 per cent said they would not pay extra
for a photo-card or a thief-proof smart card. Some 27 per cent said they
would pay Pounds 2 or more for additional security.
A third of cardholders admitted they had written down their personal
identification numbers. More than one in 20 kept their PIN number with their
card.

THREE RIVAL newspaper groups yesterday announced a joint venture to produce
advertising inserts for selected weekend titles with a total potential
circulation of 9.5m.
Brand Movers, an equal-shares venture by Express Newspapers, Mirror Group
Newspapers and The Telegraph, is to publish a colour magazine-format
brochure  - to be called Moneysavers  - offering price-saving coupons for
goods including foods.
Revenue will be split according to the circulation of the newspapers. None
of the newspapers was prepared to predict how much would be raised.
The News International group of daily and Sunday titles is due to launch a
similar insert on November 22.
Brand Movers said that the first Moneysavers would appear 'in the near
future' and be published periodically.
Such 'free-standing inserts' are big business in the US, where each
individual receives an average of 1,200 coupons each year. Nationwide, a
potential Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.55bn) in price reductions are offered.
Manufacturers pay retailers about Dollars 600m annually to participate.
A total of 8bn coupons were delivered in the UK last year, against 5bn the
previous year.
Brand Movers denied that the scheme was a response to declines in newspaper
display advertising but one clear target is to take revenue from TV.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Jensen comes to end of the road
</HEADLINE>

JENSEN CAR Company, the manufacturer of high-performance sports cars for the
rich and famous, is calling in liquidators.
Officials from Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, yesterday made their
first visit to the Jensen works in West Bromwich, West Midlands, to look
over the books and property. Creditors are owed Pounds 638,000. The
liquidators hope to sell the company as a going concern.
The Pounds 100,000 Jensen cars are hand-built. But only one new car has been
sold this year  - to Germany  - and there are no outstanding orders.
Jensen, which went into receivership in 1976, has been supported financially
for the past 18 months by Unicon Holdings of Stockport, which has decided to
cut its losses.
About 20 people work at the factory, which once produced cars for the likes
of Clark Gable, Henry Cooper and Cliff Richard.

FT  19 AUG 92 / MPs favour longer stamp duty holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURVEY of MPs suggests most favour extending the suspension of stamp duty.
An Access Opinion survey of 100 MPs shows 65 per cent of Tories and 67 per
cent of Labour MPs want abolition of the tax.
Just 12 per cent of MPs want the tax re-imposed and 15 per cent would like
to see its re-introduction delayed until the housing market picks up.
Mr Clive Soley, MP for Hammersmith and a former Labour housing spokesman,
said yesterday that the government must reconsider its stance on housing
policy and financing.
'In the present circumstances it is probably a good idea to get rid of stamp
duty, but the underlying message is that housing finance is in an appalling
mess and they need to start from the beginning again,' he said.
But Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding and a member of the
Commons Treasury select committee, said the experiment had been 'absolutely
useless'.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour environment spokesman, called for the suspension to be
extended until there was an upturn in the housing market.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Doubts hit recovery in house sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONDITIONS in the housing market remain extremely bleak in most parts of
England and Wales, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
In its latest quarterly survey, covering the three months to July 31, the
institution says a recovery in the housing market is being thwarted by a
combination of factors, including employment uncertainty, gloomy economic
news and the reality of negative equity.
In some parts of the country, however  - including Portsmouth in Hampshire;
Bath, Avon; Saffron Walden, Essex; Northampton; Cambridge; and Newbury,
Berkshire  - there seems to have a been a short-term surge in activity
caused by the prospect of the reintroduction of stamp duty. Exemption from
the tax ends at midnight tonight.
The exemption from stamp duty on house sales up to Pounds 250,000 has given
the market in some parts of London a temporary boost, but the survey says
that sellers continue to expect unrealistic prices while potential
purchasers do not feel confident enough to enter the market.
There also seem to be some stirrings in the housing market in parts of the
Yorkshire area and Humberside. Conditions are rosiest in Grimsby,
Humberside, and Telford, Shropshire.
Conditions in the housing market in the south-east are said to be generally
very quiet.
The survey came as the Treasury estimated that up to 500,000 buyers had
benefited from the suspension of stamp duty on most house purchases.
The Treasury said it had never expected the effect of the eight-month
moratorium on stamp duty to be 'dramatic'.
The figure was well below government estimates in December last year when
the exemption was announced. At that time the government said that at least
600,000 home buyers were expected to benefit.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Unlikely star finds a different TV role: Raymond Snoddy on
the Canadian broadcaster that may be a model for Channel Five
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VICTORIAN building in downtown Toronto may become the model for Britain's
fifth terrestrial television channel.
CityTV, an influential voice in the shaping of Channel 5, has pioneered a
'high-energy' local broadcasting style, producing two 24-hour-a-day channels
from Wesley Buildings, the former headquarters of a publishing company.
Wesley Buildings is the star of the station  - the entire building is the
studio. There are 36 camera connection points around it. Grids for mounting
cameras cover the ceilings. Lights are rigged ready for an interview or a
piece to camera in the boardroom and office of Mr Moses Znaimer, the
station's founder and executive producer. He is also the consultant
executive producer to the consortium which is the only bidder for Channel 5.
Programmes are broadcast live from his office, from corridors, a balcony,
the car park or the station shop.
Mr Jay Switzer, the station manager, says: 'We do heavy-metal groups from
the sub-basement for the atmosphere and we even did Phil Collins from the
washroom.' He is a consultant to Channel 5 on the 'model'  - the term for
the mixture of music, films and local news that has put CityTV second in the
competitive Toronto television market.
The station, which has a staff of 390, is informal, mildly irreverent and
aimed at 18-49-year-olds. Analysts say it has a turnover of CDollars 60m
(Pounds 26m) to CDollars 90m and is increasingly profitable, in spite of the
recession. Costs are said to be about four times cheaper than conventional
television.
Bureaucracy is kept to a minimum. It is up to producers to find the right
people. 'We pick the people who can lead the life,' says Mr Switzer. 'We
want people who live the beat and can learn the television skills.'
Some top producers started as switchboard operators. Editors working on news
clips tell the audience what stories they are working on to promote the
news. 'We glamorise the process not the conclusions,' says Mr Switzer. 'Some
production assistants get more fan mail than the presenters.'
Mr Znaimer believes that, if the CityTV formula succeeds in London, 'the
world will come flocking to the model; if not it could remain a Toronto
curiosity'.
The Independent Television Commission is assessing the bid from the
consortium, which is led by Thames Television. The consortium has to
persuade the ITC that it can retune millions of video recorders likely to
suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal.
'It's looking more encouraging,' says Mr Znaimer. The bid is backed by Thorn
EMI, the parent of Thames. Sony Pictures, the Hollywood studio group, has
renewed its interest and there have been initial discussions with Viacom,
the US media group.
Potential investors in Channel 5, which plans to launch first in London,
then in Manchester followed by other UK cities have already raised the
possibility of going to other countries. Eventually Mr Znaimer believes
large cities all over the world will have their equivalents of CityTV.

FT  19 AUG 92 / Full employment promoted as Labour objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESTORATION of full employment as one of the core aims of the Labour
movement will take a further step forward next month at the annual Trades
Union Congress conference in Blackpool.
The slogan, Working For Full Employment, will be the rallying call of a TUC
initiative to re-establish full employment as a central goal of economic
policy.
The idea has 'slipped down the agenda', a TUC official said. 'We want to
reassert it  - it is a time when we are having to reassess our priorities.'
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, recently called for full
employment to be put back at the heart of Labour policy. He said it would
never be achieved again unless restored to 'its proper place in the
political and economic ambitions of our country and the rest of the European
Community'.
Mr Dobson has twice returned to this theme, and has sought to broaden
support for his stance by arguing that mass unemployment is 'bad for all of
us' and not just for the unemployed.
Doubts remain about Mr Dobson's precise definition of full employment and
the full policy implications, but he is gathering some powerful allies in
the party. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said recently
he would 'very much share' Mr Dobson's sentiments.
Mr Murray Elder, chief of staff for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said
Mr Dobson's call to put full employment 'back at the top of the European
agenda' was 'entirely consistent with our position'.
Full employment was a Labour commitment for many years, but the party's
general election manifesto this year confined itself to pledging 'a swift
reduction in unemployment' and 'to prevent long-term unemployment, rather
than just trying to cope with it after it has occurred'.

FT  19 AUG 92 / PSBR reaches Pounds 11.3bn on fall in tax receipts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEEBLE state of the economy depressed government income and expenditure
tax receipts last month, resulting in a higher-than-expected public sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 600m.
The impact of the recession on the government's finances was masked by
healthy privatisation receipts of Pounds 1.7bn from the second call on the
sale of British Telecom shares. The July deficit, excluding privatisation
receipts, was Pounds 2.2bn. This compares to a deficit of Pounds 200m in the
same month a year ago.
July's figure, released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, brought
the cumulative PSBR for the first four months of the 1992-93 financial year
to Pounds 11.3bn, compared to Pounds 5.9bn in the same period last year.
Excluding privatisation receipts, the cumulative total was Pounds 14.7bn.
The second successive month of sluggish tax receipts means that the
government's target for the PSBR of Pounds 28bn in 1993-93 is well out of
reach, economists said.
The Treasury's projections assume an increase of 13 per cent in receipts
from value added tax this year. But VAT receipts were only Pounds 2.7bn last
month, unchanged from the same month a year ago.
The shortfall on VAT receipts alone is likely to be between Pounds 3.5bn and
Pounds 4bn this year, according to Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Midland
Montagu, the investment bank. 'These figures are a clear sign of the
economy's current difficulties and the pressures the government will face
for the rest of the year,' he said. Midland Montagu expects the total PSBR
for 1992-93 to be Pounds 33bn.
The news came as little surprise to the markets, which were already aware
that the PSBR will overshoot the government's target this year.
Sterling ended the day at DM2.8125  - down half a pfennig from yesterday's
close. This takes the pound even closer to its technical floor of DM2.778
within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
Income tax receipts were also lower than analysts had expected, a further
reason why the PSBR was larger than the market expectation of Pounds 400m in
July. Total cash receipts were Pounds 18.3bn in July and Pounds 64.3bn in
the first four months of 1992-93, 1.5 per cent down on the same four months
a year ago. Total cash outlays were Pounds 19.1bn in July and Pounds 75.5bn
in the first four months, up 8 per cent on a year ago.
One good sign was the local-authority debt repayment of Pounds 100m in July,
compared with a deficit of Pounds 600m a year ago. Mr Briscoe said this may
suggest that the government's constraints on local authority spending are
finally starting to bite.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RWANDA'S government and rebels yesterday signed a formal accord that
promises sweeping political reforms and an end to a 22-month civil war in
their tiny central African country, Reuter reports from Arusha, Tanzania.
The accord was signed by Rwandan Foreign Minister Boniface Ngulinzira and
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front's (RPF) Pasteur Bizimungu after a week of
talks in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
'The two parties concur that national unity, democracy and peace are
invaluable and solemnly undertake to do everything possible to preserve them
in the interest of Rwandan generations,' the feuding parties said in a joint
statement.
The accord calls for an all-party interim government, overhaul of the
judiciary, legislature and executive and the creation of a watchdog body to
monitor human rights abuses.
Talks on demands by the rebel for the integration of RPF soldiers into a
reformed national army and the return home of some 250,000 refugees are due
to start in Arusha on September 7.
The rebels, who first invaded from Uganda in October 1990 and whose ranks
are dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, have been fighting the army of
the dominant Hutu.
The Hutu seized power from the Tutsi monarchy three decades ago in bloody
uprisings that killed 100,000 people.
The terms of the agreements will be effective from January 10 next year.
The two sides are observing an internationally-brokered ceasefire which will
be monitored by a neutral 50-man African military observer group from
Senegal, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
The force is expected in Kigali, Rwanda, this week.

An estimated 18m people in 10 southern African nations face food shortages
because of drought, a regional planning group says, AP reports from Harare.
In its latest bulletin obtained in Harare , the Southern African Development
Community's Early Warning Unit said food shortages were severest in Malawi,
Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Because of southern Africa's worst drought this century, most SADC member
nations have virtually exhausted strategic food reserves by meeting
immediate needs, the bulletin said.
'The current stock position for the region is very precarious,' it said.
The 10-nation grouping - Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe - now holds some 813,000
tonnes of grain in stock, enough for about three weeks' consumption.
The bulletin noted that delivery of food supplies to isolated areas was held
up by the civil war in Mozambique and transport problems in Angola, Malawi,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency said yesterday it would finance
production of a so-called 'green fridge', a refrigerator which operates
without ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Reter reports from Berlin.
Environmentalists have campaigned for months to save the DKK Scharfenstein
company in eastern Germany from liquidation by gathering 65,000 orders for
the refrigerator.
Treuhand board member Ludwig Traenkner told reporters that DKK would still
go into liquidation but that the government agency would pay for 405 out of
1,800 workers to make the new product. The remainder would go onto
work-creation schemes.
The fridge's secret is a coolant based on a mixture of propane and butane,
as opposed to chlorine and fluorine. The Treuhand was sceptical but was
pushed into supporting it by Bonn.

The move, expected to save up to DM300,000, (Pounds 106,382) was intended as

It followed Monday's announcement that the DAG white-collar union was

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES at four Polish coal mines went on strike yesterday, joining copper
and car workers, in response to a call by radical trade unions which want to
make the government back down from painful economic reforms, Reuter reports
from Warsaw.
At the Gdansk shipyard where the Solidarity trade union was born, about 80
workers were fired for staging an illegal protest, a sign that the
authorities were unlikely to give in, PAP news agency said.
'There are four coal mines on strike now, and there are rallies in more than
a dozen,' said Mr Marek Opasnik, a spokesman for the former communist union
OPZZ.
'This is just the beginning. There will be many more mines and factories
joining if the government doesn't start negotiations on our 21 demands,' he
added.
These demands include an end to Poland's 13 per cent unemployment, 'the
immediate abandonment of the current chaotic and fraudulent privatisation,'
lower interest rates and the abandonment of strict wage controls in state
industry.
The six unions have also taken up the cause of workers at the huge
state-owned copper combine KGHM Polska Miedz SA and the plant which makes
Fiat SA's Cinquecento minicar, both of which have held pay strikes for the
last month.
The six, which unite a radical offshoot of the Solidarity trade union with
miners, farmers and railway workers' groups led by former communists, claim
the support of 5m members. Few of these have so far taken part in the
protests.
The Solidarity union itself, which claims just under two million members,
has distanced itself from the protest calls, although it is also demanding
urgent government action to help ailing state industry.
Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka's coalition government has promised measures
to help relieve heavy debts owed by enterprises, but has refused to give in
to strikes or negotiate workers' demands while stoppages continue.
Solidarity leaders have agreed to co-operate with their former colleague,
President Lech Walesa, in trying to break the stalemate and have appealed to
workers to end the strikes.

Daily News talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUGGLE to find a new owner for the Daily News, the New York city
tabloid, intensi fied yesterday afternoon when a bankruptcy court judge
essentially extended the negotiation period to allow unions to try to reach
agreements with Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher whose offer has
received management backing.
In the absence of a consensus among the paper's nine unions, Daily News
management voted to accept a bid by Mr Black, who controls The Daily
Telegraph of London, as part of its reorganisation plan presented to the
bankruptcy court yesterday.
Yesterday Judge Tina Brozman gave the parties until September 8 to reach a
firm agreement. Although Mr Black's proposal has met with management and
creditor approval, it also calls for agreements with all of the News unions,
which may prove impossible.
Other terms of Mr Black's offer include Dollars 75m for all of the Daily
News business assets, including Dollars 22m for administrative claims and
creditors, and the construction of a Dollars 200m colour printing plant in
New York city. Mr Black would also advance up to Dollars 3m in financing to
forestall a cash crisis, provided he reaches agreements with at least six of
the unions.
Before yesterday's hearing, the bulk of the unions were believed to favour a
competing bid from Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News and World Report
magazine.
Mr Fred Drasner, president of US News and World Report, said the court
hearing was 'largely a non-event. Whoever wins an agreement with the unions
will be the owner of the Daily News. We will continue our discussions and
remain cautiously optimistic'. The Daily News, which celebrated being
rescued by Mr Robert Maxwell early last year, has been operating under the
protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since shortly after Mr
Maxwell's death.
Ms Brozman, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the continued impasse
at the Daily News, earlier chastised unions and management for 'jeopardising
my ability to keep this newspaper alive'.
Hollinger, the fast-growing newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
lifted net second-quarter earnings almost sevenfold, thanks to the proceeds
of the recent sale of shares by the UK's Telegraph group, writes Bernard
Simon in Toronto.
Earnings for the quarter, including extraordinary items, were CDollars 85.8m
(USDollars 72.1m), or CDollars 1.50 a share, up from CDollars 12.3m, or 15
cents a share, a year earlier. Net earnings for the first six months climbed
to CDollars 54.1m, or 87 cents a share, from CDollars 29.7m, or 39 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 436.6m from CDollars
398.9m.
The company said that higher taxes stemming from the rise in operating
earnings and last year's application of loss carry-forwards resulted in a
fall in first-half operating earnings to CDollars 24.1m from CDollars 27.5m.
Operating earnings before income taxes and minority interest rose to
CDollars 57m from CDollars 46m.
The company said that 'other items' in the first half consisted almost
entirely of the CDollars 38.4m write-down taken in the first quarter
relating to the sale of its investment in United Newspapers, and the
second-quarter gain from the Telegraph sale.

THE SPARKLE has vanished from the latest results at Tiffany, the New
York-based jewellery group.
After-tax profits in the three months to end-July were almost halved at
Dollars 3.89m, compared with Dollars 7.23m in the same period a year
earlier.
Sales were Dollars 120.8m, barely increased on the Dollars 119.4m in the
same period of 1991.
Tiffany said that US retail sales were static at around Dollars 53.6m. Local
people kept buying, said the retailer, but there was a decline in sales to
tourists visiting the US.
International retail sales also remained flat, with increases in European
and Far Eastern stores being offset by a shortfall of wholesale sales in
Japan.
On the direct marketing front - that is, business-to-business sales and
through the catalogue - there was an 8 per cent sales gain.
Profits for the first half now stand at Dollars 6.99m, compared with Dollars
11.6m a year earlier (before a one-off accounting change item).
Six month sales were ahead at Dollars 228.1m, compared with Dollars 216.5m.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has
posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 50.3m for June. This brings the ailing
airline's deficit for the second quarter to Dollars 88.9m.
The carrier lost a similar amount - Dollars 86.8m - in the first three
months of the year. However, the after-tax figures are distorted to some
extent by proceeds from asset sales. Recent operating results show a
deteriorating trend, with losses increasing from Dollars 15m in March, to
Dollars 26.4m in April, Dollars 39.5m in May and Dollars 43.3m in June.
In June, revenues were Dollars 304.8m, compared with Dollars 291.8m in the
previous month, but expenses also increased to Dollars 348.1m - against
Dollars 331.2m in May. Because TWA is in bankruptcy, it is obliged to report
results on a monthly basis.
Mr Icahn has been attempting to resolve the heavily indebted company's
future. One mooted scheme would involve him ceding about 55 per cent of the
carrier's equity to creditors, in return for giving debt, while employees
would take the remaining 45 per cent, in exchange for wage concessions. Last
week, TWA reached an agreement in principle with one of the three leading
unions involved - the flight attendants - but the scheme still needs to
overcome a variety of hurdles.
At the end of June, TWA also acknowledged holding talks with USAir and

<TEXT>
ST LAWRENCE CEMENT, the North American cement manufacturing and construction
arm of the Swiss Holderbank group, is suspending quarterly common share
dividends until further notice.
The company attributed the move to weak commercial and residential
construction markets in eastern Canada and the north-eastern US.
In July it paid a cash dividend of 5 cents on the A shares and a stock
dividend equal to 14 cents.
St Lawrence is eastern Canada's largest cement producer and is also a large
producer and supplier in the north-eastern US. In the first half it lost
CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 16.5m) or 48 cents a share, against a deficit of
CDollars 10.9m or 27 cents a year earlier.
Sales dropped 9 per cent to CDollars 179m.
Hydro-Quebec, a leading borrower in international financial markets,
reported net profit of CDollars 432m for the first half, up 10 per cent from
a year earlier.
Revenues for the period were CDollars 3.5bn, up 12.5 per cent.
Electricity sales by volume rose 7.6 per cent, partly due to a cold winter.
In addition exports to the US were higher and domestic rates rose in May.
Operating expenses rose 4.6 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KMART, the large discount retailer, yesterday reported flat profits for the
second quarter of 1992, and a small dip in earnings per share.
But Toys 'R' Us, the New Jersey-based toy retailer, unveiled a 40 per cent
improvement in after-tax profits in the same three months.
The contrasting results come towards the end of the retail sector's
reporting season, and underline the extent to which fortunes have been mixed
during this period.
Kmart said that after-tax profits in the three months to July 29 stood at
Dollars 168m, compared with Dollars 163m a year earlier. Total operating
income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 342m, but earnings per share slipped
from 40 to 37 cents - reflecting the increased share capital following a
PERCs offering in August 1991.
Kmart said its general merchandise business was affected by consumer caution
and the cool weather - which contrasted with the warm spell a year ago, and
depressed clothing and garden sales.
The general merchandise side saw a 2 per cent advance in comparable store
sales, and total turnover was Dollars 6.46bn (Dollars 6.21bn). Operating
profits advanced by 5.1 per cent to Dollars Dollars 301m.
On the specialty stores side, five of the six chains fared well. However,
PACE warehouse clubs suffered from the strains of a rapid expansion plan and
lower-than-expected sales growth. Overall, the specialty retail business saw
sales of Dollars 2.68bn (Dollars 2.2bn), and operating profits of Dollars
41m (Dollars 46m).
Kmart now shows an after-tax profit of Dollars 284m in the first six months,
against Dollars 270m, on sales of Dollars 17.4bn (Dollars 16bn).
Toys 'R' Us, by contrast, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 32.7m, up
from Dollars 23.4m, in the second quarter to August 1.
Sales increased to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 1.06bn a year ago. The
company said that US toy stores saw a comparable store sales increase of 6.3
per cent in the quarter, with strong advances in basic categories. The
European stores also moved ahead sharply.
The results bring Toys 'R' Us sales for the first half to Dollars 2.42bn,
against Dollars 2.08bn a year ago, and after-tax profits to Dollars 61m,
compared with Dollars 45.8m.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Administrators appointed at Burns-Anderson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNS-ANDERSON, the recruitment and financial services group formerly
chaired by Sir John Harvey-Jones, has gone into administrative receivership.
Touche Ross announced yesterday that insolvency partners Mr Nick Lyle and Mr
David Morgan had been appointed joint administrative receivers of the
holding company late on Friday evening.
Mr Lyle was also appointed joint administrative receiver, with Mr Ken Chalk
of Touche Ross, of Burns-Anderson Recruitment.
Dealings in the shares were suspended at 2p on Friday, after talks aimed at
restructuring the company's debts with its bankers, which include National
Westminster, failed.
The receivers also revealed yesterday that 16 of the 21 recruitment agency
offices of Burns-Anderson Recruitment were purchased over the weekend by
Premier Employment, a company newly formed by Mr Dorian Marks, the former
finance director.
Mr Marks, who was also a director of Burns-Anderson Recruitment, was
assisted in the purchase by other former directors.
Defending the swiftness of the disposal, Mr Chalk said that it had been 'a
good realisation for the creditors in the circumstances.'
Mr Chris Edge of Family Assurance Society, which has a 4.9 per cent stake in
the group, said yesterday that the developments over the weekend were 'not
an enormous surprise. The company has been struggling for a considerable
period.'
Pre-tax losses were Pounds 2.74m for the year to December 31 1991.
The group first fell into the red in the 15 months to end-December 1990.
Operating profits were Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 3.22m a year earlier) but
interest charges of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 246,000) and exceptional costs of
Pounds 1.86m (nil) resulted in a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.6m (profit of
Pounds 2.98m).
Extraordinary costs of Pounds 5.25m relating to disposals and reorganisation
caused an overall deficit of Pounds 6.59m.
Burns-Anderson, which had interests in banking, hire-purchase, stockbroking,
insurance broking and direct marketing, sold most of these operations in
1990 to concentrate on its core businesses of independent financial advice
and recruitment.
The disposals reduced the group's borrowings from Pounds 35m to Pounds 15m.
The receivers said that three of the group's subsidiaries, including
Burns-Anderson Independent Network, the third largest network of financial
advisers in the country, were not immediately affected by the collapse of
the holding company.
Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375 individually
registered members with Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation, said
yesterday that the network itself continued to do business profitably and
was financially 'ringfenced' from the group.
Mr Stephen Kelland, director of Kelland &amp; Partners financial advisory
division, said yesterday that his company had no cross-guarantees with the
group.
'Whatever situation we move to will be a better one because the parent
company won't have debts,' he said.
The group's market capitalisation at the suspension price was Pounds
830,000, compared with a high of Pounds 55.5m in June 1987.
In that month, Sir John, former chairman of ICI and a renowned
troubleshooter, joined Burns-Anderson as non-executive chairman.
He resigned as chairman in June 1990, leaving the board in March 1991.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Four jailed after bullion trial: Large part of proceeds from
Pounds 26m Brink's-Mat robbery still missing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE part of the spoils from Britain's biggest bullion robbery continues
to evade detectives some nine years and 12 trials after an armed gang
escaped with Pounds 26m in gold bars from a top security warehouse near
Heathrow Airport.
As four members of the criminal network that handled and conspired to handle
proceeds from the Brink's-Mat raid were sentenced yesterday to prison
sentences ranging from five to 10 years, police were still pondering what
had happened to part of the proceeds.
Mr Brian Perry and Mrs Jean Savage, who were convicted yesterday at the Old
Bailey of taking part in a plot to launder profits from the raid, received
sentences of nine years and five years respectively.
Fellow defendants who were convicted last week, Mr Gordon Parry and Mr
Patrick Clark, were sentenced to 10 years and six years. Mr Clark's son,
Stephen, was acquitted.
In the Brink's-Mat case - Britain's most notorious robbery since the Great
Train Robbery more than 20 years earlier - armed raiders threatened to turn
security guards into human torches to make them disclose the combination of
the vault.
Unlike the train robbers, however, the Brink's-Mat gang had evolved an
elaborate plan to convert the bullion into cash and launder the proceeds in
the international financial system.
Gold was melted down and sold on the open market by Mr Kenneth Noye, a Kent
businessman said to be the central linkman in the scheme. Noye was sentenced
in 1986 to 14 years in jail for his part in the plot. Previously he had been
acquitted of murder after stabbing a police officer who had been keeping his
home under surveillance.
Some Pounds 14m is thought to have been laundered through two groups using
the Noye route. Another route is so far undiscovered.
According to the prosecution, once the money had entered the banking system
it went on a merry-go-round between various banks and offshore institutions.
Initially, however, the money entered banks through large cash deposits. Mrs
Savage took a total of Pounds 2.5m of cash in shopping bags to a branch of
the Bank of Ireland in Croydon. The prosecution noted it was a lot of money
to be banked by a 'lady tobacconist'.
Her nest egg, which was later transferred to Dublin, grew to Pounds 4m with
interest before part of it was transferred to another bank account in Dubai.
That money was frozen by the courts before it could go further but other
profits from the raid were said by the prosecution to have been ploughed
back into property ventures, including some in London's Docklands.
Whether cash could be transferred into the bank system so easily today is
unlikely given the publication of Bank of England guidelines in 1990 which
urged banks and building societies to report suspicious transactions to the
police.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Plan for UN protectorate backed by Bosnian president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S president has backed some form of United Nations protectorate for
Bosnia-Hercegovina, in spite of fears that this could consolidate
territorial gains made by Serbs and Croats, EC diplomats said yesterday.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic supported the idea of a UN protectorate for the first
time during talks in Brussels on Friday with Lord Carrington, chairman of
the EC sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia.
Although the Bosnian government controls only a small percentage of the
republic following territorial advances by Serbia and Croatia, Mr
Izetbegovic is determined to see a viable Bosnian republic emerge from the
conflict within the former Yugoslav republic.
During the talks, President Milan Kucan of Slovenia and President Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia also supported plans for a protectorate.
An EC diplomat said Mr Kucan supported such an arrangement because it would
halt the exodus of refugees to Slovenia, while Mr Tudjman advocated it as a
means of offsetting the negative publicity Croatia has gained in supporting
its own seizures of territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Although Slovene, Croat, and Bosnian leaders were vague about the definition
of a protectorate, the official said it was clear that 'Izetbegovic wants
one which will go some way towards reconstituting the Bosnian government,
and restoring control over all of Bosnia.'
Plans for placing Bosnia-Hercegovina under a UN protectorate were suggested
last week by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban,
head of Bosnia's Croats.
However, both men were seen as espousing the idea to consolidate their
territorial gains, rather than to reconstitute the legal status of the
Bosnian government.
Western diplomats yesterday stressed that the UN would not be prepared to
place Bosnia under any kind of protectorate until a number of conditions
were met. These included a ceasefire, the disarming of all fighters, the
removal of heavy weapons and the guaranteeing of the right of all refugees
to return eventually to the region.
'These conditions will only be realised when all three sides (in Bosnia) are
ready to negotiate a political settlement. Maybe we are slowly reaching that
stage,' a western diplomat said.
An EC official said the Bosnian leader was 'more confident, more buoyant'
during last week's EC talks despite an announcement by Mr Karadzic that he
had taken control of 70 per cent of the territory in Bosnia, 'more than he
wanted'. Mr Izetbegovic told Lord Carrington that he questioned Mr
Karadzic's claims.
A six-storey hotel housing hundreds of refugees was set ablaze in Sarajevo
last night after it was hit by threee mortar bombs. Two people were reported
to have been killed and it was feared others might be trapped inside the
Europa Hotel. Two members of an ITN camera crew were among those injured.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Hungary's spies turn to free enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S SECRET service, casting around for a role after the collapse of
communism, believes it has found a growth industry in investigating western
businesses in the country.
The secret police, which only three years ago spied on opponents of the
communist regime, will gain powers to confirm the credentials of foreign
capitalists entering partnerships with Hungarian businesses, the government
says.
'The National Security Office would like to prevent swindlers entering
Hungarian commercial life disguised as businessmen,' said Mr Tibor Fuzessy,
minister for the security services, explaining the thinking behind
forthcoming national security legislation.
The government's proposals follow a number of privatisation scandals as
inexperienced Hungarian managers and officials, desperate for money to save
faltering companies, prove easy targets for western conmen and speculators.
In one case, executives at a state-owned canning factory gave money, office
space and credence to a western investor who turned out to be a fraudster
with a criminal record.
The Hungarians are not always the victims, however. At the lobby of the
Forum, Budapest's premier business hotel, carpetbagging western property
developers met their match.
'There were people sitting there selling things they did not own to people
who could not afford to buy them,' according to Mr Neil Gillon, who works
with Mr Mel Simon, the US property developer.
The case for the security services checking out investors' credentials is
that western banks charge too much to do so. The minister denied, however,
that the secret service was undercutting the banks to gain business.
Nevertheless, economic intelligence gathering is a logical activity for
Hungary's reformed security service.
The National Security Office was formed from the wreckage of III/II, the
department of the old communist secret police which dealt with economic
counter-espionage.
But in one of those delicious post-communist ironies, many former secret
policemen are on the staff of new private security companies, which have
grown along with the western joint ventures they protect.

Sir, The final burning of banknotes at The Royal Bank of Scotland was a
cheerful acknowledgement of a colourful tradition.
Yes, Scottish bankers are proud of the innovations they have passed on to
their southern counterparts. You modestly reduced these, perhaps in the
interests of space, to three. We could have added overdrafts, branches,
coloured banknotes, two-sided printing of banknotes and mobile banks - while
we wait to see which bank will join us in cross-border European payments,
photos on plastic cards and, come December, commemorative banknotes.
Don't begrudge us that true passion of the Scots banker - looking backward
with pride and looking forward with imagination.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Letter: Making good news of a dividend cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor ADAM BRANDENBURGER and Dr BEN POLAK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paul Marsh ('Why dividend cuts are a last resort', August 12) correctly
observes that managers usually have better information than investors, that
dividend cuts signal bad news to the market, and that companies try to
smooth dividends, avoiding 'cuts at (almost) all costs'. But the implication
that this situation is satisfactory is unwarranted.
Consider a manager who knows his company would be best served by cutting the
dividend (instead using the funds for some project) but is worried about the
company's share price. If he were to cut the dividend, the market would see
this as a signal that the firm was in trouble and the share price would
fall.
The market would not be irrational in drawing this conclusion: prevailing
'ground rules' imply only distressed companies cut dividends. The manager
could try to explain the real reason for the dividend cut, say in the annual
report. But this tactic is available to all companies (including ones in
distress) and so has little credibility. Thus managers often continue to pay
high dividends, even when it is not in the best interests of their companies
and shareholders.
This is a vicious circle: as long as only distressed companies lower
dividends, the market will treat dividend cuts as bad news, and the
resulting low share price will discourage healthy companies from even
beneficial cuts.
How do we break this circle and promote more flexible dividend policies? One
way would be to encourage managers to be less concerned with today's share
price and more concerned with long-term earnings. This could be achieved by
long-term contracts and stock options restricting early sale.

However, when asked which country had the best toilet facilities, the same

When it comes to international institutions, the European Community is
probably more important to the South Africans than either the Commonwealth
or the United Nations. This helps explain why Neil van Heerden, head of
South Africa's diplomatic service, will soon be taking up his post as the
country's next ambassador to the community.
A craggy, law and political science graduate, the 53-year-old Van Heerden is
one of South Africa's best known career diplomats. He joined the foreign
affairs ministry in 1959, and served in Tokyo, Taiwan, Tehran, Washington
and Bonn. But he really came to international attention during the Namibian
independence negotiations and more recently has been at the heart of South
Africa's constitutional talks.
Differences with long-serving foreign minister, Pik Botha, are rumoured to
be one of the reasons behind his move to Brussels. However, this need not
affect his future; there will be a 'place for him in the new South Africa,'
says the ANC, which is probably more than can be said for his erstwhile
boss.

Australia has scored another first over Britain. It has put a woman on the
board of its central bank. Janet Holmes a Court, widow of the late tycoon
Robert, has been made a member of the Reserve Bank of Australia board along
with Lew Solomon, chairman of Coles Myer.
Whilst it is always good to see a woman moving up the ladder, Janet Holmes a
Court was not the most obvious female candidate to fill the vacancy. She is
reckoned to have done a good job running her late husband's business empire
after he died in 1990, but most of her life has been spent worrying about
her family rather than big business. Similarly, Lew Solomon's elevation will
raise a few eyebrows. It is a bit like putting a financial
entrepreneur/retailer, such as Sir James Goldsmith, on the board.
But then perhaps the Bank of England might benefit from the appointment of a
few non-establishment figures to its Court. How about Lord Hanson to replace
Sir Adrian Cadbury?
Twenty-two years on the Bank's board is long enough for anybody.

Treasury officials were quaking in their pinstripes last night after Teresa
Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay and one of the most extravagant
self-publicists in the Commons, finally added her voice to the chorus of
advice to the government on how best to solve Britain's economic problems.
Mrs Gorman's solution? Fire a Treasury civil servant each time a business
goes bankrupt. 'The sackings should start at the top,' she advises, 'At
permanent secretary level.'
If she started with Terry Burns at 5 o'clock, the guard at the front door
would get his marching orders by about 6 and the place would be deserted
well before the Tory party conference, on the basis of 1,000 bankruptcies a
week.
No doubt the idea will go down well with her supporters in Essex but it
hardly suggests that she is ministerial material.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Greater education reform urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT stage of education reform should be a mechanism to help found new
state schools, according to Mr Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith
Institute, the rightwing think-tank.
In a book to be published next month, Mr Pirie argues for a system whereby
'parents can get together, perhaps with local businesses, to found new state
schools which can be rapidly accepted for grant-maintained status'.
Mr Pirie - one of the government's panel of advisers on the Citizen's
Charter - suggests that the Education Department should consider preparing
and issuing 'a guidance manual for parents and teachers wishing to start new
schools'. He says it is clear that opted-out, grant-maintained status will
become 'the norm'.
In a wide examination of how privatisation, internal markets and the
Citizen's Charter aim to restructure society, he also turns his attention to
health, arguing that the next stage of NHS reforms should be 'the extension
of choice to patients themselves'.
He says: 'It would not require major changes to the fundholding system to
build in the incentives for practices to compete for patients. When patients
themselves can choose which organisation they wish to enrol with to handle
their health needs . . . the internal market in health will be functioning
fully.'
Mr Pirie argues in favour of a process of cross-fertilisation for the
Citizen's Charter: 'The best points of the good charters . . . need to be
copied by those services whose charters have been at best indifferent.'
He maintains that the charters affecting passengers, patients and parents
mean an important shift in power 'toward the consumers'.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Those that bite the bulletin: The Bank's low-profile
economics division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEYOND THE hush of the Bank of England's marbled ground floor, a small
warren of slightly shabby, narrow corridors leads to the Bank's economics
division.
Little is generally known about the economists who work there other than
what appears in the Bank's quarterly bulletin, the latest copy of which is
published today. But a favourite taunt of their City and Treasury colleagues
is that their research is carried out in a vacuum, having little impact on
the authorities' decisions.
The role of central bank economists is bound to be slightly murky. The
extent to which their work can affect big policy decisions is limited, given
that the government has the final say on monetary policy.
At the same time, much of their research cannot be published for fear of
giving away intentions on base-rate movements and of upsetting the markets.
Yet Professor Mervyn King, an executive director of the Bank who took over
responsibility a year ago for the economics division - known internally as
ED - was convinced that a department of about 35 economists could make a
valuable contribution to the Bank's policies.
He decided to reorganise the division to 'make it more central to the needs
of the Bank'.
Mr Lionel Price, head of ED, who was closely involved with the
reorganisation, said: 'There was a feeling that ED had become detached from
the Bank and didn't reflect the shift in its work that had taken place over
the previous 10 years.
'We needed to act as adviser to the banking system on the macro-economic and
monetary side but also on bank regulation and the promotion of financial
services.'
The question was how to reorganise more than 30 highly qualified,
intelligent public-sector employees, who had been working to more or less
the same brief since the late 1970s, in order to make their output more
relevant to the needs of a central bank. The main change to the division was
to reduce sharply the importance of its economic model, formerly the
division's centrepiece around which all research revolved.
The system, according to Prof King, had become ossified. Underemployed
economists scrabbled around for something new to say about their section of
the model, rather than addressing relevant issues.
'It is easy for any organisation to get stuck in a rut. A small group can
sit on the same thing for 50 years, without asking themselves 'should we be
working on this?',' he said.
Withdrawing an established economic model from a group of economists is a
bit like robbing an electrician of his tool kit. After all, many of ED's
economists had defined themselves in terms of the model since they began
working there.
Professor King said: 'In the old days people had a clear link with a
particular bit of the economy, for example, the capital account. That had to
change - people had to start thinking about why they were doing what they
were doing.'
The model was slimmed down from 500 variables to about 350, and the number
of people working on the forecasts was cut to about five. At the same time
the rest of the department was divided into six groups, each focusing on a
separate area of the economy relevant to the Bank's activities.
The theory was that, released from the burden of the forecast, the Bank's
economists would be free to carry out topical research.
Few problems were encountered on the way. One or two employees left, and
those responsible for the model before the changes felt a little bereft at
its downgrading.
But Mr Price said: 'On the whole I think those directly involved with
forecasting rather liked the new system once they got used to it. They used
to have about 40 other economists telling them what to put in their
forecast. Now, with just four or five of them they felt they owned it.'
The other groups, including two new sections, could now use their time to
research projects relevant to the bank - the shape of the economic recovery,
the pros and cons of gilts auctions, analysis of bond yields and prices, and
the effect of repossessions on the housing market.
A year on Prof King is pleased with the results of the reorganisation. He
said that ideas generated by ED were beginning to be subsumed into the
collective consciousness of the Bank.
Most employees seem enthusiastic and busy, in spite of the collegiate,
slightly laid-back atmosphere of the division. Complicated equations adorn
the walls of the rather austere offices, alongside notices for the next Bank
of England cricket match.
Often a seminar - for example Mr John Wriglesworth of UBS Phillips and Drew
on the UK housing market - interrupts the day.
One or two of the younger economists grumble that their work goes
unrecognised, and that ED research remains unlikely to influence policy
decisions taken by the authorities. But other comments suggest that Prof
King's desire to bring ED closer to the heart of the Bank is being
fulfilled.
A member of the monetary and exchange rate policy group said: 'The people
you get here are those that want to do something useful with economics.
Obviously there is no profit motive, rather a desire to see your thoughts
become policy.'
Another of the division's younger economists working in the quantitative
financial economics group has recently returned from the City. He said:
'This place has changed a lot. Getting me to come back would have taken
about five or six months and a sub-committee a few years ago, but this time
it took a couple of phone calls.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / Textile and clothes exports rise by 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXTILE and clothing exports rose almost 8 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn in the
first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, the
industry's trade body said yesterday.
This was more than double the growth in imports, the Apparel, Knitting and
Textiles Alliance (AKT) said. The change left the textiles and clothing
trade deficit steady at Pounds 1.8bn.
Mr Allan Nightingale, chairman of AKT, said: 'This is a remarkable
achievement when the economies of the UK's major overseas markets are in
difficulty.
'However, the UK market remains extremely depressed. The brief upturn in
consumer and industrial confidence in the spring has faded.'
He criticised 'government spokesmen who deny the extreme seriousness of the
present recession'.
Textile and clothing companies continued to cut costs, said Mr Nightingale.
The AKT estimates 6,000 jobs in the industry are lost each quarter.
Clothing exports increased faster than textiles and accounted for Pounds
875m of the total. The biggest markets remained the Irish Republic and
Germany, with the fastest growth coming from France, Sweden, Spain and
Italy.
France reinforced its position as Britain's third biggest export market with
sales growing by more than 20 per cent to Pounds 90.4m.
Sales to Sweden increased by 30 per cent to more than Pounds 62m, largely as
a result of the shrinking domestic manufacturing base and the strong
traditional trading links with the UK, said AKT.
Spain moved from tenth place to sixth as sales jumped 45 per cent to Pounds
53m. The improvement continues a long trend - in 1988 sales to Spain were
worth less than Pounds 7m.
A weak dollar was one of the factors behind a 14 per cent fall in clothing
sales to the US, but the value of goods going to the former Soviet Union
rose from a negligible level to Pounds 13m.
Hong Kong remained the biggest supplier of clothes to the UK, in spite of a
fall of 7.2 per cent to Pounds 341m.
This was partly offset by imports from lower-cost Far Eastern countries  -
especially China (up 39 per cent), Indonesia (up 27 per cent) and Malaysia
(up 30 per cent).
Within the European Community, Portugal was the biggest supplier to the UK,
second only to Hong Kong overall with sales of almost Pounds 112m, up 2.2
per cent.
Textile exports grew by a more modest 6 per cent.
The fastest growing market was the Netherlands, where sales grew by half to
Pounds 147m. This figure was distorted by the establishment in the
Netherlands of a new distribution centre for an artificial fibres
manufacturer.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Tube staff may face tests for drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF London Underground staff face random tests for drugs and
alcohol abuse if discussions between rail unions and the railway can
establish a cost-effective procedure for testing.
Under legislation due to come into effect next month, London Underground has
a responsibility to take measures to ensure that staff holding a range of
jobs crucial to safety, such as train drivers, are fit for duty and not
under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The law will give the police the
power to test safety-critical staff who they believe are behaving
erratically or who have been involved in a dangerous or potentially
dangerous incident.
London Underground be-lieves unannounced checks on staff whose names would
be drawn at random, or on staff at specific locations, is the fairest
testing system. The management would like to see the procedure include staff
who are not specified by the law, such as lift and escalator operators, who
it believes are equally crucial to safety.
London Underground said it was sure there was no widespread problem 'but
obviously we want to make sure there is not going to be one'.
An obstacle to random testing is the cost of arranging cover for those
called in to take them.
The unions are not opposed to the principle of testing, but they do not
believe the system is necessary for London Underground to meet its legal
obligation. They say that British Rail, which will be bound by the same
legislation, is not considering random testing.
The unions want safeguards against abuse by managers who, they argue, might
use tests to penalise staff. They would also like to see the tests
introduced alongside preventative and educational programmes.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Teething problems to be cleared this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG HELLO: the teething troubles of Europe's longest escalators, which
opened last week at the Angel underground station in north London, should be
cured this week, Bethan Hutton writes.
The station has been closed since Friday because of continuing trouble with
the three 60-metre escalators, made in France, which started operating last
Wednesday. The much-publicised new machinery ground to a halt after two days
as large numbers of passengers tried to use the escalators.
Tests at the weekend traced the problem to the control electronics, rather
than the power supply which was originally suspected.
Different technical problems which delayed the opening of the escalators
from Monday to Wednesday last week have already been solved. London
Underground said yesterday the escalators could be back in operation as
early as today.
Passengers, who had to use an emergency bus service, may be entitled to
refunds under the Passenger's Charter.
The escalators were installed as part of a Pounds 70m reconstruction
programme, started in 1989, due to be completed in March with the opening of
a south-bound platform.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Timeshare buyers win right to cancel in cool-off period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMESHARE BUYERS will soon have the right to cancel their transactions and
claim back advance payments, Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister,
said yesterday.
The right to withdraw from a timeshare transaction within 14 days will apply
from October 12 and follows many complaints of misleading advertising and
high-pressure selling. The rule change also provides for cancelling credit
agreements. The right, contained in the Timeshare Act, will not apply where
the agreement is concluded outside the UK. The European Commission has said,
however, that it intends to issue a directive covering timeshare throughout
the EC.
The act has been criticised by the Timeshare Council for not going far
enough. The council, which represents timeshare owners and sellers, says it
wants to see better protection for purchasers' money through the use of
escrow accounts; the compulsory provision of full prospectuses to buyers;
and provisions to ensure that buyers acquire their timeshare free of
encumbrances such as pre-existing mortgages. The council also says that only
25 per cent of British purchasers buy timeshare in the UK so the majority
will not be protected by the changes.
Last month the Office of Fair Trading revoked the consumer credit licences
of six companies associated with Club Riviera, one of the UK's leading
timeshare groups. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said a stream of
complaints against the companies had suggested that their conduct had been
'seriously misleading and deceptive'.
From October 12 a timeshare seller must provide a buyer with a notice
setting out the right to cancel and a blank cancellation form before the
agreement is signed. If the buyer is not given the notice or form, the right
to cancel extends indefinitely or until the buyer takes action that can be
construed as acceptance.
Failure by the seller to comply with the act could result in fines of up to
Pounds 5,000 on summary conviction or an un-limited amount on indictment.
Baroness Denton said she intended to use the UK's EC presidency to make
progress on the European directive.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Observer: Tragedy of the opera
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to international soap operas it it hard to beat the goings on
at the world's leading opera houses. Whilst everyone is waiting for the
final act in Covent Garden's Jeremy Isaacs drama, opera-lovers should not
miss an interesting divertissement in Paris.
The hero, or villain, depending on one's taste, is Pierre Berge, alias
Pierre la Panthere, president of L'Opera de Paris. He's having a horrible
summer. First, a set collapsed killing a member of the chorus and injuring
30 others. Then Philippe Belaval, his director general, and three of his
supporting cast, walked out after firing a highly critical broadside at
Berges management style.
Now the the premiere of Arthur Honneger's Jeanne au Bucher, has had to be
postponed because 20 of the chorus have still not recovered from the Seville
tragedy. As if he did not have enough problems, Berge, who doubles up as
president of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, is also under attack for
spending too much money trying to launch the career of his young friend,
Robert Merloz, as a fashion designer.
However, Berges future may still be brighter than that of Jeremy Isaacs. For
a start he is the best of friends with Jack Lang, the flamboyant French arts
minister. They have even bought a wooden datcha together outside Paris.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Justice for the Moslems
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major returned to London last night, having interrupted his holiday
for talks with senior cabinet colleagues on the Bosnian crisis. In so doing,
he inevitably raises expectations that Britain, as president of the EC, is
about to take a more decisive lead in dealing with that crisis. If those
expectations were to be disappointed, the prime minister would have been
much better advised to stay in Spain. So far, Britain's main contribution
has been to call a new, larger peace conference in London next week, whose
main purpose seems to be to dilute the responsibility for failure, allowing
the EC to lean on the UN. There is certainly plenty of failure to share
responsibility for. The republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, to which the EC
solemnly accorded recognition in April, has all but ceased to exist: its
government retains control only of a tiny area of territory around the
capital, and a few other isolated pockets. Well over a quarter of its
inhabitants have been driven from their homes.
Effectively the republic has been partitioned, with the lion's share of the
territory going to the Serbs, who make up only a third of the population but
are much more heavily armed, thanks to the support of the rump of the
Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) stationed in Bosnia. Aiming to be sole masters
of the territory in which they live, they have not scrupled to expel its
other inhabitants, most of them Moslems, by the most brutal methods,
endowing the vocabulary of war with a new and horrible euphemism: 'ethnic
cleansing'.
The international community needs now to face up to the magnitude of its
failure, rather than hair-splitting over the logistics of humanitarian
relief. It must consider how far the consequences are reversible, and how
far they form an inescapable if unpalatable reality on which any future
arrangements must be built.
Unitary state
The most unpalatable but also most inescapable consequence is that the
demographic status quo ante cannot be restored. Even if all the atrocities
had been committed by one side, it would be unrealistic to expect the
victims and the perpetrators to live peacefully intermingled in towns and
villages as they did before. For a long time to come most Bosnians will feel
safe only among members of their own community, whether Moslem, Serb, or
Croat. Everyone should have the right to return to his or her home, but many
in practice will not do so.
That being so, the Moslems will do themselves no good by continuing to
insist on a unitary state. However much they may regret agreeing to the EC's
'March 18 principles', under which Bosnia-Hercegovina was to become an
independent state with three 'constituent units', they must know that is the
only imaginable solution. What is clearly unacceptable is for the Serbs to
retain anything like the proportion of territory they control, and for the
Moslems to be confined to the miserable remnant the government has held on
to, or to be exiled permanently from the republic. The offer by the Bosnian
Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to reduce the territory he holds from the
claimed 70 per cent to 64 per cent, is outrageous and insulting.
Significant quantities
While the international community cannot put Bosnia-Hercegovina together
again as it was before the war, it can insist that the Moslems be allowed a
'constituent unit' roughly proportionate to the size of their community - 43
per cent of the population. Mr Karadzic has been able to seize the territory
he holds in the teeth of international condemnation and in spite of
sanctions applied to Serbia, from or through which his supply lines run.
Those sanctions should not be relaxed until the Serbs agree to relinquish
significant quantities of the territory they control. So Britain must take
the lead in advocating extreme firmness towards Serbia, while giving every
possible support to the Moslems in their hour of agony. It may be necessary
to send troops to protect them in the enclaves where they are now confined,
with the supply lines essential to their survival - and later to help them
defend their expanded territorial unit. But above all the Serbs must be kept
under maximum international pressure until they agree to negotiate a
reasonable territorial and constitutional settlement.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Personal View: Clintonomics, a clear sense of deja vu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN ROACH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Governor Bill Clinton's economic plan, Putting People First, is a
comprehensive proposal for a significant shift in economic policy in the US.
The programme is not lacking in details, nor is it timid. But will it work?
Over the next four years, Clinton has proposed a total of Dollars 514bn
(Pounds 267bn) in changes on the revenue and spending sides of the federal
budget, combined. Of that amount, a little more than 40 per cent represents
new spending initiatives and slightly less than 60 per cent reflects
proposals to boost revenues. Thus, over this four-year period, the revenue
enhancers are expected to exceed the cost of new programmes by only Dollars
75bn, or a little less than Dollars 20bn a year. In a world of outsized
budget deficits, this hardly qualifies as a miraculous breakthrough. Indeed,
relative to the current estimates of the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office, the Clinton plan would result in only a 7 1/2 per cent direct
reduction of the cumulative budget deficit projected over the 1993 to 1996
period.
At the same time, Clinton's proposal claims that it will 'cut the deficit in
half' over the next four years. This result rests on the critical premise
that the plan will boost economic growth sufficiently to provide a large
windfall of incremental revenue. Clinton offers two possible growth paths,
each with a set of deficit projections. In the 'moderate growth' scenario
(presumably about 3 per cent real GDP growth), the deficit is estimated to
be Dollars 141bn in 1996 - about 25 per cent below current estimates. Only
under the 'strong growth' scenario (probably 4 to 5 per cent GDP growth)
would deficit reduction conform to Clinton's heroic aspirations of cutting
the deficit in half; in this case the deficit is estimated to be Dollars
76bn in 1996 - 60 per cent below the latest Budget Office estimates.
This arithmetic is troubling. Four years from now, only 22 per cent of
Clinton's targeted deficit reduction comes from the plan's direct effects
(that is, annual cuts of about Dollars 20bn). That means fully 78 per cent
of the presumed halving of the federal budget deficit is expected to show up
as a fiscal dividend from accelerated economic growth.
To its credit, there is far more to Clinton's plan than evaluating its
fiscal potential. Its most noteworthy attribute is to set a bold agenda for
a reordering of economic priorities. There are three broad objectives.
The first involves significant shifts in the mix of federal spending over
the next four years - changes that account for a little more than half the
total Dollars 514bn of proposed policy initiatives. The centrepiece of the
new spending initiatives is the Rebuild America Fund  - Dollars 20bn
annually dedicated to infrastructure improvements, a national information
network, environmental technologies and defence conversion. This is the
controversial aspect of the programme that most closely resembles an
'industrial policy' - complete with a new civilian research agency charged
with funding support for a list of critical technologies.
Clinton's plan attempts to pay for these initiatives with a detailed
schedule of spending reductions - focusing particularly on defence, where
outlays have already been slashed. Indeed defence reductions account for
about 40 per cent of all spending cuts proposed over the next four years.
The balance of the proposed spending reductions runs the gamut from
administrative savings and federal employment cuts to the ending of
subsidies to honey producers. In short, the plan is not without its fair
share of seemingly dubious proposals for trimming spending.
A second objective pertains to income distribution - changes in the tax code
that account for about 33 per cent of the entire Dollars 514bn four-year
package. The plan is quite clear as to who foots the bill. It calls for
Dollars 22bn in middle-income tax cuts - countered by Dollars 92bn in
upper-income tax increases and another Dollars 58bn in corporate tax rises,
with the latter largely attained through closing loopholes on foreign
business taxes. All in all, over the next four years, the revenue gained
from proposed tax increases is likely to outweigh that lost from tax cuts by
a factor of about 6 1/2 to one. A third objective is human capital
enhancement, highlighted by a variety of educational reform proposals.
This summary hardly does the plan full justice. In addition, the Clinton
proposal also gives considerable emphasis to a variety of measures directed
at the pressing problems of healthcare reform, foreign trade frictions,
crime, urban decay and a bloated governmental bureaucracy. While few stones
are left unturned, the question is: how does the plan stack up against the
macro imperatives facing the US economy?
Its strengths lie in the powerful growth initiatives aimed at capital
formation. Incentives for business capital spending are provided by the
combination of a targeted investment tax credit, a permanent research and
development tax credit, and a capital gains tax cut for small company
start-ups. The programme also offers strong incentives for two other
neglected areas - infrastructure and human capital. In my view, reversing
course after a decade of anaemic capital formation is critical - especially
in sustaining the productivity increases essential for improving America's
standard of living.
Clinton's proposal, however, is not without its weaknesses. The most glaring
is the credibility of the so-called deficit-reduction plan. Certainly, the
last thing America needs is an even wider budget deficit. Moreover, the
programme fails to provide a more concrete assessment of the great jobs
issue of the 1990s. Much is said about creating 'millions of high-wage jobs'
but little is said about who will do the hiring.
Do the strengths of the plan outweigh its weaknesses? Sadly, the answer is
probably no. Despite the programme's appreciation of the imperatives of
capital formation and productivity enhancement, the lack of a credible
strategy of deficit reduction is most disturbing. The fiscal quagmire of the
1980s was Washington's gravest economic policy blunder of the post-second
world war era - sapping the vitality of a savings-short economy through a
quantum leap in real interest rates. And yet the rhetoric of deficit
reduction under Clintonomics smacks clearly of deja vu. America can ill
afford to ignore the painful legacy of the past 12 years - namely, that
growth incentives will be forever undermined by a nation struggling against
the headwind of high real interest rates. Unfortunately, that is the
critical lesson the governor has failed to appreciate.

<TEXT>
THE discombobulating sounds of Brazil are in residency at Ronnie Scott's
club in the shape of husband and wife team Airto Moreira and Flora Purim. It
seems a curious choice for the long silly season slot, being far from
mainstream and quite unconventional in line-up. As usual, Airto dances
behind a flea market stall of hanging percussion, darting from Amazonian
shakers to conventional bass drum and cymbal. Flora, fronting the ensemble,
warbles in a seductively flat, Latin way.
The group is unusual in that it uses no bass but a powerfully strummed and
thrumming electric guitar (Jose Neto) and the various saxophones, flute and
keyboards of talented multi-instrumentalist Gary Meek. Daughter Diana
Moreira helps out on shakers in the background. The sultry sound which
results, however, turns out to be wholly appropriate for steaming August
nights.
Moreira and Purim, based in Los Angeles since the late Sixties, are an
interesting couple. Both just 50, they came to notice with Miles Davis and
later Chick Corea. One of the first Latin 'percussionists', to work in a
modern jazz context, Moreira along with Nana Vasconcelos, has defined a role
for up-front, exotic and often complicated rhythm.
On opening night, the younger Meek and Neto worked hardest at songs which
were a mix of new originals and re-workings from Moreira and Purim's time
with pianist Chick Corea. As Purim delivered a light Latin vocalise and her
partner worked up a froth of rhythm, Meek blasted off from behind the
keyboard with swinging soprano or abrasive alto.
Neto, meanwhile, tested the tensile strength of strings against cuticles
with a series of vigorous Latin riffs. Moreira can do as much with a
tambourine as others might with a synthesiser.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Upwardly mobile duo - Edinburgh International Festival
/ Patricia Morison visits exhibitions on the works of Robert Adam and Allan
Ramsay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS summer, Edinburgh commemorates two Scottish geniuses of the 18th
Century: Robert Adam, who set out to be the greatest architect of his age
and arguably achieved his goal, and the society portraitist Allan Ramsay.
Such a monumental egomaniac as Adam would surely be pained to find that the
bicentenary of his death is being modestly marked by three small
exhibitions, only one of which - albeit the best - will travel to London.
A mildly interesting show, Robert Adam and Scotland, has been mounted by the
Scottish Record Office in the dome of the General Register House in Princes
Street (until September 25). This is the most prominent of the city's
buildings by 'Bob the Roman', as he called himself, and as such is well
worth the visit. Nothing like so clear a case can be made for an
over-designed and pretentious photographic show at the Royal Incorporation
of Architects in Scotland (until September 17).
Which leaves Monumental Reputation: Robert Adam and the Emperor's Palace
(details below). This is a jewel of an exhibition. Admirably focused and put
together with intelligence and wit, it is crammed with drawings, books,
paintings and memorabilia. Ramsay's portrait of his young friend, Robert
Adam, is one highlight, together with intaglio seals depicting Inigo Jones
and Palladio which were used by the Adam family. Iain Gordon Brown's
accompanying book (bargain of the Festival at Pounds 3.50) paints an
unforgettable picture of Adam's genius for self-promotion.
Residing in Rome on his Grand Tour, in 1757 Adam decided to produce an
expensive archaeological book of the kind much in vogue. Emperor
Diocletian's 3rd-Century palace in present-day Croatia, offered an exotic
yet cheap location. The show's centrepiece is a vast model loaned from a
Roman museum, and a helpful slide-show explains the influence of the palace
on Adam's subsequent work.
Edward Gibbon was right: elegance did triumph over accuracy. Adam was also
guilty of presenting the book as all his own work when in reality it was a
team-effort. However, examination of the set of proof plates recently bought
by the Library has shown that Charles-Louis Clerisseau, Adam's
long-suffering assistant, managed to smuggle his name on to a sarcophagus.
Since the 1950s, Ramsay has been reinstated to first rank of British
18th-Century artists. Nearly 100 paintings and drawings, many still in
private collections, make Allan Ramsay, 1713-84, a dauntingly large show. It
will migrate from the Scottish National Portrait Gallery to London this
winter.
'Mumpy' (Scots for grumpy) was Adam's nickname for Allan Ramsay, his friend
during their time together in Rome. Not that Ramsay had much to grumble
about. In six months before departing on this second Grand Tour, he had
produced no less than 40 portraits. He became court painter to George III,
albeit challenged latterly by Cotes and Zoffany.
The fashionable world flocked to Ramsay as a portraitist abreast of the
latest trends in Continental painting, especially French portraiture. He was
notably good at graceful images of even plain women, Queen Charlotte being a
case in point. As Walpole observed, Ramsay was 'all delicacy' compared with
Reynolds's boldness and tempestuous colouring.
It is a fair comment, and the effect of so many half-length society ladies
in pink, white, and sky-blue, is rather cloying. Against them can be set
Ramsay's most famous portraits, the informal images of Rousseau in Armenian
costume, David Hume, Adam's second wife, Margaret, and his own black-jowled
self-portrait.
The semi-eclipse of his reputation came about partly because many paintings
remained inaccessible in palaces and country houses. Partly, too, it was
because he gave up painting in 1773 after he fell off a ladder and broke his
arm while demonstrating how easy it would be to get out of the house if
there was a fire.
The last decade of his life was spent enjoying his substantial earnings and
writing essays. Ramsay was no mean intellectual and wrote on architecture,
poetry, politics, and foreign policy - a hawk, he urged a war of
annihilation against the Americans.
That Ramsay can now be seen in the round is due to the researches of
Professor Alastair Smart, also responsible for this memorable exhibition.
His book, Allan Ramsay, Painter, Essayist and Man of the Enlightenment (Yale
University Press, 316pp, Pounds 45) is a well-written, fascinating study
which brings Ramsay's world vividly to life. The quality of the colour
plates does him no favours.
In the exhibition, Professor Smart's long and impassioned advocacy of Ramsay
is reflected in labels bossily insistent on the paintings' merits. More
could have been said about Ramsay's workshop, influences, technique and,
crucially, what he meant by 'the natural portrait'.
But these are quibbles about what is a rewarding exhibition, the more so if
you can catch it on home ground, almost in sight of Ramsay's famous
'Goose-Pie' house and his property developments up on Castle Hill.
Cut-throat though the competition was, here is the proof that rewards were
high for the upwardly mobile Scottish genius.

Library of Scotland to September 30.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Twilight of the Wagner family? - Andrew Clark
considers the future role, if any, of the Wagner family in running the
Bayreuth Festival, and details the squabble over the succession to Wolfgang
Wagner as director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THERE a future for the Wagner family at Bayreuth? An improbable question,
you might say, considering the two have been synonymous for more than a
century. But while the composer himself is always likely to remain the
centrepiece of the festival he founded, the role to be played by his
descendants is suddenly being called into question.
The German press this summer has given extensive coverage to a series of
personal attacks on Wolfgang Wagner - long-established festival director and
grandson of the composer - emanating from the next generation of the family,
none of whom Wolfgang has allowed to work at the Festspielhaus.
Rifts and quarrels within the Wagner family are nothing new, and discussion
about a successor to Wolfgang - who turns 73 at the end of this month - has
been simmering for some years. But this is the first time younger members of
the family have launched a concerted public campaign against Wolfgang and
his style of management. They feel shut out.
Wolfgang is portrayed as a greedy old tyrant under whom the festival has
lost its creative energy and fallen prey to commercial pressures. The
implication is that it is time he made way for new blood. Several of the
composer's 12 great-grandchildren are nearing 50. They are becoming
impatient.
Wolfgang, who has unwavering support from artists and most of the festival
public, says there is no dynastic 'right of succession'. The family name
alone is no longer sufficient qualification to manage a large and complex
operation such as the Bayreuth Festival. Members of the next generation must
prove their ability elsewhere first - something he believes they have failed
to do.
Wolfgang says: 'And 'To bring in as a colleague anyone who so vehemently
criticises me and my work would poison the atmosphere for all who work
here.'
Bayreuth-watchers say it is increasingly likely that when Wolfgang goes,
someone from outside the family will take over. When Wolfgang and his elder
brother Wieland resurrected the festival from its post-war ruins in 1951,
they made a clean break with its Nazi past. Wieland was the artistic genius,
but Wolfgang's practical management skills ensured that the festival had the
wherewithal to thrive.
Since Wieland's premature death in 1966, Wolfgang has run the festival
single-handed, opening it to a broad range of nationalities and styles,
laying the groundwork for its long- term survival.
In 1973 he and his mother Winifred established the Richard Wagner Foundation
 -consisting largely of representatives of public funding bodies - with the
aim of preserving the festival's independence and protecting it from family
in-fighting. All festival property now belongs to the foundation, in which
the Wagner family has a minority vote.
Under the rules of the foundation, when the post of festival director falls
vacant, a successor must first be sought from within the family. If the
family cannot agree by majority decision on a candidate within four months,
or if 'other more suitable candidates should present themselves', the
foundation will consult a three-member commission chosen from the general
administrators of the six main German-language opera houses.
Whoever is appointed (probably on a fixed-term contract) will have overall
responsibility for the festival, but considerably less power than Wolfgang.
There is no doubt that the festival draws much of its character from the
presence of a member of the Wagner family at its centre. Wolfgang is steeped
in Bayreuth tradition, he knows his grandfather's works inside out and he
has a knack of discovering new talent. His avuncular presence pervades the
Festspielhaus at all times. He wants to do all he can to ensure that his
life's work is not destroyed by an irresponsible successor.
In private, Wolfgang does not seem bitter towards the next generation: he
simply feels they have not grasped what running the festival entails.
Wolf-Siegfried Wagner, Wieland's 49-year old son and a sharp critic of
Wolfgang's production style, claims it is his birthright to work at
Bayreuth, but has made little headway in his own career as an independent
stage director.
His 47-year old sister Nike alleges Wolfgang has barred her from consulting
festival archives for a book she is writing on its postwar history, and says
Bayreuth should widen its remit to include musical experiments, 'ideological
debate' and the works of 20th century composers like Schoenberg and Henze.
Gottfried Wagner, Wolfgang's 45-year old son, has accused him of employing
Jewish conductors like Daniel Barenboim and James Levine in order to draw a
veil over the festival's anti-semitic past.
Banned by his father from entering the Festspielhaus for the past two years,
Gottfried gives lectures on Bayreuth's Nazi history, and has been quoted as
saying the music of Meyerbeer and other Jews vilified by Wagner should be
performed at Bayreuth.
Notable for her silence is Wolfgang's 47-year old daughter Eva, who
currently holds a senior management post at the Opera Bastille in Paris.
Members of the festival's Friends Organisation see her as the sole hope for
the family succession. But she and her father barely communicate -
apparently because of the influence exerted by Wolfgang's 48-year old second
wife Gudrun, who arrived as an employee in the press office in the 1960s and
now plays a key role in festival administration.
Eva worked in the Festspielhaus when she was younger, but left soon after
Wolfgang married Gudrun. 'Secretly Wolfgang probably wants Eva to succeed
him,' observes one Bayreuth insider, 'but showing favouritism would create
hell at home. Gudrun has never been accepted by the family, they feel
usurped by her. She's hard-working and ambitious, and probably fuels his
animosity towards them. As long as he reigns, the queen will be queen.'
Wolfgang's refusal to do anything to influence the succession means there
will be a huge upheaval and power struggle when he goes. The quickest
solution would be for the foundation to appoint Eva - who would probably
bring in a part-time artistic director (as Winifred Wagner did in the 1930s)
and try to ride out family jealousies.
Alternatively, to maintain short-term continuity, the foundation could opt
for an uncontroversial outsider to work in harness with Gudrun: with Cosima
Wagner and Winifred to look back on, the festival has a history of young
wives inheriting the mantle of power. Or the Wagnerian decks could be
cleared altogether and the festival put in the hands of an experienced
German opera intendant.
But that is pure speculation. Wolfgang is too wily and popular to have
anything to fear from the younger generation. He is in good health and is
busy supervising production plans for the next two summers. He likes to
quote Fafner's words from The Ring, 'Ich lieg und besitz' (I'll keep what I
hold). For the time being, Bayreuth's detractors and the German press are
simply enjoying another chapter in the long-running Wagner family soap
opera.

FT  18 AUG 92 / People: Lucas recruits from customer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the Midlands-based motor and aerospace components
manufacturer, has found a senior executive from its biggest customer, Ford,
to fill the finance director spot left vacant when David Hankinson resigned
unexpectedly in March.
Belfast-born John Grant, who joined the US motor giant in 1967, has worked
his way up through the treasury side of Ford in both Europe and the US,
becoming treasurer of Ford Europe in 1985. Later appointed executive
director of corporate strategy of Ford based in Detroit, he had been a key
player in the acquisition of Jaguar in 1990, and hence was drafted in, as
deputy chairman and number two to Bill Hayden, by Ford after the purchase.
With his planning and finance background, his job was to map out a fresh
business plan for the luxury car-maker that fitted in with the style and
expanded resources of the new parent.
While some saw him as the heir-apparent to Hayden, who retired in the
spring, he clearly did not have the strong engineering and manufacturing
background - the areas Ford had identified as priorities for attention at
Jaguar.
After the appointment of Nick Scheele to the top job, Grant stayed on in the
UK with a 'special assignment' to Jaguar Sport for a few months. By the time
his next assignment emerged, executive director of international financing
at Ford Financial Services Group, Lucas had already made the approach -
although Grant still took up the Detroit job before the Lucas offer was
finalised.
Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas chairman, believes 46-year-old Grant, with his auto
industry and international financial experience, will complement well the
skills of Tony Edwards, 47, the former head of the aerospace division, who
is now group managing director and chief executive designate. Grant's
predecessor, Hankinson, also came from a car manufacturer - in his case
Rover.
Grant joins at the beginning of September, about six weeks before Lucas,
which has been hard hit by the recession, unveils its results for the year
to July 1992.
*****
Barry Gibbons has taken another step towards GRAND METROPOLITAN's boardroom
with his appointment as chairman of Burger King.
Gibbons, 46, former chairman and managing director of GrandMet Retailing,
was sent out to Florida from the UK as chief executive of Burger King to
mastermind the restructuring of the US fast food chain soon after it came
into the group with the 1989 Pillsbury acquisition.
'He has achieved an exceptional record of accomplishments in management and
improved profitability,' said Ian Martin, GrandMet's chief operating
officer, whom Gibbons succeeds as head of Burger King.
Gibbons, already a member of GrandMet's group operations committee which
deals with development policy and strategy, will now function 'as Burger
King's link to GrandMet,' Martin added.
At the same time, James Adamson, president of Burger King's US retail arm,
has been promoted to the new post of chief operating officer, worldwide.
Adamson, 44, who has overseen improvements in service, marketing, and
profitability in the company-owned US outlets, will be responsible for
operational standards of the business throughout the world.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of passengers could face further disruption on British Airways
domestic and European flights as a result of the dispute with cabin crew
members of the TGWU general union.
The crews will today consider another one-day strike over new terms and
conditions. BA has made what it describes as a final offer and warned that
if cabin crew staff take action they could be suspended.
The dispute is over compensation for new terms and conditions under which
about 1,000 staff face pay cuts of Pounds 2,000, on salaries of Pounds
14,000 a year. Next year crews will receive pay rises only if inflation is
above 4 per cent.
BA says its improved compensation package is worth almost Pounds 1,500.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Return to apprentice system supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of companies in north-east England would like to see a return to
apprenticeship-style training, a survey for Tyneside Training and Enterprise
Council has found, Lisa Wood writes.
A study by North Tyneside Brass Tacks, a provider of training to the Tec,
says that 59 per cent of the 300 companies questioned were in favour of
returning to job-specific and time-served training.
Critics of the old apprentice system claim it was rigid and nurtured
prejudices about skills and how they should be taught. Apprenticeships, they
said, had become too closely identified with restrictive craft practices, in
particular the strict demarcation of work.
But increasing numbers of companies are expressing interest in returning to
apprenticeships - usually lasting three years. Youth Training, the
government-funded scheme, lasts two years and many employers believe it is
impossible to get to required craft levels in this time.
Tyneside Tec, along with training providers, including the local Engineering
Training Authority, is investigating the possibility of a three-year
apprenticeship programme in which the Tec might give employers matching
funds for the third year.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Business ethics professor chosen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the UK's first professorships in corporate responsibility was filled
yesterday with the appointment of Mr Brian Harvey at Manchester Business
School.
Mr Harvey, who is reader in management studies at the University of
Nottingham, will take up the Co-operative Bank chair this autumn.
Several British institutions have laid claim to creating the first academic
position in the ethics of business, including London Business School, which
received Pounds 1m for the study of the area last month from Mr Stanley
Kalms, the founder of the Dixons electronics dealership. This position has
not yet been filled.
Mr Harvey, an economist by training, is the author of several publications
on ethical concerns in business and is a founder member and the honorary
secretary of the European Business Ethics Network.
He said: 'I am not interested in wagging a finger at business but corporate
responsibility is as important in practice for business as it is in theory
for business schools.
'The role of business is guided by the market. Where the market doesn't
work, the gap is made up by the law. But there is an area of discretion,
which is where ethics should fit in.'
He said his main priority would be to build on existing corporate
responsibility and environmental issues courses at Manchester, with an
emphasis on applied research.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Late paying still plagues businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY A quarter of invoices are still unpaid a month after they are due in
spite of campaigns by business organisations against late payment, according
to Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance company.
A survey by the company found that smaller businesses were particularly
badly affected by late payment.
It found that in the April-June quarter, companies received payments an
average of 26 days after the due date. That was down one day from the
previous quarter's figure but was still a cause for concern, said Mr Clive
Brand, Trade Indemnity's senior economist. Payment terms are commonly 30
days.
Of companies that exported regularly - 232 out of the 718 replying to the
survey - getting payment from overseas customers appeared to be even more
difficult than from domestic businesses. The average payment period stands
at 28 days beyond the due date, a slight worsening since the last quarter.
Mr Brand said that action was required throughout industry to encourage
prompt payment of accounts. He added: 'Companies are being forced to delay
payments to their suppliers due to delays in receipt of payments from their
own customers. One late payment has repercussions throughout the entire
length of the payments chain.'
The Confederation of British Industry and small business organisations have
been campaigning for a tightening up of the rules on late payments and bad
debts. A CBI survey last year found that nearly 20 per cent of small
businesses were at risk because of the problem.
Steel stockholders and textile distributors are the sectors suffering from
the highest proportions of late payments, according to Trade Indemnity's
study - 34 per cent and 30 per cent respectively of their invoices were
outstanding for more than 30 days beyond the due date. Overall, 10 per cent
of companies had more than half of invoices unpaid for at least 30 days.
Companies with a turnover of less than Pounds 1m typically had 27 per cent
of their invoices outstanding after 30 days. That compared with an average
of 13 per cent for companies of Pounds 50m-plus turnover.
A quarter of companies have been updating their overdue accounts procedures,
21 per cent are taking extra steps to verify creditworthiness, while 17 per
cent have changed their debt collection methods.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Working within flawed walls: Stumbling blocks that face
diagnosis and action on sick building syndrome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST JOHN'S HOUSE in Bootle on Merseyside is reputed to be a sick building.
Since the early 1980s, almost half of the civil servants who work there,
mainly for the Inland Revenue, have experienced the flu-like symptoms of the
so-called sick building syndrome.
Sick building syndrome is an elusive illness. It is difficult to diagnose,
harder to pinpoint causes and few employers will admit to the problem for
fear of bad publicity or being forced to make costly refurbishments.
Mr David Rogan, a lay official for the Revenue's staff federation at St
John's House, who works in the building, says he has suffered mildly. 'It is
depressing. You have not only your normal workload, you have the fact that
the building is making you feel ill or not up to par. For the people who
suffer badly it's like having a persistent headcold.'
The government is just one of many employers which have found that even the
most pristine, modern office block can appear to be a health hazard. The
World Health Organisation estimates that the syndrome affects a third of
European and North American offices. The Commons environment committee put
the annual cost to the UK economy at between Pounds 330m and more than
Pounds 650m in absenteeism.
Yet the Health and Safety Executive said this month that 20 years of
research had failed to establish the precise cause or cure for the
condition.
At St John's House many of the 2,000 staff began complaining of sore
throats, dry eyes, headaches and coughs in 1981 as soon as they moved there.
They said the symptoms came on at work and their families seemed immune.
They blamed the building.
Mr Rogan said: 'People would arrive in the morning feeling fine and by late
afternoon feel so bad they would have to go home or take a break outside.'
The management initially dismissed numerous complaints as resentment at the
move or stress from the upheaval. But a 1988 staff survey found that more
than 40 per cent of employees regularly went home early because of
discomfort. The report said St John's House had the characteristics of a
'sick building'.
In the 1960s the government had decided to computerise the Inland Revenue
records and St John's House was built, but a 1971 dispute between the
government and contractors which began after the main structure was complete
meant the offices remained empty until 1981.
This year Property Holdings, the government's building managers, received
Treasury approval for an overhaul of the air-conditioning system, new
fixtures, fittings and some structural alterations that will cost about
Pounds 20m over the next three financial years. Property Holdings stresses
that the works will address several problems bedevilling such offices, not
just sick building syndrome.
While it is hard to find a company that will admit to a sick building, there
are some celebrated examples. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency
was called in to investigate a mysterious illness affecting 70 staff at its
own headquarters.
In 1984 the Public Records Office in Kew, west London, was closed for about
four months for an overhaul after the syndrome was diagnosed.
Dr Leslie Hawkins, director of the occupational health service at Surrey
University's Robens Institute and an authority on the syndrome, said the
label 'sick building syndrome' was often misused.
'Sometimes we are called in where 10 or 15 per cent of staff complain of
headaches. That's no different to what the population as a whole suffers,'
he said.
He believes that where a higher-than-normal proportion of staff report
symptoms ranging from irritated eyes, noses, and throats to menstrual
disorders, and where those symptoms are triggered by office work, it is
likely that the building is sick.
Difficulties with diagnosis are outstripped by the problems of determining
causes. The HSE's 121-page review of recent research concluded that while
the sources of the individual symptoms are likely to indicate the sources of
the syndrome itself, the field of possible causes is still wide.
The most popular theory is poor air quality or some as-yet-undiscovered
pollutant. Researchers have also examined noise, artificial lighting, static
electricity and electromagnetic fields.
The HSE found that, in general, cheaply constructed buildings with poorer
air-conditioning systems, especially public-sector buildings built in the
1970s, have had more difficulties than others.
One cause favoured by some employers is that the symptoms are dreamt up by
the 'sufferers'. They say the syndrome is more common among women, those
doing boring or low-paid jobs and those with allergies.
The HSE report argues there is little to show the syndrome is psychological.
But it says psychological factors can produce a snowball effect on reporting
of symptoms once perceptions of an office change.
Dr Hawkins believes stress is an important factor. He said: 'I have seen
cases where it is not the building that is the problem, but what goes on
inside it.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / Kevin Maxwell hearing adjourned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kevin Maxwell yesterday succeeded in staving off immediate bankruptcy.
After a 75-minute private hearing in the High Court a petition by the
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management seeking an immediate
bankruptcy order against him was adjourned to September 1.
The adjournment means that Mr Maxwell will have two court appointments on
the same day: he, his brother Ian and Mr Larry Trachtenberg are due to make
their second appearance at the City of London Magistrates Court on fraud and
theft charges on that date.
After yesterday's hearing Mr Maxwell read a prepared statement. He said the
liquidators' petition had not been heard and the court had listed September
1 'to hear the grounds for my opposition to their expedited petition'.
He continued: 'To the best of my understanding an expedited petition is only
heard when there is a serious possibility that assets will be dissipated
pending the hearing. This is utterly misconceived in my case. No assets have
been dissipated or will be dissipated.
'I have and will always conduct myself in compliance with court orders and
for the benefit of all my creditors. I am pleased the court's decision today
has given me this opportunity to publicly state my views.'
On July 20 Robson Rhodes, the liquidators of BIM from which hundreds of
millions of pounds of Maxwell empire pension funds have disappeared, were
given final judgment against Mr Kevin Maxwell. In that High Court action
they claimed Pounds 450m damages for his alleged breaches of his fiduciary
duty as a director of the company.
The court ordered Mr Maxwell to make interim payments totalling Pounds
406.8m, pending assessment of his total liability. He did not defend the
claim because, he said afterwards, he did not have the resources to do so.
Immediately after obtaining that judgment the liquidators issued a statutory
demand for payment. Normally three weeks are allowed for compliance with
such a demand but section 270 of the 1986 Insolvency Act permits the time to
be abridged and an expedited petition for bankruptcy to be issued 'if there
is a serious possibility that the debtor's property or the value of any of
his property will be significantly diminished during that period'.
It was that expedited procedure adopted by the liquidators to which Mr
Maxwell referred in his statement yesterday.
The adjournment is unlikely to prove more than a hiccup in the liquidators'
move to make Mr Maxwell Britain's biggest ever bankrupt. He would take over
the mantle from Mr William Stern, the former property millionaire made
bankrupt in 1974 for Pounds 118m.
The liquidators are expecting the High Court to rule next month on their
application for final judgment in their identical, but opposed, claim
against Mr Ian Maxwell, who was also a director of BIM.
If successful they will seek to have him made bankrupt also.

BUILDING SOCIETIES and other mortgage lenders are bracing themselves for a
fall in the number of house sales from tomorrow when the eight months'
exemption from stamp duty on house purchases of less than Pounds 250,000
comes to an end.
The exemption was introduced by the government in December as a modest
gesture to help revive the housing market. At the time the government
estimated that in the eight-month moratorium about 600,000 transactions  -
or 90 per cent of private house purchases - would not bear stamp duty.
First-time buyers purchasing an average property in the south-east were
expected to make a saving of just under Pounds 600 on their purchase. But,
in the event, the stamp duty exemption has not triggered a widespread market
recovery.
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest building society, said at the
weekend it had evidence that homebuyers were rushing to complete purchases
before stamp duty was reintroduced. Mr Richard Stapleton, managinging
director of Alliance &amp; Leicester's estate agency chain, said: 'I believe
that there is every chance that some of the sales momentum stimulated by the
reintroduction of stamp duty will continue after August 19.'
However, some other lenders are more nervous, at least in private. At the
back of their minds lurks a comparison with the rush to beat the August 1988
deadline on double mortgage-interest tax relief, which drove the housing
boom to its peak.
What is striking about the housing market in 1992, in spite of a mild boost
from the lifting of stamp duty, is the shrinkage in the property market. In
1988, the peak of the housing boom, building societies and banks between
them approved 1.5m loans and other financial institutions brought the total
to about 1.7m. Last year, according to the Council for Mortgage Lenders, the
number of new residential loans fell to just over 1m.
This year the fall in the number of house sales has marched on. In the first
half of this year, mortgage loans approved fell by 15 per cent on the same
period last year to 477,000.
This may understate the problems the market is facing. According to the
Central Statistical Office's figures, total property transactions, including
commercial as well as residential deals, dropped by 21 per cent in the same
period, from 668,000 in the first half of last year to 526,000.
The fall in the number of transactions has been much greater in London, the
south-east, the east midlands and the south-west than in other parts of the
country, although Wales has also fared badly.
According to the CSO, transactions in these regions last year fell by more
than 40 per cent on those of 1988. The two regions where the housing market
has contracted least are the west midlands and the north-west. Even there,
it has fallen by about a quarter since the days of the housing boom.
For all that, there seems to have been no fall in the number of people who
say they are likely to move. Stanliland Hall Associates' index of the number
of people who say they are likely to move stood at 105 in July, up from 102
a year ago and 100 at the beginning of the year. The trouble is that
would-be purchasers still seem to believe that it is in their interests to
postpone a move.
Two main factors restrain many people from moving. One is that many would-be
second-time or third-time buyers cannot sell up and move on because the
value of their house has fallen, perhaps wiping out all or part of the cash
they put into it, and perhaps leaving them with 'negative equity' - a
mortgage debt larger than the sale value of their house.
The other is that although houses have become cheaper and more affordable,
many potential first-time buyers are reluctant to buy a house until they are
sure that the market has started rising again.
However, there are those, such as Halifax Property Services, the estate
agency arm of Halifax Building Society, that believe they can see some
glimmers of hope.

OPPOSITION parties plan to increase the pressure on Brazilian President
Fernando Collor, whose administration is beset by allegations of corruption,
in prime-time television election broadcasts starting last night.
Mr Collor's opponents hope to score points by attacking the president and
harping on the corruption claims. The national scandal is likely to take
precedence over local issues in the nightly broadcasts. Free TV and radio
time, awarded to big parties under Brazilian electoral law, will continue at
least until the first round of municipal elections on October 3.
Cracks have also begun to appear in the Liberal Front party (PFL), the
anchor of Mr Collor's coalition support. Mr Joaquim Francisco, the PFL
governor of the northeastern state of Pernambuco, has withdrawn his backing
of the president.
The report of the congressional commission investigating the activities of
Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's campaign treasurer and the focus of the
corruption allegation, is to be completed on Saturday and presented to the
committee for approval on August 26. The report will serve as the basis for
impeachment charges against the president.
A poll by DataFolha, associated with the opposition newspaper Folha de Sao
Paulo, showed that 70 per cent of those surveyed in 11 cities want the
Congress to remove Mr Collor from office.
AP adds from Braslia; The powerful Brazilian Bar Association said yesterday
it would support impeachment of the president.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Bush set to demand curbs on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for tougher control of federal spending - especially 'entitlement'
programmes such as government health care schemes - appear likely to form a
central plank of the economic strategy President George Bush will unveil in
his acceptance speech on Thursday.
A commitment to spending restraint is regarded by Republican strategists as
advantageous for several reasons. It appears the only way to square a
daunting fiscal circle: the vocal conservative wing of the party is calling
for sweeping tax cuts in a second term, yet Mr Bush and many moderate
Republicans are anxious to reduce the record fiscal deficits that have
plagued his first presidency.
In theory sufficient restraint of spending could allow both goals to be met
simultaneously.
A clamp on spending would also highlight philosophical differences between
the Republican and Democratic parties. Governor Bill Clinton is proposing to
increase public investment spending by Dollars 200bn (Pounds 105bn) over
four years. A credible plan to contain spending would allow Mr Bush to
portray Democratic plans as irresponsible while stressing his commitment to
a smaller, less intrusive public sector.
The pressure for tax cuts seems likely to intensify as the week progresses.
Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary and a popular figure on the right of the
party, has already called for a cut in the basic rate of tax from 15 to 12
per cent and a big increase in personal allowances.
He also wants a top income tax rate of 28 per cent and a maximum capital
gains taxes rate of 15 per cent, about half the present top rate. Neither Mr
Kemp nor the official highly conservative party 'platform' (which also
favours a revival of 1980s supply-side doctrines) makes any attempt to
quantify the cost of such measures.
Few Republicans dispute the potential appeal of tax cuts. The difficulty is
making them appear consistent with Mr Bush's other commitments - such as his
support for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Projections
published last week by the independent Congressional Budget Office indicate
that the outlook for the federal deficit is now much bleaker than most
analysts appreciate.
If the faltering economic recovery gathers momentum, the CBO expects the
deficit to decline slowly over the next couple of years, to Dollars 244bn
(3.5 per cent of GDP) in 1995. However, it will then climb again, reaching
Dollars 514bn by 2002 - or roughly the same percentage of GDP as the current
deficit (which is swollen by the bailout of bankrupt savings and loan
institutions).
The worst culprits are two of the biggest entitlement programmes - Medicare
for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. Over the next five years,
spending on these programmes is set to rise by 71 per cent and 85 per cent
respectively. Together they may absorb over 6 per cent of GDP in 2002,
compared with 3.4 per cent today.
Mr Bush has said he does not favour a cap on the biggest entitlement
programme, social security (federal pensions). But he may propose caps on
most other entitlements, including health and such smaller programmes as
veterans' benefits and farm subsidies. Such caps, which might restrain
growth of spending to inflation plus population growth, would be a logical
extension of caps placed on discretionary spending under the bipartisan
budget agreement of 1990.
Caps on entitlement spending could deliver big 'savings' but would by no
means be an election-winner for Mr Bush. CBO figures suggest there is no
room for tax cuts even if caps were implemented. And such figures make no
allowances for new spending proposals such as the Republican plan for health
care tax credits which would cost an extra Dollars 100bn over five years.
Caps on entitlements, moreover, could prove exceedingly unpopular. Mr
Clinton is believed to be planning a vigorous counter-attack if Mr Bush does
embrace such a strategy, arguing that both poor and middle-class families
could suffer if arbitrary curbs are imposed on government social programmes.
Mr Clinton argues that changes in the structure of social programmes, rather
than caps, are the way to achieve savings.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Presidential hopefuls take long view on prospects: The
Republican party's convention is a proving ground for those with ambitions
for 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOUSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER happens in November, George Bush will not be the Republican party's
presidential nominee in 1996. This makes the Houston convention something of
a proving ground for those who have eyes on the prize four years from now,
writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Houston.
The list is long - very long for a party not known for great diversity of
opinion. But it can be divided conveniently into two: those not in Houston
or, if so, not much in evidence; and those jockeying for public exposure.
In the first category, naturally, are Mr James Baker, still secretary of
state until Sunday, and Mr Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence. Reflecting
the pressure of other business, with Iraq, and the tradition that these two
cabinet positions should be reasonably above partisan politics, neither will
address the convention, although Mrs Lynn Cheney will do so in her capacity
as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
Also absent is Governor Pete Wilson of California, attending to his state's
budgetary crisis. He might, in any case, have found Houston uncomfortable,
given that he supports freedom of reproductive choice and that the party
platform is calling for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
The stakes are probably highest for those who have been given prominent
speaking roles. Chief among them are Vice-President Dan Quayle, Mr Jack
Kemp, the housing secretary, Senator Phil Gramm from Texas, and Mr Pat
Buchanan, Mr Bush's erstwhile primary challenger.
Also very much in the frame and on the podium are Mr William Bennett, the
former education secretary, Mr Lamar Alexander, who now holds the job, and
at least four governors - Mr William Weld of Massachusetts, Mr Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina, Mr Pete du Pont of Delaware and Mr Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin.
And the last may not have been heard from the Rev Pat Robertson, the
television evangelist who made a run four year ago.
Some are obviously long shots for 1996. If Mr Quayle is defeated with Mr
Bush in November he will not be a contender. Even if he wins he can expect
to be challenged, if for no other reason than he stands in the way of Mr
Baker's presumed ambitions, not to mention some others on the right.
Nevertheless, Mr Quayle will be extremely visible this week, with a dozen
public appearances and his own acceptance speech on Thursday night. He knows
he is being compared unfavourably with Senator Al Gore, Mr Bill Clinton's
running mate, but he remains popular with conservatives.
It is on the right where the battle for succession is the hottest.
Mr Buchanan, an early convention speaker last night, has expressed an
interest in 1996 but recently underwent heart surgery and has, in any case,
probably been overtaken in the outsider conservative sweepstakes by the
likes of Mr Kemp.
The housing secretary - a conservative renegade within, and frequently
semi-detached from, the Bush cabinet - had to lobby even to be given a
speaking slot at the convention.
Having won his point by threatening to stay away, he is among the most
visible in Houston, pushing the cause of a more radical tax-cutting agenda
in a second Bush term.
Mr Bennett, among the most articulate conservative critics of the president,
is putting Mr Quayle's name in nomination tomorrow night, but, in the
opinion of those who know him, will use this speech as his own springboard.
Conservatives are also becoming increasingly attracted to Mr Weld of
Massachusetts. He fails two litmus tests - he supports both abortion and gay
rights - but his uncompromising fights with his state's Democratic
legislature over taxation go down well with the right.
The 'moderate' with most to gain and lose this week is Senator Gramm, whose
keynote address tonight will probably be the most important speech he gives.
First elected to Congress as a Democrat, he was co-author of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget act of 1986 which sought, and failed, to
control government spending.
Mr Gramm has an owlish demeanour, but, with a sharp tongue, is a formidable
debater; he has this week already criticised Mr Kemp for trying to force the
president's hand on economic policy. Although he is up for re-election in
1996, Texas law allows him to contest national and state elections
simultaneously and he has a Dollars 5m-plus (Pounds 2.6m) war chest left
over from his last campaign.
Except Messrs Quayle, Baker and Cheney, and possibly Mr Buchanan, none of
the above has enjoyed great national exposure. Even Mr Kemp, visible this
year in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, is a closed book to seven out of
10 Americans, according to a recent New York Times poll.
The convention offers all a chance to make a mark, and to be better known
among the faithful at the innumerable parties that sometimes seem to be the
real business of the week.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Investment grade rating for Chile debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE yesterday became the first of Latin America's problem debtors of the
1980s to meet international standards of creditworthiness when its debt was
given an investment grade rating by a leading US credit rating agency.
The announcement yesterday that Standard and Poor's had assigned a BBB
rating to Chilean government debt came 10 years to the week after Mexico's
announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments triggered the
Latin American debt crisis.
The investment grade rating, from Standard &amp; Poor's, widens significantly
the potential group of buyers for bonds issued by the Chilean government and
its entities. Many investment institutions, particularly in the US, have
guidelines which strictly limit the amount of below-investment grade debt
that they can buy.
The rating, announced yesterday by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance
minister, ranks Chile as the safest country in Latin America for foreign
investors. It places Chile in a category of countries of low political and
economic risk for investment, ranked above Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina and
Brazil, and only slightly below the newly industrialised economies of
south-east Asia.
'The rating should significantly decrease the cost of financing foreign
investments in Chile,' Mr Foxley said. 'It should strengthen Chile's
reputation abroad as a reliable partner for trade and long-term
investments.' He forecast a big leap in foreign investment flows, which
totalled Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 576m) last year.
Chile's economy is set to expand 8 per cent this year - its ninth
consecutive year of growth - while inflation is expected to fall to around
13 per cent, from 18.7 per cent at the end of 1991.
Despite the healthy macroeconomic outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's evaluation
cautioned that greater efforts were needed to bridge the income gap between
rich and poor, and that Chile needed to improve its health and education
services and infrastructure. It also noted that exports were still too
dependent on copper.
Paradoxically, the 'investment grade' rating comes at a time when Chile is
trying to stem a flood of dollars into the country.
The dollar glut is a product of the country's trade surplus and foreign
investment flows, and has led to an appreciation of the peso.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Houston in a whirl as the party hurricane hits
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   REPUBLICANS were warned that Houston can be inhospitable
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
not politically necessarily, but climatically, write Jurek Martin and
Matthew Kaminski in Houston.
Thus it seemed a good omen that the convention dawned with, by local
standards, balmy weather, dry heat in the mid-80s, and coolish nights
perfect for the party-going which accompanies these quadrennial bashes,
regardless of political affiliation.
But it is also hurricane season and, as has been endlessly reported, in
previous years 10 hurricanes have struck the city between August 17-20, the
days spanning the convention. The weather service has discovered an ominous
tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico.
If it hits, the Republicans could find non-political chaos on their hands.
For a start Houston is a city made for motorists (actually, made only for
motorists since public transport is rudimentary). But it is the
constitutional right of every Texan, and most of the south, to drink and
drive, which means the parties have not been affected.
Not that every party is necessarily overflowing with the demon drink.
Yesterday, for example, the Reverend Pat Robertson, who sought the
Republican nomination in 1988, hosted Pat Boone, the 1950s singer turned
television evangelist, Vice-President Dan Quayle and Oliver North, of
Iran-Contra fame at a 'God and country rally.' As Garry Wills, the astute
observer of American politics, says: 'The crazies are in charge.'
More conventional good 'ole country fun is being sponsored by the National
Rifle Association - '3,000,000 strong and we vote' proclaim the three
billboards that surround the convention site. The association supports a
kind of old west ideal rather than, it seems, the violence and urban blight
to be found in economically depressed modern Houston.
Also there was Charlton Heston, the hero of many westerns, who is now the
gun lobby's pitch man, and Randy Travis, the president's favourite country
singer, who can be guaranteed to sing what Republicans hope to make the
mantra of this convention: 'Forever and ever, amen'.
Still, the Republicans are now, in the late Lee Atwater's words, the big
tent, tolerant of all sorts of opinion. This is why extra-convention dissent
has been confined to a vacant lot across the street from the Astrodome -
where signs had to be approved before coming in. Towering above them is one
of the NRA billboards.
The big tent approach, though, does make for unlikely party bedfellows. It
would perhaps be too much to expect the American Israel Political Action
Committee (AIPAC) to invite Mr Buchanan, Mr Bush's challenger in the
presidential primaries, to speak.
But the way things are going this year it is within the realm of possibility
that Planned Parenthood could invite former Senator Barry Goldwater for
lunch.
The old conservative warhorse has recently taken to warning President George
Bush that his adamant opposition to abortion could cost him the election.
After all, it is Mr Bush himself who keeps calling 1992 'this screwy
political year'.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Test for Canada's constitution industry: Pressure is growing
on politicians to decide the country's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIANS joke that the only industry prospering in their recession-battered
economy is that manned by a sizeable band of politicians, civil servants,
lawyers and academics busy trying to write a new constitution.
Over the past two years the constitution industry has produced a procession
of commissions, panels, public forums and high-level negotiations, all aimed
at holding the world's second biggest country in one piece.
To its credit the process has kept English- and French-speaking Canadians on
speaking terms, and has cooled the tempers, especially in Quebec, which
flared after two English-speaking provinces failed to ratify the Meech Lake
constitutional accord in mid-1990.
But patience with the constitutional merry-go-round is wearing thin.
Pressure is growing on all sides for the politicians to move from
consultation and negotiation to hard decisions on the country's future.
There is a good chance that some of these decisions will emerge from a
full-scale constitutional conference which opens in Ottawa today. Chaired by
Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, the conference will bring together
leaders of all 10 provinces, two Arctic territories and Canada's aboriginal
people.
Mr Mulroney has indicated that if Quebec and the rest of the country cannot
strike a deal this time, the federal government may step in with its own
compromise proposals.
These would probably be crafted to ensure approval by Quebec and would then
require the support of only six of the other nine provinces, including
Ontario, Canada's most powerful province.
Mr Mulroney is also considering a national referendum. He would gamble that
the country's eagerness to put the constitutional industry out of business
and avoid an acrimonious break-up would be strong enough to ensure
ratification.
The participation of Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, at today's
meeting is another sign that at least a partial - and perhaps only temporary
 -solution to the long-running constitutional saga is in sight. Mr Bourassa
said over the weekend that the next 10 days would be 'a crucial time' in the
long constitutional wrangle.
He has boycotted national-unity talks for the past two years, initially in
protest against the rejection of the Meech Lake accord, and more recently
for fear that another failure at the negotiating table might ignite a new
burst of separatist fervour in the francophone province.
Anger generated by the collapse of the Meech Lake agreement boosted the
separatist cause in Quebec in late 1990 and early 1991.
But a deep recession, conciliatory gestures from the rest of the country and
a skilful balancing act by Mr Bourassa have combined over the past year to
dampen enthusiasm for independence.
Pressure to strike a deal at today's meeting is compounded by the
national-unity referendum which Quebec is due to hold by the end of October.
Unless he decides to delay the vote, Mr Bourassa has, by law, less than a
month to formulate the question which will be put to voters.
The separatist Parti Quebecois is pushing for a blunt question on
sovereignty. But Mr Bourassa would prefer to campaign on a specific package
of constitutional reforms already agreed with the rest of the country.
If he returns from Ottawa without a package which he can sell to Quebec's
notoriously sceptical political establishment, the risk increases that the
separatist forces will again have the upper hand. A senior Quebec minister
hinted last week that the referendum might be delayed under such
circumstances.
Mr Claude Gauthier, executive vice-president of Crop, a Montreal opinion
polling group, says that in the last referendum campaign in 1980 - which the
separatists narrowly lost - those in favour of some form of independence
'had to prove it was the good thing to do'.
Now, says Mr Gauthier, the onus is on federalists to make their case. 'There
is much more work to do this time for the people who want Canada to stay
together,' he says.
Mr Mulroney and his officials, helped by such provinces as Ontario, New
Brunswick and British Columbia, have worked hard behind the scenes in recent
weeks to bridge the gaps between Quebec on the one hand and the hard-line
English-speaking provinces, notably Alberta, on the other.
The most divisive issue now on the table is reform of the Senate, the upper
chamber of parliament. The nine English-speaking provinces complicated Mr
Mulroney's job last month by cobbling together a pact - known as the Pearson
agreement - which would transform the all-appointed Senate into an elected
body with equal representation from each province.
Western provinces, especially Alberta, have for almost a decade pinned their
hopes on an 'equal' Senate as a way to gain more influence in Ottawa. But
the Pearson agreement sparked an uproar in Quebec. The reforms would leave
the province with only eight French-speaking senators in an 84-member
chamber, and Quebecois saw a real danger of bilingualism disappearing in one
of the houses of parliament.
Other elements in the Pearson agreement have also drawn criticism, and not
only from Quebec.
Having just negotiated a North American free trade agreement with the US and
Mexico, Mr Mulroney is pushing for a stronger commitment from all the
provinces to tear down the myriad of inter-provincial non-tariff barriers
which they have erected over the years.
Hints were being dropped in Ottawa late last week that any deal which
emerges from today's conference may end up papering over the most
intractable areas of disagreement, such as Senate reform, by putting them
off into the far-distant future.
That would leave Canada's quest for a secure identity unfulfilled - and it
would probably not be long before the constitutional bandwagon started
rolling again.

A US military team arrived in Kenya yesterday to prepare for a big airlift
of food into famine-plagued Somalia, as a top United Nations official
appealed to the Somali people to help resolve security problems impeding the
international relief effort.
The 33-member team from the US defence department arrived at the Kenyan
coastal city of Mombasa in a C-141 transport aircraft. In the next couple of
days it will set up a base for shifting 145,000 tonnes of food in Somalia,
where an estimated 1.5m people are at risk of starvation.
Aid officials have expressed surprise at the sudden speed with which the
Bush administration has reacted, stung by criticism of inadequate relief
efforts so far. The details of the airlift are still to be fleshed out,
although at least 10 military transport aircraft will fly food to Wajir, in
northern Kenya, and to unnamed destinations inside Somalia.
The US has no relief personnel in Somalia to help ensure effective food
distribution. But Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's
special envoy in Somalia, paid tribute to the US effort.

HAVING completed 42 inspections in 16 months in the effort to eliminate
Iraq's main weapons capability, the UN now is expected to continue
operations at a slower pace, but officials emphasise that a lot of work
remains to be done, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York.
Still, they appear confident that, apart from some gaps, most of the Iraqi
programmes have been identified by inspection teams sent by the disarmament
commission set up by the Security Council.
The destruction of arsenals is well advanced except in the area of chemical
weapons. Eliminating stocks of nerve agents and mustard gas, a programme due
to start next month, is expected to take at least a year. Destruction teams
are already in Iraq on a full-time basis.
As for UN monitoring to ensure that Iraq never again develops the potential
to become a serious military threat to the region, that will continue
indefinitely, officials say.
Mr Tim Trevan, the commission spokesman, hailed the latest mission as a
total success. Its report will be prepared in Bahrain and transmitted to New
York by mid-week for evaluation.

THE UN Security Council last night approved unanimously a resolution to send
observers to South Africa 'as a matter of urgency' to help calm the
situation there.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had recommended deploying 30
observers following a report 10 days ago by Mr Cyrus Vance, his special
envoy to South Africa. Several third world members felt the number was too
small and called for up to 400 observers.
However, states which will have to bear much of the cost rejected that
number and the resolution left it to Mr Boutros Ghali to deploy the team 'in
such a manner and in such numbers as he determines necessary' to do the job.
Officials said 50 observers might be a reasonable compromise.
International organisations - such as the Commonwealth, European Community
and Organisation for African Unity - were invited to deploy their own
observers in co-ordination with the UN. The exercise would be linked to the
year-old National Peace Accord.
The South African government, which readily accepted the Vance mission and
the deployment of a small number of UN observers during recent mass
demonstrations, is not expected to oppose the Council's decision.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Pakistan proposes talks on Kashmir

<TEXT>
PAKISTAN yesterday formally proposed talks with India on the Kashmir issue
under the Simla Agreement - for the first time since the agreement, laying
down terms for normalisation of relations between the two countries, was
signed 20 years ago.
The proposal, contained in a letter from Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani
prime minister, to his Indian counterpart, Mr Narasimha Rao, was delivered
by Mr Shahryar Khan, the Pakistani foreign sec-retary, on the first day of
talks between the two countries at the foreign secretary level.
Mr Khan said Pakistan hoped that India would respond positively to its
proposal for bilateral discussions on Kashmir under Article 6 of the Simla
Agreement, which states that final settlement of the dispute needs to be
discussed between the two sides.
But he stressed that the proposal should not be seen as a change in
Pakistan's policy on Kashmir, or evidence that Pakistan 'had turned its
back' on United Nations resolutions on the disputed territory.
'Pakistan does not regard the Simla Agreement and the UN resolutions as
mutually exclusive,' he said. 'It is Pakistan's considered view that the UN
Security Council resolutions calling for a plebiscite remain valid.'
An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said there was 'nothing new or
startling' about Mr Sharif's proposal. He said Mr Rao had told Mr Khan that
India would consider the proposal and convey an appropriate response.
He also said India had pointed out during the first round of talks that it
was 'not possible to isolate individual articles of the Simla Agreement,
which had to be viewed in its totality as a document'.
The foreign secretaries' talks - earlier scheduled for July and postponed by
India after an Indian diplomat was assaulted in Islamabad - are meant to
prepare the ground for a meeting between the prime ministers of the two
countries in Jakarta on September 3.
The Delhi talks are due to culminate today in the signing of a memorandum of
understanding on a code of conduct for diplomats, an agreement banning the
use of chemical weapons, an exchange of instruments of ratification and the
non-violation of each other's air space.

Mr Ramos had told reporters earlier in the day that the 11 currency
violation charges filed against Mrs Marcos had 'become moot and academic'
because of a decision this month to liberalise foreign exchange rules.
However, Mr Ramos's remarks contradicted positions taken by Central Bank
Governor Jose Cuisia, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon and government
prosecutors, who said they would appeal to the Supreme Court.

LEADERS of 10 southern African states signed a treaty yesterday creating a
development community to defuse the threat of economic competition from a
powerful post-apartheid South Africa, Reuter reports from Windhoek.
The Treaty of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was signed
at the University of Namibia by leaders from Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The new community with a population of 80m replaces the South African
Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), formed in 1980 to reduce the
dependence of South Africa's neighbours on its white-controlled economy.
At the time, the black countries accused the South Africans of waging a
regional campaign of military and economic destabilisation to bolster
apartheid.
'It is time to reduce the areas of conflict and maximise the areas of
co-operation,' Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi said before signing the
treaty yesterday.
Officials said they hoped SADC would develop into a common market with a
regional parliament.
The leaders urged Pretoria to speed the transition from white rule to
democracy, which they set as the condition for South Africa's membership of
their community.
But Mr Charles Hove, SADC chief economist, said the community hoped to
establish mechanisms for co-operation and integration before then.

FT  18 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Turks look to future with Bosporus radar -
The costs of progress have put transit charges for ships on the agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY is considering breaking with a tradition of more than half a century.
It plans to introduce charges for ships going through the Bosporus, in an
effort to defray the costs of a proposed radar system.
Such a move would represent the first change since the Montreux Convention
of 1936 established the Bosporus as an international waterway, guaranteeing
free transit between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.
In April, 10 companies, including Thompson CSF of France and the UK's GEC
Marconi, submitted bids for a turnkey supply contract for a fully automatic,
computer-supported radar system.
The project is estimated to cost Dollars 20m (Pounds 10.4m). It comprises as
many as 20 direction-finding radars, providing the Bosporus with the
equivalent of an air traffic control system.
The project has been postponed a number of times, but a contract is now
expected to be awarded in the next two months.
Turkey is bracing itself for increased traffic. For the new Black Sea
countries and central Asian states, the Bosporus offers the most direct
route to western markets.
In addition, once the network of canals in central Europe links with the
Danube over the next two years, demand to use the Bosporus is likely to
increase.
Dr Demir Sindel, professor of marine engineering at Istanbul University and
an expert on the Bosporus, says: 'If we have a good radar system we can
manage twice the volume of traffic. But we must earn money from this. At the
moment we have expenses but no income.'
The Bosporus is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, with more than
40,000 ships in transit every year, from coasters to oil and LNG tankers. In
addition, it is also one of the most difficult waterways to navigate with 12
major turns, and as little as 500 metres at the narrowest point.
There are just three passive radar units for the entire 30km length of the
Bosporus Passage. When supertankers attempt the journey, port authorities
close the Bosporus to other traffic. Despite traffic lanes, officials
calculate there are on average 10 collisions every year.
No formal request to the other Montreux signatories has been made to
introduce transit fees.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry is said to favour completely renegotiating the
treaty, given that one of the main signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer
exists.
Turkey currently charges a fee based on tonnage, if ships choose to take
pilots to direct them through the straits which divide European Turkey from
the Asian mainland, but under Montreux pilotage is not mandatory.
Officials at the Turkish Maritime Organisation (TDI) in Istanbul estimate
that more than 20,000 vessels go through every year without pilots.
Only warships have to notify the Montreux signatory countries, a key
provision for Nato members Turkey and the UK during the cold war, when the
Bosporus was an outlet to the Mediterranean for the Soviet Fleet.
Earlier this year, Turkish authorities seized the Cape Malleas, a
Greek-Cypriot ship taking arms to Iran. The public prosecutor defended the
action, arguing that Turkey was still at war with Cyprus and thus, under
Montreux, was empowered to seize the shipment, a position not supported by
an embarrassed Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara.
In practice, Turkey enjoys few other controls on the traffic. The TDI
currently uses its right to make health inspections under Montreux as a
means of regulating the frequency of ships.

July's 0.3 per cent rise compared with an increase of 0.1 per cent in June.
France still has a lower annualised rate of inflation than its main trading
partners, notably Germany with 3.3 per cent, and the US with 3.2 per cent.

British Labour party yesterday stepped up its charges that the government
had been slow off the mark in applying the United Nations trade embargo to
Serbia, using new figures on the extent of bilateral trade with Yugoslavia,
writes David Owen in London.
Referring to Customs and Excise statistics for June, the first month after
the UN resolution calling for a trade embargo, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade
and industry secretary, said that trade in a third of all types of goods had
increased in comparison with June 1991.
Examples of goods in which trade had increased included imports of iron and
steel and exports of telecommunications equipment, Mr Cook said. 'It is
extraordinary that the government still cannot produce figures to show how
much of this trade was with Serbia,' he added.
European Community officials yesterday did not endorse a plan put forward
last week by the European Commission to make EC exports to Serbia and
Montenegro subject to a triple licensing system, David Gardner adds from
Brussels.
The Brussels proposal may, however, go into a broader package designed to
reinforce sanctions against the two former Yugoslav republics, UK presidency
officials said.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Union offers Lufthansa pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S DAG white-collar trade union turned traditional negotiating
tactics on their head at the weekend with an offer to accept longer working
hours and less pay for its high-flying members.
The surprise initiative, revealed yesterday, came at Sunday's preliminary
pay talks for the 60,000 employees of Lufthansa, the loss-making state
airline, which will shortly announce a cost-cutting programme expected to
include up to 10,000 job losses.
DAG, which earlier this year backed the oTV union in Germany's longest
public-sector strike since the 1970s, said its aim was to help restore
Lufthansa's fortunes.
The union's proposal, made after a hard-fought 1992 pay round between unions
and employees in all sectors of industry, is the first suggestion that
appeals for wage restraint from the government, Bundesbank and economists
may have had some impact.
However, Lufthansa is a special case. Many companies are in difficulties,
but few can match the national carrier's DM542m (Pounds 192m) loss in the
first half of this year, or its expected 12-month deficit of well over
DM1bn.
If directors, management and other non-union employees followed the DAG
lead, the company could save DM500m a year, the union claimed.
Lufthansa, caught unprepared, said only that the offer 'could be an
important contribution to the package of measures being prepared by the
board'. All proposals would be considered at the formal pay talks for the
airline's workforce starting on August 26.
The more militant and bigger oTV union said it saw no reason to change pay
standards. It was wrong to put all the blame for Lufthansa's crisis on wages
and staffing levels, officials said yesterday.
Union leaders have already been given copies of the plan, which spells out
the need for drastic economies. Lufthansa officials claim personnel costs
are 30 per cent higher than at British Airways, and administrative staff
have increased 47 per cent since 1986.
Details of the DAG offer were not available yesterday, but they included
'adjustments' to overtime pay rates, and the sacrifice this year of the
'13th month's pay' Christmas bonus. In return, the union said employees of
the airline's internal flight subsidiary, Lufthansa Express, and its other
undertakings should be paid and employed on the same terms as workers in the
parent group.
The star of Mr Walter Momper, who shot to international prominence as mayor
of Berlin during Germany's unification celebrations, dived below the horizon
yesterday morning.
'The man with the red scarf' resigned as chairman of the city-state's Social
Democrat party after a short, sharp clash over his new job as general
manager of Ellinghaus, a building and property company with ambitions in the
east.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Reagan joins Bush to build up fighting spirit for campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and his predecessor, Mr Ronald Reagan, last night
launched their effort to inject a fighting spirit and poll-winning
confidence into the Republican party at the opening of its presidential
convention in Houston, Texas.
Scorning polls showing him 20 points behind Mr Bill Clinton, his Democratic
challenger, Mr Bush told cheering supporters at a rally that he was going to
make as big a comeback as Harry Truman in 1948.
Mr Reagan, in a speech prepared for the convention, praised Mr Bush as 'a
steady hand on the tiller' who would steer the US through a turbulent time
of change.
Their attempts to rouse Republican spirits came after the convention opened
in hesitant fashion, still with half an eye on the simmering crisis in Iraq
and concerned to settle its own internal battles - especially over abortion
 -without bloodshed.
The convention avoided a potentially divisive public debate on abortion when
abortion rights advocates conceded they did not have the votes to force
discussion of the issue.
After flying in to Houston, Mr Bush told supporters he was itching to take
on his opponents. He noted that Mr Clinton had said he was already planning
his transition into the White House.
'I half expected when I went over to the Oval Office to find him over there
measuring the drapes,' he said. 'Let me say as the first shot out of the
barrel: Put those drapes on hold. It's going to be 'curtain time' for that
ticket.'
Mr Bush also pledged to turn his attention to US domestic problems in a
second term. 'We have changed the world and now we will change America
because America is the land of eternal strength.'
He pledged to produce an economic revival plan which would cut government
spending and use tax incentives 'to get this country moving again'.
To cheers, Mr Bush said: 'Houston, get ready for . . . the most stirring
political comeback since Harry Truman gave'em hell in 1948 . . . It starts
right now.'
Mr Bush also gave one the strongest defences of Vice President Dan Quayle
since some Republicans appealed to him to dump Mr Quayle from the Republic
ticket. 'He has been a super vice president and he will be for another four
years,' Mr Bush said.
In his prepared speech, a combative and nostalgic Mr Reagan said the stakes
were high in the November 3 presidential election and 'we cannot afford to
take a chance.'
'We know President Bush. By his own admission, he is a quiet man, not a
showman,' Mr Reagan said. 'His is a steady hand on the tiller through the
choppy waters of the '90s.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / West steps up pressure on Iraq: Southern air exclusion zone
planned in effort to counter violations of ceasefire terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, Britain and France plan to announce an air exclusion zone over
southern Iraq later this week in an attempt to protect Shia rebels from
attack and to increase pressure on the regime of President Saddam Hussein.
US officials say the three governments have agreed that 'blatant violations'
of UN ceasefire resolutions passed after the Gulf war can no longer be
tolerated.
It is expected that Iraq will be told, perhaps as early as tomorrow, that
helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft flying south of the 32nd parallel will
be shot down.
The White House declined to confirm the reports but said it was concerned
about the treatment of minorities in Iraq.
The announcement of an exclusion zone will be seen by some Arab governments
as another step towards the political partition of Iraq.
The Kurdish population in the north already benefits from air protection
above the 36th parallel. Some US officials believe that the increased
pressures on Saddam Hussein could lead to the collapse of his regime before
the end of the year.
The threat of an immediate military confrontation over UN access to
information on Iraqi weapons systems eased yesterday when inspectors in
Baghdad completed their present round of visits without incident. US
officials let it be known at the weekend that military action was being
prepared in case Iraq carried out its threat to bar the 22-strong inspection
team from government ministries.
It had been expected in Washington that the UN team would specifically ask
to enter the Ministry of Military Industrialisation. But in New York, Mr Tim
Trevan, spokesman for the UN inspections commission, said no request had
been lodged to visit ministries because there was no need to at this time.
'Of course, we retain the right to designate any location in Iraq,' he
added.
Mr Nikita Smidovich, the Russian who heads the team, said in Baghdad: 'We
have learned things that will be very useful and very helpful in our future
inspection activities.' He added that 'normal relations' had been restored
with Iraqi officials prior to yesterday's final round of inspections.
Oil prices initially rose on the threat of new hostilities, then slipped
back when Mr Smidovich said his team's mission had been successful. But the
market remained on edge about the possibility of western action over
southern Iraq.
President George Bush has vehemently denied that the threat of renewed
military action against Iraq was designed to boost his own flagging
re-election campaign. But in Indianapolis yesterday, on his way to the
Republican convention in Houston, he evoked the spirit of the Gulf war,
recalling that the US had 'kicked a little Baghdad bully'.
He added: 'Saddam Hussein miscalculated. He thought we'd grown soft over the
years. He didn't think we'd commit our armed forces. He mis-read the will of
the American people'.
If President Saddam did not give UN inspectors access to Iraqi government
buildings 'we have responses planned and they are strong responses'.
The US has in place all the military equipment it needs either to bomb
targets inside Iraq or enforce an air exclusion zone to the south of the
32nd parallel.
Aircraft movements in Iraq would be monitored principally by Awacs aircraft
flying out of bases in eastern Saudi Arabia, and supported by land and
carrier-based strike aircraft.
A specialised team of air warfare controllers was dispatched to Saudi Arabia
last week from its base in South Carolina.
The Saudi government, which has been concerned at the increasing signs of
Iraqi assertiveness, is believed to have agreed to the use of its bases for
US operations.
Iraq's challenge last month to UN inspection teams was only the latest
violation of UN resolutions, according to US officials. Resolution 688,
designed to deter Saddam Hussein from harassing domestic opposition groups,
has been ignored almost from the day it was approved.
The intensification of Iraqi army efforts to crush remaining Shia rebel
groups in the south have, however, reached a level which the White House
felt could no longer be ignored, in particular the use of fixed-wing
aircraft.
For many months after the conclusion of the Gulf war Iraq made no effort to
use fighter aircraft.
However, evidence of fixed-wing flights has been building up over the past
two months, leading Iraqi opposition groups to make direct appeals to the US
for protection.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Companies fooled by 'cowboy' copier salesmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMOOTH-TALKING photocopier salesmen are swooping on smaller companies when
senior staff are on holiday and persuading their deputies to sign
extortionate contracts which can ruin the business.
The Confederation of British Industry warned yesterday that, with the boss
lying on a beach, some businesses back home are falling victim to 'cowboy'
salesmen pushing contracts with penal costs and conditions.
As a result, a number of unsuspecting companies are being forced to close
down, unable either to honour or cancel high cost agreements to which they
are committed for many years.
High-pressure sales techniques in some parts of the photocopier market are
well known but complaints from customers, who have found themselves on the
wrong end of a salesman's slick patter, have been rising.
The Campaign to Clean up Copier Contracts, which represents corporate
victims of the photocopier salesmen and is supported by the CBI, backed
yesterday's warning.
A campaign official said:'Some small businesses have found it easier to fold
than to pay the penalties arising from the copier contract.'
Companies are not regarded as consumers under the Consumer Credit Act and
are, therefore, unable to break contracts they have signed. The campaign
also wants churches, schools, charities and other corporate bodies to be
given the same protection under the law as individuals and partnerships.
It is calling for a mandatory, two-week cooling off period for photocopier
contracts and members plan to meet Baroness Denton, consumer affairs
minister, to press for action.
The campaign plans to publish a blacklist of companies which ignore the code
of practice drawn up by the British Association of Print and Copyshops.
Many companies are being caught out by the offer of a 'free' photocopying
machine, along with a service agreement which provides for payment at an
agreed rate for copies. Only in the small print, however, is it clear that
the cost per copy can be very high and can rise by up to 15 per cent during
each year of the contract.
Ms Judith Vincent, the CBI's head of company law, said yesterday: 'Vigilance
is vital if a company wants to avoid such extortion'. She said hundreds of
companies have been taken in by the malpractices of part of the photocopying
industry. She emphasised that contracts could contain costly extras and last
up to nine years, compared with the average three-year lifespan of a
photocopying machine.

FT  18 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Brighter tone at Argos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUGGESTIONS from Argos, the catalogue showroom retailer, that the recession
may be over the worst and sales are beginning to show signs of recovery
added gloss to interim results at the top end of market expectations. The
shares advanced 15 to 219p in healthy volume of 1.6m.
However, the company's warning that second-half trading will continue to be
tough was not lost on market analysts and most kept their full-year
forecasts unchanged at between Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m. Mr Andy Hughes at
Nomura, keeping the shares on hold, commented: 'While Argos may have passed
its low point in terms of sales, it will not be returning to the sales
growth levels of recent years because volumes are so low.'
County NatWest's Mr John Richards rates the shares a short-term buy, mainly
because, in his opinion, the worst appears to be over. 'The group has
battened down the hatches and got its costs under control. Although trading
will continue tough, we think the shares should hold up and outperform the
market.'
Siebe squeeze
Engineering group Siebe was one of the best performing FT-SE stocks
yesterday as the shares jumped 27 to 631p. However, turnover of 658,000
shares was thin, indicating that the renewed confidence which has sent the
market higher has failed to prise institutions away from the sidelines.
Yesterday's rise was attributed mainly to demand from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
which led to a squeeze. Yet, only last week the shares fell because the same
house was said to have had a large seller.
Sentiment was also boosted by a recommendation from Merrill Lynch. The US
securities house has moved the stock from a hold to a buy. Explaining the
move, Merrill analyst Mrs Jenny Tora said: 'The recent falls have been
overdone, but in addition, we favour the stock because of its early cycle
exposure to the appliance and automobile sector in the US which is showing
hesitant signs of recovery.'
Health products and services group London International moved ahead 10 to
199p, helped by a recommendation from SG Warburg. The house advised clients
to buy the stock on a view that it was oversold and the market has become
too pessimistic on prospects for its photo-processing operations.
Pharmaceutical issues benefited from the strength on Wall Street. Glaxo,
which has full-year results due on September 10, picked up 12 to 724p as US
selling subsided and buying in London continued.
Environmental services group Rentokil rose 7 to 154p ahead of Thursday's
interim results, which are expected to show a near 20 per cent rise.
Analysts forecast profits of Pounds 49.5m to Pounds 51m for the group versus
a previous Pounds 42.3m. Cost-cutting, small acquisitions and some margin
growth will offset adverse currency movements in driving profits higher.
After registering some of the biggest falls at the end of last week, the
building materials sector was the subject of bargain hunting yesterday, but
turnover was thin. RMC rallied 24 to 484p, Redland 15 to 424p and Rugby 12
to 193p. Among construction issues, Berkeley Group gained 6 to 210p and
Persimmon 12 to 202p.
British Gas saw good two-way business on a dull day and closed a halfpenny
firmer at 241 1/2 p with 11m traded.
Insurance broker Sedgwick slipped a further 3 to 144p on worries that it
might cut its dividend payout when it announces first-half profits today.
The fears arose from a Sunday newspaper article which said Sedgwick may
reduce its dividend by as much as half to 2p a share in the face of serious
trading problems, particularly in the US. Analysts expect the group to post
profits of between Pounds 54m and Pounds 63m, against Pounds 65.3m in the
first half of 1991.
Midland Bank owner HSBC fell 7 1/2 to 327 1/2 p, reflecting weakness in the
Hong Kong market.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries climbed 23 to 746p,
responding to the better results than expected disclosed last week by
leading insurance groups. Results from General Accident and Commercial Union
highlighted prospects for Eagle Star, BAT's insurance subsidiary, said
analysts.
A rash of buy recommendations following third-quarter results on Friday
failed to lift Hanson and the shares closed 2 lower at 193 1/2 p. Selling in
New York was said to be keeping them under pressure.
Most analysts are looking for full-year profits of between Pounds 1bn and
Pounds 1.05bn and argue that the shares are cheap. Nevertheless, the stock
is virtually unchanged against the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index over the
past year and some 12 per cent higher than just after the crash of October
1987.
Last week's falls in Guinness were deemed to be overdone at the start of
trading yesterday and the shares bounced 16 to 523p. Grand Metropolitan,
which had benefited from switching out of Guinness, lost 5 to 420p.
Downgrading in the food manufacturing sector - a constant feature in recent
weeks as analysts have responded to poor trading reports - continued
yesterday. Hoare Govett cut its profits estimate for United Biscuits by
Pounds 10m to Pounds 185m for this year, and by Pounds 12m to Pounds 200m
for 1993. The shares eased 2 to 292p.
Rumours of downgrades in Unigate and Cadbury Schweppes could not be
confirmed, but did undermine the shares. Unigate lost 8 to 275p, while the
latter shed 4 to 437p. In stores, the Argos results proved a tonic for
Kingfisher, and combined with a squeeze the shares were lifted 14 to 453p.
Adverse comment in the weekend press on Thorn EMI undermined the shares,
which declined 11 to 693p. Rank Organisation was also dragged lower, dipping
4 to 538p on paltry volume.
Hints that price discounting on holiday packages may not be as bad as feared
pushed Airtours forward 11 to 227p. Rival Owners Abroad edged up a penny to
68p.
The announcement of a new finance director at Lucas Industries was greeted
nervously and the shares eased a penny to 99p.
Publication of the annual UK engineering directory from Albert E. Sharp, the
Midlands-based broker close to the sector, boosted several stocks. These
included IMI, 9 higher at 237p, and Vickers, which firmed 3 to 123p.
Gains following Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's positive results last week began to
appear overdone and the shares lost 6 to 152p.

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC trading on the Athens Stock Exchange got off to a disappointing
start yesterday, with the index losing 1.61 to 779.36, writes Kerin Hope in
Athens.
Greece's five biggest banks were the first issues to be traded on the
screens installed on the trading floor. Prices of all but one bank declined
slightly, and trading volume also fell.
Insurance, commercial and industrial shares, still traded by open outcry,
all went down but by a smaller margin than the banks.
Brokers said the new system's failure to stimulate activity reflected
anxiety about a new Gulf crisis, as well as concern that the government is
planning further austerity measures. This month, the market has fallen to
its lowest level since 1990, as daily volume has dropped below Dr1bn
(Dollars 5.4m).
Mr Nikitas Niarchos, the bourse president, said screen-based trading will be
expanded until 'all the most active stocks are included, probably by the end
of the year'.
It will be some time before the system's capacity to handle 40,000 orders an
hour is tested. The system was developed by Femcon Associates, of the US, at
a cost of almost Dollars 4m, with part of the funding provided by the
European Community.

FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tentative recovery in
Nikkei as Pacific Rim slides
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average broke back above 15,000 on early index-related buying
yesterday, but profit-taking subsequently eroded some of the gain, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed a net 109.30 ahead at 14,929.55 after opening at the day's
low of 14,854.58 and rising to a high of 15,122.84 in the morning session.
Advances outscored declines by 709 to 213, with 125 issues unchanged.
Volume, however, dropped to 140m shares from 282m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks gained 9.38 at 1,132.51, but in London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 0.46 to 936.15.
Reports that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, had expressed his
'grave determination' to boost the economy triggered bargain hunting and
short-covering by traders. Mr Miyazawa met Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of
the Keidanren business federation, on Saturday to discuss measures to
counter the current economic slowdown.
The meeting, however, did not produce new proposals, and Mr Miyazawa
reiterated plans to implement an economic stimulus package this autumn. He
promised to study ways to reduce the tax burden on property and equity
investments, and to consider the government's purchase of land needed for
state projects.
Activity centred on position adjustment by dealers. Shares which were
previously hit by negative news rebounded on buy-backs. Nippon Housing Loan,
the most active issue of the day, advanced Y22 to Y140. The leading home
loan company faces mounting bad debts, and had been requesting a cut in
interest payments to its creditors. Reports that Nippon Housing Loan's nine
founder banks had agreed to its restructuring programme prompted buying.
High-technology issues gained ground. Toshiba rallied Y19 to Y564, rising
for the first time in eight trading days. Dealers said the issue was seen as
oversold, since it had declined 12 per cent during the previous seven days.
Hitachi appreciated Y7 to Y752 and Fujitsu put on Y5 to Y546. In contrast,
NEC lost Y9 to Y761 on fears that the company may drastically revise down
its annual earnings forecast.
Brokerage houses were weaker on concern ahead of the interim book closing.
The low turnover in the Tokyo stock market is hurting the industry, and most
brokers are expected to post losses for the first half.
Nomura Securities receded Y20 to Y1,210 and Daiwa Securities retreated Y14
to Y696.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 194.38 to 15,964.60 in volume of 10.8m
shares.
Roundup
FEARS of conflict between the US and Iraq were blamed for the relatively
heavy declines in some of the region's markets.
HONG KONG also reflected disappointment with results from domestic blue chip
companies. The Hang Seng index shed 154.74, or 2.7 per cent, to 5,667.85,
its biggest setback this year, in turnover down from HKDollars 4.47bn to
HKDollars 2.26bn.
Banks were among the hardest hit, HSBC and its Hang Seng Bank subsidiary
both sliding HKDollars 2, to HKDollars 51.50 and HKDollars 2 respectively. A
measure of the mood was that Hang Seng's 22 per cent profits rise, reported
last week, was among the 'disappointing' results.
TAIWAN added domestic political struggles to its international worries, with
an investigation into suspected corruption on a construction project
contributing to a fall of 141.90, or 3.6 per cent, to 3,784.48 in the
weighted index.
Turnover rose to TDollars 21.5bn from Saturday's two-hour total of TDollars
14.2bn. Local commentators believed that an investigation into suspected
corruption on a major highway construction project was linked to factional
disagreements within the ruling Nationalist party, and investors feared
instability if a power struggle resulted.
SEOUL's composite index tumbled 16.77, or 3.5 per cent, to 462.13. Continued
speculation on the formation of a new political party, led by the Daewoo
group and some politicians, added to the depressing effect of poor
first-half results and stringent monetary policy.
KUALA LUMPUR extended Friday's 1.7 per cent decline with a drop of 13.69, or
2.4 per cent, to 568.25 in the KLSE composite amid profit-taking.
BANGKOK fell through a strong support point, pressured by concern about a
jump in oil prices and weakness on other regional exchanges. The SET index
lost 8.13 to 756.35 in moderate volume of Bt5.1bn.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index rose 10 points to 1,559.0 in a technical
rebound after four consecutive days of losses. Foster's Brewing rallied 5
cents to ADollars 1.71, after a loss of 17 cents last week which prompted
the Australian Stock Exchange to query the fall.
NEW ZEALAND rallied as a bounce in Fletcher Challenge restored confidence.
The NZSE-40 Index closed 19.75 better at 1,491.06. The forestry and
resources conglomerate jumped 23 cents to NZDollars 2.56.
BOMBAY rose 3.4 per cent on bear-covering and speculative buying, the BSE
index ending 93.90 up at 2,889.08.

FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Singapore bears brunt of bearish week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore suffered the most in a generally bearish week for world equities,
dropping 8.3 per cent in local currency terms against a decline of 1.5 per
cent in the FT-Actuaries World Index.
The fall in Singapore was triggered by concern about rights issues,
following cash calls from two banks, OCBC and OUB, as well as a realisation
that the economy is slowing down, says Mr Michael Franklin, a director at
Kim Eng Securities.
Other stocks came under pressure as institutions took their profits in a
thin market. Mr Franklin says the market looks vulnerable from a technical
point of view, since there is little support for the Straits Times
Industrial index below 1,300. The index closed at 1,334.42 yesterday.
The week's second-worst performer was Johannesburg, which weakened 8 per
cent following a dividend cut warning last Tuesday from De Beers, one of the
most dominant components in the overall index.
One analyst says the market has also been depressed by a 1.2 per cent
year-on-year fall in Gross Domestic Product in the June quarter, the ninth
consecutive quarter of negative performance and the sharpest decline since
the first quarter of 1986.
He adds that no improvement in the economy, poor results from the retail
sector and little prospect that the ANC and the government will return to
the negotiating table soon have caused local institutions to shy away from
equities. 'There is a realisation that profits at industrial companies are
declining and that there is no dividend growth,' he explains.
The reality, or the expectation, of disappointing results from bellwether
companies were also to blame for the 4.3 per cent fall in Brussels in the
wake of poor first-half figures from Petrofina, while New Zealand lost 5.9
per cent on fears that Fletcher Challenge would announce large losses at its
annual meeting this week.

FT  18 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Early rally peters out on lack
of buying interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's excitement in Europe, generated by the thought that a German
economic slowdown must eventually lead to lower interest rates, subsided
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried to go with the flow but, after an intraday high of 1,563.49,
the DAX index came back to close just 7.72 higher at 1,555.42. Dealers said
that there was a lack of follow-through buying, as turnover fell from
DM4.9bn to DM3.7bn.
Hopes rose last Friday when the deputy president of the Bundesbank, Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, said that German interest rates would be reviewed in a couple of
months' time - this after a sharp fall in German wholesale prices in June.
But they dissipated after two other council members, Mr Otmar Issing and Mr
Lothar Muller, appeared to take a hard line, Mr Muller saying that Buba
would raise the Lombard rate if last month's discount rate rise turned out
to have no effect, and Mr Issing that the conditions for a rate cut were a
virtual halving of money supply growth, and inflation below 3 per cent.
Mannesmann stood out among the day's declines, falling DM5.20 to DM267.30
ahead of Tuesday's first half results. Lufthansa recovered DM2 to DM93,
after an intraday high of DM97; yesterday, Germany's DAG white-collar union
offered the airline a package of cost-savings which, it claimed, were worth
DM500m.
PARIS had its thinnest day's trading since January 4, 1991, as volume came
to to a paltry FFr933m. The CAC-40 index came off the day's low of 1,741.39
on rumours that a new poll on Maastricht would show support for the treaty,
closing up 3.85 at 1,757.31.
Eurotunnel rose in early trading on reports of an early settlement to the
dispute between the consortium and its contractors. The stock peaked at
FFr36.40 before closing down 10 centimes at FFr35.
Among gainers, Olipar jumped FFr12.50 or 16 per cent to FFr90 in speculative
trading while institutional buying lifted Credit Local by FFr7 or 2.8 per
cent to FFr262.
MILAN saw a classic technical reaction after last week's heavy losses and
dealers said the rise was due to a lack of sellers rather than any buying
interest. The Comit index rose 9.73 to 403.43 in turnover estimated at
L60bn-L70bn after Friday's L65.9bn. Among leading blue chips, Fiat rose L125
to L4,210 at its official close although it pared its gains later to stand
at L4,190.
Some shares were suspended temporarily due to excessive gains, including
Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura and the insurer Sai. BNA closed up L250 at
L4,550 and Sai was up L660 to L12,110.
The transport group, Ausiliare, was readmitted to trading after its
suspension last week pending details of negotiations for a change in
ownership of the group.
AMSTERDAM closed early as the stock exchange extended the share suspension
caused by a computer failure earlier in the day. The market, extremely quiet
before the interruption, will re-open as normal today. The CBS Tendency
Index rose 0.4 to 113.7.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Running faster just to stand
still - Quality assurance schemes may soon become necessary for survival /
Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN COMMODITY prices fall and production costs continue to rise producers
of those commodities have to respond. The two most positive options are to
attempt to cut costs and/or to seek to increase receipts. The third, giving
up the struggle and getting out of the business, is being chosen by about
100 UK farmers each week, either voluntarily or because they have been
declared bankrupt.
I am told that this is the operation of market forces. Having been a
subsidised farmer all my life, I am not really supposed to understand these
things. But I am learning fast.
The Ministry of Agriculture's own records show that on average UK farm
incomes have fallen in real terms by 50 per cent during the last decade.
Furthermore, it has been calculated by the National Farmers' Union that the
effect of the recently agreed reform of the European Community's common
agricultural policy will be to reduce those incomes by a further 16 per cent
over the next three years.
To survive till now has already meant severe cost-cutting for most farmers
and this is beginning to show in such things as the advancing age of
tractors and the increasing breadth of untrimmed hedges. Those who seek to
continue farming, against the apparent odds, will need to reduce expenditure
still further. Last year alone, 6,000 farm workers lost their jobs on farms
and the manpower exodus seems set to continue.
While all this has been going on, however, the leading thinkers of the
various sectors of the industry have been attempting to find ways of
increasing income from commodities sold. It is called better marketing,
another concept that is supposed to be foreign to most farmers.
In simple terms, they have sought to identify the qualities consumers most
desire in their food and to produce to those criteria. Chief arbiters in
most of this have been the big supermarkets, which now claim to retail
something between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of all the food consumed in
Britain.
The 'intelligence' the multiples are feeding back to producers is that the
average consumer is now becoming concerned about the environmental and
welfare implications of the way their food is produced, as well as the
long-standing and vital need to be sure of its absolute safety for
themselves and their families.
I am bound to say that, while I am not surprised that the supermarkets put
esoteric qualities forward as priorities, I have some doubt as to their
total accuracy. Some months ago, I decided to do an unauthorised straw poll
in my local superstore on why people chose particular types of eggs.
On the shelves were free-range eggs, laid by hens which had access to open
grassland, which were the most expensive; barn eggs, produced by hens kept
inside on deep litter, which were less expensive; and so-called fresh eggs,
clearly indicating that they had been produced by hens in battery cages,
which were the cheapest.
Frankly, I was amazed at the apathy of the shoppers. Some obviously did not
look at the labels or the prices, merely picking up whatever came most
easily to hand. Others thought fresh eggs must be best, because the rest did
not have 'fresh' written on the packets. But most, when asked which eggs
they would choose, simply said: 'The cheapest'. Only two ladies out of the
two dozen or so that I questioned mentioned anything about battery cages and
welfare.
My conclusion from this highly unscientific survey is that it is possible
that the supermarkets themselves, out of concern for their own public
images, dictate the criteria for production standards far more than their
trusting customers.
Nevertheless, in the search for a better price for their beef cattle, their
lambs, their pigs and their poultry products, groups of farmers, seeking to
steal a march on their more traditional neighbours, have, over the last year
or two, been developing quality assurance schemes. These involve producing
animals to specified standards, which they perceive coincide with consumer
demand. They include welfare, feed ingredients and slaughter conditions that
are usually better than the law requires. In return the producers hope to
earn a small premium for their stock.
There are now so many such schemes - each supplying its particular niche
market, but still, in total, only representing a minority of farmers - that
the whole situation is becoming confused. Pleas are already being made by
buyers to try to bring about some harmonisation of the standards.
Indeed, to my certain knowledge, the pig industry is attempting to achieve
just that, and I suspect that those who produce other classes of livestock
may feel the need to do something similar. If they succeed, however, they
will, of course, erode the premiums being paid for individual schemes.
It seems inevitable to me that, as such quality assurance schemes spread
across the industry, the standards they set will tend become the norm rather
than the exception. And once supermarket buyers discover that they can
readily acquire the quality and the standards they have set, they will be
unwilling to pay premium prices.
Only by by making the standards more difficult to achieve will those who
began the quality race be able to maintain their price premium. It has to be
recognised, moreover, that standards may be tightened anyway, to satisfy the
fickle and changing demands of supermarkets and consumers.
That is not likely to prove profitable for producers because most new
restrictions placed on production methods will either add to costs or reduce
efficiency. The whole quality assurance business is a treadmill that may
become more onerous as time passes.
But that is no reason for a farmer not to get involved in such a scheme. Not
if he hopes to survive in business, that is. For I predict that, before very
long, farmers who do not comply with some recognised assurance scheme will
have difficulty in selling their stock at all. And if they are able to get
rid of it, the price they get will be at a discount to that which is
quality-assured.
In short, those farmers who survive will have to run faster to stand still.
The rest, who are unable to stand the pace, will probably swell the 100 a
week who are already getting out of the business.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Report urges upgrading of NZ
wool exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND should double the amount of value-added processing of wool by
the year 2000 in a bid to ensure the long term viability of the industry,
according to a wide-ranging industry study.
It said the industry must develop more 'higher value wool' promote a
distinctive New Zealand wool brand and sell aggressively into new markets.
The report was initiated by Mr John Falloon, the minister of agriculture,
who last year called for long term strategies to be evolved to bolster the
declining fortunes of the wool industry. This followed the collapse in
prices after Australia suspended its price support system in February 1991,
causing New Zealand to do the same. Other problems related to the virtual
end of sales to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, because of
currency problems, and erratic buying from China.
Adding to the difficulties have been wild variations in price. The average
wool price peaked at NZDollars 7.40 a kilogram in October 1988, before
plummeting to NZDollars 3.50 in February last year, hitting NZDollars 3.70
in October before rebounding to Dollars NZ5.45 earlier this year. This
season, which began three weeks ago began with the indicator at NZDollars
4.71 and rose to NZDollars 4.82 (Pounds 1.35) at Thursday's sale in Dunedin.
The report was unusual in that it was the first in which all sectors of the
New Zealand trade - farmers, the Wool Board, and brokers - co-operated. It
highlighted the declining state of the wool market over the past two
decades.
It said that sheep farming profits were at their lowest level for at least
two decades. The poor profitability of wool growing was being reflected in
falling output that would erode the benefits for New Zealand of being the
dominant supplier of certain types of wool.
The report said that the industry must aim for prices to climb above
NZDollars 6 a kilogram, a level considered necessary to sustain production.
It suggested that farmers should concentrate on producing higher value wool,
especially fine and premium types.
Greater efforts should be made to boost the amount of wool scoured before
export to 85 per cent by 2000. It said the New Zealand industry must
manufacture 10 per cent of the clip to final product stage: at present only
4 per cent is treated this way. A further 10 per cent should be turned into
intermediate products such as carpet yarn.

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHOQUILIMPIE, Chile's third largest gold mine, will be closed down at the
end of the year as it has run out of reserves of gold oxides. The operators
say, however, that they will attempt to extend the life of the mine with a
project to extract the more difficult gold sulphides.
The pioneer high-altitude mine, located in the Andes close to the Bolivian
border, is owned by Royal Dutch/Shell's Billiton, Northgate Exploration and
Citibank. It began production in mid-1988 and produced 100,000 ounces of
gold a year between 1989 and 1991 - a tenth of Chile's total output. But
further exploration failed to uncover new oxide reserves and production is
set to fall to 65,000 ounces this year.
Choquilimpie was refused permission to continue prospecting in surrounding
areas, as the mine is located in the middle of a nature reserve.
Mr Jorge Chamy, Choquilimpie's general manager, said extraction of gold
oxides would come to a halt at the end of the year because the current low
world prices for gold made the operation unprofitable. However, he said the
owners were studying new alternatives to keep their Dollars 32.7m investment
alive, including the mining of gold sulphides.

BRAZILIAN AND Colombian officials will meet next Monday to prepare for the

London on September 21. Mr Celsius Lodder, director of the Brazilian
Department of Supply and Prices, one of the leaders of the Brazilian
delegation, said that the two countries commonly meet to exchange ideas
prior to the London encounters.
Producing countries are frustrated at the lack of progress in the talks,
especially as prices now stand at 17-year lows.
Mr Lodder said that Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, would
not be discussing a change in position at next week's meeting. 'We don't
think that a unilateral producers' accord would be appropriate,' he added.

cotton and tobacco harvests
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK COTTON and tobacco production are forecast to reach record levels this
year after farmers in the north of the country switched crops because of a
winter drought.
The cotton crop is expected to reach 875,000 tonnes, a 30 per cent rise from
675,000 tonnes last year. More than 350,000 hectares were planted with
cotton this year, compared with about 230,000 in 1991.
'The winter wheat crop this year in Thrace was poor because of reduced
rainfall, so a much bigger acreage than usual went to cotton,' said a Cotton
Board official.
Northern farmers, who grow most of the field crops produced in Greece, are
now more prepared to switch away from cereals. Their incomes have declined
sharply following reduced harvests resulting from severe drought in three
out of the past four years.
Greek cotton production doubled over the past decade, thanks to improved
methods of irrigation and extensive mechanisation. But the crop has remained
at about 650,000 tonnes annually for several years as demand from the local
textile industry tapered off.
This year's tobacco crop is forecast at 173,000 tonnes, an 8 per cent
increase from 160,000 tonnes in 1991. The area planted rose from 84,000 to
95,000 ha, according to the Tobacco Board.
For the first time, production of the Oriental tobacco varieties
traditionally grown in Greece is expected to show a slight decline this
year.
More farmers are growing the Virginia and Burley varieties, which sell more
quickly on the local market. Production of Virginia tobacco is expected to
rise this year by 50 per cent to 60,000 tonnes. Production of Burley is
likely to reach 15,000 tonnes compared with 9,000 tonnes last year.
The government has been encouraging the move away from Oriental varieties by
providing incentives for farmers to build facilities to dry and store
Virginia tobacco.
Cotton and tobacco are among Greece's highest-earning agricultural exports.
Cotton exports amount to Dollars 110m in an average year, while tobacco
exports are worth more than Dollars 140m a year.

COPPER rallied on Comex, with the active September contract jumping by more
than 3.50 cents a lb in late trading on heavy fund buying. One trader cited
trade short covering prompted by an oversold condition last week. Another
trader said locals were caught short and had to cover their positions. The
trade was continuing to buy on both the LME and Comex, he said. Prices were
underpinned by the continued Polish copper workers strike and improved
European demand. ZINC again found good buying on any dip on the LME, with
buyers further encouraged by copper's surge. ALUMINIUM was supported by talk
that the Bonneville Power Administration is again mulling the possibility of
reducing power to aluminium smelters in the US Northwest. New York's arabica
COFFEE futures were down to fresh 17-year lows as news of talks between
Colombia and Brazil had little impact on trading. Nearby September was down
more than 2 cents in late trading at 48.30 a lb. GOLD edged ahead on the
London bullion market. Initial reports of heightening tension between the US
and Iraq were mildly supportive, but it hardly budged on later news of a
successful UN arms inspection mission.

THREE NEW York commodities exchanges have agreed on a plan to build a new
headquarters and trading facility in lower Manhattan.
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the Commodity Exchange (Comex), and
the New York Cotton Exchange have approved a plan that will cost about
Dollars 150m and be funded through a combination of private finance and the
New York city and state money.
City and state funding has been offered because the project is expected to
keep some 9,000 jobs in New York. The New York State Urban Development
Corporation will invest Dollars 27m and New York city will provide a Dollars
26m grant. The city will also provide a Dollars 22m capital contribution
which will be recouped through a combination of enhanced rent and payments
in lieu of taxes.
The new seven-storey building will have 51,000 sq ft of column-free trading
floor, more than twice the size of the floor in the World Centre, which the
three exchanges share at present with the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
largest New York market.
Nymex will not be following its neighbours to their new home, but will look
for its own new trading space independently. It has favoured New Jersey as a
location.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Most CIS alumina plants 'to
become uncompetitive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST ALUMINA plants in the Commonwealth of Independent States will become
highly uncompetitive as the former Soviet Union allows its energy prices to
rise to world levels, some western analysts suggest.
Only two of the CIS's ten alumina plants - Niklaev in the Ukraine and
Pavlodar in Kazachstan - will have any chance of competing with western
producers if they have to pay the full cost of energy.
Each of these has the capacity to produce 1m tonnes a year of alumina, the
raw material smelted to produce aluminium. Total alumina capacity in the CIS
is about 5.35m tonnes. Western production last year was 35.2m tonnes.
Industry analysts point out that the CIS is under pressure from the
International Monetary Fund to lift its energy costs as part of the economic
reform programme on which further IMF financial aid depends.
They calculate that, with full-priced energy, the cost of producing alumina
in the CIS smelters ranges from Dollars 220 a tonne to Dollars 400 a tonne.
This compares with an average cost of Dollars 120 a tonne in Australia and
between Dollars 180 and Dollars 200 in other western countries.
Analysts say not one of Russia's alumina plants will be competitive. They
are at Pikalevo (300,000 tonnes a year capacity); Volkhov (50,000 tonnes);
Tikvin Plant, Boksitogorsk (350,000 tonnes); Bogoslovsk (900,000 tonnes);
Kamensk (300,000 tonnes) and Acinsk (1m tonnes).
Nor would Ukraine's smaller plant at Saporoshye (250,000 tonnes) or the
Kirovabad unit in Azerbaijan (200,000) be economic.
Observers point out that the former Soviet Union's aluminium industry was
mainly established to satisfy the country's military needs, no matter what
the cost. About 75 per cent of aluminium was used for defence or aerospace
equipment or related applications.
The CIS would also face difficulties if it wanted to import low-cost alumina
from western producers to substitute for its own production. Not only is
there not enough equipment at the ports or rail cars to handle a big
increase in alumina imports, but the material would have to be transported
about 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from port to the CIS's most-efficient aluminium
smelters in Siberia.
This is roughly equivalent to a journey from one side of the US to the other
and analysts suggest it would add about Dollars 150 a tonne to the cost of
alumina by the time it reached the smelters.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Bank makes Japan's VRN debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJI Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 350m issue of subordinated perpetual
variable-rate notes - the first Japanese bank to raise capital using a
controversial variable-rate structure. The notes count as upper tier 2
capital under Basle capital adequacy guidelines.
The move is expected to mark the start of a wave of subordinated perpetual
debt issues by Japanese banks which are struggling to meet capital
guidelines.
The deal was arranged by Merrill Lynch, the only bank currently active in
the VRN market.
Variable-rate notes are priced to pay an initial margin over the London
interbank offered rate and are re-marketed at auction every three months. If
there are insufficient buyers, the margin widens to a fall-back rate.
The VRN market collapsed in 1990, due to declining confidence in bank credit
quality. Investors - including a number of UK companies whose treasuries had
bought paper as money-market investments - were left holding paper at
fall-back rates which no longer seemed attractive.
Until yesterday's deal, only two VRNs had been launched so far this year.
Most outstanding deals are still at their fall-back rates, although Merrill
Lynch says the paper is liquid and actively traded.
Dealers were sceptical about demand for the Fuji paper, which pays an
initial margin of 0.85 point over Libor, with a fall-back rate during the
first five years of 1 point.
One trader suggested the deal would be viewed as a step-up floating-rate
note, rather than a variable-rate note.
Merrill declined to disclose the nature of placement (except that it was
with genuine end-investors, excluding banks), but reported firm demand and
predicted further such deals.
Fuji Bank also launched a Dollars 150m issue of perpetual subordinated
floating rate notes arranged by Fuji International. Placement of the paper,
which also represents upper tier 2 capital, is believed to be with related
companies, a pattern which has been followed by many Japanese bank capital
issues.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Chile's debt wins back
investment grade status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHILE yesterday became the first Latin American country to win back
investment grade status after the region's debt crisis of the past decade.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said it had assigned an
implied BBB rating to long-term debt issued by the Republic of Chile,
putting it two notches above the threshold for investment grade.
Implied ratings are given when there is no outstanding debt issued by the
country, and provide a ceiling for the ratings of private sector issuers
from the country concerned.
Of other Latin American countries, Venezuela is rated two notches below
investment status by S&amp;P at BB and only one rung below by Moody's Investors
Service, the other leading US agency, at Ba1. Mexico, unrated by S&amp;P, is
regarded as a Ba2 credit by Moody's.
Chile's rehabilitation in the eyes of the international financial markets is
due largely to the impact of economic reforms carried out during the 1980s,
under the military dictatorship of General Pinochet.
The duration of the country's economic reforms was one of the significant
factors which accounted for Chile's higher standing than other countries in
the region, S&amp;P said.
S&amp;P's assessment also reflects the country's successful transition to
democratic rule in 1990. Although its gross external debt of some Dollars
18bn is still around 60 per cent of gross domestic product, S&amp;P said debt
service had fallen to a manageable 21 per cent of exports in 1991 from 56
per cent in 1985.
Banco de Chile, which said a month ago that it was planning to raise Dollars
75m, is the only Chilean issuer so far to have announced plans to return to
the international bond markets. However, the issue has yet to emerge.

It has taken almost 60 years, but JP Morgan is on its way to becoming a

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
In the first six months of this year, Morgan has underwritten Dollars 5.2bn
in securities offerings as either co or lead-manager, and it should soon
exceed the Dollars 6.4bn it totalled in all of 1991.
The bank has achieved its position in the underwriting rankings just three
years after the Federal Reserve granted US commercial banks powers to trade
and underwrite corporate bonds. But it was not until September 1990 that
Morgan earned the special distinction of being the only bank allowed to
trade and underwrite corporate equities.
It is believed the Fed gave Morgan its equity powers back first because it
was the most securely capitalised of big US banks. It had also lobbied
hardest for a return to investment banking. Yet Morgan did not enjoy its
unique position among US banks for long. In January 1991, the Fed approved
the return of Bankers Trust to the equity markets. Since then, no other
banks have been granted similar powers.
But The Fed has imposed a limit on the two banks' activities - no more than
10 per cent of the revenues earned by their securities units must come from
trading and underwriting corporate securities. The rest must come from
government or agency business.
Even accounting for the later start, Bankers Trust has not matched Morgan's
rapid ascent up Wall Street's underwriting ladder. The only league table it
has appeared in so far is junk bond underwritings, where it ranked 10th in
the first half of this year with Dollars 425m of issues under its belt
(Morgan was ninth with Dollars 550m).
Analysts are not surprised that Morgan has made the bigger splash. Under the
stewardship of its British chairman, Sir Dennis Weatherstone, it has been
much more determined to build a presence in the securities business.
Morgan prepared for a return to domestic debt and equity underwriting long
before the Fed considered dismantling Glass-Steagall, preparations that Mr
Tony Mayer, Morgan's head of worldwide corporate finance, said were started
in 1979 when the bank got into the Eurobond business. 'We wanted to not only
advise clients, but to execute for them through the entire capital
structure,' said Mr Mayer.
By 1984, Morgan was the leading US underwriter of Eurobonds, and a big
player in the US government and agency securities markets. Its position
proved the perfect launchpad when it entered the US corporate bond market in
1989.
Morgan was also expanding into overseas equity markets, building its
experience of securities underwriting and trading. It also had a
well-developed derivatives business, a presence in the debt and equity
private placements market, and extensive research capabilities. It also
moved into the junk and convertibles markets, both of which operate much
like equity markets.
When Morgan was allowed to trade and underwrite US corporate stocks in 1990,
the bank was fully prepared. 'It made no sense not to become an equity
player in your home market,' said Mr Mayer.
Analysts say Morgan has clearly made a serious effort to try to become a
major equity underwriting firm. Mr Raphael Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman
in New York said: 'They have told people that they want to be back among the
bulge-bracket underwriters before the end of the decade.'
Morgan's long list of blue-chip clients is the weapon that Wall Street
rivals fear most. 'Morgan's strategy has always been client and relationship
driven - they are less concerned with the profitability of individual
transactions or products, and more whether deals benefit client
relationships,' said Mr Soifer.
Morgan has been willing to underwrite the higher rated issuers, even at
narrower spreads, to gain the distribution experience, and to forge the
relationships with the big institutional investors.
This aggressive approach is paying dividends. In the past year, Morgan has
handled a host of important underwritings, including for Xerox, PepsiCo,
McDonald's and Procter &amp; Gamble. It even completed its first lead-managed
initial public offering (IPO), of paperboard and packing group Riverwood
International.
Its approach contrasts with that of Bankers Trust. Like Morgan, Bankers
Trust says it was well prepared for the securities business after years of
experience in areas including government fixed-income markets, private
placements, commercial paper and Eurobonds.
By the time the bank was allowed into equities in January last year,
everything was in place, said Mr Howard Schneider, president of BT
Securities. While not as active as Morgan has been, Bankers Trust has
participated in several big equity underwritings in the past year, including
Time Warner, Ford, and Burlington Industries.
It has concentrated on the high-yield end of the market, an area that
matches its client base, many of whom were leveraged buyouts (LBOs) the bank
helped go private in the 1980s. Since it returned to bond underwriting, BT
has been involved in more than Dollars 6bn of high-yield issues.
Although the junk market has undergone a renaissance in the past year,
Bankers Trust says it was fortunate to enter the market in 1990 when it was
still in a big slump. 'It was a good time to get started if you had a long
view,' said Mr Schneider. There was a shortage of liquidity in the market
that Bankers Trust was willing to fill: 'Investors were desperate for any
dealer to talk to.'
For now, the bank will stay away from underwriting rated securities. 'The
rated bond business has very narrow margins and a high level of competition,
so we are approaching it carefully,' said Mr Schneider.
As for equities, Bankers Trust is also treading cautiously. It has been
involved in a few IPOs (again with former LBO companies it knows well), some
equity syndicates and cross-border equity deals in emerging markets, but
nothing like to the extent of Morgan.
The two banks' presence in the securities underwriting business has raised
questions about whether they have used their leverage on the bank lending
side to win underwriting business from clients.
There have been rumours about the banks leaning on corporate borrowers to
award them underwriting business, but no facts to back them up. The bankers'
response to such allegations is uncompromising. Mr Mayer of Morgan says:
'For one, it's nonsense. Two, it's illegal. And three, our clients would not
put up with it.'
Talk of such tactics serves little purpose. The chairman of one leading
brokerage firm, however, offers a constructive answer to the conflicts of
interest banks are rumoured to exploit, and to the familiar gripe from Wall
Street that banks have an unfair advantage because they can borrow at
cheaper rates from the Federal Reserve: 'Give us access to cheap money from
the Fed, and allow securities houses into the banking business.'
Glass-Steagall may be crumbling - and the granting of equity powers to
Morgan and Bankers Trust blew the biggest hole in the Act since its
introduction - but legislators are unlikely to go that far.
Given the problems of US banks with loan businesses, and in light of
Congressional opposition to allowing securities firms into banking, it seems
JP Morgan and Bankers Trust will, for now at least, remain the only pioneers
allowed to cross the great divide between commercial and full-service
investment banking.

COMPANHIA Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the state-controlled Brazilian mining
firm, and the world's leading exporter of iron ore, recorded a profit of
Dollars 234.7m for the first seven months of this year, nearly equalling the
1991 figure of Dollars 251.8m.
Although not yet reflected in the results, the company's most significant
move during the period was the signing of a management agreement in June
with the government that will allow CVRD to operate more like a private
company.
It has been freed of administrative regulations governing state-owned
companies, and will operate according to a set of goals negotiated between
government officials and company management.
Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private
mining company, posted profits of Dollars 17.5m for the first six months of
1992. Last year, the company lost Dollars 30.6m.
The company said more favourable international tin prices were largely
responsible for the rebound.
Aracruz Celulose, a leading paper and pulp exporter, registered a slim
profit of Dollars 3m for the first six months of this year, bouncing back
from a loss of Dollars 97.1m last year.
Most of the recovery was during the second quarter.

<TEXT>
THE Australian Stock Exchange yesterday approached directors of Foster's
Brewing Group, the Australian-based international brewer, over the recent
sharp fall in the company's share price.
The shares fell from ADollars 1.82 (USDollars 1.31) on August 10 to a low
point for the year of ADollars 1.65 on August 14, before recovering
yesterday to ADollars 1.70, on speculation centred on Foster's June year
earnings statement, due next month.
Investors have knocked Foster's shares down from a year high of ADollars
2.11, recorded in early June, on fears that the company may announce large
asset write-downs and perhaps be forced to bolster its capital with a share
issue.
The stock exchange asked if Foster's directors believed the company's
earnings would vary by more than 15 per cent over last year and whether it
would record any material abnormal or extraordinary items.
Foster's directors have until midday today - Australian time - to reply.
The share slide also follows Foster's largest shareholder, International
Brewing Holdings, being put into receivership and the apparent lapsing of a
merger proposal from rival beer group, SA Brewing Holdings.
The receivership means a 32 per cent stake parcel in Foster's is for sale,
although the receivers have stated they are prepared to be patient.

PLAYMATES, the Hong Kong manufacturer of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles toys,
yesterday reported a 57 per cent drop in profits to HKDollars 175.5m
(USDollars 22.7m) from HKDollars 409m in the six months to June 30.
In what Playmates officials described as a 'transition' year for the
company, interim sales fell nearly 52 per cent to HKDollars 645.5m from
HKDollars 1.33bn last time.
Directors declared a 7 cents interim dividend, up 16 per cent on last year's
6 cents, but well below the total of 18 cents actually paid. Playmates made
a special payout a year ago which amounted to 12 cents a share.
In spite of the poor results the company took pains to point out that
margins had remained robust - at more than 27 per cent - and new products in
the pipeline, together with planned expansion in Europe and possibly the US,
would be sources of growth.
Earlier this month Playmates announced it was acquiring 37.5 per cent of
Ideal Loisirs, France's leading toymaker, for HKDollars 235m.
Mr Ian Forsyth, the newly appointed chief financial officer, said the
company was considering further acquisitions in Europe and in the US. He
pointed out that at June 30 the company had no long-term debt and had
HKDollars 1.1bn in cash and marketable securities.
'Clearly what is happening is the maturing of the Turtle's lines,' Mr
Forsyth said. 'We have scaled back production - to cut inventories and
stocks at the retail level - but we are very confident that sales can be
maintained at or above current levels.'
He said new lines of Turtles' products and other toys related to television
programmes would be introduced. 'We see some growth in the second half but
the second half is really a transition period,' he said.
Analysts said although Playmates was well-managed it was essentially a one
product company. Mr Steven Lee, of Jardine Fleming, said: 'They continue to
search for another hit toy (like the Turtles), but it's tough to repeat that
success.'

extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, remained confident yesterday that
negotiations on a crucial Dollars 8.6bn multi-bank loan extension for its
financial services subsidiary will be completed shortly, despite last-minute
delays.
To rollover the credit facility, Chrysler Financial needs the consent of all
152 banks in the lending consortium, but two banks, one US and one German,
are reported to have demanded better terms on the loan before approving its
renewal.
A spokesman for Chrysler confirmed that although the two banks delaying the
deal accounted for only Dollars 60m of the Dollars 8.6bn financing, if
unanimous approval of the loan's renewal was not forthcoming the entire deal
would have to be scrapped.
That would require Chrysler renegotiating the terms of the loan with every
one of the 152 banks in the consortium.
The spokesman, however, said the company expected to conclude the deal
'relatively shortly'.
The loan extension is crucial to the Chrysler subsidiary, which provides the
financing for many of the carmaker's customers and dealers. Because Chrysler
Financial has a junk credit rating, the company has few alternative sources
of funding.
Analysts, however, believe the rollover of the loan will be completed
successfully.
Mr Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley pointed out that Chrysler's ability to
negotiate an extension on the facility long before its expiration date of
April 1993 represented a vote of confidence in the company's future by
banks. He said: 'It's a major achievement for Chrysler to get so many banks
to agree to rollover these loans nine months in advance of expiration."

<TEXT>
NIPPON Housing Loan, Japan's home loan company, yesterday announced its nine
leading creditor banks had agreed to provide financial assistance for its
restructuring programme.
Nippon Housing Loan, facing mounting property-related debts, had been in
dispute with its creditors who were opposed to the company's requests to
reduce the interest rate on its loans.
The nine banks which fund Nippon Housing have now agreed to lower the
interest rate to 3.25 per cent, the same as the official discount rate, and
maintain their outstanding lending levels.
The banks, including Sakura Bank and Sanwa Bank, have extended Y600bn
(Dollars 4.75bn) to Nippon Housing Loan, which holds an estimated Y2,300bn
in total debt.
Reports of the deal were greeted on the Tokyo stock market with relief, as
Nippon Housing Loan's shares, which had plunged on concerns over the
financial stability of the company, rose Y22 to Y140.
However, the banks are concerned over the reluctance of Nippon Housing
Loan's remaining creditors to co-operate with the company's restructuring.
Financial affiliates of agricultural co-operatives lead by Norinchukin Bank
have around 40 per cent of loans to Nippon Housing Loan.
Seven Japanese housing loan companies have sought financial assistance from
their leading banks.
The companies were set up during the 1960s and 1970s by leading financial
institutions to provide property loans for individuals. However, the bulk of
the loans and investments, made to riskier resort and property developments
in the 1980s, have since turned sour.
The problems at Japanese non-bank financial institutions, including the home
loan companies, are expected to put pressure on Japanese banks which have
been forced to accept reduced or even no interest payments.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ST LAWRENCE CEMENT, the North American cement manufacturing and construction
arm of the Swiss Holderbank group, is suspending quarterly common share
dividends until further notice.
The company attributed the move to weak commercial and residential
construction markets in eastern Canada and the north-eastern US.
In July it paid a cash dividend of 5 cents on the A shares and a stock
dividend equal to 14 cents.
St Lawrence is eastern Canada's largest cement producer and is also a large
producer and supplier in the north-eastern US.
In the first half it lost CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 16.5m) or 48 cents a
share, against a deficit of CDollars 10.9m or 27 cents a year earlier. Sales
dropped 9 per cent to CDollars 179m.
Hydro-Quebec, a leading borrower in international financial markets,
reported net profit of CDollars 432m for the first half, up 10 per cent from
a year earlier. Revenues for the period were CDollars 3.5bn, up 12.5 per
cent.
Electricity sales by volume rose 7.6 per cent, partly due to a cold winter.
In addition exports to the US were higher and domestic rates rose in May.
Operating expenses rose 4.6 per cent. Taxes paid to the shareholder, the
Quebec government, were up 52 per cent to CDollars 298m partly because of
higher capital taxes.
The 1992 investment programme totalled CDollars 4.6bn, and CDollars 1.7bn
was spent in the first half. The year's borrowing programme totalled
CDollars 3.7bn, including CDollars 2.5bn raised in the first half.

WESFARMERS, the diversified West Australian agricultural group, lifted
earnings and dividends strongly in the year to June 30 on the back of
acquisitions, higher sales and falling costs.
The company posted a 77 per cent net profit rise from ADollars 35.8m
(USDollars 25.8m) to ADollars 63.1m in the period. Operating revenues rose
by 35 per cent from ADollars 953m to ADollars 1.8bn for the same period.
The annual dividend has been boosted from 14.5 cents to 26 cents a share,
lifting the payout from ADollars 26.7m to ADollars 48.5m.
The company benefited from the consolidation of Bunnings, the timber group.
It increased its stake in Bunnings from 24.5 per cent to 45 per cent and
included an ADollars 11.3m pre-tax earnings contribution from the timber
company in its latest results.
The coal business was the biggest pre-tax earnings contributor, with
ADollars 62.6m, followed by fertilisers and chemicals with ADollars 48.6m.
The company's interest bill eased from ADollars 35.8m to ADollars 32.6m.
The result also benefited from a big reduction in abnormal losses which
dropped from ADollars 24.1m to ADollars 722,000.

IMPALA Platinum does not expect to improve on its 1991-92 annual results in
the current financial year and has deferred its UG2 ore body expansion
programme for a year, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
'We are husbanding our resources,' said Mr Michael McMahon the managing
director of the world's second biggest platinum producer, after reporting a
16.5 per cent fall in attributable income to R260.3m (Dollars 94.3m) in the
year ended June 30, 1992, from R311.8m.
A 38 per cent cut in the dividend for the full year to 170 cents reflected
the lower profit in the past year and expected depressed conditions in the
immediate future, he said.
Mr McMahon said a remarkable turnround in second-half performance, contrary
to the company's forecast at the halfway stage, was the result of reduced
operating stocks and its programme to control costs and resolve the
technical problems at its refinery.
The company deferred its expansion at the UG2 ore body because of weakness
in world prices for platinum group metals and a fall in demand.

prompt share fall

SHARES in Wang Laboratories, the ailing US office computer company, plunged
another Dollars  7/8 to just Dollars  3/4 yesterday as speculation over the
company's future grew.
Rumours that the company could be poised to file for protection under
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code have been rumbling for days, following
Wang's early payment of its workforce last week and the company's decision
to delay announcing its fourth-quarter results.
The company's board was understood to be meeting yesterday, but officials
were unavailable for comment.
Wang has been seeking new finance for some months. Last year it agreed a
deal with International Business Machines, the world's largest computer
manufacturer, to distribute IBM's equipment in addition to its own in
exchange for funding. IBM declined to comment on reports that it had decided
against investing a further Dollars 75m on top of Dollars 25m put in last
year.
Shares in Wang, which has posted after-tax losses totalling more than
Dollars 1.1bn over the past two years, rallied briefly to Dollars 7 1/2 in
February but have since declined steadily. Losses in the first nine months
of the current year totalled Dollars 22.9m.
Wang cut its payroll by almost a quarter a year ago and this May it axed
more than 1,000 of the remaining 13,532 jobs - a move expected to result in
a Dollars 30m fourth-quarter charge. Wang's debt totalled almost Dollars
540m at the end of March - more than 10 times the company's 1991 net worth.
If the Boston-based manufacturer opts for Chapter 11, it will be the most
dramatic victim of the malaise in the global computer industry.
Less than a decade ago, Wang was a force to be reckoned with; tipped to
succeed Digital Equipment as the world's second-largest computer maker.
Its expertise in office systems, especially word processing, and the quality
of its products were universally acknowledged.
In spite of its record as an innovator it failed to move quickly enough to
exploit either personal computers or industry standard (open) systems.
It was further handicapped by management weaknesses and the death two years
ago of founder Dr An Wang.

<TEXT>
THE sluggish state of the French economy was yesterday highlighted by the
announcement of lacklustre interim sales figures from a number of big
industrial groups including Poliet in construction and Roussel-Uclaf in
chemicals.
Poliet mustered a negligible increase in turnover to FFr9.92bn (Dollars
1.98bn) for the first half of 1992, compared with FFr9.87m during the same
period of 1991. Last year's figures were restated to allow for the sale
earlier this year of Ciments Francais, the cement business, to Italcementi
of Italy.
The announcement of static sales from Poliet followed a series of similar
disclosures last week from other French construction groups, including
Bouygues and Fougerolle, all of which have been affected by the slowdown in
the economy and the problems of large European building projects, notably
Eurotunnel.
Roussel-Uclaf, a in the chemicals group, reported a modest 3.2 per cent
increase in sales to FFr7.3bn in the first half. This means that it just
managed to keep sales ahead of inflation, which is now running at an annual
rate of 2.9 per cent in France.
Chargeurs, one of France's largest textile groups, saw sales rise more
slowly than inflation at 2.65 per cent to FFr5.42bn in the interim period.
Textile turnover rose 8.6 per cent to FFr4.15bn.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Spanish groups ponder the KIO's
change of policy - A look at how the Kuwaiti investment institution has
shocked Madrid's financial world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers in Madrid were puzzled two weeks ago when they were asked by Prima
Inmobilaria, a young property development company 33 per cent owned by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), to attend a meeting of creditors.
Representatives of some 60 banks assembled to hear Prima's chairman ask them
to agree on a two-month moratorium on repayment of capital. In return, the
KIO would lend Dollars 35m to Prima to enable it to continue paying
interest. The curious thing about the meeting was that hardly any debt was
due to mature in August and September and that which did only affected a
handful of the banks present. Why call the meeting?
The most probable reason was that the once powerful and discreet KIO, under
new management since May, wants it that way. KIO's new president, Mr Ali
Rashaid Al-Bader, controls assets worth close to Dollars 40bn around the
world but nothing with quite the public profile as the industrial and
property empire his predecessors have built up and managed in Spain since
1984.
Prima has consolidated debt of close to Dollars 700m which the KIO has
evidently decided not to continue funding until it disposes of a number of
assets. This must be heartbreaking for a company caught in a property
recession with most of its prime assets still under development.
At least it is still alive. A few weeks earlier, the KIO had refused to
continue funding losses at Ercros, Spain's biggest chemicals company, 39 per
cent owned by the Grupo Torras, the KIO holding company in Spain. Most of
Ercros is now in receivership.
Torras's other two large affiliates, the Ebro foods group and the
Torraspapel paper operation, are likely to be affected by the KIO's efforts
to trim debt and creditor banks are waiting to be called to new meetings.
The events have been a shock. The new KIO management has decided to
implement, almost overnight and quite without warning, a radical change of
investment policy in Spain.
What was once a long-term commitment to build up the Torras group is being
rapidly reduced to little more than a short-term portfolio play, with more
than 20,000 Spanish jobs at risk.
Torras is one of the biggest privately owned industrial groups in Spain. It
was built up by a flamboyant partnership of Mr Javier de la Rosa, a Catalan
financier, and Mr Fouad Jaffar, the KIO's former general manager. As the
Spanish economy has foundered, though, so has the group. Mr De la Rosa left
on May 26.
The last two months have seen a worsening of the prospects of Torras's
assets and share prices. Partly, this is because new KIO representatives in
Spain, professing their 'shock ' and 'surprise' to Spanish newspapers in
unattributable briefings, have been openly critical of Torras's businesses
and have begun a legal investigation of the actions of the old management.
However, the surprise and the investigation may be more theatrical than
real. The Torras companies were in trouble but documents show that this was
well known, certainly to the Kuwait Investment Authority (the KIA, which
theoretically controls the KIO), by late last year.
The previous management at the KIO and Torras fought for, and won, agreement
in January from the KIA for a Dollars 1bn transfer of funds to keep the
Spanish group alive. Almost Dollars 700m had been channelled into Torras
from the KIO between February 4 and June 2, when the new KIO team took over
the Torras board. The transfers were interrupted at the behest, it is
understood, of the finance ministry.
The KIA agreed to that funding (treating it not as fresh capital but simply
replacement funds) after being presented, in December 1991, with a
pessimistic report on Torras by KPMG Peat Marwick, the KIO's auditors.
That report flatly states that Torras needed a cash injection of Dollars 1bn
and says that 'overall, Grupo Torras is unlikely in the short term to be
able to give the KIO a return on its investment'. It also warns that 'a
forced sale in the current European recessionary climate could result in a
significant loss of the investment made by the KIO to date'. The new KIO
management nevertheless, appears to have decided to make disposals at both
Ercros and Prima.
The Peat Marwick report contradicts the impression being sown by the new KIO
team that Torras's Spanish management was wayward. 'The investments
themselves are in large autonomous companies which appear to be managed
appropriately,' it says, and chides the KIO for not giving the Spaniards
enough support.
'Five Kuwaiti representatives are on the board of Grupo Torras. The complete
board has not met for over a year and is not directing strategy. The Spanish
management of Grupo Torras . . . are currently disillusioned since they have
not been given guidance on the policies of Kuwait.'
Peat Marwick suggested the KIO should refinance Torras's bank loans to
reflect their equity positions. The KIO now appears to be doing this. Torras
owns 91 per cent of Torraspapel, 33 per cent of Prima, 39 per cent of Ercros
and 40 per cent of Ebro. Peat Marwick, in December, calculated Torras's debt
at Dollars 963m to banks and a further Dollars 501m in outstanding bonds. In
November and December this year Torras has to repay loans of Dollars 200m
each to Bank of America and Credit Suisse.
At the same time as insisting it will only be responsible for debt in
proportion to its equity stakes, the KIO has reworked the 1991 Torras
accounts, substituting market for book values to show a 1991 portfolio loss
of about Dollars 300m and not a small profit as originally reported. This
casts Torras in an even worse light, suggesting it may one day be abandoned.
The fact that most of the debt of Torras and its affiliates is secured
against shares in the affiliates has also sharpened interest in the group's
immediate future. The La Caixa savings bank and Sumitomo Bank have loans to
Torras worth Dollars 37m secured against Ercros stock and now that the
security is in receivership the loans may have to be repaid quickly. Also
Torras guaranteed loans worth nearly Dollars 100m to Ercros from Banco
Santander, Bankinter and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which could increase
financial pressure on the Spanish holding company.
Peat Marwick last year accurately predicted 1991 losses of Dollars 180m at
Ercros and warned then that it was 'a major management problem'. So bad, in
fact, that it valued Ercros at zero in arriving at a valuation of Dollars
2.9bn for the Torras assets.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, yesterday slashed the US list price
of its latest consumer electronics product, compact disc-interactive (CD-I),
to Dollars 699 from Dollars 999, less than a year after launching the first
CD-I player in the US.
The company said the move was part of plans to double the number of US
retail outlets carrying CD-I players to 2,000 by Christmas and to start a
national advertising campaign.
Philips declined to say whether it would reduce prices in the UK, where the
product was launched in the spring, or in continental Europe, where the
players will become available in September.
The company, whose results in the 1992 first half were hit by price-cutting
in its consumer electronics unit, said US sales of CD-I were developing
'according to expectations'.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Banking on the impossible
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEWIS Carroll's Red Queen, who made it a rule to believe six impossible
things before breakfast, would find herself quite at home in international
banking.
She would surely have seized with pleasure on the news that Chile's
sovereign debt has now achieved an investment-grade rating. After all, that
raises the possibility that in time some of the Latin American debtor
nations will be rated more highly than the banks who lent to them -
something that would certainly have seemed impossible a few breakfasts ago.
Another newly credible impossibility is a world in which investors and
depositors must pick and choose just as discriminatingly among individual
Swiss and German banks as they now do between those supervised in more
traditionally freewheeling financial centres.
To trace that thought back to its origin, turn to the Red Queen's favourite
morning reading, the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. The latest edition,
published today, contains a study highlighting the remarkably bumpy profits
of banks in the most rapidly deregulated financial markets, and the striking
difference between the best and worst performers.
In countries with traditionally more regulated and insulated financial
sectors, such as Germany and Switzerland, the study says, banks appear to
have performed more consistently. 'Experience suggests that moving from a
regulated cartel-like environment to one in which lending capacity and
competition are enhanced opens up more scope for banks' performance to vary
according to the quality of management and individual strategies.'
Heartily endorsed
That view is one which will be heartily endorsed by the shareholders of many
a British or American bank. Shareholders in Germany and Switzerland may in
time come to hold similar views, since banking deregulation is now under way
in both countries. Ominously, commercial real-estate loans, high but stable
in Germany throughout the 1980s, are now starting to rise as a proportion of
the banks' total lending. That is just what happened in the US, Japan and
the UK in the 1980s - and if the increase proves excessive, German bank
shareholders may yet regret the consequences.
Another prospect to please the Red Queen is a banking system which no longer
provides the bulk of bank lending to its domestic corporate sector. Between
1980 and 1991, however, the share of total UK bank lending accounted for by
foreign banks rose from 26 per cent to 35 per cent. If it continues to grow
at the same rate, UK banks will in time find themselves providing only a
minority of total domestic lending.
Momentary pause
They may not mind, if they continue to reduce their dependence on interest
as a source of profits. Figures in the Bank's study draw attention to
another remarkable phenomenon: the speed with which banks have raised their
non-interest income in the past decade. Between 1980 and 1991, banks in
Britain raised non-interest earnings from 25 per cent of pre-tax income to
43 per cent. In France, the figure rose even more sharply, from 19 per cent
in 1980 to 45 per cent in 1990. Last year, banks in the US obtained almost
half of their total income - 47 per cent - from non-interest sources, up
from 27 per cent in 1980.
Yet the prospect of banks which derive most of their profits from activities
other than lending is surely one which merits a momentary pause for thought.
The Bank raises its own delicately arched eyebrow: it notes that the
benefits from data-processing investment to raise the profitability of
non-interest business have so far been modest, and that banks are not alone
in pursuing this sort of customer. Investment banks, money-market funds,
insurance companies and unit trusts are all spending hard on technology and
products, and the banks may not have it all their own way.
The rush into identical markets, with identical products, is part of what
got banks into today's mess. In escaping it, managers and shareholders would
do well to consider the dangers of creating a similar mess tomorrow. As the
Red Queen pointed out: 'It's a poor sort of memory that only works
backwards.'

heartening series about the strengths of old age. Last week a poet, this
week a composer: Minna Keal used her pension as a student grant and now, at
83, has become a composer of serious music (7.45 BBC2).
There follows the first in a series, Floyd On Spain, (8.30) in which Keith
Floyd extends his culinary globe-trotting once again. If he can withstand
the blandishments of those who would turn him into another arm-waving,
cliche-spouting 'character' and stick to his natural good humour we shall be

The star of BBC1's two-part drama Children Of The Dragon (9.30) is, yet
again, Bob Peck. The story, we are told, is of 'love and intrigue set in
1989 against the backdrop of the violent political events of Tiananmen
Square'.
BBC2 begins The John Bull Business (9.40), a series of five documentaries on
British business culture, with a programme which features Freddie Laker, the
man who took on the big airlines in the 1970s. . . and lost. He and others
discuss why in recent years it has been easier to get established in
business but also easier to fail.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Schoenberg's Moses und Aron - Edinburgh International
Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH has a new festival director, Brian McMaster, previously boss of
Welsh National Opera. On the musical side the programme (though perhaps
lighter on fully-staged operas than it may be in future) displays to
impressive effect the patterns of his finely imaginative artistic needlework
in its properly festive blending of the popular and the recherche.
Tchaikovsky is the main focus of the programme - a particularly fruitful
subject, since in his work-list there are copious amounts of both kinds to
make up a rich and satisfying festival mixture.
But the opening concert, at the Usher Hall on Sunday (broadcast live on
Radio 3), was a McMaster salvo of a different sort: a concert performance of
Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra,
the Edinburgh Festival Chorus and a superbly well-chosen selection of
principals (including such notable young talents in smaller roles as Rebecca
Evans, Paul Charles Clarke and Alastair Miles) under Richard Armstrong.
In place of the big choral splash-pieces that past years have produced, the
choice seemed intended to 'make a statement' - and, at the same time, to
make a case for this craggy, thorny masterpiece as a musical drama so
utterly forceful and gripping that a packed Usher Hall might be absorbed in
it without a murmur. That was triumphantly the case on Sunday: everything in
the performance seemed geared to seizing the audience with main (though
never excessive) force and thrusting them into the burning centre of its
argument.
The Word is its subject - the eternal, and eternally topical, struggle at
the heart of the comedie humaine between abstract ideas and the
'approachable' images into which those ideas must almost always be turned
for mass consumption. The word, its audibility, sense and purpose, was
certainly at the heart of this performance: I have never before heard a
Moses und Aron so intelligible and, therefore, so meaningful.
It was sung in Allen Forte's English translation (as Schoenberg, a believer
in artistic communication in the language of the audience, would have
wished). The utterance of the large chorus, which must mingle passages of
speech, song, and the Schoenbergian Sprechgesang in between, indicates long
weeks of the most concentrated and purposeful preparation: whether in
fine-brush murmurs or full-throated cries the delivery possessed the
authority of fiercest conviction.
Likewise, the orchestra, though lacking weight of string tone, really
grasped the purpose and direction of their notes and lines. It is one of the
paradoxes that makes Moses und Aron a living, breathing work of art, not
just a vehicle for artistic debate, that the score's sound-world should be
at once so expressively denuded and so graphically suggestive. Armstrong,
who has conducted outstanding performances of Salome and Elektra in the
theatre, caught the Strauss post-echoes in the Golden Calf orgy without ever
underlining them. His mature, balanced approach was masterly.
As Aaron the veteran American Heldentenor William Cochran used all his long
experience to paint a rounded, many-sided portrait of sweet reason and
silver-tongued articulacy - high-register phrases were not exactly suave,
but the style dictating their shape was excellently assured. Willard White,
making his first approach to Moses, had already learnt (from Shakespeare's
Othello and Wagner's Wotan, inter alia) how to alternate thunderously
ringing and gravely despairing tones of voice. At the centre of a splendidly
significant festival achievement he provided an ideally commanding point of
focus.
The concert was sponsored by Scottish &amp; Newcastle plc

FT  18 AUG 92 / Technology: Sematech funding in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) plans
to phase out funding specifically designated for Sematech, the US
semiconductor industry research consortium, according to a report prepared
by the General Accounting Office, the Congressional watchdog agency.
Although Darpa plans to continue to spend Dollars 80m (Pounds 42m) per year
for the next four years on chip manufacturing research, the defence agency
is turning its priorities towards military rather than industrial needs.
The future of Sematech does not appear to be in doubt, but the change is
significant. It signals an end to the Sematech model of industry-government
collaboration that has placed the consortium at the centre of an ideological
debate over 'industrial policy', since its formation in 1987.
For the past five years, Sematech has been in the unique position of
receiving government funding for its efforts to boost the international
competitiveness of an industry segment. It was established to enable the US
semiconductor industry to regain world leadership in chip manufacturing.
In the future, if Darpa has its way, Sematech will receive government money
only on a project basis. Like any contractor it will have to mesh its goals
with those of the defence agency.
However, Darpa's decision has come as no surprise to Sematech. The
consortium is already emphasising the defence value of its efforts and is
downplaying its crusade for government intervention to prevent the US losing
its technological lead.
Sematech officials remain cautiously confident that it will continue to
receive Darpa funding at the desired level of Dollars 100m per year. A Darpa
proposal to reduce fiscal 1993 funding to Dollars 80m has been countered in
Congress.
Darpa's change of strategy is hardly the final word. Congress may well
restore direct funding for the consortium. What is more, a change of
president would all but assure Sematech's future. Al Gore, the democratic
vice presidential candidate, is a strong advocate of the US high-technology
industry.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Technology: Robots in bulk - Andrew Baxter describes how the
humble warehouse is opening its doors to automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Looming over British Steel's tinplate works in a steep valley at Ebbw Vale
is a somewhat forbidding structure. It may not win any architectural awards
but its contents hold the key to a problem that British manufacturers
frequently ignore.
Over the past decade, industrialists have modernised their production
processes to survive in increasingly competitive markets, but updating the
warehouse next door tends to get overlooked.
'Companies worry about the introduction of automation that does not come
within the sphere of their experience,' says Jack Haggett, managing director
of Haden Technology, the UK warehouse technology and logistics company.
'There's a little bit of technofear.'
At Ebbw Vale, British Steel decided some six years ago to bring its
warehouse up to the same technological standard as its production plant by
introducing a modern storage and handling system.
The aim, says British Steel, was to achieve a much-improved delivery
performance, better stock control, save energy - automated systems can work
in the dark - and reduce damage by cutting manual intervention to a minimum.
The solution was commissioned in 1990 - a 32-metre-tall automated highbay
warehouse with 14,748 rack locations for tinplate coils and bulks, packed
with automatic guided vehicles (AGVs), stacker cranes and conveyers and
controlled by a computerised management system linked to the British Steel
tinplate computer.
With the warehouse fully operational, all the expected savings have been
achieved, says British Steel.
Highbay warehouses sit like giant shoe-boxes on their long sides throughout
continental Europe, but are rather thinner on the ground in the UK. Haggett,
whose Letchworth-based company designed the Ebbw Vale system, says Germany
is investing 10 times as much in automated warehousing as the UK.
There are a number of reasons for this, he says. Planning problems are a
genuine concern in the UK - highbay warehouses may not be rejected outright
by planning authorities but often have to be enhanced externally, thus
raising the cost.
UK industry also demands a 20-25 per cent return on its capital, which does
not seem to be the case in Germany, says Haggett. 'There they look at the
whole-life cost of whether, for example, it is cheaper to use wheelbarrows
or conveyers.'
Then again, a cheaper low-rise warehouse may lose some of the efficiency
gains of its highbay counterparts, but is easier to convert to other uses.
'That's a perceived problem with highbay warehouses in the UK,' says
Haggett.
Joachim Miebach, founder of Frankfurt-based Miebach Logistic Systems, offers
another reason for the different approach in the UK, where the company has
recently undertaken a number of big automated warehousing and logistics
projects via its office in Oxford.
'I have a feeling that in the UK there is some reluctance to use machinery
to solve a warehousing problem, and a preference to use IT only - barcoding,
checking systems and sophisticated inventory control.
'In Switzerland, and especially in Germany, the tendency is to start with
the machinery - highbay warehouses and stacker cranes. These have to be
automated, so IT is a necessary consequence.'
The recession has also had a damaging effect on UK automated warehousing
investments, reducing the market to about a quarter of its level at the end
of the 1980s. However, UK inquiry levels have recently risen just as
continental European business begins to slow.
Redressing the balance in the UK will depend partly on companies such as
Haden and Miebach raising their profile. 'All our work shows there are
tremendous cost savings from high-tech automated warehousing,' says Haggett.
'But it is hard to break through the barriers.'
One way to achieve it is to have allies among the customers. Assuming a
company has a fairly high level of activity with fast movement of goods,
there then needs to be what Haggett calls a 'crazy man' pushing through
fundamental change that is 'off the process' or separate from the main
effort to update production technology.
For the layman, a look inside a highbay warehouse at work might easily bring
on an attack of 'technofear'. Deciding the right combination of the
available technologies, organising equipment purchases from a big range of
mainly continental suppliers, and taking turnkey responsibility for the
warehouse and its integration with production is a challenging task.
Over the past five years, one of the most important developments in European
warehousing has been in attitudes to computer control. Centralised systems
controlling all the details have been found to be too costly and
time-consuming, leading to a trend towards decentralisation with
self-contained computer systems for separate warehouse functions passing up
only the necessary data to the main computer.
AGVs, the driverless warhorses of modern warehouses, are also changing, with
the traditional wire guidance system being replaced by more sophisticated
controls. These could either be a robot-style teaching method, where the AGV
repeats a movement automatically after being taken through it manually; or
through vision systems which enable the AGV to recognise a pre-programmed
route.
But prospects for further applications of robots in warehouses are limited.
While well-established, and increasingly reliable, at picking and placing
layers of goods, they still have difficulty adapting to the huge variety of
goods found at an average warehouse.
Consequently, the trend in warehousing towards fast delivery of small
quantities of goods at high frequencies can be hard for a robot to handle,
although they are making a mark in niche markets such as in pharmaceutical
warehouses, where packages are more uniform.
Companies like Haden and Miebach spend a lot of time talking to robotics
suppliers in the hope of pushing for improvements, but the real problem,
says Miebach, is that 'we have not come across the warehouse robot that can
imitate the movement of the human hand'.
Sometimes, though, there are occasions when no mechanical solutions are
necessary. 'There have been times when we've told a client to paint a few
lines on the floor, buy a PC with a warehouse management program, and the
problem will be solved,' says Haggett.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Business Law: Need to rethink Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One year after the failed Moscow coup, western attitudes towards reform in
Russia under President Boris Yeltsin are changing.
At first, emphasis was placed on 'shock' economic reforms advocated by the
International Monetary Fund and on the efficiency of Korean, Taiwanese and
German economic reform models, as if these models were relevant.
The need for massive western aid was justified by suggesting that the fate
of democracy in Russia (and other former Communist bloc countries) would
ultimately be determined on the economic front.
The advocates of the IMF approach - rapid introduction of mass privatisation
and liberalisation of the entire economy - believed that it was necessary to
push through unpopular economic measures.
The Russian dissenters - parliamentarians and the old-line Soviet industrial
elite - said that the IMF's prescriptions were too simplistic. They pointed
out that it took centuries to develop the western capitalist economies. And
their research showed that there were strong non-market elements such as
subsidies and protectionist tariff barriers involved in growth in Korea and
Taiwan, for example.
They also argued that successful western (and Asian) economies are mixed and
pluralistic. There are large public sectors, unions, pressure groups and so
on that do not yet exist in Russia.
The elite's criticisms were, to a large extent, valid, and since spring this
year they have succeeded in slowing down the reforms pressed on President
Yeltsin by the IMF.
Convertibility of the rouble has been deferred; the industrial elite has
returned to positions of ministerial power and to the Russian central bank;
energy price liberalisation has been postponed; and new credits have been
approved for Russian industry - increasing the budget deficit and
aggravating inflationary pressures. There is even talk in Moscow of a change
of government before the end of September.
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations and the IMF are now
reconsidering their approach to Russia. Their reported consideration of
increased direct financial aid from western governments fails to take into
account the emerging view that the success of economic reform in Russia (and
elsewhere in eastern Europe) may depend on constitutional and political
reform.
Many Russians have concluded that Russia's economic reforms (and those of
the other CIS republics) cannot succeed without strong government. This
means strong governments in each of the republics and, more importantly, a
strong co-ordinating central government in Moscow.
Former President Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to put together an almost
US-style federalism was correct. Perestroika - intended to strengthen Soviet
central authority through elimination of inefficient Communist party
political control and the introduction of local autonomy - was and is the
only right answer to the realities of the ex-Soviet Union.
Recent efforts to prepare the Soviet auto industry for privatisation support
a federal approach. There are tens of car and truck plants spread across a
number of republics and organised in a mutually dependent system. A car or
truck cannot be assembled in Moscow without parts from other plants.
Privatisation is impossible as long as plant managers do not work together.
Furthermore, the auto industry is simply too big to be privatised right
away. Yet, there is a great deal of modern equipment, a large and expanding
internal market and good prospects for increased exports.
In the auto industry - as in others - central governmental assistance to
maintain the output of the principal plants, credit to permit acquisition of
important spare parts and transitional tariff protection are necessary. This
needs to be co-ordinated from the centre.
Russia cannot move forwards on the basis of economic guidance alone. Yet,
until now, the G7 nations have turned over the whole of the Russian problem
to the IMF. This has been a mistake. The IMF has no answer to the present
situation in Russia.
The G7 countries need to provide another kind of advice - to move towards a
form of 'political conditionality' in the Russian situation. This would mean
encouraging strong government as a prerequisite to financial and other
assistance.
The west should not operate competing embassies and offices in each of the
republics of the CIS - accepting as a fait accompli the complete collapse of
the Soviet Union as a political entity. On the contrary it should be
pressing Russia and the other republics to study and adapt relevant
political models - ranging from the Swiss cantonal system through the
Canadian and EC confederations to the US federal model.
Without something like the US constitution's commerce clause - establishing
federal supremacy in matters involving interstate commercial relations - the
ex-Soviet Union's economy will suffer badly. It is a single economy and must
be treated as such by the political system.
If a 'commerce clause' approach is not adopted, economic chaos, civil war
and eventual intervention by the military may be the result.
Therefore, at this stage in Russia's transition from communism, political
and constitutional reform should receive a higher priority than it has to
date.
What are the implications of all this for the west?
First, the impulse to react by seeking to increase direct economic aid
should be resisted by the G7. The problem in Russia (and elsewhere in
eastern Europe) is not money. Investments and foreign assistance would
largely be wasted under current conditions.
Moreover, there is a danger that the present Russian government is placing
too much confidence in foreign economic counsel. If the results are a
failure - as is likely without necessary constitutional and political change
 -Russia will be disillusioned and bitter.
Already Russian leaders such as Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi have
expressed a desire to go it alone. Western governments need to listen to
these voices.
Second, as President Yeltsin enters a period of maximum danger - not unlike
that which preceded Mr Gorbachev's downfall - the G7 leadership should not
be reluctant to support the creation of a strong federal government in
Moscow, even at the risk of further deviation from the IMF's usual nostrums.
The west should begin to give advice on possible legal and constitutional
reforms before it is too late. Such advice should not be given through the
IMF. A new forum needs to be created. The G7 should encourage the Russians
themselves to recruit a small multinational group of pragmatic political
advisers to work with the Russian presidency, the Russian Supreme Soviet and
the leadership of other ex-Soviet republics to bring forward new
possibilities for creation of a federal constitutional and legal system in
the former Soviet Union.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Technology: Multimedia and the consumer - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'multimedia' clans gathered recently in the Japanese resort of Hakone
intent upon participating in the birth of a huge new market for products
that exploit the confluence of electronics and the arts.
Each of the 100 or so delegates representing leaders in the graphic arts,
the computer industry, publishing, consumer electronics and film all
appeared confident that by forming partnerships they can create products
with vast potential.
Yet they stumbled in attempting to identify future uses of multi-media, and
puzzled over how to charge customers for yet-to-be-defined products and
services.
After years of such industry gatherings, initially attracting computer and
consumer electronics executives but now drawing a more diverse crowd,
multimedia is still a solution looking for a problem; an intriguing
combination of technologies that has yet to find a commercial outlet.
Delegates in Japan were quick to congratulate each other on being
'visionaries' by their mere presence at the conference, but there was a
somewhat snooty presumption that consumers are not visionary because they
may be reluctant to purchase the 'new media' products of the future.
It was broadly suggested that 'consumers will not determine' the success of
new technologies and that industry must lead the consumer into the future.
This, despite the obvious absence of direction within the multi-industry
group and the failure of most consumer electronics companies to come up with
successful new products over the past few years.
Neither have the personal computer companies much to crow about. With PC
hardware now reduced to a 'commodity', they rely almost entirely upon the
ingenuity of semiconductor suppliers and software developers to provide
evolutionary improvements in their products as the early flare of the 'PC
revolution' fades.
Both industry segments desperately need a new generation of products to
boost their fortunes. So it is hardly surprising that they should promote
the exciting potential of multimedia.
In an attempt to make the Hakone conference an important step along the way
to the 'convergence' of multimedia industries, John Sculley, chairman of
Apple Computer, produced a list of six proposals that all participants were
supposed to etch into their corporate agendas:
Hardware makers, such as Apple, will need to create a 'platform' for
multimedia. Apple itself vowed to increase sharply production of computers
with compact disk capacity.
The hardware and software industries should establish a 'New Media Centre'
that would provide facilities for experimenting with technologies and space
for artists to increase the flow of software for these technologies.
Diverse companies should exchange more information electronically in a
'Virtual Forum'. As a first step, Sculley announced that Apple will open up
its electronic mail services to other systems to encourage communication.
The technology industry should create 'hypernetworks'; communications
systems that speed the convergence of text, graphics, video and sound.
A working group should be established to devise standards for the
publication, sale and distribution of multimedia materials and propose
updates to intellectual property laws to fit the new technologies.
The industry should refine multimedia technology for educational
applications. In the future, Sculley suggested, the 'haves and have-nots'
will be defined as those who do or do not have access to multimedia
technology.
As these proposals demonstrate, there are many hurdles to be overcome before
multimedia can reach its full potential in the marketplace. Inter-industry
partnerships may be important, yet in the self-congratulatory atmosphere of
Hakone there is a danger that this industry intelligentsia may loose sight
of its ultimate goal - the consumer.

FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Repsol registers static profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy conglomerate, yesterday reported
practically static profits for the first half of 1992, an effort it
considered 'extremely positive' considering the dire straits of some of its
larger rivals in the oil industry.
Net profits for the first six months, Repsol said, were Pta40.6bn (Dollars
4.3bn). The company said it had been able to hold profits steady in spite of
falls of 50 per cent in margins at its oil refining and petrochemicals
operations.
This had been helped by a sharp increase in operating profits in Repsol's
gas distribution businesses, from Pta7.3bn in the first six months of last
year to Pta9.3bn; a 102 per cent increase in operating profits in
exploration and production to Pta10.2bn; and slow cost growth helped by the
loss of some 1,000 jobs in the first half.
This should encourage Repsol to continue with a cautious policy of opening
itself up to wider share ownership. More than 30 per cent of the group is
owned outside of the state and Repsol recently completed a very successful
convertible bond offering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Net asset value at Alliance Trust fell 6 per cent to Pounds 14.48 over the
six months ended July 31 1992, slightly less than the drop in the FT-A
All-Share index.
In the UK, where 51 per cent of the portfolio was held, the share prices of
the trust's holdings kept up well compared with the indices, but in the US
currency had been a negative influence. The exposure to the Japanese market
was minimal.
On the revenue side the half year produced a reduction from Pounds 17.5m to
Pounds 16.8m in the total. That reflected some increase in dividend
revenues, offset by the adverse effect of the weak dollar on US income and
of lower interest receivable on cash deposits. Earnings per share worked
through at 22.74p (23.33p) and the interim dividend is again 14p.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Broker seeks winding up of Alliance
Resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIROZENTRALE Gilbert Eliott, the London stockbroker, has filed a petition to
wind up a natural resource company which it brought to the market just last
year.
The broker claims that Alliance Resources, a Louisiana oil and gas producer
floated in March 1991 at 40p, owes it Pounds 38,346 for services rendered.
In July of this year, the broker served a 21-day demand for payment upon the
company, which it says 'remains unanswered and unpaid'.
Thus, Gilbert Eliott alleges in the petition, 'the company is insolvent and
unable to pay its debts. In the circumstances, it is just and equitable that
the company should be wound up.'
Mr Stuart McCullock of Lovell White Durrant, solicitors to Alliance, said he
was unaware of any such petition.
Gilbert Eliott refused to comment on the case, while Mr John O'Brien,
Alliance chairman, was unavailable yesterday.
Alliance was originally a Canadian company called United North American
Resources. In December 1990, shareholders approved a reorganisation plan to
allow the firm to come to Britain under the name Alliance. A petition was
lodged to dissolve UNAR after its assets were transferred to Alliance.
Alliance was capitalised at Pounds 8.8m in its London flotation. The shares,
which hit a low of 7p in April, closed steady last night at 10p.
In May of this year, Mr O'Brien, managing director of Manx Petroleum, became
the company's new chairman. Manx is now in negotiations to take on
Alliance's assets, in return for paying off the US-based company's
creditors. Some three months ago, the Manx board voted to advance Pounds
200,000 to Alliance to meet its commitments. It is unclear whether this has
yet been paid.
Mr Algy Cluff, non-executive chairman of Manx Petroleum, said the petition
for winding up Alliance could threaten the proposed deal.
It is uncertain whether the petition has been served. The case is due to be
heard in the Royal Courts of Justice in London on October 28.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: No end in sight to the Pacific war - Philip
Coggan gives the background to the long-running dispute over the future of
PHIT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE outsider, it seems incredible that grown men can fight bitter battles
over the future of something as staid as an investment trust.
But tiny Pacific Horizon, with a market capitalisation of just over Pounds
8m, is only the latest trust to provoke a bad-tempered bout.
In one corner is Jupiter Tyndall, which has been managing the trust; in the
other is the Pacific Horizon board.
The origins of the dispute date back to the merger between Jupiter Tarbutt
Merlin and Tyndall Holdings in 1991. Tyndall was a banking and fund
management group which had made a disastrous investment in Clayton Robard,
an Australian fund manager, just before the crash. Pacific Horizon was an
investment trust in the Tyndall stable, having been created by the revamp of
an Australian investment trust in 1989.
Some would suggest that the underlying cause of the battle is the
unhappiness of those Pacific Horizon directors who were linked with the
Tyndall regime and have now left the group. Indeed, another trust in the
Tyndall stable, European Project, has sacked Jupiter in favour of Murray
Johnstone. But Mr Garnet Harrison, Pacific's chairman, dismisses allegations
of 'sour grapes', pointing out that he left Tyndall a year before the
takeover by Jupiter.
For the Jupiter side, the key questions relate to the role of the manager.
Is it right that a trust's managers should be allowed to buy shares in the
trust - and then use that stake to block a bid approved by the trust's
board? And should the managers be negotiating with potential bidders,
without the board's approval?
Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, rejects suggestions of a
conflict of interest. He says that his group has simply been trying to get
the best deal for shareholders - and importantly, warrantholders. In
addition, he says that Jupiter's most recent proposals would have resulted
in the loss of the group's management contract over the bulk of the trust's
assets. That, he argues, does not indicate self-interest.
But why is Jupiter Tyndall, with more than Pounds 1bn of funds under
management and which recently recruited Mr Leonard Licht, a top Mercury fund
manager, bothered about an Pounds 8m trust?
At the heart of the dispute are the two key issues which tend to prompt
bitter conflict in the sober world of investment trusts. The first is the
discount. Shares in most trusts trade at a discount to their net asset
value. That causes frustration for those shareholders who bought at launch -
and makes them willing to welcome proposals which narrow the discount, or
eliminate it altogether. It also provides an opening for predators, who see
the chance to buy assets on the cheap.
But this can be bad news for the managers of the trust, since a bid will
mean the loss of their fee income. In theory, the board of a trust and the
managers are completely separate - and the former should have the right to
sack the latter at any time.
In practice, many trust boards are closely linked to the management groups.
Indeed, in recent years, some trusts have been branded with the fund
manager's name, making the prospect of sacking highly unlikely.
At Pacific Horizon, the first proposal to eliminate the discount was for the
trust to merge with CST Emerging Asia, another trust in the Jupiter stable.
But that deal was rejected by the board of CST, which was independently
advised by Robert Fleming. CST's board said 'PHIT's portfolio and
performance, in terms of the decline in net assets per share since launch,
provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a merger partner.' (Pacific's
performance leaves it eighth out of 10 trusts in the sector over the year to
August 1, turning Pounds 100 into Pounds 85, according to Micropal).
The Pacific Horizon board then negotiated a takeover by Martin Currie
Pacific. But Jupiter Tyndall said the deal disadvantaged warrantholders. It
bought up a stake of 25.1 per cent in the warrants and 15.4 per cent of the
ordinary shares, in the process blocking the deal and causing Martin Currie
to withdraw in mid-June.
The summer has seen further skirmishing. Pacific Horizon said it was
dismissing Jupiter Tyndall as manager and replacing it with Baillie Gifford.
Jupiter announced it had received a bid approach (to the indignation of the
Pacific Horizon directors); but a week later said the approach had been
withdrawn.
Today seemed likely to see the showdown. Two extraordinary meetings are
being held - the first to vote on the replacement of Jupiter Tyndall, the
second on a Jupiter plan to restructure the trust and allow investors to
sell their holdings at 90 per cent of net asset value.
But Jupiter announced yesterday that 'following discussions with a number of
significant shareholders', it was dropping its proposals. Since the Martin
Currie bid won the support of more than 74 per cent of Pacific's
shareholders, perhaps that is not surprising.
Mr Duffield seems unlikely to give up, however. Other potential bidders have
been reported to be in the wings and Mr Duffield maintains that the
replacement of his group by Baillie Gifford will do nothing to eliminate the
discount (currently about 14 per cent). The future of Pacific may still be
warlike.

but the war may not be over, writes Philip Coggan.
The Pacific Horizon directors want to replace Jupiter Tyndall, which has
been managing the trust, with Baillie Gifford.
Alternatively, Jupiter Tyndall had proposed a reconstruction of the trust in
which shareholders could have received an offer worth 90 per cent of the
trust's net asset value.
Two extraordinary meetings are due to be held today, at which shareholders
will vote on the rival pro- posals. But Jupiter Tyndall said yesterday it
understood 'that a number of significant shareholders wish to support the
alternative proposals of the board of PHIT, and it has there- fore decided
that, in order to avoid further controversy, it will no longer continue to
press for the resolutions to be passed at the Second Extra- ordinary General
Meeting.' In fact, Jupiter Tyndall will not even propose the resolutions.
Victory for the Pacific Horizon board in today's votes therefore seems
certain. Mr Garnet Harrison, Pacific Horizon's chairman, said yester- day
that he was 'pleased' to hear the news.
However, Mr Harrison's victory may not be final. In July, Jupiter Tyndall
announced an approach from another investment trust which might be
interested in making a bid for Pacific Horizon. Although that approach was
then withdrawn, there have been reports of other trusts waiting in the wings
to make an offer.
Mr Harrison said yesterday 'we take the view that any potential offeror has
had plenty of time to make a bid. If there were an offeror, surely they
would have made themselves known by now.'

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Takeover Panel reviews creeper provision to
protect companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RULE by which a shareholder with more than 30 per cent of a company can
increase its stake without triggering a bid is being reviewed by the
Takeover Panel.
The so-called 'creeper provision' was brought in alongside the mandatory
offer rule in 1974. The aim was to provide some flexibility in the wake of a
rule that made a bid compulsory once a holding reached 30 per cent.
The 'creeper' allows the holder of between 30 and 50 per cent of a company's
shares to buy a further 2 per cent a year without triggering a bid.
However, in a few cases the effect has been to leave a target company under
siege even though the predator has failed to attract majority acceptance of
an offer.
For instance, Molins, the engineering group, beat off a bid from Leucadia
National, the US financial conglomerate, in 1990 only to face the
possibility that Leucadia would take control anyway. In the event, Leucadia
failed in its attempt to win board control and last November sold its 48.4
per cent to institutions at a profit.
Mr Peter Greenwood, managing director of Molins, said yesterday that he
welcomed the panel's decision to review the provision. 'Molins' experience
was that there was a real danger that a company with a major holding could
gain control on a creeping basis without paying the full value to all
shareholders.'
The provision may lower the level of acceptances a predator needs in order
to gain ultimate control. In 1990, Hartwell, the motor group, fought off a
bid from the Saudi Arabia-based Jameel organisation. But the 43 per cent
stake acquired by Jameel coupled with the prospect of it gaining eventual
control through annual share purchases and preference share conversions led
Hartwell's management to surrender - at the very price they had rejected -
less than three months after their apparent victory.
Now Hartwell is bidding nearly Pounds 26m for Trimoco, another motor trader,
from the basis of a 39.4 per cent stake following the conversion of
preference shares. No wonder Trimoco is sensitive to its shareholders
misunderstanding the term 'mandatory' offer and believing that the
compulsion is on them to sell rather than on Hartwell to offer.
The Takeover Panel said it was continually reviewing its code. The creeper
provision was being debated, but there was no overwhelming body of cases. It
was not clear if the issue was worrying enough for the rule to be tightened
up.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Arthur Lee slices into borrowings with
Pounds 7.5m disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR LEE, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic products,
is selling its loss-making bright bar division and a related steel stock
holding company for Pounds 7.5m, which will enable it to repay nearly all
group borrowings.
The company is selling Lee Bright Bars, which makes bright engineering
steels, and Bell &amp; Harwood, a specialist stockholder, to United Engineering
Steels, the joint venture between British Steel and GKN.
United Engineering has its own, much larger, bright bar division and will
also supply raw steel to Lee Bright Bars. The transaction is subject to the
Office of Fair Trading indicating there will be no Monopolies and Mergers
Commission referral.
The two companies accounted for just under 25 per cent of Arthur Lee's sales
last year. In the six months to March 31 they incurred combined losses of
Pounds 702,000, which reduced group profits to Pounds 604,000.
Mr Grahame Holland, financial director, said following the sale Arthur Lee
will concentrate on alloy and stainless steel manufacturing, plastics and
wire and plastic ropes.
He said the company had invested nearly Pounds 3m in the bright bar division
in recent years. Margins, however, were disappointing and the company would
now focus on higher value added activities.
The purchase price included Pounds 1.5m of borrowings which would be
transferred to United Engineering. Arthur Lee's net borrowings would fall
from Pounds 8m to less than Pounds 1m.
Mr Peter Lee, 57, chairman and managing director, also announced that his
roles would be split. He would continue as chairman but Mr Jim Henderson,
managing director of the steel division, would take over as group managing
director. Mr David Lee, 59, another member of the Lee family, was also
reducing his involvement in the company.
Lee Bright Bars' site in Sheffield and Bell &amp; Harwood's site in West
Bromwich are being retained by Arthur Lee and rented back to the former
subsidiaries. The rental income charged, which was not disclosed, would be a
similar size to management charges paid to Arthur Lee.

FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: 34% of Manders holders reject Kalon's
Pounds 86m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON'S hostile Pounds 85.7m offer for Manders (Holdings) took another
potentially crippling knock yesterday as Finsbury Asset Management declared
that it would not accept the bid, which closes on Friday.
In all, shareholders of 33.8 per cent of the paint, inks and property
company have now declared that they will not accept. Yesterday Manders
shares dropped 13p to 198p.
Finsbury's move follows the decision of British Steel Pension Fund, which
holds 22 per cent of the target, to publicise on Friday its non-acceptance
of the final offer. This lifted the terms from 8-for-3 to 17-for-6 with the
partial cash alternative of 14 plus 300p for six, valuing Manders' shares at
232p or 241p with the cash.
Finsbury holds just under 6 per cent of Manders. Mr Malcolm King, Finsbury
investment manager, said that the British Steel announcement had 'no effect
on our decision, only on what and when we told people'. He said that
Finsbury was not accepting the bid 'because it did not feel that the bid
terms reflected the underlying value of Manders' businesses, because it felt
that Manders did have a strategy to realise that underlying value, and
because of the all-share aspect of the bid: even with the cash alternative,
80 per cent was in shares'.
Mr King added that as the Kalon share price declined over the bid - from
110p at the launch to a static 82p yesterday - the third factor meant less
and the first more.
It is believed that Kalon has received acceptances for more than 9 per cent
of Manders.
The British Steel press office said yesterday that BSPF had decided not to
accept the offer because of the dominance of paper in a bid which was not
'high enough'. The decision was taken on the make-up of the final offer, it
said.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Head of Arlington quits BAe main board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of British Aerospace's property arm has resigned from its main
board, clearing the way for the subsidiary's eventual disposal.
In a brief statement to the stock exchange, British Aerospace said Mr
Raymond Mould, chairman of its property subsidiary Arlington, had resigned
'in order to concentrate on his role at the head of Arlington'.
A spokesman for Arlington said Mr Mould had resigned to prevent a conflict
of interest during negotiations over the company's future.
Mr Mould's resignation from the main board coincided with the expiry of his
three-year service contract, which he agreed at the time of BAe's takeover
of Arlington in 1989. The Arlington directors' contracts, which expired on
Sunday, have been rolled over until the end of the year.
Sir Graham Day, then BAe's chairman, announced in May the intention to
introduce outside shareholders into Arlington once the property market
showed clear signs of improvement.
Mr Humphrey Price, finance director of Arlington, said that the disposal or
flotation of a stake in the company was likely to be 'several years off'.
Arlington, including BAe's landbank, was likely to be valued at several
hundred million pounds, he said. Mr John Cahill, the former BTR chief
executive who has taken over as BAe's chairman, wants to refocus the group
on its profitable core military aircraft and Airbus activities. A BAe
spokesman said property was not seen as a core business for BAe, although it
would continue to play an important role in the short and medium term.
Arlington was bought for Pounds 278m to add value to BAe's surplus landbank,
which had grown after its acquisitions of Rover and Royal Ordnance. BAe saw
Arlington as a valuable source of expertise, since it is widely considered
to be the leading developer of business parks in the UK. Arlington, which
was bought at the peak of the property market in 1989, incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 19m in 1990, and in 1991 it incurred a Pounds 60m exceptional
charge due to a shortfall in the value of assets it had injected into
Burwood House Group, a joint venture with Asda, the supermarket group.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Lotus car losses triple to Pounds 15.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP Lotus, the UK sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy,
suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.7m last year, as the losses of its car
operations more than tripled to Pounds 15.8m.
The scale of the losses, revealed yesterday in the company's annual report,
has forced General Motors of the US to increase its financial commitment to
its troubled subsidiary.
GM took over Group Lotus for Pounds 22.7m in 1986. It has been forced to
pump in Pounds 18m to repair the Lotus balance sheet during 1991 including
the provision of Pounds 11.5m in new equity with the remainder coming in
subordinated debt.
The company has been hit by recession in its two main markets, the UK and
the US, but the biggest blow has been the commercial failure of its Lotus
Elan sports car.
Two months ago Lotus announced it was ceasing production of the Elan, its
main product, less than two-and-a-half years after the car was launched.
Group Lotus losses have grown from Pounds 2.1m in 1988 to Pounds 4.4m in
1989, Pounds 12.7m in 1990 and Pounds 14.7m last year on a turnover of only
Pounds 87.5m. According to the annual report the losses of the car
operations jumped from Pounds 4.6m in 1990 to Pounds 15.8m last year on a
turnover of Pounds 43.2m.
The cutbacks of the car operations masked the success of the Group Lotus
engineering consultancy and vehicle testing operations which increased
profits to Pounds 5.95m, from Pounds 1.56m a year earlier, on a turnover of
Pounds 44.3m, largely thanks to increased work from North America.
The scale of the overall group pre-tax loss was reduced by exceptional
profits of Pounds 5.5m (of which Pounds 3.53m was credited to the profit and
loss account) arising from the sale of its Millbrook Land subsidiary for
Pounds 7.8m in cash.
It also took a pension contribution holiday throughout 1991.
The exceptional profits were offset by redundancy costs totalling Pounds
2.3m.
The withdrawal of the Elan will lead to around 350 redundancies from the
company's 507-strong Lotus Cars workforce in Hethel, Norfolk.
In the first six months of this year Lotus car output has dropped by two
thirds to only 505 from 1,559 in the same period last year. Production
totalled 2,240 in the whole of 1991.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Argos held back by costs of new chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM profits of Argos, the catalogue retailer, fell 11.3 per cent to
Pounds 9.5m pre-tax. The group said profits would have risen but for the
costs of an experimental chain of furniture shops.
Mr David Donne, chairman, said sales since the start of the second half in
mid-June, had shown 'a slight improvement and are marginally positive on a
comparable basis'. He said this might mean the low point in consumer
spending had been reached. The interim dividend was increased by 4.8 per
cent to 2.2p and Argos shares rose 15p to 219p.
Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said it was too early to forecast Christmas
trading, when the group makes most of its profits.
Argos, which was demerged from BAT Industries in 1990, said the Chesterman
chain of four furniture shops had lost Pounds 2.25m in the first half in
pre-opening costs and trading losses. This was Pounds 2m more than in the
comparable period. Without that both trading and pre-tax profits would have
risen.
Mr Smith said that Chesterman had not done as well as hoped. Research
suggested low awareness of the stores among furniture buyers and an
advertising change was planned.
He said that Chesterman's losses in the second half were likely to be of the
same order as the first half. There would also be provisions of Pounds 1m to
Pounds 1.5m in the 1992 figures to cover reorganisation of the Argos
distribution system.
Group sales in the 24 weeks to June 13 were 3.4 per cent higher at Pounds
331.8m. However, sales area increased by 4.3 per cent and comparable store
sales were 0.9 per cent lower.
The autumn/winter catalogue was launched two weeks ago. Mr Bob Stewart,
finance director, said that, of the goods which had been repeated from the
previous catalogue, 80 per cent were at the same price or cheaper.
Trading profits fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.3m, as costs such as staff
and rents rose faster than sales. However, interest received on the group's
cash - which averaged Pounds 88m in the first half compared with Pounds 59m
in the same period of 1991 - rose from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 4.2m.
After a tax rate of 35.2 per cent, up from 33.6 per cent, earnings per share
were 2.08p, down from 2.4p.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Ercros collapse followed cutback of funds by Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAITI government appears to have been directly responsible for
triggering the collapse of Spain's biggest chemicals group, Ercros, and a
credit crisis at its third largest developer, Prima Inmobilaria, by cutting
short a massive transfer of funds for 1992 to the Spanish industrial and
property assets of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
A confidential schedule of payments shows that between February 4 and June 2
this year the KIO passed nearly Dollars 700m to the Grupo Torras, its
Spanish holding company. However, the transfers were not considered as fresh
capital by the Kuwaiti authorities and the Finance Ministry, over-riding the
Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA, the KIO's governing body) decided they
should be stopped or dramatically curtailed.
It is understood that the KIO is increasingly responsible directly to the
Finance Minister, Mr Nasser al-Rawdan, who has just published a tough 1993
budget, more than halving the 1992 deficit.
The funds transferred were for a variety of capital and interest payments by
Torras and its affiliates.
They included Dollars 55m to the Caja Madrid savings bank on February 7,
Dollars 60m to Barclays Bank on February 11, Dollars 300m to Banco Santander
on February 28, Dollars 68m to Bank of America on March 25, Dollars 100m to
Chase Manhattan two days later and a further Dollars 21m to Chase on April
6.
The schedule of payments was agreed at a meeting in Kuwait on January 24
this year between the KIA, KIO, and the former management of Torras, whose
interests include large foods, paper and property companies.
This followed a pessimistic report to the KIA last December on the Spanish
assets by the KIO's auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, recommending a Dollars 1bn
cash injection for Torras.
The schedule reveals for the first time the scale of assistance that was
being given to the KIO businesses in Spain before a new KIO president, Mr
Ali-Rashaid Al-Bader, was appointed in May.
Since the transfers were interrupted, Spain's biggest chemicals company,
Ercros, which is 39 per cent owned by Torras, has gone into receivership and
Prima, the property group 33 per cent owned by Torras, has had to negotiate
a two-month moratorium on capital repayments to creditor banks.

FT  18 AUG 92 / Banking on a market for loans: The spread to Britain of the
growing US trade in the debt of companies in financial difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies can be certain who holds their bonds or shares. Trade in these
securities is so frequent that companies have difficulties keeping track of
their owners. But a company could traditionally be certain of the identity
of one source of its funds - its banks.
If a bank or banking syndicate provided a loan, these banks would hold the
loan to maturity - that was axiomatic. But not any more, as UK-based
advertising group WPP recently found.
WPP has been attempting to reach agreement with its shareholders and lenders
on a refinancing plan to tide it over the recession in the advertising
industry. Agreement was finally reached on August 6.
However, in the preceding weeks, Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive,
found that one of his biggest bank lenders, Bank of New York, had sold its
Dollars 80m (Pounds 41.8m) share of a WPP loan to 12 financial institutions
 -at a price of 65 cents in the dollar.
Within days, one of the 12 buyers passed on the loan at a price of 68 cents
for a quick profit. The bank loan appeared to be trading like a securitised
financial asset.
Three other banks, including the Austrian bank Credit Anstalt, also sold
their participation in the WPP loan. In all, around Dollars 160m was traded,
or 15 per cent of WPP's gross debt.
WPP is one of a handful of UK-based companies whose loans have been traded
in this way. Others are Brent Walker, the financially stretched leisure
group, Polly Peck, the collapsed international trading company, and the late
Mr Robert Maxwell's companies.
However, in the US a substantial market in 'value impaired' corporate loans
 -or loans to companies in financial difficulties - has developed. Brokers
estimate that such loans with a face value of between Dollars 100m and
Dollars 200m are traded every week.
The market in the US has developed over the past two years, as the 1980s
boom in bank financing of takeovers and buy-outs has been followed by a glut
of companies facing difficulties in servicing their debt.
The development of the market has been a natural successor to the market in
loans to less-developed countries, which is now well-established.
Like any market, this one depends on a diversity of views about the value of
the assets. If a bank has made a loan to a company which subsequently gets
into difficulties, the bank is forced by regulators to make a provision to
cover possible losses on the loan.
However, another financial institution - usually a specially created fund
rather than a bank - may take the view that the underlying value of the loan
is more than that implied by the provision. So this institution may bid more
for the loan than the value attributed to it in the bank's accounts.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is one of a handful of brokers -
others are Bear Stearns, Oppenheimer, Jefferies and BDS Securities - which
dominate the US market.
A parallel market is developing in the UK and Goldman has one executive in
London working on such deals. But there have been obstacles to a similar
corporate loan market in the UK.
Bankers say that widespread doubts about the reliability of UK company
accounts hinder trade since potential buyers of UK loans cannot easily
evaluate the risk attached to the loan.
The big UK clearing banks are also nervous about appearing to give a higher
priority to the management of their balance sheets than to maintaining
long-standing relationships with clients.
'The thought of doing such a deal has crossed my mind,' said Mr Roger Byatt,
a senior executive of National Westminster Bank. 'But it would be contrary
to what we are seeking to do here (build relationships).'
However, Mr Richard Carden, of Barclays, said: 'It would not surprise me if
a market developed.' The Bank of England said it had no strong objection to
trading in the loans.
An attempt to create a UK market is being made by a specialist broker, set
up last year, called Klesch &amp; Co. It is owned by Mr Gary Klesch, the
financier embroiled in a long lawsuit against British &amp; Commonwealth.
Klesch &amp; Co broadcasts the price of more than 60 corporate loans via
Telerate, the electronic financial information service. Many of these
companies are not in receivership and the stock market attributes a value to
their shares - which is curious, because if their bank loans are genuinely
worth less than 100p in the pound, equity in these companies should be
valueless.
As a result, some companies are unhappy at suggestions that their bank debt
has traded at less than par. One is Eurotunnel, builder of the Channel
tunnel, which recently said it had no knowledge of any substantial trades in
its debt at a discount.
Mr Klesch, whose firm has been quoting a price of 75p in the pound for
Eurotunnel, says Eurotunnel would not necessarily be aware of the trading
and insists his firm has done 'Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m' of Eurotunnel loan
sales.
Selling a loan is not simple. Complex contracts need to be drawn up and
there is a gap of at least a month between agreement on a deal and its
completion.
During that time, the buyer or the seller may back out. This lack of
'immediacy' is reflected in a wide spread between the buying and selling
price, the 'turn' which goes to the broker. A broker will make at least 1
per cent on the deal and possibly up to 4 per cent - so gross profits on
deals can run to millions of pounds.
There is a separate complication to such sales of corporate loans. WPP's
original borrowing agreements contain a clause that loans can only be
re-assigned with the permission of the company. The clause also says that
such agreement will not be 'unreasonably withheld'.
Mr Sorrell felt it was reasonable to withhold permission for the
reassignment of bank loans while he was negotiating the refinancing package.
He faced enough difficulties persuading his existing creditors to back the
deal without the added complexity of having to persuade a new set of
financial institutions.
Although Bank of New York and the others were unable to reassign the loans,
they were able to pass on their 'sub-participations' in the loans. This is
not the contradiction it appears. What it means is Bank of New York was able
to pass on its economic interest in the loan by drawing up a complex
contract. The risk and reward of holding the WPP loan was passed on to the
12 buyers.
Companies may not like the idea of their bank debt being passed around like
shares - but there is probably little they can do to stop it.
