FT  15 AUG 92 / Publication of Retail Newsagent is blocked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A ROW between newsagents and The Daily Telegraph over the share of the
newspaper's cover price kept by agents has led to a block on the
distribution of a trade magazine.
Retail Newsagent yesterday failed to overturn an injunction banning
distribution of this week's issue.
The dispute arose after the Telegraph unexpectedly cut its trade discount to
25 per cent on the Saturday newspaper only, starting last Saturday, at the
same time as its price rose 20 per cent to 60p. Newspapers are normally sold
to agents at a discount of 26.5 per cent on the cover price.
Some shopkeepers responded by reducing their orders for the paper or keeping
copies off shelves in protest.
Late on Thursday The Daily Telegraph was granted an injunction against the
magazine, banning distribution of this week's issue, which carried articles
advising its readers not to sell The Daily Telegraph today. A front-page
editorial comment said: 'Don't touch it with a bargepole'.
The injunction also prohibited the National Federation of Retail Newsagents
from encouraging its members to boycott the paper.
Mr Steve Brennan, editor of Retail Newsagent, which has a circulation of
more than 17,000, yesterday accused The Daily Telegraph of showing 'total
disregard' for press freedom. He said: 'We must have the right to advise our
individual readers to take whatever action they feel is in the best
interests of their business.'
Because the cover price of the Saturday edition of the newspaper has risen,
newsagents will get slightly more in cash terms from each copy sold under
the new rate, but they are concerned that other newspapers will follow suit,
squeezing profit margins already affected by the recession.
In 1990 the Daily Mirror cut newsagents' discounts from 28 per cent to 26.5
per cent. It was followed immediately by The Sun and within months by all
the other papers.
Newspapers are not allowed to consult about whether competitors will follow
suit when one cuts margins. The Independent raised its Monday-to-Friday
cover price to 45p last week but maintained margins, indicating that it is
not certain that other papers will follow The Daily Telegraph. The Daily
Telegraph would not comment yesterday.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Rabin pledges to complete work on settlement units
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>

THE concession made by President George Bush to secure this week's
rapprochement with Israel became clearer yesterday when Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, returned home boasting of the extent of settlement
building in occupied Arab territories despite US conditions for Dollars 10bn
in US loan guarantees.
At a press conference at Tel Aviv airport, Mr Rabin said: 'I don't know what
you mean when you talk about freezing settlements if one talks about
continued building on 11,000 housing units in the territories.' All that had
been cancelled, he said, were some 6,000-7,000 units on which work had not
started and anyway had no 'practical possibility' of being built.
Mr Rabin added that even with the cancellation of those units he had never
known such an intense period of settlement building activity.
The Palestinians and other Arab delegations have demanded a total freeze on
settlements as a pre-condition for progress at the peace talks due to resume
in Washington in just over a week. Mr Rabin's boasts that he secured the
loan guarantees despite intense settlement building in the West Bank and
Gaza, together with the departure of Mr James Baker from the State
Department, seem certain to increase Arab suspicions about US priorities and
its intentions towards the peace process.
The US had refused to grant the government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, defeated in
the June elections, the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees until it halted
building settlements which the administration said were a major obstacle to
the Middle East peace process.
However, this week Mr Bush urged Congress to approve the loan guarantees,
apparently as a result of Mr Rabin's pledge not to build more settlements
beyond those already under construction. The reconciliation between the US
and Israel was presented as a foreign policy triumph for Mr Bush in his
uphill battle to win re-election.
Neither the US nor Israel has yet made public the details of the agreement,
a key element of which may be the amount the US will deduct from the loan
guarantees if Israel completes the 11,000 units said to be already under
construction. Under a compromise formula discussed with the Shamir
government the US planned to deduct the entire cost of the new settlements
from the loan guarantees. Mr Rabin made no mention of this yesterday.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Joint bid for European air traffic control system
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Europe's biggest electronics groups, Siemens of Germany and
Thomson-CSF of France, are joining forces to bid for the contract for the
new integrated European air traffic control system.
The two have for some time been in talks over the terms of their joint
venture: it will be handled by Siemens' air traffic control management
division and by its French partner's defence and control systems subsidiary.
Europe air traffic is notoriously congested. Officials at the Inter-national
Air Transport Association (Iata) have warned that the network faces
'meltdown' in which a technical hitch could lead to delays bad enough to
leave pilots aircraft stranded at the wrong airports.
Iata and Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based body responsible for co-ordinating
air traffic control across the continent, are working together to establish
an improved air traffic control system by 1995-6.
Siemens and Thomson-CSF are likely to face stiff competition for the
contract from IBM, the US computer company. The initial contract, estimated
to be worth FFr500m (Pounds 52m), involves supplying 500 work stations for
the air traffic controllers under the aegis of Eurocontrol.
The long-term project could be worth between FFr10bn and FFr20bn over the
next 10 to 15 years.
Thomson-CSF has won contracts recently for air traffic control equipment at
Athens airport and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US INDUSTRIAL production rebounded modestly last month, after a dip in June,
but the underlying trend was flat, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday.
Production rose 0.4 per cent last month largely as a result of a rebound in
coal mining - which was depressed in June by a rail strike - and higher
output at utilities. The increase reversed a 0.4 per cent fall in June and
left industrial output 0.8 per cent higher than a year ago.
Manufacturing output was statistically unchanged after a 0.2 per cent
decline in June.
The figures are consistent with a raft of recent data indicating the US
economy is caught in a no man's land: it is neither showing signs of lapsing
back into recession nor responding to repeated cuts in interest rates.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York brokerage,
said the figures pointed to growth at an annual rate of 1.5-2 per cent, a
disappointment for the Bush administration which had hoped for growth of 3
per cent or more in the approach to the November presidential election. In
most past recoveries from recession the economy has grown at annual rates of
5 per cent or more.
Production was weak in most industrial sectors last month with falls in
output of motor vehicles, consumer appliances, defence and space equipment.
Yesterday's figures followed reports earlier this week indicating sluggish
consumer demand. Retail sales rose 0.5 per cent last month after a 0.3 per
cent drop in June.
Inflation figures, however, were encouraging. The consumer price index rose
only 0.1 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in the year to July. Many
analysts expect inflation to fall below 3 per cent in the coming year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHEDULED negotiations between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund
over targets for the country's stand-by accord have been put on hold until
the government can implement cost-cutting measures. Brazil has been unable
to meet targets for cutting the public deficit laid out in the agreement,
signed in January.
A good bill of health from the IMF is fundamental for implementation of
Brazil's accord with international creditor banks, since IMF funds are
needed to supply part of the collateral for the debt repayment scheme.
The government has offered a fiscal reform package, including a tax reform
and simplification proposal and a series of constitutional amendments that
President Fernando Collor de Mello says are needed before the administration
can seriously reduce public spending.
These efforts are hindered by the country's political crisis, as a
congressional inquiry into corruption charges against the president's
campaign treasurer may lead to efforts to impeach Mr Collor.
Meanwhile, Mr Collor has asked the 'silent majority' to demonstrate its
support for him by wearing the colours of the country's flag tomorrow .
But a recent opinion poll in Sao Paulo, by Data Folha, showed that 65 per
cent rated the president's performance in office bad or terrible, opposed to
12 per cent who characterised it as excellent or good.
However, the apparently desperate gesture comes as a growing number of
observers are predicting that Mr Collor can weather efforts to impeach him.

FT  15 AUG 92 / Boris Yeltsin's troublesome deputy waits serenely for call
to power: Alexander Rutskoi explains his broadsides against radical reforms
to Leyla Boulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi displays the serene
self-confidence of a man whose time has finally come.
Delivering the benefits of eight months of sniping at the government's
radical economic reforms, a recent opinion poll suggested for the first time
last month that he had become more popular than President Boris Yeltsin.
As the fate of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, hangs in the
balance, he and the 'constructive' Civic Union opposition group he backs are
certain their calls for a new cabinet and more gradual reform will soon
prevail.
But this Afghan war hero with a taste for sculpture says that at 44, he is
in no hurry to replace Mr Yeltsin, who has already declared he will stand
down at the end of his current presidential term. 'If I serve two terms with
President Yeltsin, I will be 53 years old. What's that for a politician?' he
told the FT this week.
His airy Kremlin office features a bust of Peter the Great, the great
reforming Tsar, a row of model Soviet airplanes and a Sotheby's catalogue -
reflecting the eclectic tastes of the air force general who is in charge of
reforming Russian agriculture.
His motto of 'liberal reform and strong rule' inspired by Pyotr Stolypin,
the great Tsarist prime minister who combined strong-arm rule with ambitious
land reform, Mr Rutskoi claims Mr Gaidar's 'shock therapy' is leading Russia
to revolution and disaster.
He believes Russia must abandon financial austerity policies agreed with the
International Monetary Fund and rely more on its own resources if it cannot
get unconditional help from the west. 'Dancing for the IMF has buried our
investment-credit policy,' he charges.
By way of argument, he rattles off a host of figures on the fall in
production. Asked why he favours the appointment of a new cabinet (an aide
claims this is just a matter of weeks away), he picks up a weekly report on
inflation by Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister. 'I am going to
invite Nechayev here and give him 335 roubles to see if he can buy a week's
shopping as this report claims it is possible to do.'
The flaws in his arguments appear only when he is challenged on how he would
deliver alternatives. He advocates either methods from the past which have
already proven to be inadequate (planning the distribution of natural
resources) or remedies which the new government is already trying (such as
attracting foreign investment).
'He is so simplistic, a typical military man,' said one foreign diplomat
with experience of military regimes.
His extravagant criticisms - typical of many ambitious Russian politicians
who are free from real responsibility - have in themselves done much to
undermine the present government. His aides argue, however, that he has done
President Yeltsin a favour by chanelling public discontent away from the
extreme neo-communists and fascists who find so much in common in
post-communist Russia.
From his military past, when he flew missions in Afghanistan and was
eventually taken prisoner by mujahideen guerrillas, the dapper
vice-president believes in working out a clear cut strategy and marching
towards it.
For this reason, he argues that Mr Yeltsin must have more power to pursue
reforms - a path which the president has already tried without going as far
as abolishing the backward parliament which has stood in his way.
Although no easy task in a country where the vice-president can tell the
nation that the government is committing 'economic genocide', Mr Rutskoi is
probably also right about the need for more 'ideological work' to explain
market reforms to the people.
'Everybody must know what they are going to get out of reforms,' says this
former communist who is now honorary chairman of his social-democratic Free
Russia Party - now one of the biggest of Russia's fledgling parties.
He speaks effortlessly in the theatrical cadences and soothing tones of a
populist leader as if he had been groomed for this role all his life ('the
Russians are a patient people, a courageous people and a good people but
their patience is not unlimited').
'This is a new kind of 'popular politics' - talking to the people in
language they understand,' explains one of his aides who says the next task
is building the vice-president's image in the west.
Although he enthuses about the need to co-operate with the west, Mr Rutskoi
also successfully seizes on a popular perception that the west has let
Russia down with help for its reforms. 'Today everybody claps Russia on the
back and says 'come on come on'. All right, but help us then. I'm sincerely
grateful to those who give humanitarian aid but it is peanuts. We need help,
but for concrete projects so that western taxpayers can see where the help
is going. Like if you build a baby-food factory, you can solve the baby-food
problem.'
In contrast, he becomes visibly angry when he talks about the former Soviet
republics. He says that Russia must act from a position of force in order to
ensure they respect the 'human rights' of Russian minorities. He claims that
it is precisely his sabre-rattling which has helped warring parties come to
the negotiating table in Moldova and South Ossetia.
'No idea is worth a child's tears,' he says, quoting Dostoevsky to condemn
what he calls 'nationalist-chauvinistic' policies pursued by newly
independent republics - such as laws in Estonia depriving Russians of the
vote or requiring that they learn the local language to hold government
office.
Similarly he argues that Russia should cut off deliveries of cheap energy to
the Baltic republics if they continue to insist on the immediate withdrawal
of Russian army units. 'They say housing for them is our problem but if it
is our problem let's export those energy supplies for hard currency and
build flats with the proceeds.'
Just like the young academic, Mr Gaidar, whose team he branded as 'little
boys in pink shorts', he has matured a lot since coming to power, making a
host of mistakes on the way.
In February for instance, a brief flirtation with the far right won him the
opprobrium of his own party. Until December he was close to General
Alexander Sterligov, a hardline neo-communist KGB officer.
Now he is open to exploitation by other forces in the Civic Union alliance,
including Mr Arkady Volsky, the wily chief of the Russian Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs who also has ambitions for high office.
Although President Yeltsin is by no means on the ropes, Mr Rutskoi offers a
package which the fickle and long-suffering Russian public seems
increasingly willing to embrace.
Extracts of this interview will be shown tonight on Channel 4's The World
This Week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP drop in German wholesale and producer prices in July will take some
of the sting out of west Germany's troublesome inflation rate and reduce the
chance of higher interest rates, private economists said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
They were commenting on Federal Statistics Office data which showed that
wholesale prices plunged 1.3 per cent in July from June and were down 0.9
per cent from a year earlier - the first year-on-year decline in two years.
The result was well below independent forecasts of a monthly rise of 0.6 per
cent and marked a sharp swing from June's year-on-year increase of 1.2 per
cent.
July producer prices fell 0.1 per cent from June and were up 1.1 per cent
year on year. That was down from a 2 per cent year-on-year rise in June and
a third of last July's 3.3 per cent rise.
Mr Ulrich Beckmann, economist at Deutsche Bank, said: 'The stronger mark and
lower import prices are the key reasons for the drop.'
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank deputy president, said on German television
yesterday that the slowing in inflationary pressures reflected in the two
indicators was 'pleasing' but warned it was due in part to import prices
weakened by the strong D-Mark.
'That is not a stability generated by domestic factors,' he said. 'It is
partly the result of import prices and exchange rates.'
Western Germany's annual inflation rate dropped to 3.3 per cent in July from
4.3 per cent in June, the lowest since May 1991. The steep decline was
caused by petrol taxes - which rose sharply last July - dropping out of the
yearly comparison.
Mr Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank would review German interest rate levels in
a few months.

FT  15 AUG 92 / French state insurers under fire on HIV cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, yesterday criticised Union des
Assurances de Paris (UAP), the state-controlled insurance group, for
threatening to withdraw its cover from blood transfusion centres which have
been implicated in a scandal over Aids-tainted blood supplies.
On Thursday morning UAP, which is France's biggest insurer, announced it was
not obliged to pay damages to people who contracted the HIV virus through
transfusions from 25 regional centres where officials allegedly failed to
notify UAP they were knowingly using infected blood.
UAP said late on Thursday that it had reversed its decision. The French
insurers' association yesterday announced that its members were extending
the transfusion centres' cover until the end of the year.
France's regional blood transfusion centres are being sued by people who
were infected with HIV after receiving transfusions, even though the health
officials involved allegedly knew the blood was infected. More than 1,200
people, mostly haemophiliacs, are known to have been infected with HIV by
transfusions - 256 have died.
Damages have been awarded to some HIV victims. Other cases are still
pending, including the case against Dr Michel Garretta, former director of
the National Blood Transfusion Centre, in which Mr Laurent Fabius, former
French prime minister, now first secretary of the ruling Socialist party,
gave evidence.
Had UAP gone ahead with its original threat, the transfusion centres would
have been forced to pay their own damages. Some centres would almost
certainly have gone bankrupt. This would have caused even more embarrassment
for the government, already under fire for the involvement of senior
socialists such as Mr Fabius in the Garretta case.
Mr Sapin yesterday condemned UAP's initial announcement saying it had been
made 'without sufficient consideration'. His public comments underlined the
strength of the government's feeling on the issue. It usually prefers to
resolve disagreements with state companies in private.

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Daily News, the New York city tabloid, seemed more
precarious than ever yesterday afternoon when its unions failed to agree on
a new owner after three days of negotiations.
The cash-strapped paper, rescued by Mr Robert Maxwell last year, has been
under Chapter 11 of the US bank ruptcy code since the month after Mr
Maxwell's death.
A creditors meeting has now been rescheduled for Monday, the day bankruptcy
court judge Tina Brozman set for the paper to produce its reorganisation
plan. Earlier this week, the creditors committee had said it would announce
its own choice among the three potential owners on Friday if the unions
failed to reach an agreement.
The paper has received bids from Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher who
owns the Daily News in London, and Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News
and World Report magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. There is also a
so-called 'stand alone' plan under which Silver Screen, a group of film
financiers, would join forces with the unions, giving them a stake in the
paper.
The creditors are reviewing revised offers from both Mr Black and Mr
Zuckerman on debt payments and a new printing plant.
In spite of yesterday's apparent impasse, Mr Fred Drasner, president of US
World and News Report, said: 'We are reasonably encouraged by the outcome
because we think we have the support of the majority of the unions.'

GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said sales rose 7
per cent in the first half to SFr1.28bn (Dollars 969m), with foundries,
piping systems and machine tools all contributing to the growth.
The board forecast that the profit for the full year would be higher than
that of 1991 provided there was no further deterioration in the economy.
Orders on hand at mid-year amounted to SFr1.02bn, down 19 per cent since the
end of last year mainly due to the closure of the Schaffhausen steel
foundry.
Sales of the foundry division in the first half were ahead of budget at
SFr520m, up 9 per cent on the same period of last year. Sales of automotive
castings benefited from relatively heavy demand from the German motor
industry.
Piping systems sales gained 10 per cent to SFr326m, with substantial growth
in demand for plastic and automation products. Manufacturing technology
sales rose 25 per cent to SFr209m, but orders for flexible machining systems
declined because of the weak investment goods market.
The plant engineering and construction division was also affected by the
weak capital goods market, but large orders for environmental protection
equipment were received.

SPAREBANKEN NOR, Norway's biggest savings bank known internationally as
Union Bank of Norway, reported yesterday that it had returned to profit in
the first half, helped by a reduction in operating costs and improved
income.
Operating profit in the first six months was NKr3m compared with a NKr284m
(Dollars 49m) operating loss in the same period last year. Operating profit,
before credit losses, rose to NKr658m, or 1.58 per cent of average assets,
from NKr408m, as credit losses dipped to NKr643m from NKr689m.
The bank said that calculated on an annual basis, credit losses represent
1.85 per cent of gross loans which were put at NKr75.06bn, a NKr13.6bn
increase over the same period last year. For the whole of 1991 credit losses
comprised 2.2 per cent of gross loans. Net interest income was up to
NKr1.34bn from NKr1.29bn.
Sparebanken Nor said operating costs were cut to NKr1.19bn from NKr1.35bn
and that staff had been reduced by 9 per cent this year. 'Work with further
staff and cost reductions continues,' it said.

THE North American Free Trade Agreement will boost US sales in Mexico's

Energy sales by US companies in Mexico at present topped Dollars 1bn out of
a total market of Dollars 8bn, and 'we see a further increase there'.
Mexico's decision to open 50 per cent of procurement by Pemex, the giant
state-owned oil company which buys Dollars 5bn worth of goods a year would
also boost US sales.
Further, US investment in Mexico was expected to rise sharply in the wake of
the agreement, which will open a significant part of Mexico's energy market
to unlimited foreign investment, Mr Easton added. Some big US companies had
already expressed interest in setting up independent power projects in
Mexico.

The opposition, which has called for an election boycott, urged Lebanese to

for August 23. The opposition said its strike call was 'a first step on the
way to opposing the imposition of the parliamentary elections.'
The Syrian-backed government of President Elias Hrawi wants to hold the
polls before Syrian troops withdraw from Beirut and surrounding areas.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Taking a shine to new remedies. Is there a cure for
baldness? Charles Arthur analyses the scientific basis of current treatments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most bald or balding people feel wigs or toupees are passe. Nowadays, a
growing number of medical or surgical techniques promise new hair - or at
least a convincing substitute. That doesn't mean they necessarily sound like
something you would try at home. The latest claimed cure being tested by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) resembles a salon hair dryer and
applies a weak pulsed electrical field of about 800 volts across the scalp
without touching it.
Apparently for social reasons, seeing a receding hairline in the mirror
worries most men. Typical 'male pattern baldness' - thinning at the crown,
followed by loss across the top of the head - is due to a combination of
ancestry (bald fathers usually lead to bald sons) and male hormones, which
eventually cause the scalp's hair follicles to shrink, spending less time
growing hair and more time quiescent.
In women, stress and immune diseases can also lead to hair loss (often
temporarily), as can the sudden hormonal changes after pregnancy. Perhaps
reflecting the increasing pressures of the modern world, a growing
proportion of clients coming to hair loss clinics, traditionally a male
haunt, are women. 'Ten years ago it would be maybe 1 to 3 per cent,' says
Richard Ingham, UK director of marketing for Svenson Hair Clinics (which has
112 outlets worldwide treating 20,000 new clients annually). 'Now it's more
like 10 per cent.'
Current Technology Corporation (CTC), the Vancouver-based company set up in
1988 to market the electrical method, has already raised Cdollars 14m
(pounds 6m) of which the company's two co-founders, Anne and Robert Kramer,
have so far spent Cdollars 9m on trials and promotions. Their financial
models say if they can get 70,000 Americans - fewer than 2 per cent of the
37m men and women who are losing hair - to take the treatments (at USdollars
12.50 pounds 6.50 weekly for nine months, and monthly afterwards), by the
second year of operation CTC will make profits of USdollars 39m on revenues
of USdollars 73m.
Still, the causes of baldness are the same everywhere. In men, incidence
increases with age; in the UK, almost 40 per cent exhibit some degree of
hair loss by 35. In women, the figure for 'excessive loss' is 30 per cent,
but not age-linked.
But capitalising on the huge US market depends on receiving full FDA
approval. For CTC, that is at least six months away; the FDA might even
proclaim the method, which the company calls Electro-Tricho-Genesis (ETG), a
dud. What then?   According to Robert Kramer, CTC's chief financial officer:
'We have started testing in other countries. And anyway, we wouldn't have
started the FDA tests if we didn't think we had a better than even chance of
passing.'  He also quotes successful studies performed by the University of
British Columbia.
Yet even FDA approval does not guarantee riches. The only baldness cure
which has so far received the FDA's nod is the drug Minoxidil, marketed in
the US by the Kalamazoo-based Upjohn Corporation under the trade name
Rogaine (and in Europe as Regaine). 'The product is a solid performer,'
insists Paul Fitzhenry, the company's European spokesman. 'Not a
blockbuster, sure, but strong.'   Last year world-wide sales totalled
dollars 143m - though only dollars 40m outside the US, despite the product
being launched everywhere in 1988. (Sales in the US were slightly up on
1990; elsewhere, slightly down.)
Both Upjohn's and CTC's cures are thought to work by stimulating blood flow
in inactive follicles, prompting them back to hair production. Oddly,
neither was originally aimed at curing baldness. CTC's ETG therapy began as
a research program to help migraine sufferers. Minoxidil began its
pharmaceutical life as an oral drug for high blood pressure called Loniten,
developed by Upjohn and launched in the US in 1977.
Among the side-effects doctors noticed with was new hair growth. Following
seven years of trials, in 1988 Upjohn launched Rogaine as a baldness cure,
to be applied externally twice daily.
The treatment, is not, however, a panacea. Only one-third of users grow back
the thick hair they wished for. Another one-third get soft, downy growth.
The rest receive no benefit at all.  'The best effects are on those who have
lost the least hair,' says Barry Monk, consultant dermatologist at the Manor
Hospital, Bedford, who specialises in the subject.
More frustrating for the user - though heartening for the company - is that
as soon as the treatment stops, the hair gain is reversed. 'You go back to
where you would have been without it,' says Monk. That means using the drug
is a commitment for life, or at least the term of one's vanity; and in the
UK, it is only available on private prescription, not through the NHS or
across the counter. 'At pounds 30 to pounds 40 per month, it's a big
commitment,' says Monk. 'There was a lot of interest at first, but now I
can't remember the last time someone came to me asking for it.'
Similarly, CTC's Robert Kramer admits that ETG is a treatment, not a cure.
'It's like diabetes,' he says. 'You get treatment on an ongoing basis.'
Comparing the natural loss of a few bits of hair to a potentially
life-threatening disease may sound like hyperbole, but probably reflects an
American attitude. 'Upjohn's market research before the launch of Regaine
indicated the British are less concerned about going bald than almost
anyone. So the price here was less than in other European countries,' says
Monk. Still, most companies see the US as the biggest potential market.
For those unwilling to make a life commitment to sprays or (if it's
approved) electricity, other alternatives include hair transplants and hair
weaving.
Transplants entail surgically removing healthy follicles from the side or
back of the head and punching them into the skin at the front. The outcome
'tends to look like a planted forest,' says Monk. The cost is in the
hundreds of pounds, though Svenson's Ingham comments: 'Once you've achieved
a successful transplant, that's it.'  Failures do occur, though, usually due
to infection of the transplanted roots.
Hair 'weaving' is increasingly popular. Surgical thread a thousandth of a
millimetre thick is woven into the bed of existing hair and then extended
and enhanced with real hair, matched for colour and texture. Its
disadvantages are that the 'weave has to be repositioned and cleaned every
month as the existing hair grows through. 'But you can do what you like
otherwise,' says Ingham.
Why, in the end, do people want a cure for baldness?  'In a recession a lot
of people are frightened about losing their job,' says Ingham. 'People who
are disadvantaged in terms of hair feel disadvantaged generally, and worry
that younger, more virile-looking men will pinch their job.'
However, Monk disagrees. 'There's a sterotyped person who goes in for such
treatments,' he says. 'To be honest, I feel thay can't face up to reality.
Most people are prepared to go bald gracefully.'

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Warm weather woes for Johnson Cleaners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARM WEATHER and recession combined to depress interim profits at Johnson
Group Cleaners, the dry cleaner and textile group, which reported a 4 per
cent fall to Pounds 7.91m pre-tax.
In a characteristically cautious statement, Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said
he expected recessionary conditions in both the US and UK to continue 'for
at least the remainder of this year'.
Nevertheless, the interim dividend is maintained at 7p for the third
consecutive year.
Mr Greer added that one of the priorities during recession had been to
protect the balance sheet. Controlled capital spending helped cut interest
charges by 36 per cent to Pounds 999,000. Gearing was slightly lower than
the 39 per cent recorded at the year-end.
Dry cleaning in both the US and UK continued to be depressed, with a similar
effect on margins. As a result profits in this division had declined rather
more than sales.
Textile rental, however, increased sales and profits in the first half. Mr
Greer said the rate of growth in textile rental was still increasing, albeit
more slowly.
Losses in the US franchise division had depeened in the first six months.
'It has been harder than we thought it would be in the US,' said Mr Greer.
'There is still no sign of a let-up in recession.'
Overall sales fell from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 74.8m, while operating
profits declined 10 per cent to Pounds 8.56m. The pre-tax return included a
Pounds 349,000 (Pounds 271,000) surplus on property sales.
Earnings per share, including the property surplus, fell from 25.42p to
24.95p.
COMMENT
For Terry Greer, the ideal summer's day is cold, cloudy and wet.
Unfortunately the first half was warm and sunny. There are some things about
which even Johnson's management can do nothing. In spite of the adverse
climate, which hits Johnson as hard as recession according to Mr Greer, the
company did well to keep the profits decline to a mere 4 per cent. The
textile rentals division deserves much credit for squeezing business out of
a market which has ravaged the likes of BET. It is not likely that Johnson
will experience a sharper fall in the second half. Indeed, analysts expect
the full year to be almost flat at Pounds 15.5m, compared with Pounds 16m.
With a prospective multiple of about 12.5, Johnson could be one of the
better shares in the sector to tuck away for the eventual upturn.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Blagden at Pounds 6m thanks to all-round
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLAGDEN Industries, the Hertfordshire-based packaging, chemicals and
protective equipment group, bucked recessionary pressures in the six months
to June 28 and lifted pre-tax profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 6m. Turnover
rose from Pounds 109.7m to Pounds 118.1m.
Mr Cameron Smith, chief executive, said he was particularly pleased that
profits improvements had been across the board and not simply led by one
division.
In packaging, the core business, international operating profits rose to
Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 4.47m) on turnover up at Pounds 62m (Pounds 59.4m),
while the UK side made Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.29m) on turnover of Pounds
20.8m (Pounds 20.5m). Volumes in the division increased 6 per cent in the
half as prices were reduced.
Mr Smith said that, having made 85 per cent of profits a few years ago, the
45 gallon steel drum business now only accounted for 65 per cent. He said he
was excited about the future of the new propellant for aerosols - compressed
air, rather than flammable gases like butane, opted for after the CFC scare.
In chemicals, 'distribution was hammered by recession', but manufacturing
accounted for the rise in profits from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2.14m on
turnover of Pounds 25m (Pounds 23.3m).
Protective equipment sales grew to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 6.56m). Mr Smith
said: 'Old companies made Pounds 500,000, new ones Pounds 300,000, minus
Pounds 300,000 written off' in one-off obsolescence costs, where Blagden
redesigned many of its ranges.
Because of the international weighting of its profits, Blagden had to write
off Pounds 600,000 of advance corporation tax, against last time's Pounds
250,000, of which Mr Smith said: 'With perfect hindsight, it should have
been Pounds 500,000.' This lifted the tax charge to 42.5 per cent (38 per
cent).
Earnings were static at 7.3p per share and, because of the tax penalty, the
interim dividend is held at 4.5p.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Mobile phone groups to cut prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VODAFONE, the cellular phone network operator, yesterday announced new
prices in an effort to bring mobile telephones to the masses.
The move followed a similar initiative by Cellnet, its main rival, aimed at
opening up a new market of non-business users.
The two groups, which dominate the UK market, are hoping to transform the
cellular phone from an expensive businessman's gadget to a more everyday
consumer item.
The new prices aim to attract customers who would like to own a mobile phone
for occasional use, but find the connection and line rental charges too
high.
Vodafone expects the market for mobile phones to grow from the current 1.3m
users to 7m - half of them non-business users - by the turn of the century.
Starting in October, Vodafone will offer a 'low cost' service with a reduced
connection charge of Pounds 30, compared with the current Pounds 50, and a
monthly line rental charge of Pounds 15, down from Pounds 25. Cellnet is
introducing a similar option from November.
Vodafone's call charges under this service, however, will be higher than
under its present tariff. The peak rate will be 54p per minute within the
M25 London orbital and 46p per minute elsewhere. The off-peak rate is 15p
per minute in all areas.
These rates compare with Vodafone's current rates of 33p per minute within
the M25 at peak times - between 7.30am and 9.30pm, Monday to Saturday - and
25p elsewhere. Off-peak rates are 10p anywhere.
Cellnet's nationwide peak rate charge under its new offer will be 50p per
minute and 20p off peak. Under its existing tariff, peak calls cost 33p per
minute within the M25 and 25p per minute elsewhere. Off-peak calls are 10p.
Vodafone is pricing handsets at Pounds 249 compared with current retail
prices of anywhere from Pounds 800 to Pounds 200. Cellnet's will also be
priced under Pounds 300.
The new pricing scheme is intended to attract people who do not plan to make
frequent calls on their mobile phones.
The higher call charges mean that anyone making at least one call a day
during peak hours is better off staying with the current scheme, Vodafone
says.
Both companies expect the new prices to attract a large number of new
customers. Cellnet estimates it will have 200,000 new customers in the first
year.
The mobile phone market has been hit by recession, and competition is
expected to increase with the launch next year of radio-based personal
communications networks and the progressive introduction of telephones using
GSM, a digital standard agreed by 17 European coun-tries.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Baker appointed election chief: Bush calls on old friend to
head campaign for the White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday finally called on Mr James Baker, his old
friend and the US secretary of state, to pull his political chestnuts out of
the fire.
On August 23 Mr Baker will become White House chief of staff, the position
he held in President Ronald Reagan's first term.
Mr Bush, conceding that many Americans were 'anxious' about the future, said
Mr Baker's prime task was to lay before the public a coherent set of
domestic, foreign and economic policies for a second term in office. To this
end he is being given sweeping powers over the campaign and policy,
including supervision of the Middle East peace negotiations.
The absence of coherence, combined with occasional hysteria in the Bush
campaign, helps explain why Mr Bush is so far behind Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, in the polls.
The deficit has narrowed little recently. The latest Washington Post/ABC
News poll out yesterday still had Mr Clinton ahead by 60 per cent to Mr
Bush's 34 per cent, a lead only one point less than its previous survey.
Mr Bush described Mr Baker as 'a committed trustee of the American interest'
and 'the sort of man you want on your team'. That team is going to be
reshaped by Mr Baker, who is bringing with him four trusted aides from the
state department, including Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the spokeswoman, Mr Robert
Zoellick, the economics expert, and Mr Dennis Ross, head of policy planning.
Mr Baker replaces Mr Samuel Skinner, who is being shunted aside to the
honorific job of general chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Mr Robert Teeter remains as nominal campaign chairman, but reporting to Mr
Baker as well as to the president. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, Mr Baker's
deputy, takes over as acting secretary of state.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said he would remain
in his job, with Ms Tutwiler as an assistant, but he waved a hand with
crossed fingers as he said so. He ducked questions about the future of other
senior White House advisers, including, on domestic policy, Mr Clayton
Yeutter.
The transfer of Mr Baker, who left the treasury department four years ago to
take over the Bush campaign, has been expected for a month. In anticipation,
Mr Clinton and other leading Democrats have said that events in the Balkans,
the Middle East and elsewhere make this the worst time for him to be
withdrawn from control over foreign policy.
Mr Clinton himself described Mr Baker as 'a talented man', adding: 'I think
they want him back because they won with him before and they obviously are a
little bit in disarray.'
Preparations for the Republican convention in Houston next week are too far
advanced for Mr Baker to change much. The party platform being drafted this
week reflects the dominance of the right wing in both social and economic
policies.
But he can be expected eventually to rein in some of the wilder assaults on
Mr Clinton and the Democrats. These have grown in virulence over the last
week to a point that may be politically counterproductive. A recent target
has been Mrs Hillary Clinton, portrayed by Mr Rich Bond, Republican national
chairman, as a radical reformer who equates marriage with slavery. Mr
Clinton has dismissed such assaults as 'pitiful' and 'pathetic'.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Italy plans capital gains tax change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new government announced yesterday it was planning to water down its
complex capital gains tax on bourse transactions as part of a package of
measures to advance its ambitious privatisation programme.
Stockbrokers have attributed part of the recent decline in equity trading to
the effects of the tax, introduced last year. At present investors can pay
one of two rates - 15 per cent or 25 per cent - according to a complex
formula which they must choose in advance.
Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, said after a cabinet meeting that
the steps aimed at 'cooling investors' desire to sell shares and reinforcing
that to buy', particularly new issues.
But he said this did not imply the government accepted that the market's
current difficulties stemmed from the tax treatment of investors.
In a seven-hour cabinet session, ministers also authorised the four public
sector groups transformed into joint stock companies last week as a first
step towards privatisation, IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA, to revalue their
portfolios.
IRI, the biggest of the four, which has consolidated debts of more than
L60,000bn (Pounds 28bn), experienced difficulty after the change of status,
because Italy's civil code forbids joint stock companies to issue debt if
their own capital is inadequate. The new decrees will allow the groups to
revalue their holdings free of tax, instantly raising their capital and
getting round the legal knot.
The new measures coincided with the decision by Moody's, the US debt rating
agency, to downgrade Italy's foreign currency borrowings. Moody's lowered
the rating for Italy, already the only one of the world's seven leading
industrialised countries not to have a top-notch triple A status, to AA3
from AA1.
Expectations of the move, which had already caused the lira to slip against
the D-Mark in foreign exchange trading earlier this week, obliged the Bank
of Italy to intervene to prevent a move against the currency.
The lira closed at L759.175 against the D-Mark, compared with L757.150 on
Wednesday, after the central bank sold DM100m and Ecu25m in a deliberate
signal of its readiness to intervene in the markets.
The government yesterday also tidied up television broadcasting concessions,
with long-awaited legislation confirming the roles of the main broadcasters,
notably the three private channels owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media
magnate.
At the same time, the cabinet approved draft laws to create a new supremo
for internal security, who will attempt to improve co-ordination between the
police, the military-style carabinieri and the guardia di finanza, Italy's
three separate police forces.
Disorganisation and rivalries between the three have in the past been blamed
for the inability to combat organised crime.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Mobiles for the masses: Michiyo Nakamoto on competition over
portable telephones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of spectacular growth, spurred by the image of the high-powered
businessman, changing conditions are forcing the mobile telephone to go
down-market. The expensive but essential business accessory of the 1980s is
set to become the mass-market consumer item of the 1990s.
The change is being ushered in this summer by a battle between the UK's two
cellular phone operators which want to bring mobile telephones to the
ordinary consumer.
Yesterday, Vodafone, owned by Racal Telecom, announced a new pricing scheme
called Low Cost Vodafone, to be launched in October. It comes in response to
a similar scheme, Cellnet Lifetime, which was unveiled by Cellnet, owned by
BT and Securicor, in June.
Vodafone's new pricing policy will mean connection charges will fall from
the current Pounds 50 to Pounds 30, and monthly line rental charges from
Pounds 25 to Pounds 15. Cellnet is likely to offer similar rates. Handsets
will also be priced at about Pounds 250 from this autumn, compared with as
much as Pounds 800 today.
In exchange for lowering these charges, the network operators are making it
more expensive for users of the scheme to make calls during peak hours.
Vodafone's new low-use tariff has a peak-time call charge of 54p a minute
inside the circumference of the M25 motorway; 46p outside. Peak hours are
7am-8pm, Monday to Friday; off-peak charges from 8pm-7am anytime during the
week are 15p a minute. Cellnet's new low-use tariff has a peak call charge
of 50p per minute for anywhere within the UK and an off-peak charge of 20p
per minute. Peak hours are from 8am to 7pm, Monday to Friday; off-peak
charges are at all other times.
The aim is to expand into the consumer and small business markets of mainly
occasional users who are keen to own a mobile phone for the convenience it
offers, but who are discouraged by the high costs of subscribing to a
service. For users who do not make many calls, the service will be cheaper,
but those making at least one peak-time call a day will find it more
expensive.
Cellnet expects to add 200,000 new subscribers to its service in the first
year after the scheme is launched in November. Vodafone predicts that with
the new low-use tariff the number of mobile phone users in the UK will
increase from 1.3m today to 7m by 2,000, of which half will be non-business
users. At the moment, only about 5 per cent of users are non-business.
'The cellular phone industry has now passed its adolescence,' says a Cellnet
representative. 'We're going from a low-volume, high-margin business to a
high-volume, low-margin one.' This direction holds out the only hope of
growth, as the business market has become saturated, he says.
The recession has played a part in the transition. Although there are some
signs that the market is picking up from its lowest point in summer 1991,
there has been a substantial loss of customers over the past year - more
customers are making fewer outgoing calls, which means lower revenues for
the operators.
'It's a middle-management and small-business recession, and those are the
people who mainly use the network,' says a Vodafone representative.
What is worse, however, is that the business market of mobile phone users
may not be growing much at all.
The overall cellular phone market grew just 7 per cent last year, compared
with growth rates of anywhere between 70 and 100 per cent in the heydays of
the late 1980s.
Cellnet believes that high-usage customers, who are more profitable for the
network operators, are already signed on to a service. New subscribers,
Cellnet is discovering, make less use of their phones.
To stimulate growth, prices would have to come down to levels acceptable to
ordinary consumers. Rates of Pounds 50 for a connection and a monthly line
rental charge of Pounds 25 are seen by many consumers as too expensive. One
City observer said that when Cellnet announced its new pricing policy, his
mother decided she could now afford to operate a mobile phone.
But simply reducing prices across the board, while it would enlarge the
market, would hurt profitability. The complicated arrangement of introducing
a different pricing scheme was necessary to lure non-business users while
keeping business customers happy on the current scheme.
Business users who do not use their mobile phones frequently are expected to
switch to the new pricing structure. Vodafone anticipates that 20 per cent
of its existing customers will migrate, meaning a drop in profits of Pounds
5m in the first year. But the company expects customers to have switched to
the new pricing scheme within two years, after which it hopes to see overall
profit growth as new customers subscribe.
Unlike Cellnet, Vodafone believes there is still room for growth in the
business market, though it is just as keen to tap the non-business market as
its rival.
Both Vodafone and Cellnet face the prospect of competing with a new mobile
system with the launch next year of Personal Communications Networks (PCNs).
These are digital radio communications networks that will link users via
radio handsets to ordinary telephone exchanges. Because they will user
smaller handsets, and will cost only about half what Vodafone and Cellnet
charge their business customers, they are expected to pose a serious threat
to current mobile telephone systems.
In addition to PCNs, the GSM system, a digital standard that has been
adopted by 17 European countries, will make a pan-European mobile telephone
system available in a few years.
PCNs are likely to pose a greater immediate threat to the UK's two existing
mobile phone operators, since it will take some time for the GSM network to
be set up. GSM handsets are also likely to be heavier and more expensive
than those currently available.
Vodafone already planned to address the PCN threat by launching a lower-cost
scheme, called MCN (microcell network), which would reduce connection and
line rental costs.
Although Vodafone stresses that the impending battle with Cellnet for more
of the consumer market is not a price war, it is clearly launching its new
pricing structure just one year before it plans to introduce MCN, because it
fears being pre-empted by Cellnet. 'We cannot afford to let the competition
offer something we don't,' Vodafone says.
With new services coming on offer over the next few years, competition is
bound to heat up even further, reducing prices and bringing mobile
telephones within reach of more people. 'It will undoubtedly be a war,' says
Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Undecided position on rent reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint, 'The 'upwards
only' price mentality' (August 6). In it he states that 'a county court has
recently held an upwards-only rent review clause void'.
Since I suspect that this relates to the recently much-publicised case
between Boots and UK Land concerning a shop unit at the Elephant and Castle
Shopping Centre, in London, I would like to clarify the position. The clause
was not declared void.
Boots was applying to renew its lease. The old lease did not contain a rent
review clause. Boots, on advice, accepted that it was now the norm to have a
rent review clause, but argued that it should not be an upwards-only clause.
The judge accepted this and quoted a previous decision: 'What is sauce for
the goose should also be sauce for the gander.'
The case in fact did not change the law. It confirmed the previous position:
where a party to a lease wishes to change the terms of that lease on
renewal, it is for that party to show that the change either reflects modern
terms or is just and reasonable in the circumstances.
What was left undecided is the position when the tenant seeks an
upwards/downwards rent review clause instead of an existing upwards-only
rent review clause. The tenant will have to prove that either it is now the
general trend for rent review clauses to allow both upwards and downwards
reviews, or that it is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of that
particular case for the change to be made.

An Australian sugar cane farmer rammed his tractor into a horse box
yesterday to rescue his pet pig Penny from government officials. Penny, a
razorback or feral pig, was being taken to a research centre after elderly
women complained that it had been attacking them.
Penny, who tips the scales at around 160kg, has a drinking problem. She
can't say no to a beer, gets drunk and gets into fights. So the board gave
Penny's owner an ultimatum; destroy her or enrol her in a breeding
programme. But when it came time to say goodbye, owner Boris Radic changed
his mind.

So who has the largest free trade area in the world - Europe or North
America? Widely reported claims that the North American Free Trade Agreement
will create the 'largest and richest' trading bloc on earth have clearly
piqued the Europeans, whose very own European Economic Area (EEA) comes into
being on January 1.
With just a hint of smugness, a European Commission official pointed out
yesterday that the 19-nation EEA would have 379m inhabitants, against
Nafta's 360m. 'Added to which, the EEA will account for half of
international trade, so it's difficult to have a larger area,' she said.
As for being the richest, the EEA countries seem to win that battle too,
with a combined GDP of nearly Ecu6,500bn: that's more than Dollars 9,000bn,
compared with the Nafta countries' Dollars 6,000bn.
Trade negotiators must be hoping that such statistical sparring will be the
only manifestation of rivalry between the two blocs.

It is not every day that the chairman of Britain's biggest bank invites the
media into his office for a drink, let alone his family home. But yesterday
Sir John Quinton, Barclays outgoing chairman, opened up his riverside pad in
leafy Bucks (four beds, three bathrooms and a Gertrude Jekyll garden) to
celebrate 10 years of Saturday opening at Barclays.
It would seem unthinkable for the banks not to open at weekends now, but
back in 1982, when Sir John led the way, it was a revolutionary move in
Britain's conservative banking industry. Barclays was the first of the big
banks to take on the building societies and its success in this area was one
of the main reasons why he won the chairmanship in May 1987. Like Deryk
Weyer before him, who was passed over for the chairmanship, Sir John was one
of Barclays' ablest bankers. It would be sad if he is remembered as the
first Barclays chairman to get his job on merit and then blew his chances.
Morgan Stanley's banking guru, Keith Brown, says that it will be another two
or three years before judgment can be passed properly on Sir John's time at
the top. Observer believes that history may be kinder to Sir John than his
current critics.

Yiannis Yiannikos, the elderly Greek publisher who has ridden to the rescue
of Pravda, once the bible of the Soviet Communist party, is making his

Yiannikos belongs to the heroic age of Greek communism. After leading a
guerrilla band in the Greek civil war in the late 1940s, he landed in jail.
Then he became a publisher of Greek translations of Soviet books, notably
the Great Soviet Encyclopaedia. In 1981, his partner in the encyclopaedia
venture, George Bobolas, launched Ethnos, a leftwing tabloid which quickly
became Greece's top-selling daily.
Yiannikos thought his publishing agreement with Bobolas gave him a
half-share in Ethnos. Bobolas disagreed. After losing a succession of court
cases, Yiannikos revealed that Ethnos was launched with money provided by
the Soviet government. It later turned out that the KGB's dirty tricks
department had been involved.
Owning Pravda will give Yiannikos a chance of scoring off Bobolas at last.
Though Bobolas still flourishes - he owns 20 per cent of Greece's most
successful private television station, Mega Channel - Ethnos's circulation
has slumped badly.

FT  14 AUG 92 / A scandal that threatens to shackle reform: India's
government is facing a difficult struggle to keep its radical economic
policies on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India's radical economic reform programme is in danger of running out of
steam. The government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao, facing a balance
of payments crisis when it took office last year, responded with a drive to
open the economy to international competition and shake the shackles of
bureaucracy from the large, inefficient public sector.
But there is a growing feeling in Delhi that the momentum has been
dissipated in recent months by a financial scandal, bureaucratic inertia and
disappointing economic performance. 'The traffic light has turned from green
to amber,' says Mr Jaswant Singh, a leading opposition politician who backs
the direction of reform but criticises its management.
All is by no means lost. Nobody is suggesting that reforms have been
irrevocably derailed. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and chief
architect of reform, insists: 'We have set out a programme and we are moving
at the pace at which we said we would move. We haven't given up anything.'
Other politicians and officials who back reform, however, admit the pace is
likely to slow.
A three-month parliamentary recess beginning next week will remove the
burden of parliamentary disputes and give the government an opportunity to
spell out the next steps in the reform programme, including a reduction of
industrial subsidies and moves to revitalise banks. More important, it will
provide a chance to regain the psychological momentum for reform.
Mr Singh's team of reformers are victims of the high expectations created by
their radical approach. They advocate a fundamental shift towards the market
by a country traditionally devoted to values of self-sufficiency, dominated
by the public sector. Unlike most other reforming socialist economies, such
as those of eastern Europe and China, however, India already had a vibrant
private sector that could help to drive the economy ahead. The potential was
tremendous.
But India also differs in having a well-developed democracy. China's leaders
may argue behind the scenes about economic reform, but they do not have to
face daily a rowdy and suspicious parliament.
Indian opposition parties have seized upon the Bombay financial scandal and
are set to keep it in the political limelight at least until the end of the
year through the proceedings of a newly-formed joint parliamentary
committee.
The scandal, which erupted over fraudulent dealings in the country's
securities markets and which involves funds of about Rs35bn (Pounds 625m),
revealed a merry-go-round of transactions between banks, stockbrokers and
investors, both fuelling and benefiting from a surge in the virtually
unregulated Bombay stock market.
The scandal caused the downfall of some of India's top brokers and bankers
and has damaged leading financial institutions as well as foreign banks.
Standard Chartered, apparently the worst hit, has made Pounds 100m of
provisions for expected losses.
Parts of the banking system are almost paralysed by the multiple
investigations now under way, raising worries that industry could be starved
of capital.
The scandal's impact, however, is also political. One of the driving forces
of reform, Commerce Minister P Chidambaram, had to resign in July because he
had made a small investment in a company implicated in the fraud. 'He was
determined to push reforms at a greater pace than anyone else,' says Mr
Salman Khurshid, deputy commerce minister.
Mr Manmohan Singh himself has been forced to devote much of his time to
warding off opposition attacks related to the scandal - though there is no
suggestion of wrongdoing on his part.
The scandal's positive effect is that it underlines the need for reform of
the financial sector. But it has also occurred in the area of the economy
which has so far been allowed the greatest freedom from control. And,
ominously, the response to the scandal has exposed enduring suspicion of
private sector activity.
For Mr Rao and Mr Singh, the road to reform was never going to be easy. And
it was always going to get more difficult as more politically contentious
issues were tackled.
A number of factors remain in their favour. Even now, they enjoy a political
consensus behind the broad thrust of reform. Opposition politicians agree
that there is no desire to go back to the 'license raj' in which bureaucrats
had to approve virtually any corporate decision.
The government can also take heart from signs that the country's
disappointing economic performance may be improving. Year-on-year inflation
has dipped below 10 per cent, agricultural production this year will be
better than had been expected, and exports and industrial production have
seen a marginal upturn.
Such improvements are party a reflection of the reforms which have already
been achieved. In little more than a year, the government has abolished most
of the industrial licensing system and removed most restrictions on foreign
investment. It has relaxed import restrictions and begun to cut tariffs;
reduced some subsidies; cut the fiscal deficit and deregulated some interest
rates. It has also begun the privatisation of some public sector companies;
and made the rupee partially convertible.
The most important reforms still to be tackled, apart from continued cuts in
tariffs and subsidies and a move to full rupee convertibility, are in the
public sector. A restructuring package now near completion for the
nationalised textile industry involves the loss of 75,000 jobs and probably
the write-off of large debts to the government. Many other industries
require similar treatment.
Mr Singh is seeking to build a consensus in these areas before proceeding.
This week he floated the idea of banks issuing equity without mentioning the
word privatisation.
'What we are trying to do is to get the workers on board, and I find that
when the facts are explained to the trade unions and workers they do realise
that we are grappling with these problems in a fair, effective manner,' he
says. He admits that this causes delay, but believes it will also contribute
to the durability of reform 'which will have the backing of all thinking
sections of our population'.
The nagging worry which could undermine the whole process, however, remains
India's export performance. 'I can't say I'm happy at all,' says Mr Khurshid
at the commerce ministry.
It was a balance of payments crisis which precipitated reform, as India
suddenly ran out of cash to pay for imports. Industrialists say they have
become much more export-minded as the economy's isolation and protection
from the rest of the world is dismantled. But the results have yet to show
through.
With reserves buoyed by IMF and other borrowings, as well as weak demand for
imports, there is no fear of a similar crisis now. But India's long-term
credit rating has yet to be raised by debt agencies after last year's
downgradings by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Growth in exports would
improve international confidence and ease fears that the country could slip
back into another crisis.

Sixteen pieces of silica aerogel, one of the lightest solids on earth, were
launched into space last week when the space shuttle Atlantis released the
European Retrieval Carrier, or Eureca, satellite.
The silica aerogel pieces are glued into aluminium canisters connected to
the outside of the satellite. They will remain in space for nine months
acting as cosmic dust catchers.
The experiment, which was constructed at the University of Kent, is designed
to detect evidence of organic material containing carbon and hydrogen to
address the age-old question of whether life exists in space.
The material was produced by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California. Within the last six months they have developed an
even lighter silica aerogel that is less dense than air. Commercial
applications are expected to include packaging and insulation. Lawrence

Bulk users of bottled water - such as hotels, restaurants, clubs and

an on-site filtration system, writes Hilary de Boerr.
Eaupure, of Lancashire, markets a filter system using mains water, which
passes through a three-stage filtration, is chilled and then carbonated if
desired. The resulting sparkling or still water conforms to all UK and EC
standards and is environmentally-friendly in other ways - no bottles to
transport, store or dispose of.
Stage one of the process removes particulate material from tap water, like
grit, dirt, rust; stage two takes out organic residues and dissolved gases
like pesticides, herbicides and chlorine; stage three traps anything larger
than a micron in size, including pathogenic bacteria. Eaupure installs the
units free and charges on a water metering system. Eaupure: UK, 0772 815950.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Wage inflation at lowest rate for 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAGE INFLATION, as measured by the underlying increase in seasonally
adjusted average weekly earnings, decelerated sharply to 6 per cent in the
year to June, the lowest such rate for 25 years.
Because manufacturing productivity advanced strongly in the three months to
June, the growth of wages and salaries per unit of output also declined,
bringing the rate of increase in British manufacturing unit wage costs to
their lowest level since October 1987.
Figures released yesterday by the Department of Employment showed that the
underlying annual increase in UK average earnings has fallen by 1.5
percentage points from 7.5 per cent in March, a rate of decline last seen in
1981.
Officials expect the rate of wage inflation will continue to fall following
a recent spate of settlements in the 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent range.
The June average earnings increase was lower than most forecasts and
accompanied a downward revision in the rate of increase in May to 6.25 per
cent from 6.5 per cent announced last month. The Public Finance Foundation,
an independent research body, reported yesterday that average earnings
growth would be even lower than 6 per cent if public-sector wage inflation
were not running at a high 7.3 per cent rate.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said yesterday's unit wage
cost figures showed that the competitiveness of the UK economy continued to
improve. In the three months to the end of June manufacturing unit wage
costs were 1.7 per cent up on the same period last year, compared with 4.5
per cent in the three months to March.
Productivity, although higher in June, grew less strongly than in May.
Manufacturing output per head in June was 3.4 per cent higher than in June
last year compared with year-on-year growth of 4.2 per cent in May.
Manufacturing productivity in the second quarter was 4.2 per cent higher
than in 1991, however, compared with a year-on-year increase of 3.9 per cent
in the first quarter.
According to Employment Department officials overtime earnings account for
between 0.5 and 0.75 percentage points of average earnings growth. The
latest statistics, however, showed a sharp drop in overtime working in
manufacturing to 9.95m hours a week in June from 11.26m in May. The hours
lost by short-time working increased to 640,000 a week from 350,000,
resulting in a fall in the index of average weekly hours worked in UK
manufacturing to 99.6 in June from 101 in May.
Only 25,000 working days were lost through industrial disputes in June,
bringing to 546,000 the number of working days lost through industrial
action in the 12 months to mid 1992. This was the lowest total since 1920.

FT  14 AUG 92 / City's foreign earnings rose to Pounds 16.9bn last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S financial in-stitutions boosted overseas earnings by 12.8 per cent
to Pounds 16.9bn last year, underlining the importance of 'invisibles' to
the economy and of the City's international role as a financial centre.
The improvement largely reflected increased investment income, which rose
almost 20 per cent to Pounds 10.5bn, according to a report from British
Invisibles, an industry trade group. Services income rose just 3 per cent to
Pounds 6.4bn.
Even the insurance sector - dogged by underwriting losses at Lloyd's of
London - saw a 24 per cent jump in earnings to Pounds 3.3bn as insurance
brokers raised income by 12 per cent to a record Pounds 919m.
The banking sector also made a schizophrenic showing, with a 7.9 per cent
fall to Pounds 3.14bn in income from banking services outweighed by a 21 per
cent rise to Pounds 4.6bn in investment income, to show an overall 7.5 per
cent improvement between 1990 and last year.
British Invisibles noted 'positive pointers' for the first half of this
year, with informal forecasts that earnings would grow by at least 7 per
cent.
The UK is second only to the US as an exporter of invisibles - which
encompass not only financial services, but tourism, information transfer and
transport services, and remitted interest, profits and dividends. Last year
these earned Pounds 117bn - significantly more than visible exports of
Pounds 104.8bn - with interest, profits and dividends accounting for Pounds
75bn.
This accounted for about 16 per cent of the Pounds 750bn total world trade
in invisibles.
The UK has a greater dependency on invisibles trade than any industrial
country, with tradeable services accounting for 20.5 per cent of gross
national product last year. This compares with 4.8 per cent of GNP in the
US, and 5.6 per cent in Japan.
Even last year, a year of recession in banking, 31 new banks opened a London
office and 15 banks departed.
The Baltic Exchange, which was devastated by an IRA bomb in April, lifted
earnings by 7 per cent to Pounds 804m. Mr Peter Tudball, the exchange's
chairman, said this confirmed the exchange's importance at the heart of the
world shipping freight market.
Dealers in London's securities markets lifted earnings by 23 per cent to
Pounds 2.0bn, with a steep fall in commissions and fees being offset by
portfolio investment income.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Sharpest jobless rise in south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT continued to grow more rapidly in the south of England than
elsewhere in the UK between June and July, according to the Department of
Employment.
Of the 29,100 seasonally adjusted increase in the number of claimants over
18 recorded in the month to July 9, 16,100 occurred in regions south of a
line from the Wash to the Bristol Channel.
Unemployment in the south-east, including greater London, is running at
record levels. Just over 30 per cent of UK unemployment is now con-centrated
in the south-east, where the seasonally adjusted jobless figure was 845,300
last month. Unemployment in greater London was 427,600, or 10.6 per cent of
the area's workforce. In the UK as a whole last month's seasonally adjusted
jobless total was 2.75m, or 9.7 per cent.
Recorded unemployment is much higher among men. The latest figures put the
seasonally adjusted male jobless total at 2.11m in July, or 13 per cent,
against female unemployment of 644,600, or 5.3 per cent.
Yesterday's figures nonetheless suggested that the rise in unemployment may
be past the worst. Last month's increase was sharply lower than the
seasonally adjusted jump of 69,600 in July last year. The average monthly

FT  14 AUG 92 / Secretarial rises 'above average'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECRETARIAL PAY, which has risen an average of 6.5 per cent over the past
year, is outstripping inflation and average earnings, according to Reward
Group, David Goodhart writes.
Chief executives' secretaries pay rose 7.3 per cent, while shorthand/audio
typists' increases averaged 5.6 per cent. Average earnings as a whole are
rising at 6 per cent, with clerical staff receiving 4.5 per cent, according
to Reward.
The study shows that the average pay of chief executives' secretaries in
central London has risen from Pounds 11,229 in July 1987, 25 per cent above
the national average, to Pounds 18,624 in July 1992, 40 per cent above the
national average.
In central London, where the cost of living has moved closer to the national
average, the average pay for a manager's secretary is Pounds 14,914.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Orders issued against 2.6m poll tax defaulters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN one in 10 adults in England and Wales have been subject to legal
action this year alone for non-payment of the poll tax, according to figures
released yesterday.
The Lord Chancellor's Department reported that 2.6m liability orders were
issued against defaulters in the first six months of this year.
Leaders of local authorities warned that the high level of defaulting could
significantly increase the first council tax bills next year.
Individual authorities reported a similar number of summonses this year to
last year, and the poll tax set by most authorities already makes allowance
for a significant non-payment rate.
The amount of outstanding tax will make it difficult for councils to wind up
their poll-tax collection operations, and is likely to lead to a short-term
increase in administrative costs as they struggle with both tax systems at
the same time.
The Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities said that
councils would be dealing with the poll tax 'until the year 2000'.
It criticised the government's decision not to exempt from the tax those
with little or no income. A disproportionately large proportion of summonses
have been issued against individuals eligible to pay only 20 per cent of the
tax - mostly students and people receiving income support.
In many of those cases the legal costs of summonsing, as well as the
administrative cost of collecting the tax, exceeds the amount due.
Meanwhile, almost a fifth of the poll tax due to be paid in Scotland since
its launch in 1988 remains unpaid, according to the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities. It estimates that the amount outstanding has increased
with each year of the tax - up from Pounds 118m in the first year to Pounds
214m last year. It said there was evidence of a continuing trend of
non-payment this year.
The government is taking steps to keep appeals against the valuation of
properties for the council tax to a minimum, David Owen writes.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday that those wanting early
notification of which band their property had been assigned to, in advance
of receiving their first bill, would be required to visit local authority
offices to inspect banding lists.
It also confirmed that only those who had already paid the council tax would
be permitted to appeal against their banding.
The Department of the Environment said that banding lists would be available
for inspection from the end of December, with bills sent in March next year.
The admission is likely to fuel concern that the system of property
valuation for the levy, which will replace the poll tax, may provoke public
resentment and a perception that it is unfair on the grounds that the tax
will be based on two-year-old valuations which make no allowance for the
decline in property prices.
The department defended the decision to restrict appeals to those who had
already paid the tax on the grounds that such a principal was 'true of any
appeal system'.
It also emerged that the government is making last-minute changes to its
council tax publicity leaflets in an attempt to dispel confusion over the
system of valuing properties for the levy.
According to Local Government Chronicle magazine the department is making
the changes before the leaflets go to the printers this month.
The department said it was concerned that the document should explain the
tax 'as accurately as possible'.

Midland Bank, which was taken over by Hongkong Bank in June, is to lease
Thames Exchange, one of the largest buildings in the City, for the combined
group's treasury operations, Vanessa Houlder writes.
James Capel, the stockbroker owned by Hongkong Bank, will also move into the
190,000 sq ft building adjacent to Southwark Bridge. Its decision to move
follows bomb damage to its existing building in April.
Thames Exchange, which was built by Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese
civil-engineering contractor, was completed a year ago. The building was
chosen because it can accommodate up to 800 dealing positions on its trading
floor.
Midland's treasury team will move out of the first two floors of Midland
Montagu's building on Lower Thames Street, while 120 dealers from Hongkong
Bank will move from premises in Bishopsgate.
The letting of Thames Exchange is the largest deal this year in the City.
According to Savills, chartered surveyors, a total of 280,000 sq ft of
offices were taken up in the City in July.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Bingham cautious on BCCI probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Bingham, who is to succeed Lord Donaldson as Master of the
Rolls, said yesterday he did not know when his completed report into the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International would be published and
whether it would be published in full.
'The question of publication is entirely for others and I have no input
now,' he said. 'But certainly there is material in the appendices which I
would expect to be unpublish-able.'
Lord Justice Bingham, speaking the day after the announcement of his
appointment as the most senior civil court judge in England and Wales,
described the 11-month BCCI inquiry as 'extremely laborious, but very
interesting'. He said it would have been impossible to conduct the inquiry
in public because a great deal of the material could not have been disclosed
without prejudicing possible criminal proceedings.
Lord Justice Bingham, who is in favour of a number of radical reforms, said
that provided there were adequate safeguards to ensure the quality of
advocacy, he was in favour of wider rights of audience for solicitors in the
higher courts.
He would like to see judges and barristers abandon their wigs in the civil
courts but not the criminal courts, and the European Convention on Human
Rights incorporated into domestic law.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Action on cash machines launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS were started yesterday against four UK banks and one
build-ing society for compensation and costs over alleged 'phantom
withdrawals' from automatic teller cash-dispensing machines.
If it comes to court the case will be the first serious challenge to the
claimed infallibility of the machines.
More than 200 customers, who say money has disappeared from their accounts
via such machines, are involved in the multi-plaintiff, multi-defendant
action. One writ was lodged in the High Court yesterday and will be served
during the next few days.
The banks are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, and the TSB, while the building
society is Nationwide. All have denied phantom withdrawals are possible.
They say the machines require simultaneous use of electromagnetic
information stored on a card which is inserted into a cash dispenser and the
customer keying in a personal identification number (PIN).
Customers say they have never let anyone else have their cards or PINs, as
the banks in most cases claim they must have. The action is being
co-ordinated by Mr Denis Whalley of a St Helens firm of solicitors.
Mr Whalley said yesterday that three new allegations of phantom withdrawals
a day were being made to the firm following recent publicity. He expects the
list of plaintiffs to grow as the new complaints are investigated.
Mr Whalley added that he intended to start proceedings 'pretty soon' against
five more institutions. They are National Westminster Bank, Girobank, Royal
Bank of Scotland, and Halifax and Abbey National building societies.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Challenge to LT over pension move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL UNIONS are challenging the legality of the deed and rules of London
Transport's pension fund and the procedures by which the salaried grade fund
and wages grade fund were amalgamated to form the present merged fund in
April 1989.
The unions say the rules of the new fund give LT powers it was not entitled
to take, in particular over the pension fund surplus. The merger of the
funds, into a fund of a total of nearly Pounds 1.7bn, was allowed under a
law which the unions believe specified that the new fund should reflect, as
nearly as possible, the balance of power and responsibilities that existed
under the predecessor funds.
The legal dispute arises from LT's decision to award itself the use of 70
per cent of the fund's surplus of about Pounds 460m and use the remaining 30
per cent for improvements to benefits.
The case centres on legislation which is unique to LT, but solicitors acting
for scheme members said the outcome could have implications for other
companies seeking to merge pension schemes.
There has been an increasing trend since the mid 1980s for companies to
switch pension-scheme members into new schemes with less restrictive rules,
allowing the companies to take advantage of surpluses built up as high
investment returns outstripped increases in benefits.
A solicitor for some of the LT members said that in most of those cases
members had been offered some enhancement of benefits. 'In this case, they
did not think the inducement was enough,' he added.
Most scheme members, unhappy with the terms of their transfer, have been
unable to seek redress in the courts because they do not have the funds to
pursue a legal claim. The LT case is among the first to be tested in the
courts.
The case centres on whether the loose body of trust law, which requires
trustees to act in the best interest of beneficiaries, allows the transfer
of those beneficiaries to a scheme which has less generous terms than those
currently on offer.
LT said: 'We maintain our view is reasonable but we would always listen to
new proposals. We hope the dispute is resolved before the court hearing in
December.'

FT  14 AUG 92 / Manufacturing industry output is flat in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTPUT IN almost every sector of manufacturing industry was flat in June
with only metals registering a fall from the previous month.
The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office paint a
picture of an economy that has stopped contracting, but has yet to show
unmistakable signs of growth.
In the chemicals, engineering and textiles sectors output was unchanged on
the previous month, while minerals, and food, drink and tobacco showed small
rises.
Manufacturing output is now 7.5 per cent below the level reached at a peak
in the second quarter of 1990. Although this fall is not as steep as the
downturn experienced by manufacturing during the recession of the early
1980s, it has occurred over a longer period.
The latest figures show that manufacturing output has resumed an upward path
for two successive quarters but remains 0.7 per cent down on the second
quarter last year. After an upward revision to manufacturing output in May,
growth in the second quarter was 0.4 per cent. That followed
quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the
year.
Food, drink and tobacco registered the strongest growth in manufacturing.
The sector was boosted by high drink sales during the hot weather in June
and rose 1.1 per cent in the second quarter compared with the first.
Chemicals suffered the sharpest fall as the output of pharmaceuticals
dropped from a recent peak. Output declined by 1.4 per cent in the three
months to the end of June compared with the previous three months.
A breakdown of manufacturing by sector shows that output of consumer goods
and investment goods rose in the second quarter, but production of
intermediate goods - those supplied to other manufacturers - fell.
The quarterly growth in consumer goods was fuelled by a strong rise in the
output of cars, which rose 4.4 per cent from the previous three-month
period. Other durables, mainly household goods, fell 1.6 per cent while
clothing and footwear grew 0.6 per cent.
Energy output fared less well than manufacturing in the second quarter,
falling 2.1 per cent on the first three months of the year.
The latest figures for energy and manufacturing suggest that overall GDP was
flat in the second quarter.

PROFITABILITY in the fund management industry recovered last year,
reflecting an increase in funds under management and better cost control,
according to Price Waterhouse's Investment Management Survey, Norma Cohen
writes.
Price Waterhouse found that less than one fifth of the fund management
organisations made a loss last year. In 1990 a third of all managers
incurred losses. Median profitability - defined as net profits as a
percentage of revenues - rose to 14.4 per cent last year from 7.3 per cent
in 1990.
The survey covered 34 organisations with more than Pounds 300bn under
management, representing about 40 per cent of all managed funds in the UK.
Among retail products, authorised unit trusts were the most profitable. For
wholesale products the traditional institutional domestic fund continued as
the most profitable.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Fowler outlines Tory party changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEEPING changes to the management and finances of the Conservative party
were foreshadowed yesterday by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman.
In an open letter to Tory activists ahead of the party conference in
October, Sir Norman also issued a gentle warning that the planned
celebration of Mr John Major's election victory should not be spoilt by
arguments over the economy and Europe.
His letter confirmed that the initial conclusions of a post-election review
of party organisation point to the need for much closer and more formal
links between Conservative Central Office and local party organisations.
It also announced that the sharp cuts in spending announced by Central
Office are to be accompanied by the creation of the post of director-general
to improve day-to-day management.
The considerable degree of autonomy enjoyed by local associations has been
reflected in mutual suspicion between Central Office and many grass-roots
activists. Some associations that operate under the party's National Union
refuse to contribute to Central Office funds, while party managers in London
have only a small say in the choice of election candidates.
Sir Norman signalled that he planned to ease such tensions by 'welding'
together the various wings of the party in a single management board that
would draw its representatives from constituencies and other voluntary
organisations as well as from Central Office.
He acknowledged the party's disappointment with its election performance in
many marginal constituencies by announcing an improved career structure for
full-time party officials and increased resources for those seats. Sir
Norman also signalled a drive to recruit more women parliamentary candidates
and more potential MPs with experience of commerce and industry.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Water price warning over 'green' costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER bills could double in real terms by the year 2005 because of the cost
of meeting environmental regulations, Ofwat, the water industry watchdog,
warned yesterday.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Improvements in the quality
of water are beneficial but they cost money - which some customers can
ill-afford.'
He drew a sharp response from water companies by pointing out that customers
would be shielded from some of the costs if the companies and shareholders
assumed part of the burden.
In an assessment of the water industry, Ofwat estimates that water companies
will have to spend from Pounds 28bn to Pounds 43bn between 1995 and 2005 to
improve drinking water and clean up beaches and sewage discharges.
Mr Byatt wants the report to start a debate between water companies,
customers and regulators about the desired level of water quality. He was
'delighted' that questions were being asked about whether some standards
were unnecessarily high.
The average water and sewerage bill is Pounds 170 a year, according to
Ofwat's report. By the end of the century the average bill could be between
Pounds 215 and Pounds 255, without taking account of inflation, and higher
still by 2005.
Mr Byatt said that if the companies became more efficient and accepted a
lower return on capital than at present, that could cut between Pounds 20
and Pounds 30 a year off bills.
The Water Services Association, representing the public companies, said that
the companies needed the present rate of return on capital to finance
investment.
The range of projections by Ofwat shows the difference between the minimum
spending needed to meet regulations, and the level demanded by a tighter
'pure and green' interpretation of the rules.
Estimates of spending are much higher than those made three years ago, when
the 10 large companies were privatised, because of subsequent EC
environmental rules.
The main increase is caused by the EC's urban waste water treatment
directive, where estimated costs have risen from Pounds 2bn in 1990 to
around Pounds 10bn. Mr Byatt emphasised that the government still had
considerable scope for interpreting the rules.
Mr Mike Carney, secretary of the Water Services Association, said: 'Mr
Byatt's estimates are in the same ball park as ours, but his figures for
installing meters look low, and there may be further costs from meeting
national statutory regulations'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS could be paying Pounds 750m for unwanted new power
stations, a lobby group for cheaper electricity said yesterday.
The group, known as Coffer, or the Coalition for Fair Electricity
Regulation, made the accusation in a letter to Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator. It plans to take him to court for
failing to keep prices down.
Coffer, which was set up last week with the aim of taking the regulator to a
judicial review, gave Prof Littlechild a deadline of September 1 to respond
to the letter.
It argues that because regional electricity supply companies have invested
in the new stations they have signed long-term contracts to buy their
output. This means they must buy power from the stations, regardless of
whether they could get it cheaper elsewhere.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Plan to tighten law on political levy may be revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is prepared to revive plans to tighten the law governing
trade unions' political funds.
Senior Conservatives are warning that a move by Mr John Smith, the Labour
party leader, to convert the unions' political levy payers into 'associate'
Labour party members would prompt legislation to make it easier for
individuals to refuse to make such contributions.
The legislation would require unions to receive the written authority of
each member before using any portion of their contributions for political
purposes. Senior Labour figures accept that such a change could lead to a
sharp reduction in the level of contributions.
Under existing law individuals can contract out of payments to union
political funds, which typically amount to just less than 10 per cent of
annual dues. The system leaves thousands of 'passive' contributors to Labour
finances who might choose not to pay if the law demanded their positive
approval.
Successive Tory governments have considered changing the law. The latest
review was earlier this summer when Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment
minister, pressed for its inclusion in the employment bill due later this
year.
The bill includes measures to tighten the rules on the direct deduction of
union dues by employers but after what was described as a 'finely balanced'
argument the government decided to defer again any move on the political
levy.
Now senior Conservatives are stressing that it would be 'unthinkable' to
allow the present system of passive contributions to continue if Mr Smith
used the levy system to boost the individual membership of the Labour party.
One said: 'It would be impossible to justify the inertia in the system which
already means that many Conservative trade unionists contribute to Labour.'
The Tories add that a Labour suggestion that union levy payers would have to
opt explicitly for associate party membership or would pay an additional fee
would not discourage the government from changing the law.
Labour is considering relaxing its rule that requires those in employment to
join a relevant trade union before becoming a party member. The rule is
thought to discourage a significant number of potential recruits to the
party.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Building societies feel the squeeze: David Barchard on
conflicting pressures that have brought unusually narrow margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY seemed, on the face of it, an odd time to be making a cut in
savings rates. The savings market is shrinking and building societies have
been complaining for months that they have been losing business to National
Savings.
But as Mr Mike Whitehouse, operations director of Halifax, the largest
society, announced an average 0.35 percentage point cut in the savings rates
he said: 'The alternative was just not realistic.'
Building societies saw a Pounds 314m net outflow of funds in June and they
fared even worse in July. The figures will not be published for another
fortnight but are expected to show a net outflow of about Pounds 450m,
leaving a net outflow of about Pounds 105m for the first seven months of
this year.
National Savings has easily outstripped building society receipts in every
month except January. The pressure on societies is compounded by the fact
that many people are repaying debt rather than saving.
Mr David Barnes, finance director of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth
largest society, said: 'We are all chasing just a little money around.'
In this situation societies would normally improve their rates to investors
to attract more business and pass on the cost to mortgage customers. On
Tuesday Skipton, the 14th largest society, tried to do this but the larger
societies would not follow.
Since February building societies and Abbey National, the retail bank which
was formerly a society, have been holding standard mortgage rates about 50
basis points above the London Inter-bank Offered Rate. A few years ago many
societies would have considered that their rates to borrowers should be at
least one full percentage point, and perhaps even two, above Libor.
The present unusually narrow margin was introduced by Abbey National in
February as a sort of discount to borrowers in the hope of reviving the
housing market. Such a tight rate not only squeezes profits but reduces the
amount of income societies can put aside against their unprecedentedly high
levels of bad debts.
Six months later there is no sign of a market revival but the large
societies feel strongly that rates to borrowers should not go up.
One reason is that they have recently prevailed on the government to lower
National Savings rates - not once but twice. The unspoken quid pro quo was
that mortgage rates would stay down, and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which had
announced a mortgage rate rise, withdrew it smartly.
Halifax said: 'Increasing rates to borrowers is just not realistic, partly
because we want to encourage a housing market recovery and secondly because
we want to make continued progress in dealing with arrears and serious
arrears.'
Any rise in lending rates would have been modest but societies say it would
have made it even more difficult to manage the accounts of about 305,000
mortgage customers with arrears of more than six months.
Mr Donald Kirkham, group chief executive of Woolwich, the third largest
society, said: 'Raising mortgage rates by say 0.5 per cent may not look very
onerous but even an additional payment of perhaps Pounds 8 a month could be
the last straw for some people.'
The savings outflow is a problem which the larger societies can live with.
Their liquidity is mostly good and their mortgage business is about 60 per
cent of what it was two years ago. They can turn to the wholesale money
markets to fund these reduced volumes and rely on the growth of retail
deposits from accrued interest.
Some large lenders even say they can live with the narrow margins between
saving and lending rates. Mr John Bayliss, Abbey National retail oper-ations
director, said: 'We have no intention of cutting our savings rates as things
stand. We do not need to do so.'
Things look rather different for small societies. They have to woo savers
hard to stay in business. They are less able to tap commercial money markets
and are reliant on volatile deposits from savers with a high net worth who
shift money quickly when a better rate is available elsewhere.
In recognition of this, Halifax yesterday tapered the reductions in its
investment rates to favour customers with deposits of more than Pounds
50,000.
The building society world has until now been used to a fairly tidy and
uniform interest rate structure. What has emerged in the last week looks
anything but uniform. There are clear signs of polarisation between the
large societies and smaller ones.
As to whether the new rates are sustainable, Mr Kirkham said: 'It all
depends on how we fare in the savings market in the next few months. If
societies do not get the inflow of savings that they need, then there will
have to be a change eventually.'
THE INLAND REVENUE is to launch a probe of individuals claiming to be
non-taxpayers and receiving interest gross from banks and building
societies, after discovering that up to a million of them are liable for
tax, Andrew Jack writes.
Investigators have found that up to 14 per cent of the 7m individuals who
have registered to receive interest gross earn income in excess of their
tax-free allowances.
The audit of claimants by tax inspectors has been triggered by market
research backed up by internal investigations and approaches to individuals
claiming to be non-taxpayers and receiving gross interest at levels close to
their allowances.
The revenue yesterday played down the possibility of widespread deliberate
fraud. It said: 'We think that mostly this is a case of people
misunderstanding the rules.'
Individuals whom investigators conclude have deliberately falsely registered
could be liable for fines of up to Pounds 3,000 and penalties up to the
value of the tax they should have paid.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Bullishness in Buenos Aires: John Barham assesses new
confidence in Argentine investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, confidently predicts that
his country is on the verge of investment growth the like of which it has
not seen since the eve of the third world debt crisis. He expects
investments to double by the end of this year to 20 per cent of gross
domestic product from 10 per cent last year.
If he is right, it would be as significant an achievement as the defeat of
hyperinflation.
It would ensure a long life for his market-oriented reforms by generating
the 6 per cent a year growth he has targetted and rekindling Argentina's
hopes of joining the developed world.
Investment rates have fallen to sub-Sahara African levels since they peaked
at 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1980 - a large part of which was hugely wasteful
public sector capital spending financed by a rising foreign debt.
The result has been a visibly collapsing infrastructure, obsolete industry
and worsening poverty. The economy is still the same size as in 1980, but
the population has increased by 14 per cent since then.
Now it is all change. The atmosphere for investment has rarely been so good:
inflation has fallen to 19 per cent a year, the economy has been thrown open
to free competition and the government has scrapped laws that discriminated
against foreign investment.
Not everybody shares Mr Cavallo's optimism but something is stirring in the
rotten hulk of Argentina's economy.
Companies are retooling as they slowly regain confidence. New apartment
blocks are sprouting all over Buenos Aires, a capital city that has seen
hardly any new building for more than a decade. Business consultants and
investment bankers are overwhelmed with work re-organising chaotic corporate
structures and tangled finances.
Investment is being focused in three areas. First, in newly-privatised
utilities, which are expected to invest the equivalent of Dollars 32.93bn in
the next eight years, comparable with an average of 2.3 per cent of GDP a
year. Fiel, an industry-funded thinktank, says infrastructure investments
made by private companies should be far more productive than the corrupt
state, which it reckons to have wasted Dollars 35bn-plus in 1970-1991.
Second, investment is being channelled into the services sector where profit
margins are still attractive. Money is going into shopping centres, housing,
tourism and entertainment - almost any sector shielded from the avalanche of
imports that began pouring into Argentina 18 months ago.
Last comes industry. Although hard data do not exist, Mr Cavallo points to
indicators, such as the 123 per cent increase in capital goods imports to
Dollars 1.11bn in 1991. This confirms anecdotal evidence that cautious
businessmen are retooling to increase productivity of existing plant before
beginning any ambitious greenfield investments.
It is difficult to estimate what part of the hoped-for investment recovery
might be from abroad. However, foreign direct investment, which peaked at
Dollars 927m in 1981 before the debt crisis, is showing firm signs of
recovery. Last year it was up to Dollars 465m, compared with Dollars 333m in
1990.
Despite these encouraging trends, there are a number of disturbing signs. To
begin with, most independent economists disagree with Mr Cavallo's
optimistic forecasts. They estimate investment at only 12-14 per cent of
GDP, doubting whether it will reach 20 per cent of GDP this year, and expect
growth of just 2-3 per cent a year.
Industrialists also complain that the government is not doing enough to
encourage investment in export-oriented manufacturing. Most industrial
investment is taking place in sectors that do not compete with imports or
are aimed at meeting domestic demand.
They question the promises by Mr Cavallo of improvement in the economy's
overall efficiency. Argentina remains an inefficient, high-cost economy
unable to compete internationally except in agricultural commodities. Wages
are high and productivity low and the crumbling infrastructure is a serious
drag on profitability. What is worrying is that Argentina's experience so
far with privatisation has resulted in inefficient and costly services,
rather than the reverse.
Mr Jose Luis Machinea, a respected opposition economist, adds that
investment seems to be funded mainly from foreign sources and he warns this
could have an 'enormous impact on the balance of payments in future years'.
He reckons Argentina needs to import at least Dollars 5bn in capital this
year and Dollars 8bn-Dollars 9bn in 1993.
He warns that this may be unsustainable if investors lose confidence in Mr
Cavallo's reforms. One source of concern is a deteriorating trade balance.
Argentina ran a Dollars 302m trade deficit during the first quarter this
year and could register its first annual deficit since 1981. If that does
happen, confidence in government policy could be shaken.
Another concern is that business people may lack the skills to survive in a
stable, open economy. Mr Eugenio Reynal, a director of Merchant Bankers
Asociados, an investment bank, says: 'Companies are realising they lack the
management to deal with change. There really are very serious problems with
management.'
What's more, Argentina has never created a stable business environment.
Laws, rules, regulations - even ministers and entire policies - can shift
with bewildering unpredictability.
Mr Miguel Angel Broda, a leading management consultant, says political
concern is rising, now that the government is under increasing pressure to
dilute reform as incomes fall, demand weakens and businesses fail. He says:
'The question is - will (President Carlos) Menem stand firm? We are entering
an 18-month period of risk. I think his survival instinct will make him
fight for stability.'

REPORTS of weak growth of US retail sales and almost flat consumer prices
yesterday provided further evidence of sluggish economic conditions.
In a separate report, the Congressional Budget Office said the economy had
yet to enter a 'self-sustaining recovery' but appeared to be on the verge of
one. It forecast growth of 1.9 per cent this year, rising to 3.1 per cent
next year.
Like most other forecasters, the CBO, an independent advisory body for
Congress, has consistently over-estimated economic growth in the past couple
of years.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, after
seasonal adjustment, slightly more than expected in financial markets. But
its estimate for June was revised sharply down to show a contraction of 0.3
per cent instead of a 0.5 per cent gain.
Retail sales have made no significant headway since February.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Colombian drug baron Pablo Escobar was charged with murder yesterday, in
a US federal court, over the bombing of an Avianca airliner in 1989, our
Foreign Staff reports.
The flight was over Colombia but two US citizens were among the 110 killed.
Also named in the indictments, and alleged to be the man who put a bomb on
the aeroplane, was Dandeny Munoz Mosquera, reputed to be a top Escobar
hitman and already held in the US after his conviction in March over illegal
entry of the country.
Without political change in Colombia, Escobar is unlikely to face trial in
the US, although most of the 14 new charges are not directly drug-related.
Last year, Colombia enacted a ban on extradition of its citizens for trial
abroad, the price exacted from the government through a bombing rampage by
drug cartels.
Escobar remains on the run after his escape last month from jail in
Colombia.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Prospects for S Africa talks suffer setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an early resumption of South Africa's constitutional talks received
a serious setback last night as the African National Congress (ANC)
announced that its preliminary contact with the government, including
discussions for a blanket amnesty, had proved 'fruitless'.
The ANC said that there had been 'no visible movement' from the government
in terms of meeting the core demands - for an ending of violence, the
installation of an interim government and constituent assembly elections.
The ANC says these demands must be met before negotiations can recommence.
As a result the ANC said it would 'refuse any further requests for meetings
with the government.'
Earlier in the day, Mr Kobie Coetsee, minister of justice, told a news
conference in Pretoria that substantial agreement had been reached with the
(ANC) on details of a blanket amnesty for those who had committed political
crimes which would 'wipe the slate clean and bury the past' where serious
political crimes have been committed.
The ANC in a statement denied that any such agreement had been reached,
saying it had never lent its support to a general amnesty and denyingany
link between the question of political prisoners and amnesty.
Talks, which ended in stalemate, at the last formal negotiating round in
May, were suspended by the ANC in June following the massacre of 42
residents of Boipatong. However, the ANC's comments come at the end of a
week when the two main parties had seemed to be moving together again,
following last week's general strike and mass action protests.
Mr Coetsee said the government had approved an amnesty plan drawn up in
recent bilateral discussions between itself and the ANC. He said the talks
were facilitated by Mr Cyrus Vance, the United Nations special envoy, during
his visit to the country last month.
The ANC believes that the estimated 300-400 political prisoners still in
jail, mostly ex-ANC members, should be released under existing amnesty
arrangements. The government argues that they are guilty of serious common
law crimes such as murder and grievous bodily harm that are not covered by
the earlier agreements. It believes a new blanket amnesty, which would also
cover members of the security forces and state, would be necessary.
The ANC says it has decided to suspend any further talks with the government
on the issue of political prisoners because of the government's bad faith.
It also disputes the 'moral competence' of the current government to offer
amnesty saying this is a matter for an interim government. The ANC argues
that security force members involved in the violence should be prosecuted,
not granted amnesty.
The ANC also disputed the call, made inter alia by Judge Goldstone who is
leading a commission investigating political violence, that a general
amnesty was necessary to help investigations.
The flare-up last night overshadowed the government's announcement earlier
in the day that it had accepted the report of UN secretary-general Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali which includes a recommendation for an external
investigation into state security and the sending of 30 observers.
Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister, said the government agreed with the tone
of the the secretary general's report and with its recommendations 'as a
whole'.

<TEXT>
MR Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the dissident hard-line Afghan Islamic leader,
yesterday offered a one-day conditional ceasefire to allow foreigners to
leave Kabul, as his fighters pounded the Afghan capital with rockets for the
fourth consecutive day.
The United Nations agency for refugees said yesterday that it was
withdrawing its staff from the Afghan capital because of the non-stop rocket
attacks.
'We just can't work there. There's another crisis every second,' said Ms
Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman of the UN High Commission for Refugees.
Mujahideen sources in Pakistan said at least 150 people had been killed in
fighting yesterday, including 75 in a single cluster-bomb attack near the
city's central post office.
The Afghan news agency ANA, controlled by Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami,
yesterday reported that Mr Hekmatyar was willing to agree to a ceasefire on
four conditions: the release of all Hezb-e-Islami prisoners in Kabul;
foreigners should only be evacuated by road and not by air; an armed force
should oversee the ceasefire; and that the Afghan government and militia
forces should accept the ceasefire terms.
The UN on Wednesday urged all sides to hold their fire to allow the
evacuation of foreigners after two Russian embassy staff were killed by
rockets and a third injured.
The latest round of fighting is seen as the worst setback to peace hopes
Afghanistan since President Najibullah's downfall in April. While government
sources say Mr Hekmatyar's men have been driven out of Kabul, western
diplomats say it is not clear how the balance of power has changed.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Foreigners suffer sharp rise in attacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday said that the root cause of a sharp increase
in right-wing attacks against foreigners was the recent surge in the number
of asylum-seekers in Germany.
Presenting a catalogue of violence assembled by constitutional protection
agencies which include the secret service, Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior
minister, said neo-fascist and extreme right-wing attacks against foreigners
in Germany increased more than 500 per cent last year.
Although the escalation has since slowed, a government report released
yesterday indicates an increasing level of violence.
Seven people have been killed in the first seven months of this year,
compared with three during 1991. About 30 per cent of the 650 assaults so
far counted involved arson or explosives.
Bombs or fire were used in 383 of the 1,483 attacks recorded last year.
Referring to the rise of the right in France, Italy and elsewhere, he said
the problem was not uniquely German. Democracy was not in danger from the
estimated 39,800 extreme right-wingers in Germany at the end of last year,
he claimed.
The figure includes 4,200 loosely organised neo-Nazi skinheads ' 3,000 of
them in eastern Germany ' registered in Mr Seiter's annual report for the
first time as a separate grouping.
According to recent estimates there are around 6m foreigners living and
working in Germany. The main targets for attack, however, are
asylum-seekers.
More than 45,000 arrived in July, swelling the year's total to 233,000
compared with 256,000 for the whole of 1991.
Membership of the German People's Union, DVU, one of the extremist parties
which drew international attention recently when it won seats in the Bremen
and Schleswig-Holstein state elections, grew by 2,000 last year to 24,000,
the report said.
The far-right Republicans, which have also made big gains, are under active
observation by state authorities, the report said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two resolutions which were yesterday passed by the United Nations
Security Council authorise all necessary measures aimed at protecting the
humanitarian relief operation in Bosnia.
But they fall short of calling for explicit military involvement to protect
aid convoys, let alone as a means of halting the war or ending the process
of 'ethnic cleansing' in the former Yugoslav republic.
The two resolutions were backed by Britain, France, the US, Belgium and
Russia. But the text of the first resolution, left many countries,
particularly the Islamic, and east European states, dissatisfied.
'The point is that the first resolution, which authorises all necessary
measures to ensure the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to Bosnia,
is an incremental step towards applying force,' a Nato diplomat said.
The second resolution, which deals specifically with violation of human
rights in Bosnia, strongly condemns the practice of 'ethnic cleansing.'
In the first resolution's original draft, drawn up by the US last week,
Washington wanted a specific reference to the government of Bosnia.
'A provisional resolution stipulated that all humanitarian efforts should be
performed in conjunction with the government of Bosnia-Hercegovina. But some
EC countries opposed this,' said a US diplomat. 'We wanted to give the
government of Bosnia some backing and recognition,' he added.
The final draft recognised the need to respect the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But a Nato
diplomat described this article as 'an insult' to the Bosnian population.
'Entire villages have been destroyed. Tens of thousands have been forcibly
deported. Serbs have grabbed 70 per cent of the territory. Croatia has
grabbed some land as well. We should be talking about ways to reconstruct
the republic of Bosnia,' he added.
As a means of defending the republic of Bosnia, the Organisation of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), an umbrella for the 46 Islamic countries, and
which recently set up its own contact group or lobby at the UN, tried to
'give more teeth' to the first resolution, a Turkish diplomat at the UN
said.
'We wanted Bosnia to be excluded from the UN arms embargo imposed on all the
republics of the former Yugoslavia,' he said. 'Our amendments never made
their way into the Security Council.'
However, the implicit use of force is spelt out in article two of the first
resolution. It calls upon states to take ..all measures necessary to
facilitate ..the delivery of ..humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo and
wherever needed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN, said that the
precise interpretation of what is meant by 'all measures necessary' should
have been spelt out.
The reluctance by the west to intervene is also reflected in the second
resolution, which concerns the violation of human rights in Bosnia.
Article 3 demands that all authorities in the former Yugoslavia and all
military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, immediately cease and desist from
all breaches of international humanitarian law ..
'How can we implement this article?' an Austrian diplomat asked. 'The Serbs
are armed to the teeth. I don't know how this clause will stop the
intimidation and killing which is taking place in those towns and villages
which are not visited by aid agencies, or the media. Without using force,
and its success is not even guaranteed, I don't know how we can make any
side comply.'
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
             UN SECURITY RESOLUTIONS ON THE WAR IN BOSNIA
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
First resolution:
(On use of force)
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Underlining once again the imperative need for an urgent negotiated
political solution to the situation in Bosnia and Hercegovina to enable
that country to live in peace and security within its borders;
Reaffirming the need to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity

Recognizing that the situation in Bosnia and Hercegovina constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.
Deeply concerned by reports of abuses against civilians imprisoned
in camps, prisons and detention centres;
The UN is determined to establish as soon as possible the necessary
conditions for the delivery of humanitarian assistance wherever needed
in Bosnia and Hercegovina, in confromity with resolution 764 (1992)
Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Reaffirm its demand that all parties to the conflict immediately
cease all military activity in Bosnia and Hercegovina;
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Calls upon states to take nationally or through regional agencies or
arrangements all measures necessary to facilitate in co-ordination with
the UN delivery of relevant UN humanitarian organisations and others of

PORTUGAL is to lift restrictions on capital movements imposed last year to
prevent investment from overseas upsetting the country's monetary targets.
The Bank of Portugal said that all remaining restrictions would be lifted in
three phases by the end of the year.
The first phase will come on August 31, when Portuguese borrowers in foreign
currency will be excused the obligation to deposit 25 per cent of the money
in interest-free accounts with the central bank.
Foreigners will be allowed full access to the Portuguese money markets from
December 31.

<TEXT>
THE International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday issued a solemn
appeal to all the warring parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina to comply with their
obligations under international humanitarian law.
The rare public appeal by the Geneva-based organisation, which normally
works confidentially behind the scenes to help individual victims of
conflict, reflects concern over the scale and depth of human rights
violations in Bosnia and its failure privately to persuade the parties to
respect basic humanitarian principles laid down in the Geneva Conventions.
Urgent measures are needed to 'guarantee the physical and moral integrity of
detainees', the statement says, adding that the ICRC has had only limited
access to regions of Bosnia while repeated requests for complete lists of
detention centres and detainees have yet to be met.
The ICRC has so far visited 11 camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina holding up to
6,000 people, three controlled by Serbs, six by Croats and two by Muslims.
Among specific targets of the appeal, the ICRC called for an end to forced
transfers of population, immediate steps to improve living conditions in
detention centres, immediate notification of all places of detention and
detainees, and full and secure access for ICRC delegates.
Reuter adds from Banja Luka: Later yesterday International Red Cross
officials said they had now been promised access to all prisoners held in
the Bosnian conflict.
They said a team of 20 had already visited prisoners in the Serb-run
detention centres of Omarska, Manjaca and Trnopolje, among the most
notorious of the camps.
'The (Red Cross) now has access. We are in there. It has lots of experience
and is doing its job,' said Mr Beat Schweizer, head of the office of the
ICRC in Banja Luka.
ICRC officials said Serbian, Croatian and Moslem authorities had all
promised let them visit all their detention centres. Whether they will fully
carry out there promise is unclear but the ICRC is hoping to be able to
provide the first comprehensive figures on the numbers of prisoners at the
end of next week.

</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community yesterday pledged to help bring to
judgment those guilty of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
Speaking on the first day of a two-day exceptional session of the United
Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr John Bolton, US assistant secretary of
state for international organisation affairs, said the US was 'fully
prepared with others to see that individuals guilty of violations of
international law and human rights principles are held strictly
accountable'.
He referred to a resolution approved by the UN Security Council late
yesterday which urged states and organisations to provide information on
possible war crimes to the Security Council.
A US-drafted resolution put to the Human Rights Commission, which wonbroad
support among the 53 members, called for appointment of a special human
rights investigator to report by the end of the month on human rights abuses
in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. It also
demanded immediate access for the International Committee of the Red Cross
to all places of detention.
For the EC presidency, Mr Martin Morland, Britain's ambassador to the UN in
Geneva, said the investigator's report would include recommendations on
compiling evidence of human rights violations 'so that those responsible can
be brought to book'. 'In that way, we can also send a clear message that  ..
the international community will not tolerate gross violations, nor allow
them to be forgotten.'
The threat of war crimes prosecutions is seen by western diplomats as one of
the few ways the international community can deter further atrocities in the
Bosnian conflict short of direct intervention.
Mr Bolton warned the warring factions that seized territory would never
receive international sanction.
'Any state enlarged through the bloodshed of innocent civilians is an
international pariah, an outlaw state', he said. 'The sooner the parties
accept this fundamental fact, the sooner we can turn to peacefully resolving
this crisis.'
Mr Ejup Ganic, a member of the Bosnian presidency, told the Commission that
Serbian agression in Bosnia had resulted in tens of thousands of deaths,
more than 150,000 injured and 1.8m uprooted from their homes.
He claimed that Serb militias had established more than 100 concentration
camps holding more than 120,000 people.
Mr Ganic called for the Red Cross to inspect the camps, permanent human
rights monitors in the region and the setting up of a war crimes tribunal.
In London, the Liberal Democrats urged the government to take in more
refugees from the battle zone and renewed their calls for 'safe havens' to
be set up within Bosnia for displaced persons, writes David Owen.
Drawing on his experiences during a recent visit to Serbian-held areas of
Bosnia, Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said the EC should 'sit down and
work out a formula' for the equitable sharing of the refugee burden.

<TEXT>
SPAIN'S consumer price index rose just 0.3 per cent in July, well below
market expectations, to draw annualised inflation down a full percentage
point from June, to 5.2 per cent.
The figures are the best recorded in a July in Spain since 1983 and were
greeted with delight by the government, which had to revise upwards its 1992
inflation forecasts after big price rises at the beginning of the year.
The Finance Ministry said the July figures would help narrow Spain's
inflation gap with the EC's best performers and said the low CPI rise was
due mainly to weak food costs.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Pan-German economic growth slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE growing strength of the D-Mark and unease about international growth
prospects has shaken Germany's confidence that the domestic economy will
regain momentum later this year.
The government stands by its official forecast of 2-2.5 per cent pan-German
economic growth this year, but in a report yesterday the economics ministry
gave the first official hint that expectations may not be met.
Real western German growth slowed in the second quarter of this year,
falling by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent compared with the first three
months, the economics ministry said. This represented a return to normal
after the 2 per cent quarter-on-quarter gain recorded between January and
April, due mainly to mild weather conditions.
However, there were also signs of reduced momentum in the domestic economy
and doubts about recovery elsewhere. 'Until now there has been a general
expectation of improving external demand. How strong this will be is
admittedly uncertain,' the ministry said in its August report. 'The picture
of the world economy, after positive indications in the first quarter, has
recently become vague again. The high exchange rate of the Deutschemark
against the US dollar could reduce the competitiveness of west German
companies.'
The report expressed concern at the rising number of companies planning job
cuts, while recovery in the east was less marked than expected.
The ministry repeated its claim that domestic demand should rise because of
tax cuts and higher disposable incomes. But independent economists suggest
consumer confidence has been eroded by fears of increases in indirect
taxation and growing unemployment.
Manufacturing companies have announced big payroll cuts in the past few
months. The Baden-Wurttemberg government said yesterday that 2 per cent of
industrial jobs in the state had been lost in the year to the end of June.
The southern state, home to Daimler-Benz and its Mercedes Benz motor
subsidiary, said 6,000 vehicle manufacturing jobs had been lost. There were
23,000 fewer workers making plant and machinery, and the electronics
industry had cut its workforce by 3,600.

A GROUP of Russian manufacturers yesterday demanded that the government
reverse its course of radical economic change or resign.
The meeting of 1,460 directors, representing only part of the country's
industrial lobby, approved a series of demands including price controls and
the indexation of wages and enterprises' working capital, but it fell short
of its original plan to call for the immediate resignation of Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the prime minister.
The conference was the latest lobbying effort on the part of enterprise
managers to get more government money as it tries to come to grips with the
debt crisis hurting much of Russian industry.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs - who sees himself as more progressive than the Industrial
Union parliamentary faction which organised the meeting - told delegates he
understood their anger but that new policies could not be elaborated in one
day.
Not all directors shared the meeting's angry tone. Mr Alexei Novikov,
director of the GAZ car plant in Nizhny-Novgorod, said that although
'corrections' of policy were necessary, the government was on the right
track.
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze sent 3,000 troops yesterday to hunt out
anti-government rebels who rejected an ultimatum to free Mr Roman
Gventsadze, the kidnapped interior minister, Reuter reports from Zugdidi.
The ruling State Council said the troops were heading towards rebel
strongholds in the west of the country.
The Georgian government blames ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, toppled in a
bloody revolt last January, for masterminding Tuesday's abduction of a dozen
officials including the interior minister. Mr Gamsakhurdia has denied
responsibility.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Jobless total hits 5-year peak: Hopes of modest recovery
encouraged by signs of increase in output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Britain rose to a five-year high last month but a slight
second-quarter increase in manufacturing output encouraged government hopes
of a feeble recovery from recession.
The Department of Employment reported that unemployment increased for the
27th consecutive month in July as the number of jobless claiming benefit
rose by a seasonally adjusted 29,100 to 2.75m. This lifted the unemployment
rate to 9.7 per cent of the workforce from 9.6 per cent in June.
But, contrary to forecasters' expectations, manufacturing output crept
higher in June, resuming the slight upward trend of the first four months of
the year. The figures raised hopes that next week's provisional gross
domestic product figures for the second quarter will show no further
decline.
In spite of a sharp 95,776 increase in July's unadjusted jobless figure to
2.77m, the figures were only slightly worse than the average of City
forecasts and pointed to an improvement in underlying trends compared with
July last year and the early months of this year.
The output and jobless figures - combined with statistics showing a sharp
slowdown in the growth of average earnings to a rate of 6 per cent in the 12
months to June - cheered the stock market after seven consecutive days of
decline. The FT-SE 100 index rose 14.9 to 2,318.
The Treasury drew encouragement from a 0.2 per cent increase in
manufacturing output between May and June and revised figures showing that
May's fall in output was less than earlier thought. According to the Central
Statistical Office, manufacturing production rose by 0.4 per cent in both
the first and second quarters. 'The figures suggest there has been a
distinct improvement in this key sector of the economy which has been borne
out by the broad results of business surveys,' the Treasury said.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said the unemployment news
was 'showing signs of improvement' and pointed out that the 19,400 average
monthly increase in unemployment in the three months to July was 'the
smallest recorded for any three-month period for nearly two years'.
She announced a Pounds 2.4m advertising campaign to encourage employers to
notify vacancies to their local Jobcentres. This followed evidence in the
latest figures of a decline in job vacancy inflows and placings at
Jobcentres between June and July.
The output data encouraged some City analysts to suggest the recession might
be ending. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers
International in London, said the figures suggested that non-oil GDP in the
second quarter might have risen by between 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent
compared with the first quarter, with overall GDP staying broadly unchanged.
Others warned that yesterday's news was consistent with the economy bumping
along a 'corrugated bottom' to the business cycle and that further falls in
output could lie ahead.
Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, pointed out the most
recent industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry
suggested that output could weaken in the coming months.
Indeed, CBI economists have expressed concern that, without a pick-up in
business and consumer confidence, employers will decide on a further wave of
redundancies after the summer holiday period.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UN agrees force as last resort in Bosnia aid effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night authorised the use of force
as a last resort to ensure relief supplies get through to the beleaguered
population of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The resolution was passed as western governments cautiously backed further
away from military involvement in the former Yugoslav republic. They hope
the threat alone will clear obstacles to relief convoys.
Welcoming the UN vote, President George Bush said he hoped to step up the
Bosnian relief effort in co-operation with allied nations, the UN and aid
agencies. He called on Serbia and Croatia to give their full support.
The resolution, sponsored by the US, Britain, France, Belgium and Russia,
authorises 'all measures necessary' to ensure delivery of humanitarian aid.
It does not spell out what kind of force could be used or by whom.
It was adopted by 12 votes to none, with China, India and Zimbabwe
abstaining.
The council unanimously adopted a second resolution demanding unimpeded
access for the Red Cross to detention camps in Bosnia and other former
Yugoslav republics. Reacting to mounting concern about atrocities, it warned
that individuals violating human rights would be held responsible for their
actions.
Sir David Hannay, Britain's ambassador to the UN, stressed that the Security
Council was not prescribing the use of force. 'It is a resolution which is
authorising (force) as a last resort,' he said.
Despite the UN vote, several European governments were yesterday united in
their determination to resist being drawn into military involvement in the
tangled ethnic conflict between Serbs, Croats and Moslems in the former
Yugoslavia.
President Francois Mitterrand of France said a military campaign would be 'a
fearsome effort'. He said 'adding war to war would not solve anything'.
The Italian defence minister, Mr Salvo Ando, warned the west not to get
sucked into a long guerrilla war.
In Britain, Mr George Robertson, the Labour party's foreign affairs
spokesman, cautioned against military involvement. But he said the British
government 'cannot simply hang around waiting for UN resolutions - action to
force Serbia to the peace table is urgently required'.
Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN, protested that the UN
was not going far enough. The envoy, who sought but was denied an
opportunity to address the Security Council, strongly criticised what he
termed a 'Band Aid approach' to the turmoil in his republic. 'I am afraid
that this approach may end up with the patient on the operating table,
ostensibly to help him, but that he may then be dismembered,' he said.
Mr Sacirbey also complained that there was an attempt being made to deal
with the situation in a way that did not fully acknowledge Bosnia's
sovereign status as an independent member of the UN. The real issue was
Bosnia's right to self-defence and how to exercise this, along with ensuring
that relief aid was delivered, he said.
UN diplomats said that any use of force aimed at protecting humanitarian aid
convoys in Bosnia would be carried out under the auspices of the UN, which
already has a peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia.
Diplomats said the UN resolution authorising force was a final warning to
Serb irregular forces besieging Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities that they
must allow relief deliveries through. But the diplomats cautioned that the
actual use of force would complicate the conflict.
The UN moves came only hours after a sniper killed a US television
journalist, David Kaplan, 45, in an attack on a convoy taking Yugoslav Prime
Minister Milan Panic into Sarajevo for peace talks.
Mr Kaplan was a producer for the ABC television network.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Halifax savings rate cut eases home loan fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of a rise in mortgage interest rates receded yesterday when
Halifax Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, announced that it
was cutting interest rates on its savings accounts by an average of 0.35
percentage points.
The move follows similar savings rate cuts by three other of the top 10
building societies in the past week and will affect about 14m savers.
Mr Mike Whitehouse, Halifax operations director, said: 'The Halifax has
sought to keep mortgage rates down throughout the year but, in common with
other societies, continuing pressures on operating margins means that
adjustments to investors' interest rates are required to ensure continued
financial strength for all our customers. The alternative of increasing
mortgage rates is not realistic.'
Most of the remaining large societies are expected to follow Halifax by
lowering their savings rates in the next few days. However, Abbey National,
the retail bank and second largest UK mortgage lender, said it would leave
its interest rates unchanged for the immediate future.
Halifax's decision was taken in spite of the news of an expected record
outflow of money from building society savings accounts in July, even larger
than a net outflow of Pounds 314m in June caused by stiff competition from
National Savings.
The Halifax cuts have been designed to penalise the largest balances the
least. The rates paid on Pounds 50,000 or more in the 90-day Xtra account
has been cut from 9.9 per cent gross to 9.8 per cent, compared with a
reduction from 8.85 per cent gross to 8.5 per cent on amounts from Pounds
10,000 to just under Pounds 25,000.
Although the government has twice lowered interest rates on National Savings
accounts in the past three weeks, it is by no means clear that the building
societies will be able to hold their own for long in the highly-competitive
UK savings market.

FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RELEASE of figures showing a rise in industrial production, coupled with
a feeling that recent falls had been overdone, helped reverse the recent
decline in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at a poor 2,299 the early trading in the September contract on
the FT-SE continued dull for the first few minutes as a large securities
house completed a sell order started on Wednesday. Many traders were, at
this stage, left with the impression that another dull session was in store.
However, with the sell order completed, dealers were keen to cover short
positions which helped September regain momentum. The release of favourable
industrial production data boosted the contract and it moved gently forward
to reach 2,338, the high point of the day by 2pm. Then, early reverses on
Wall Street led to more selling, which caused a retreat in the contract.
September closed at 2,329, up 28 on Wednesday's close, and around its fair
value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at 10,907 was reasonable.
The traded options saw a slight improvement in turnover at 25,593 lots with
the FT-SE 100 index option trading 13,337 contracts.

FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: SE to hold trading inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY is to be held by the Stock Exchange into dealings yesterday in
Sears shares after the stores group was the victim of an anonymous note sent
to the offices of many institutions and brokers. The one-sheet note made a
series of allegations about the financial state of the company and its
relations with its bankers, raised doubts over the dividend, and suggested
the shares should be traded down to 35p.
Analysts were quick to rebut the criticisms, but not before the shares had
retreated in busy trading early in the session. Opening at 67p, the shares
slipped to 62p within half an hour as word spread of the anonymous letter.
However, closer inspection of the mysterious document raised suspicion that
a bear raid was being attempted, and the share price recovered.
Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura said: 'Worries over the dividend and aspects of
trading are not new but are already in the price, which at this level looks
reasonably good value.' Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, described
the notes as 'cheap and nasty' and not worth further comment. Sears shares
closed at 67p, unchanged on the day after hefty volume of 12m.
Waters firmer
The publication of the discussion document from Ofwat on quality costs in
the water industry was greeted with a huge sigh of relief by the market and
shares in the sector were marked up accordingly. Analysts pointed to a
number of positive points, principally that the large capital expenditure
programme after 1994 will enable the industry to maintain positive dividend
growth and argue for higher prices.
However, others were more bearish. County NatWest pointed out that Ofwat's
indication of keeping down the 'K' factor - the level above inflation that
prices can be set - could mean water companies having to find more money
from the balance sheet.
But Dr Angela Whelan at BZW argued that water companies would have scope to
fund extra capital expenditure from cost savings and some reduction in the
rate of return. Smith New Court and County said that the best placed
companies were those with big investment programmes after 1995, namely South
West, Anglian and North West. Among the main movers yesterday, Severn Trent
rose 12 to 392p, Welsh 14 to 429p and Yorkshire 20 to 438p.
Vodafone pleases
The price restructuring plan proposed by Vodafone was welcomed by the market
which saw it as a positive move to combat its cellular rival, Cellnet,
without provoking a price war. Vodafone proposed to reduce rental rates but
increase call charges at peak times in an attempt to attract new customers,
mainly from the domestic market. The company estimates the new measures will
cost Pounds 5m this year and Pounds 10m in 1993. The shares gained 5 to
317p.
Barclays setback
Bearish comment from one securities house lay behind a sharp fall for
Barclays which closed 12 lower at 290p on busy turnover of 9.2m shares.
SG Warburg Securities reminded clients of the bank's comments last week that
bad debt ratios would deteriorate and that the final dividend depended on
the state of the economy. Warburg said the comments meant profit
expectations would be very low over the next two years and that the dividend
might be cut. Barclays held its first-half dividend unchanged at 9.15p when
it announced half-year results last week.
BP nerves
An unimpressive performance from British Petroleum (BP) shares may be taken
further today when the market digests disappointing news on the new
Columbian oil field in which BP has a 40 per cent stake.
Last night, the first official reserve estimate stated that Cusiana contains
700m barrels of crude oil. Analysts said that although this report reflects
only initial surveys, it is certain to be a disappointment for BP. The
announced figure is below even the most conservative forecasts from market
analysts of around 1bn barrels. The shares, restrained by lack of interest
from the US fell 1 1/2 to 187 1/2 p on heavy volume.
Insurance brokers were under pressure ahead of results next week. Analysts
believe that soft US insurance markets and a weak dollar will push down
first half profit figures from the two largest brokers, Sedgwick and Willis
Corroon. Sedgwick slumped 17 to 141p and Willis slid 9 to 179p. Both depend
heavily on the US market, with around 50 per cent of their earnings in
dollars.
Royal Insurance closed unchanged at 165p after announcing it had cut its
first-half loss to Pounds 79m, in line with expectations, from Pounds 97m
last year.
A return of takeover speculation boosted Lasmo by 10 1/2 to 147p on heavy
turnover of 10m shares. French group Total was linked to the UK oil
exploration group but the rumours were not widely believed and increasing
Middle East tension was also a factor.
The prospect of an amicable settlement between Eurotunnel and TML, the
tunnel's constructor, in their dispute over costs continued to boost
Eurotunnel's shares. They added 10 to 335p.
Engineering group Glynwed International shrugged off recent gloom as the
market greeted with relief its 48 per cent improvement in interim figures,
at the top end of expectations.
The shares jumped 13 to 196p on though turnover at 1.6m was average with
renewed confidence that the company would post a covered dividend this year.
Worries over the dividend have been responsible for Glynwed's recent poor
performance.
Motor dealer Henlys gained 6 to 75p after predator T. Cowie improved its
hostile bid to Pounds 30.3m, valuing each Henlys share at 80p. Cowie ended
unchanged at 115p.
Negative comment after Wednesday's results from Queens Moat sent the shares
reeling further. After an 8p fall on Wednesday, they shed another 6 to 51p
in turnover of 22m, to make it the most actively-traded stock in the market.

FT  14 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Technical rally boosts share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market broke its seven-day run of losses yesterday but moved
uncertainly at first before responding firmly to the latest statistics on
domestic unemployment, industrial production and wage trends.
Trading results from Royal Insurance helped sustain the brighter trend in
the sector and water stocks responded favourably to the official report on
the prospective costs of meeting environmental demands. The broader range of
the market was featured by sharp but irregular movements among the Footsie
stocks.
Equities opened lower with investors discouraged by a bearish review of
dividend prospects at Barclays bank from a UK brokerage house. Share prices
took a further knock when stock index futures opened lower and the Footsie
was nearly ten points down. By mid-morning it was below the 2,300 mark which
has proved a painful testing point for market confidence over the past
fortnight.
However, the clutch of economic data, showing a small increase in production
and some moderation in wages and unemployment, gave relief to a stock market
badly unsettled by economic uncertainty.
Although buying support was not on any great scale, the Footsie climbed
steadily into positive territory.
London gathered pace when Wall Street opened firmly and, at best, the
Footsie was more than 20 points ahead. However, gains were trimmed as the
early advance in New York was reversed in UK trading hours. The final
reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,318 for a net gain on the day of 14.9.
Trading volume remained very disappointing and the market became very quiet
before the end of the session. Seaq volume reached a mere 441.3m shares.
Wednesday's 406.2m reflected retail business worth only Pounds 699.6m, still
woefully inadequate in terms of profitable trading for the London-based
securities industry.
With some other European markets remaining on the downward tack, London
analysts were wary of changing their views after yesterday's rise, which was
regarded as largely technical; many traders needed to buy stock to meet
selling orders taken aboard since the equity trading account started on
Monday.
Bearish views on the stock market continued to dominate the investment
stage. At Goldman Sachs, Sushil Wadhwani said that if the UK economy shows
no sign of recovering in a year, he still expects that the Footsie will then
trade around 2,000. In the near term, he predicts a technical bounce in an
oversold market.
While yesterday's economic data gave the stock market some cause for a
revival of confidence, attention is now focused keenly on the July retail
price index, due at 11.30am this morning. Expectations are for a slight
rise, perhaps of 0.1 per cent on the month, to show an annualised rate of
4.2 per cent on the year, excluding mortgage charges.
The resumed flow of economic data will continue next week with the July
Distribution Survey from the Confederation of British Industry and the
latest Public Sector borrowing statistics.

FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens slightly
on option trading
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER fluctuating on index-related selling, share prices finally closed down
with marginal declines as the Nikkei index shed initial gains just before
the close, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 5.62 to 14,768.17, falling for the sixth
consecutive day to a new low for the year. The index moved between a high of
15,018.07 and a low of 14,717.38, with its best time in early afternoon on
buying by investment trusts and dealers.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 248m. Gainers led losers by 469 to 433 with
126 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 3.48 to 1,117.50 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.66 to
933.00.
Stock option related trading dominated the market as dealers tried to
manipulate stock prices ahead of today's settlements of August stock-index
option contracts, which expired yesterday. Dealers were also seen
short-covering on issues which were heavily sold during past trading days.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone regained strength on buying by short sellers.
The issue advanced Y2,000 to Y460,000 after falling for six consecutive
trading days.
Speculative theme stocks rose on active dealer trading. Okamoto Industries,
the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y850 and Meiji Milk Products
advanced Y9 to Y749.
Brokers were also firm. Nomura Securities gained Y30 to Y1,230 and Daiwa
Securities advanced Y10 to Y690.
Nippon Housing Loan, the financially troubled home-loan company, fell Y46 to
Y102, after dipping below Y100. No share has been priced below Y100 on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange since June 1986, but Nippon Housing Loan faces mounting
bad property-linked loans due to the plunge in real estate prices, and is
requesting financial assistance from its main creditors.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.39 to 15,673.09 in volume of 37.2m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, advanced Y310 to Y9,200 on bargain hunting.
The issue was previously sold by investors to raise cash for margin calls.
Roundup
EMULATING Tokyo, the region tended towards gentle movement yesterday, with a
slight bias towards the downside. Manila, once again, provided the
significant exception.
AUSTRALIA almost engineered a recovery after the government announced, late
in the morning, that Australia's gross domestic product expanded by 0.6 per
cent in the April-June quarter, the fourth consecutive quarterly expansion.
However, the All-Ordinaries index closed down 2.4 at 1,568.4 in turnover
which was also little changed at ADollars 204m against ADollars 205m on
Wednesday. The Australian dollar recovered to USDollars 0.7200 for part of
the day, which also helped sentiment on the equities market.
Resource stocks were hit by concerns about recession in Japan, and by falls
on base metals and bullion in overseas markets.
HONG KONG was held back by the government investigation into a string of
companies controlled by Lee Ming Tee, and by recent chaos in China shares.
The Hang Seng index fell 22.08 to 5857.11, turnover easing from HKDollars
2.49bn to HKDollars 1.93bn.
Many participants stayed on the sidelines, awaiting Hang Seng Bank earnings
announced after the market closed. A 22 per cent rise in earnings and a 159
per cent jump in dividend, however, did not please some of the speculators,
who have driven Hang Seng shares up by 45 per cent this year.
SEOUL blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), its potential
effect on South Korean exports, and pessimism over today's Hyundai results
as the composite index fell another 4.41 to 488.25.
Issues connected with major exports to the North American region, such as
cars, electronics and steel, led the downturn as they are expected to be
worse hit by NAFTA; Hyundai group shares, also involved in the Nafta
argument, were particularly vulnerable with Hyundai Motor losing Won700 to
Won16,400.
NEW ZEALAND saw yet another drop in Fletcher Challenge, down 12 cents to
NZDollars 2.52, as the NZSE-40 index fell 2.40 to 1,494.16; KUALA LUMPUR
worried about crumbling Japanese stock prices as the KLSE composite dropped
2.39 to 592.18.
Among the winners, SINGAPORE produced a weak technical rebound as the
Straits Times Industrial index closed 8.53 better at 1,374.76; BANGKOK's SET
index rose 1.42 to 756.26 in trading described as nervous, ahead of the
September 13 general election.
MANILA reflected the government's lifting of foreign exchange controls and,
once again, a strong performance from Philippine Long Distance Telephone in
New York. The composite index rose 20.21 to 1,491.46.

FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Equities stage an intraday
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a week on the downgrade, the Eurotrack 100 stopped retreating for
about six hours yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Roger Palmer, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that the
recovery coincided with an estimate from the German economics minister, Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, of a one-half to one per cent drop in second quarter west
German GDP, compared with the first three months of 1992.
While bourses were preoccupied with the French Maastricht referendum in six
weeks' time, said Mr Palmer, indications that the German economy was slowing
down might have allowed them to look beyond it to the prospect of lower
interest rates in the early spring of next year.
FRANKFURT duly broke down through 1,550 on the DAX. However, said market
makers, the very fact of an intraday low of 1,526.35 brought technical
aspects to bear. People expected the market to rebound when it hit 1,530,
and this coincided with a stock and futures shortage. The DAX closed just
12.03 lower at 1,540.98, and the DAX future was trading around 1,550 in the
later part of the afternoon.
Turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM6bn. The insurance group, Allianz, which has
the heaviest individual weighting in the DAX, fell DM66 to DM1,665 at once
point, closed DM36 down at DM1,695 and recovered to DM1,720 in the post
bourse.
Among second liners Lufthansa fell another DM5 to DM90.50, and into
speculative territory as a decision on a sharp cost cutting programme is
awaited at the end of this month; Linotype, however, produced a recovery and
rose DM17.50 to DM371.50.
AMSTERDAM worried over KLM's results which came in worse than expected, and
the CBS Tendency index closed 0.4 down at 111.8.
Analysts noted that the airline's core business remained relatively strong
while associated companies, such as the US carrier NorthWest and Air
Littoral of France, which had made large losses, had sapped profitability.
Mr Philip van den Berg of Goldman Sachs said that he had changed his
recommendation on the airline from sell to hold yesterday. KLM closed down
Fl 1.30 at Fl 27.70, but off the intraday low of Fl 26.00.
Nedlloyd slipped further on nervousness ahead of next week's interims,
closing down Fl 1.60, or 4.5 per cent at Fl 37.70. The stock has dropped 41
per cent since its 1992 peak in February.
Downgrades from US brokers contributed to Polygram's 70 cent fall to Fl
45.10.
PARIS closed at a new low for the year, the CAC-40 index falling 7.69 to
1,722.36, but off an intraday low of 1,712.08. Turnover remained weak at
some FFr1.4bn.
With a clutch of first half results results there was plenty to keep the
market busy.
Hachette was one of the biggest losers of the day, down FFr9 or 7.3 per cent
to FFr114 after reporting a decline in sales, while Remy Cointreau lost
FFr3.0 or 4.6 per cent to FFr170.0 for the same reason. Michelin slipped
FFr3.90 to FFr205.50 in spite of a sales rise; weakness in the European tyre
industry has led some analysts to issue sell notes on the major producers.
Suez finished down FFr4.80 at FFr235.10 after announcing a 10 per cent slide
in turnover. Eurotunnel bucked the trend, up 70 centimes to FFr32.50 as
confidence returns that negotiations with contractors may soon be resolved.
MILAN closed the August account with an power cut, which caused a two-hour
failure of the screen market. In addition, anxiety in foreign exchange where
the lira is under heavy pressure spilled into equities, and the Comit index
fell 2.87 to 398.28, threatening its 1992 low.
An Italian cabinet meeting in Rome was expected to announce several measures
to stimulate the equity market, but dealers were still not enthusiastic
about short-term prospects as the market closed yesterday.
COPENHAGEN was forced down by the Danish finance minister, Mr Henning
Dyremose's threat to go to the polls in premature autumn elections over the
1993 state budget. In spite of a rally in mid-afternoon, after the prime
minister, Mr Poul Schluter, ruled out the prospect of snap polls, the CSE
index still closed 5.04 lower at 293.16.
MADRID was unimpressed by good CPI data for July and the general index
closed slightly weaker, off 0.27 at 205.49.

FT  14 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Economic slowdown hits confidence in
Taiwan - The outlook for equity investment for the rest of the year remains
depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUISETTA MUDIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with other marginal investors in an economically depressed world,
Taiwan's housewives and taxi-drivers appear to be finding better things to
do with their savings nowadays than investing in the island's dull equity
market.
Since the government quashed a rally last February with action on money
supply and a squeeze on the inflow of foreign investment, the weighted index
has recorded a steady downward trend. This culminated with three new 1992
lows in the last eight days of July, and a half-hearted recovery since then
before subsiding to yet another new low yesterday of 3,893.34.
Following the Nikkei's plunge to a six-year low and the threat of renewed
war in the Gulf, investor confidence bottomed out on July 23 in an already
bearish market, sending the index plummeting by 4.2 per cent in one day.
Although it later recovered to break through the 4,000 level, analysts
expect little remission in the next quarter.
'There are fewer people participating now, and they are putting their money
in other places,' says Mr Jeffrey Toder, of Jardine Fleming Securities.
Property and the new B shares in mainland China are rapidly finding favour
with individuals who still form the majority of the island's equity
investors.
A series of minor blows has further dampened enthusiasm. Evergreen
Securities, one of Taiwan's biggest brokerages, announced its closure due to
depressed trade, heralding further possible casualties as a consequence of
the market's decline. Furthermore, the central bank's failure to follow
Japan and the US in cutting interest rates renewed fears of a tight credit
policy.
The bearish sentiment of the first half of the year, with the exception of a
rally in January, is seen by some as a legacy of the 1990 crash, when the
speculative bubble burst on the property and stock markets.
It is difficult to see how an economy which is expected to make 7 per cent
GNP growth this year could sustain such pessimism for long. But a slowdown
in export growth brought on by a strong Taiwan dollar, extensive media
coverage about the economic slowdown and problems with the Dollars 303bn
infrastructure plan have taken their toll on investor confidence.
The market did brighten recently on news of a relaxation in credit control
by the central bank and lower inflation figures for July. The index rose to
4,134.91, although buying was cautious and turnover thin, and sentiment
recovered only to slide again.
A meeting scheduled for the end of the month to address problems concerned
with relations with Beijing is expected to boost activity but there is
little else to encourage buyers.
There is a sense, say observers, that the good news has been heard already,
and that as the economy matures, fortunes may no longer be made overnight.
Mr Peter Kurz, chief representative of Baring Securities, sees a prolonged
dull period as a necessary stage in the market's evolution. 'It's part of a
typical bull-bear cycle, but at the same time (the market is) becoming more
mature,' he says.
Analysts say that equities are likely to remain in the doldrums for most of
the remainder of 1992. The first full parliament will be elected on December
19, and although the main opposition party is taking a more moderate line,
its pro-independence stance caused panic selling when it was announced last
year.
Caution seems likely to be the watchword. 'Investors on the whole are being
more careful. Everyone realises now that stocks can go down as well as up,'
says Mr Toder.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Uncertainty remains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures dipped yesterday after the pound dropped below DM2.8200 for
the first time since Britain joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism. But trading
in both the futures and cash markets was thin, and period rates ended the
day virtually unchanged from Wednesday night's levels.
The quiet trading of recent days is partly due to the summer holiday. But
there is also a determined lack of position-taking in both the cash and
futures markets. Uncertainty unites the market more than any other
sentiment. Dealers are waiting for the outcome of next month's French
referendum on Maastricht, which could blow the ERM apart, and push rates
down. They are also uncertain about whether there will be another Lombard
rate rise in Germany.
Yesterday's UK economic indicators were mildly encouraging but had no impact
on trading. The 29,100 rise in July unemployment was slightly higher than
the market had forecast, and manufacturing output rose 0.2 per cent when a
fall had been predicted.
Sterling futures dealers were therefore guided by the currency alone. The
September contract dropped 8 basis points from its previous close to a low
of 89.57, and closed at 89.60. One clearing bank dealer said that this was
as low as the contract could dip with base rates at 10 per cent. The
September contract would dip to 89.50 if there was the immediate prospect of
a  1/2 percentage point rise in base rates, but dealers would be taking too
much of a risk to sell the contract down to that level now.
In the sterling cash market, dealers appeared to be unwilling to offer bills
to take out a Pounds 700m shortage forecast by the Bank of England. They may
have been waiting to push the overnight rate down today, making borrowing
conditions cheaper over the weekend.
In the morning, the Bank purchased only Pounds 10m in a repurchase
agreement, at 9 15/16 per cent, and the overnight rate responded by moving
up to 10 3/4 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 700m, and
the Bank purchased Pounds 172m in Band 1 at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 150m
in the repo. There was late assistance of Pounds 220m. Three-month money
closed unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent on the offered side.

supply

THE RUSSIAN government plans to reorganise its grain procurement system as
part of attempts to encourage peasants to hand over more supplies to the
state.
Mr Leonid Cheshinsky, chairman of the government grain procurement
committee, reported yesterday that the state had met only 25 per cent of its
29.1m tonne target for this year. He said it was likely that the government
would only be able to secure a total of 24.5m tonnes as 12 grain producing
regions had unilaterally reduced the amount they planned to sell.
As a result, President Boris Yeltsin is to sign a decree making sales to the
state compulsory only for regions which produce surplus grain beyond their
own needs, absolving those which only break even or produce less grain than
they need. Mr Cheshinsky said this would mean doing away with the old
system, whereby all grain-producing regions had to sell grain to the state,
which would then send some back to them.
He said Russia would import an estimated 20m tonnes, including 3m tonnes
from Kazakhstan. He forecast the Russian grain harvest this year at 94m-96m.
On Tuesday, the government raised its purchase price for lower quality grain
from Rbs10,000 to Rbs12,000 a tonne, in an attempt to increase procurement
levels. Mr Cheshinsky said however this would aggravate the crisis in
livestock and poultry breeding. The government has allocated 20,000 military
trucks to help move the harvest off farms.
The Ukrainian government, anxious to fill state granaries, has threatened to
halt subsidies to farms that refuse to sell grain to the state, reports
Reuter from Kiev.
The government said it had succeeded in purchasing just 8m tonnes of grain
so far this year out of a required 17m.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alouette smelter ready for
first shipments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, mining correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEPT ILES, QUEBEC
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALOUETTE smelter in Quebec is ready to dispatch its first big batch of
aluminium only 36 months after construction started on a greenfield site.
About 4,500 tonnes will be shipped out to Rotterdam for European customers
on August 20.
The smelter, about 850 km (530 miles) north-east of Montreal on the north
shore of the mouth of the St Lawrence river, was brought into production
within a very tight schedule but under the CDollars 1.4bn (Pounds 610m)
budget.
It will produce 70,000 tonnes of metal this year and by December be running
at its full annual capacity of 215,000 tonnes.
The budget included most of the preparation work for a second phase to
double annual output. Mr Otto Niederhofer, president of VAW Aluminium
Canada, said that the partners in the Alouette Consortium were 'broadly in
favour' of going ahead with the expansion. VAW of Germany is technical
manager of the project.
However, present low aluminium prices and uncertainties about aluminium
production in and exports from Russia is holding up a final decision.
Along with VAW, partners in Alouette, each with 20 per cent are: Austria
Metals Hoogovens of the Netherlands; a joint venture between Kobe Steel and
Marubeni of Japan; and SGF (Societe Generale de Financement), the
Quebec-base industrial agency.
While the smelter, which will employ 530 workers, will be one of the lowest
cost - and least polluting - in the world, the partners are giving no
details because Alouette has signed a confidentiality agreement with the
Quebec-owned Hydro Quebec, which is supplying power under a 25-year risk -
and profit-sharing contract. This also covers the second phase of the
project - but only if a decision is made by the end of 1994.
Alouette is among several projects which cost a total of nearly CDollars 4bn
and boosted Canada's primary aluminium production capacity by 26.5 per cent
in 1991 and another 16.5 per cent this year. The country now has about 2m
tonnes of capacity, all but 200,000 tonnes of it in Quebec, drawn to the
province by its abundant low cost, renewable, non-polluting
hydro-electricity.
In the past year 690,000 tonnes of new capacity has come on stream to worsen
the aluminium over-supply situation created by recession in most
industrialised countries and increased Russian exports.
Mr Niederhofer said the partners considered lengthening the schedule for
Alouette's start-up but this would have increased costs substantially.
In any case, most of Alouette's metal would be absorbed by the partners'
downstream activities, mostly in Europe as it is cheaper to ship aluminium
from the smelter to Europe than to truck it to the US.
SGF would retain some metal in Quebec where it wants to encourage new
aluminium fabricating businesses to be set up.
A Venezuelan company, Cabalum, has cleared a site next to the Alouette
smelter for a CDollars 45m aluminium cable plant, but work has been halted
for a year, reportedly because of the cost of financing the venture.
VAW took over management of the smelter project in 1989 after Reynolds
Metals of the US dropped out of the consortium. Now 97 of Alouette's 264
'pots' are working and the smelter is producing 200 tonnes of metal a day.
Mr Niederhofer said that for the smelter to have moved so swiftly to a
smooth start-up was 'amazing', given the numbers of people involved the size
of the project and the remoteness of the region.

New York COTTON futures tumbled in early afternoon dealings, scoring
successive lifetime lows. One Mississippi economist said Wednesday's USDA
crop report confirmed that US cotton had to seek lower prices if it is to
compete in the world market place. 'The explosion in world stocks makes this
very clear,' he said. The report showed 1992 production of 16.5m bales
compared to 16m last month. 'Most estimates were running about 15.8m to
15.9m, so this was a surprise to the market although not totally
unexpected,' said one broker. Most base metals ended below overnight levels
on the LME, although the presence of underlying support helped some move
away from their lows, particularly copper and zinc. Three-month COPPER met
support around Dollars 2,480 tonne, as expected, and recovered to end at
Dollars 2,486, still down Dollars 11 from Wednesday's kerb. London COCOA
closed well below its highs but held on to moderate gains as New York
rallied after Wednesday's sharp slide. 'No one can still find any
fundamental reason for the fall yesterday other than long speculative
liquidation, which we hope we've seen the last of,' one trader said.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Precious metals falls leave
traders 'shell-shocked'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE BEARS have really got the bit between their teeth,' commented one gold
dealer yesterday as London bullion market prices fell on the back of the
overnight plunge on the New York futures markets.
No single factor appears to have sparked the retreat. Analysts cited talk of
global recession, well-timed producer selling from Australian gold producers
and the fall in the stock market in Japan, the biggest platinum consumer.
Added to the cocktail was a fall to six-year lows of a Commodities Research
Bureau futures index watched widely as an inflation indicator and the easing
of tension in South Africa, the biggest platinum producer.
Once the ball started rolling on Wednesday in New York, US investors and
commodity funds bailed out of the market in a frenzy of selling.
Yesterday the London gold market closed at Dollars 338.25 a troy ounce, a
fall of Dollars 8.10 and the lowest close for two months. Platinum was fixed
at Dollars 351.75, down Dollars 16 and silver closed at 381.5 cents, down
7.5 cents.
In late trading both gold futures on Comex and platinum futures on Nymex
were showing further heavy losses. The active October platinum contract was
down Dollars 7.80 at Dollars 346.50 and the December gold contract was off
Dollars 4.50 at Dollars 337.50.
Mr Brian Nathan, managing director of Ayrton Metals, said the rout on
Wednesday could have been sparked by news that the chairman of General
Motors had announced the possibility of further plant closures later this
year.
'Fund managers decided not to wait any longer,' he said.
Platinum is now widely regarded, like silver, as an industrial metal -
automotive exhaust catalysts account for nearly 40 per cent of total
platinum consumption. Its fall has taken the gold market with it.
Gold's recent rally ended in failure to breach the Dollars 360-a-troy-ounce
level, and many analysts believe it is heading back to the recent low of
Dollars 335.20, struck in May.
'It looks horrible,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp;
Aitken. 'It came down so fast you would be a mug to touch it.' He believes
the big commodity funds, which had been beginning to take renewed interest
in the gold market, would be put off for at least six months by the speed of
the fall.
'There are an awful lot of shell-shocked people out there,' said Ms Rhona
O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, part of the Banque Bruxelles
Lambert group. She believes there is not much support for gold above the
level of the recent low.
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, pointed out that there
was no longer anything mystical about gold, which has to be regarded as a
commodity like any other. There was no sign of any strong buying on the
horizon which could take gold back up, he said, suggesting that the market
could touch Dollars 320 or below. 'Dollars 355 looks like the Matterhorn
now,' he said.
Mr Charles Kernot of Durlacher &amp; Company, stockbrokers, said that, looking
at the charts, he 'would not be surprised if gold came back to Dollars 325'
in the short term. However he remained bullish about gold in the long term,
because he believed that the general world economic malaise would lead to
currency devaluations.
Mr Neil Carson, marketing director at Johnson Matthey, the world's largest
platinum marketing group, stands by the company's May forecast that the
price would reach Dollars 400 a troy ounce by the end of the year.
'These dramatic movements can sometimes happen in this month, when there are
so few players in the market.'
Automotive catalysts used 500,000 troy ounces in 1991, but this year 800,000
troy ounces will be used, Mr Carson said, pointing out that by the end of
December every new car in the European Community has to be fitted with a
catalyst.
'If the price dropped by Dollars 5 in any other month than August, there
would have been heavy buying into the drop,' he suggested.
Other observers believe the platinum market will bounce once August is over,
but see Dollars 380 as the top level this year - and then only if the
world's economic performance improves in the final quarter.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool takes a back seat on UK
farms - Low prices discourage quality improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDMUND MORPHET has been hill farming in the Yorkshire Dales for almost 40
years. His 900 sheep, like many others scattered about the hills, are
largely of the Dales-bred variety - black-headed with a whitish snout,
adaptable to climate changes. 'Sheep with a bit of black in the shanks or
the head are believed to be a bit hardier. . . buyers like them that way,'
he says.
The buyers he speaks of want the sheep for their meat or for breeding.
Buyers of the sheep's wool have a rather different view. Stray black hairs
in the white wool make it less desirable to carpet and cloth manufacturers,
less marketable, less competitive internationally. 'If we could educate the
producer to breed so that the effect of black hairs is minimised, we would
be helping the carpet industry and the producer also,' says Mr Maurice
Grass, managing director at the British Wool Marketing Board.
The BWMB has a tough job ahead of it - and stray black hairs are just the
beginning. The wool market is in the doldrums, having just weathered its
worst three years. Britain, Australia and New Zealand have wool stockpiles
which continue to depress prices. And in the next couple of years the UK
government is going to end its price guarantee programme, meaning an open
market for British wool.
British farmers are obliged by law to sell their wool to the board, which is
in turn obliged to buy it. Last year, 100,000 producers sold it 50.5m kg of
wool.
The board grades and sorts the wool, organises auctions for buyers every two
weeks, and stockpiles that which does not sell - it still has more than 4m
kg from 1991. And every year it guarantees farmers a price for their product
 -a price that is historically low but still higher than it would be in a
free market.
Several factors have conspired to take the average auction price of wool
below 65p a kilogram over the past 12 months - although the subsidised
British farmer still gets an average 82p.
Most British wool is used in carpet and upholstery manufacturing - markets
which have been hit severely by depressed property sectors in many
countries. Political upheavals in significant markets like China and Russia
have further dampened demand. Meanwhile, man-made fibres and changing
fashions have overtaken wool, both in carpet-making and in textiles.
Wool's share of the world textile fibre market is now only about 4 per cent.
Britain's main competition comes from New Zealand, which also produces
mostly carpet wool - albeit a lot more. New Zealand's total annual wool
production is more than 220m kg - or 9 per cent of the world market -
compared with Britain's 2 per cent share. Australia is the largest producer,
with a third of the market, but its sheep produce finer wools largely for
the clothing industry.
The BWMB's aim is to boost sales by improving the quality of the British
product, so that it can compete effectively on world markets. Mr Grass says:
'The future for British wool lies in it being accepted as a truly
international fibre'.
The board is conducting a campaign to impress on farmers the need to deliver
wool properly packaged and uncontaminated - rather than tainted by tar,
colouring, other fibres, moisture, straw or feed. Breeds are another area of
contention; the board not only prefers pure white sheep, but would also like
to see more breeds with finer wools, to increase markets for the British
product.
There is a troublesome catch-22, however. In Britain, wool represents only
between 5 and 10 per cent of a sheep's market value. Farmers are therefore
reluctant - or even unwilling - to devote much effort to keeping the wool
clean or to introducing new breeds. Without higher prices, farmers are
unlikely to address the issue of wool quality; without improved quality,
prices are unlikely to rise much.
Hill farmer Mr Morphet explains: 'The first priority in selecting breeding
stock is size and length, next is bone and colour and the wool comes along
behind'. He receives an average Pounds 1.63 net per ewe for its annual wool
clip, or about Pounds 1,200 a year - 'an insignificant amount', he says.
Falling wool prices and the impending removal of the price guarantee - a
government subsidy that will end sometime after next April - mean the board
has had to clean up its own act over the past couple of years.
Eighteen months ago it employed 160 people and had borrowings of about
Pounds 40m, largely a result of the high cost of stockpiling unsold wool.
There are now 60 employees and no borrowings. Marketing costs have been
reduced by more than a quarter since 1990, to levels last seen in 1984.
Most of the marketing funds - about 80 per cent - go to transporting,
grading and packing the wool, and plans for further automation could help
reduce costs further. Meanwhile, the board is pursuing new outlets for
British wool - such as Japanese futons and Italian mattresses. More unusual
applications include footpath repairs on the Pennine Way, on booms for
containing oil slicks and on football pitches.
Once the guarantee ends, there is then some question over the future role of
the board. As one wool buyer questions: will it still be able to force
farmers to sell it their wool if better prices are being offered elsewhere?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TONY PENDER, chief executive of English Estates, believes that the Urban
Regeneration Agency will bring the government's development activities into
'sharper focus immediately', writes Chris Tighe.
'We are putting into one agency a flexible set of tools, an agency which can
intervene at all stages of the development cycle,' he says. 'The possible
synergy is considerable. Derelict Land Grant and City Grant are demand-led
grant structures. In a sense we (English Estates) are the opposite of that.'
The new agency will permit greater targeting and, unlike English Estates,
will have powers to make compulsory purchase orders, he says. He also sees
the new agency as an effective part of City Challenge initiatives, many of
which have a strong property element. 'An agency like this could be
extremely helpful in pushing things along. The timing is good.'
Mr Pender disagrees with critics who say the URA should have had an
all-embracing remit, to cut down the plethora of regeneration initiatives.
'If you have too many functions, you end up with an enormous spread of work
and a problem of co-ordination.'
He does not expect the new agency to solve all the complex problems of
declining urban areas. 'I don't believe anybody believes that property of
itself is the answer,' says Mr Pender. 'Urban renewal is a means to an end,
not an end in itself.'

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Finnish bank offers maximum
FM950m convertible bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union Bank of Finland (Unitas) yesterday issued a maximum FM950m
offering of convertible bonds, in order to strengthen its capital base.
Mr Vesa Vainio, the bank's president said the additional capital would
strengthen the bank's lending ability by FM10bn.
'The issue will give investors a good yield but will also be profitable for
Unitas since this will be equity-ranked capital,' he explained. The issue
has a maturity of 50 years.
The bank's share capital may increase as a result of the conversion of bonds
by a maximum of FM285m.
Each bond with a nominal value of FM10,000 may be converted into 300 A
shares each with a nominal value of FM10. The conversion right comes into
force on January 4 next year. The subscription period will be from August
17-28.
Yesterday the bank said it would report a substantially larger loss in its
results for 1992 than the FM128m deficit of last year.
'The banking sector's problems will continue at least throughout next year
and possibly longer,' said Mr Ahti Hirvonen, Unitas chief executive. 'Credit
write-offs are likely to increase in relative terms towards the end of this
year.'
However, he pointed to a number of positive factors for the bank. Its
capital adequacy ratio has risen to 10.7 per cent as risk-weighted assets
have declined while its core capital ratio is 7.4 per cent.
Mr Hirvonen added that the group's structural reorganisation announced at
the end of June was going ahead as planned.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS review suggests sparse
credit creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond markets will have to work hard to refinance the
record volumes of bonds maturing by the end of next year, suggesting that
relatively little credit will be created, according to the Bank for
International Settlements.
In its latest review of the international financial markets, BIS reports
that the scale of bonds being repaid in the first quarter of this year, at
Dollars 57bn, was unprecedented. As a result, in spite of the large number
of bonds being issued - only exceeded once before - the net new finance
created through the bond markets was 'comparatively small'.
Bond redemptions will remain large, with a further Dollars 135bn due to
repay by the end of the year and a further Dollars 260bn due in 1993. About
a third of the repayments relates to equity-linked instruments launched by
Japanese borrowers in the late 1980s on the back of soaring stock prices.
Even taking into account the high level of bond redemptions, the securities
markets have still been in the unusual position of generating considerably
more new credit than the international banking system. According to the BIS
figures, the bond markets created a net Dollars 150bn in the year to the end
of March, compared with just Dollars 55bn of net new international bank
credit.
This reverses the position of previous years. In the year to March 1991, for
example, bond markets generated a net Dollars 143bn, while banks supplied
Dollars 405bn of new credit.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Issues suffer as Moody's
downgrades Italy's rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of poor performance, Italian government bonds and Eurobonds
were dealt a further blow yesterday, when Moody's downgraded Italy's foreign
debt rating from Aa1 to Aa3.
Italian bond prices have followed a downward spiral since Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union in June, which
re-awakened worries about Italy's ability to tackle economic difficulties,
possibly without the constraints of tough economic targets.
Since the Danish vote, the 10-year Italian bond future on Liffe has fallen
from 98.29 to 92.45 at yesterday's close. The Liffe contract shed a further
half point on news of the downgrade.
Italy's Eurobonds, once the most actively traded in the market, have been
suffering from widening spreads and declining liquidity.
Italy's 20-year Ecu Eurobonds, which prior to the Danish referendum traded
at a spread of 25 basis points above the French 20-year Ecu OAT, are quoted
at a spread of 80 points, having widened a further five basis points
yesterday.
In the dollar sector, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent Eurobonds due 2001 widened from
43 basis points over the new 10-year US Treasury yield to 48 basis points
yesterday.
Dealers noted that any further downgrade, taking Italy's rating to single-A,
would have a dramatic effect. Many investors cannot hold bonds rated lower
than single-A.
'A lot of central banks hold Italian Eurobonds. Even if they don't start
lightening up, they certainly will not be buying any paper,' a dealer said.
One government bond trader pointed out that Spain and Finland both have
better ratings than Italy. 'This is very important for a country like Italy
which claims to be the fifth largest economy in the world - we expect that
investors will now be more attracted to Spain than Italy.' Italy has not
tapped the international bond market in over a year, relying instead on its
domestic bond market.
Its Dollars 21bn of foreign debt had been placed under review for possible
downgrade in June - following the Danish referendum - having lost its prized
triple-A rating a year earlier. The debt has an implied rating of double-A
plus from Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading rating agency.
The latest downgrade reflects the prospects for only a gradual reversal in
the weakened state of public finances, and political uncertainty over
European unification, as well as the 'fluidity' of domestic politics.
However, Moody's described the steps taken by the new government, for
example, to lower the budget deficit and stabilise the debt/gross domestic
product ratio, as positive.
As a result of the downgrade, the foreign debt ratings of Enel, Cariplo,
Istito Mobiliare Italiano, Credito Italiano and Mote dei Paschi di Siena
have also been lowered to Aa3.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Demand holds up for floating-rate notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER offering of subordinated floating-rate notes with minimum and
maximum coupon levels brought the total amount of 'collared' floaters in the
past two weeks to about Dollars 2bn, confounding dealers' predictions of
limited demand.
The latest deal was a Dollars 100m offering of 10-year notes by De Nationale
Investeringsbank, the 50 per cent Dutch government-owned investment bank.
The notes pay interest of  1/8 point below the London interbank offered
rate, with a minimum coupon of 5 1/8 per cent and a maximum coupon of 10 per
cent. The deal was arranged by Morgan Stanley International.
Demand continues to be concentrated among Swiss retail and small
institutional investors, with an appetite for dollar paper yielding more
than current money market rates.
Elsewhere, Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, launched a Fl 500m offering
of subordinated floating-rate notes via ABN Amro. The notes pay interest at
the six-month Amsterdam interbank offered rate for the first two years, then
pay a fixed coupon of 8 1/4 per cent for the rest of the life of the issue,
which matures in 2004.
BRITISH GAS yesterday lost its triple-A debt rating from Moody's, when its
Pounds 3.6bn of long-term debt was downgraded to Aa2 by Moody's. It had been
under review for possible downgrade since May.
The move follows a similar action last week by Standard &amp; Poor's, the other
leading US agency, which cut the company's rating to double-A plus.
The agency cited the company's changing structure, as it invests in
exploration and production, increasing competition in the UK, and regulatory
constraints.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas maps out
flight path for 1990s - Nikki Tait looks at the company's progress and
restructuring plans and puts them into perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas, could not be accused of false
modesty. 'When the going gets tough,' began his message to shareholders in
the company's latest annual report, 'the tough get going . . . It is an apt
description of our position.'
No one questions the difficulties which are being faced by America's number
one defence contractor and the world's third largest commercial airline
builder.
In the aftermath of the cold war, US defence spending is falling at a rate
of more than 5 per cent a year, and government business still accounts for
more than half McDonnell Douglas' sales.
On the airline side, the company ranks behind Boeing of the US and Europe's
Airbus, two strong competitors. This market, too, is likely to be difficult
until the mid-1990s: major airlines, having ordered new aircraft with heady
enthusiasm in the late-1980s, are scaling back in the recession-hit 1990s.
Moreover, stretched financially, McDonnell Douglas needs wealthy partners if
it is to develop its jet operations - in particular, the new and
much-trumpeted MD-12 jumbo. Negotiations, notably with Taiwan Aerospace,
have so far come to nothing.
But what is moot is whether this week's announcement of a major
restructuring in McDonnell's military/government operations signals that the
company is turning a corner - as the same annual report's cover so proudly
boasts.
For once, Wall Street, which has not been kind to the company of late, seems
favourably impressed. Since Monday, the shares have gained over Dollars 6,
an 18 per cent advance.
Several analysts have raised their 1992 profit forecasts, and a number of
brokerage houses now rank the shares a 'buy'. Given that the stock is still
trading at half its level a year ago, this is not a major endorsement. But
it is a small step in the right direction.
Details of the restructuring remain opaque. Broadly, the company plans to
divide the six businesses geographically, into two divisions.
One, based on the west coast, will take in the space-related projects,
electronic systems and the C-17 military transport programme. The other,
centred in St Louis, Missouri, will incorporate the missile, combat aircraft
and helicopter operations.
The mechanics of this reorganisation will be worked out over the next three
months by a newly-created 'office of the chairman', comprising five senior
executives. In the meantime, McDonnell Douglas declines to speculate on the
potential cost-savings.
But it does acknowledge that jobs will go, as duplicate administrative
functions, like personnel, are rationalised. On the manufacturing front, at
least one plant - making aircraft parts in Columbus, Ohio - will close next
year. It employs 1,000 people.
The aim is to find either a buyer or a joint venture partner for the
helicopter business, which has annual sales of about Dollars 750m. That,
suggests one analyst, could bring in approximately Dollars 500m if the first
course is pursued.
For some observers, it is the implied culture change - rather than the
numbers alone - which is providing the encouragement.
News of job cuts and re-trenchment are nothing new at McDonnell Douglas:
only last month, for example, it told employees that up to 5,000 positions
could be axed in the commercial aviation division by the end of the year.
But Mr John McDonnell's statement this week suggested a commitment to only
those businesses where McDonnell is, or could become, a market leader - that
is, number one or two worldwide. This, say the bulls, could herald a more
focused approach.
'We view it as a positive development,' commented Tassos Philippakos,
vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, the Wall Street rating agency.
'It's a shift in emphasis on to the bottom line and the financial side,
rather than assertions that McDonnell Douglas is the leading defence
contractor and a big commercial airline manufacturer'.
'Obviously, a culture change has more long-term implications than just a
drastic reduction in the head count.'
But if Monday's news was generally viewed as a step in the right direction,
the downside is that all questions overhanging the commercial airline
operations remain unanswered.
For months, analysts have been sceptical about the company's ability to
proceed with the MD-12 programme. 'The wrong airplane at the wrong time and
the wrong price,' ran one recent circular.
However, without the MD-12, there are fears that the company will continue
to cede ground to Airbus and Boeing, with their wider range of products, and
its market share will dwindle inexorably.
Under this week's reorganisation plans, the commercial aircraft operations
would appear to become even more segregated.
That, in turn, has prompted renewed speculation that McDonnell Douglas will
quit the business altogether, either by selling or phasing out its
operations. The Missouri company, however, publicly reaffirmed its
commitment.
And it is worth putting Wall Street's response to the week's news into
perspective. After all, McDonnell shares have been sitting on a extremely
low rating, back at levels seen two years ago, and way below the company's
book value of Dollars 105 a share.
The stock, moreover, fell heavily when second-quarter earnings showed a 51
per cent dive, to Dollars 38m, earlier this month.
In short, if this is progress, it comes against a very unprogressive
background.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Second-quarter loss for
Equitable Life parent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Companies, the parent group of Equitable Life, the fifth largest
life insurer in the US, yesterday reported a second-quarter after-tax loss
of Dollars 17.6m in the wake of heavy losses from real estate investments.
The result, however, was still a considerable improvement on the Dollars
212.6m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991.
Yesterday's results cover the period before Equitable was transformed from a
mutual to a stock company by last month's Dollars 392m stock-market
flotation. The group had to take an extraordinary Dollars 25.9m charge to
cover the cost of the demutualisation, which meant the final net loss for
Equitable in the second quarter was Dollars 43.5m.
The primary factors in the losses on Equitable's insurance investment
portfolio were additions to valuation allowances and write-downs in publicly
traded securities, which over the past six months have totalled Dollars
131.7m, although they were partly offset by investment gains of Dollars
61.8m.
The bulk of the investment losses was for valuation allowances set aside for
mortgages. Equitable said problem commercial property mortgages at June 30
represented 7.5 per cent of the commercial portfolio, up from 4.4 per cent
at the end of 1991.
After the write-downs and additions to valuations, Equitable's insurance
units produced an after-tax loss of Dollars 43.7m in the April-to-June
period, compared with the Dollars 218.5m loss incurred in the second quarter
of 1991.
The company, however, believes the insurance operations are regaining their
footing after a difficult 1991. New individual premiums and deposits were up
on a year ago, and surrenders and withdrawals of individual insurance and
annuities were down.
Equitable's investment businesses segment, which includes the brokerage firm
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and asset management companies, put in a strong
second-quarter performance.
They contributed after-tax profits of Dollars 48.9m, almost double the
contribution of a year ago. DLJ was the star performer, thanks to market
share gains in the underwriting business, which led to higher commission and
fee income.
Investors were slightly disappointed with Equitable's results, and the
company's share price was marked down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 .

<TEXT>
ZENITH Electronics, the troubled US television maker, has unveiled a new
financing plan that may help steady the company following sev-eral years of
debilitating losses.
Zenith has been hit by losses in consumer electronics and investments in new
technologies, such as high definition television.
The financing plan includes a public offering of 8m shares of common stock,
which will raise approximately Dollars 55m at the current share price, and a
new three-year Dollars 60m working capital loan from the Bank of New York.
The new credit facility will replace its existing agreement, which expires
at the end of the year.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zenith said of the
8m shares to be sold, 1.2m would be offered outside the US. The company has
29.3m shares outstanding.
It also said the underwriters will have the option to issue up to 1.2m more
shares on the same terms to cover over-allotments.
Salomon Brothers and The First Boston Corporation were named as managers of
the underwriting group.
The proceeds from the stock sale may be used to redeem some or all of the
company's outstanding notes, and repay other debt for its working capital
facility as well as research and development expenses.
Although Zenith privately sold about 5 per cent of its shares to South
Korea's Lucky Gold Star group last year, it has not sold shares to the
public since July 1987.

third-quarter provision

<TEXT>
NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2
Stealth bomber programme, warned yesterday it expects to make a Dollars 152m
provision related to its cruise missile programme in the third quarter.
The company said the charge reflected the estimated financial impact of its
proposal to extend the schedule to complete the flight test programme of the
Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile.
The provision will cut third-quarter earnings by around Dollars 100m or
Dollars 2.13 a share, and is being taken after discussion with the US Air
Force this month.
Northrop claims the provision should be sufficient to complete the
development programme, but added the possibility of future provisions
remained until the contract is finished. The missile programme was awarded
before Northrop stopped accepting fixed-price development contracts in 1988.

been declared, up 12.5 per cent on last year's interim of 10 cents.
Sir Run Run Shaw, executive chairman, said the results were very
encouraging. They were attributable to cost cutting and improvements in
production efficiency, he said.
Although the government has liberalised the market for cable and satellite
broadcasting. Sir Run Run said development the management believes the
prospects for TVB remain positive.
Sir Run Sun and his family control 34.6 per cent of TVB while the family of

HUGHES Aircraft is pushing ahead with a revolutionary satellite television
project designed to offer more than 150 TV channels all over the US by the
beginning of 1994.
Hughes, the aircraft and communications division of General Motors, has
already committed Dollars 500m to the project and the first of three
satellites is scheduled for launch next year.
The Hughes subsidiary involved, DirecTv, yesterday announced the latest
stage for the venture - a deal with Digital Equipment of the US to operate
the national computerised billing system for the project. Network Computing
Corporation will provide the software.
Mr Eddy Hartenstein, DirecTv president, estimates the US company could be
reaching 10m homes by the end of the decade.
Earlier this year Thomson Consumer Electronics was given an exclusive deal
under which it will produce the first 1m satellite receivers, expected to
retail at around Dollars 700.
The scrambling equipment for the service will be provided by News Datacom, a
subsidiary of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
No less than 40-50 channels will be devoted to a pay-per-view movie service
with showing of popular films starting every 30 minutes.
A second major slice of the system will carry subscription sports - all the
games not carried on national television.
DirecTv will also deliver 20 channels of cable television to rural areas
unlikely to get their own cable networks in the foreseeable future.
A fourth strand of programmes will be aimed at special interest groups or
ethnic minorities.

LOWER copper prices and reduced sales of zirconium products accounted for a
10 per cent fall in profits at Palabora Mining, the South African copper
producer, in the six months to the end of June.
Although operating costs rose by only 6.7 per cent, well below inflation,
turnover dropped to R534.4m (Dollars 193.6m) from R557.6m a year earlier.
Operating profits fell to R201.6m from R245.8m while net profits dropped to
R106.2m from R118m.
Mr Frank Fenwick, managing director, said copper sold, including metal in
concentrates, advanced to 69,569 tonnes from 68,147 tonnes. About 85 per
cent of the copper was sold in the form of cathode and rod, with the
remainder as concentrates.
Production levels were expected to be maintained in the second half, and
forward markets suggested prices would be reasonably firm.
The interim dividend, meanwhile, is being maintained at 110 cents a share on
earnings of 346 cents a share compared with 417 cents a year earlier.

THE SLOWDOWN in the French economy affected a number of large industrial
companies in the first half of 1992. The Suez industrial group, the
Thomson-CSF electronics company and the Lafarge Coppee building materials
group yesterday reported reduced interim sales.
France is still in stronger shape than many of its European trading
partners, notably the UK and Italy, but the economy has slowed over the past
year reflecting the impact of high interest rates on industrial investment
and consumer spending. The CAC 40 Index - down sharply this week - yesterday
slipped by a further 0.44 per cent to close at 1,722.
Suez, with extensive investments in French finance and industry, said sales
fell from FFr97.16bn (Dollars 19.47bn) in the first half of 1991 to
FFr87.16bn in the same period this year. The fall is partly due to Suez'
ongoing disposal programme, but comparable sales sales fell by 0.6 per cent.
Thomson-CSF, recently clouded by controversy over the government's plans to
create a French electronics super-group, saw first-half sales slide from
FFr16.5bn to FFr14.76bn. However, the company detected an improvement in
trading during the second quarter.
Other large French groups fared better. Elf-Aquitaine, the energy concern,
mustered a 6.6 per cent increase in sales to FFr98.86bn in the first half.
Michelin, the tyre maker which has been rationalising its interests to try
to return to profit, also increased sales ahead of inflation with a 5.4 per
cent rise to FFr34.8bn.
In the financial sector, Credit Local de France, one of the larger banks,
reported a 22.5 per cent rise in turnover to FFr20.87bn. Two of the biggest
insurers, Assurances Generales de France and GAN, also announced sales
increases of 10.4 per cent to FFr29.92bn and 12.3 per cent to FFr21.75bn
respectively.
By contrast, a series of lacklustre sales figures from the construction
industry, illustrated the sluggishness of that area of the economy.
Bouygues, the world's biggest building group, saw sales rise below inflation
at 1.5 per cent to FFr30.43bn in the first half. Lafarge Coppee's interim
turnover fell by 1 per cent to FFr15.06bn.
Poliet, another leading player in construction, mustered a meagre 0.5 per
cent sales rise to FFr9.91bn. Fougerolle reported a sharp increase in
first-half turnover from FFr5.65bn to FFr19.24bn, but this increase was
solely due to its takeover of SAE. On a comparable basis Fougerolle's
interim sales fell from FFr19.55bn to FFr19.24bn.
Meanwhile, one of France's most colourful corporate figures, Mr Bernard
Tapie, reported a 14.7 per cent fall in first-half turnover from FFr6.63bn
to FFr5.65bn for Bernard Tapie Finance. BTF has since sold almost all its
businesses. Mr Tapie plans to use his FFr1bn profit from the sales to buy
new businesses.

<TEXT>
FRANCE's prestigious drinks and cosmetics companies fought to maintain sales
in a volatile market during the first half of this year, according to
interim turnover figures announced yesterday.
L'Oreal, the world's biggest cosmetics company, saw sales rise by 10.4 per
cent to FFr19.93bn (Dollars 4.02bn) in the first six months of the year from
FFr18.05bn during the same period of 1991.
The group, which has a wide spread of cosmetics interests across the market,
countered the weakness in the luxury sector with a recovery in duty free
sales after the disruption caused by the Gulf War in the opening months of
last year.
Clarins, another force in French cosmetics, mustered an 18 per cent increase
in first half sales from FFr878m to FFr1.03bn thanks to continued growth in
its international markets.
The revival in duty-free sales also benefited LVMH, one of the largest
forces in luxury goods worldwide, which reported a modest 4.5 per cent
increase in sales to FFr9.68bn for the first half.
Perfume sales showed stronger growth of 24 per cent to FFr2.54bn, fuelled by
the duty free recovery and the launch of Dune and Amarige. There was a 6.7
per cent fall in drinks turnover to FFr4.44bn chiefly due to depressed
champagne sales.
Two other leading French drinks groups, Pernod-Ricard and Remy-Cointreau,
reported reduced turnover for the early part of the year.
Pernod's interim sales slipped by 3.5 per cent to FFr6.88bn, although the
fall was mainly due to the sale of Societe des Vins de France. Remy's
first-quarter sales fell from FFr1.16bn to FFr1.04bn.
Taittinger, the champagne maker, managed to increase interim sales by 38 per
cent to FFr2.2bn despite the difficulties of the champagne market.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hang Seng Bank earnings rise 22%

<TEXT>
HANG Seng Bank, the listed subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank,
yesterday reported a 22 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.3bn
(USDollars 298m) in the six months to June 30, from HKDollars 1.9bn a year
earlier, and forecast a 67 per cent increase in dividends for the year.
The bank said it had reviewed its dividend policy in light of its decision
to report earnings on a fully-disclosed basis. Hongkong Bank, which owns
61.5 per cent of Hang Sang, moved to full disclosure when it bid for Midland
Bank earlier this year.
Mr Alexander Au, managing director and deputy chief executive, said in
future the bank intended to pay around half of its net profits in dividends
 -a third of which would be paid out at the interim stage. Previously it had
paid out a half of its reported earnings.
He said, however, the percentage increases in the pay-out this year were
exceptional and one-off. The increases reflected the move to full disclosure
and their scale would not be repeated in the coming years, he said.
Hang Sang said it would pay an interim dividend of 65 cents a share,
compared with 38 cents. It expected to pay not less than HKDollars 1.67 for
the year - an increase in total 1992 dividends of 67 per cent over the 1991
payout.
The bank said the Hong Kong economy had maintained its momentum in the first
half, with the trade sector performing well and domestic demand buoyant.
'Against this background, the group's deposit and loan growth both recorded
satisfactory progress during the first half.'
Mr Au said the bank registered some slight growth in mortgage lending but
there was evidence of a slowdown towards the end of the half year.
He said the 'star' performer for the bank was trade finance. There had also
been very brisk growth in exports, especially re-exports.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa in cost-cutting plan
as privatisation looms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA, the struggling state-controlled German airline, has prepared a
new cost-cutting package designed to eliminate losses and prepare it for
privatisation.
Confirming a pre-tax deficit of DM542m (Dollars 370m) for the first six
months of this year, the airline said that its supervisory board would be
asked to approve the new measures at a meeting on August 31.
Despite selling 19 per cent more tickets in the first half, which boosted
turnover 9 per cent to DM7.2bn, and raising DM105m from the sale of 23
surplus aircraft, the national flag carrier's losses increased from DM331m
last time.
Although no details have been released officially, the workforce has been
prepared for a fresh round of job cuts, in addition to this year's planned
1,800 reduction in the 50,000-strong payroll.
The latest issue of the company magazine pointed out that the number of
administrative staff had increased 47 per cent since 1986. Personnel costs
are more than a third higher than those of British Airways, wrote board
member Mr Adrian von Dornberg.
Plans to scrap first-class services on European flights are expected to save
DM600m a year, and Lufthansa is also likely further to reduce its fleet.
Other economy measures could include stepping up last-minute ticket sales in
an attempt to improve load factors. At present, only 60 per cent of seats
are filled on the average flight.
The company blamed its continuing decline on worldwide market weakness and
over-capacity, 'exorbitant' tolls at German airports, high insurance costs
and the transatlantic price war. Earlier this month Lufthansa announced
price cuts on some US routes of up to 36 per cent.
Heavy loss-making flights out of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Philadelphia
will be cancelled from October 25.
The weakness of the US dollar was also costing the airline more than DM100m
a year, the company said.
Apart from the urgent need to stem losses, the Lufthansa management is under
pressure to prepare the business for full privatisation. The government
recently announced that it aimed to press ahead with the sale of a wide
range of state assets.
Lufthansa, together with Telekom, the national telecommunications network,
was named among the prime candidates.
Bonn, which still controls more than 50 per cent of the equity, wants to
raise funds to reduce mounting federal debt and help ease the costs of
financing economic redevelopment in the former GDR.
Its initial aim is to reduce its Lufthansa holding to 25.1 per cent. The
government will retain this as a blocking stake until full completion of the
European single market, the finance ministry said.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: KLM Royal Dutch plunges 72%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLM ROYAL Dutch Airlines yesterday reported a 72 per cent decline in
first-quarter net profit, due partly to a widening of losses at NorthWest
Airlines, the US carrier in which it owns a substantial minority stake.
Other factors behind the downturn were higher interest charges and the
absence of book profits on the sale of aircraft.
Net profit tumbled to Fl 38.4m (Dollars 23.3m) in the three months to June
30 from Fl 135.9m in the same period of 1991-1992.
Operating profit improved by Fl 28.8m to Fl 182.3m, but this increase was
almost entirely offset by a Fl 26.8m rise in interest payments.
At the same time, KLM's share of losses posted by associate companies -
mainly NorthWest - widened to Fl 60.9m from Fl 25.8m the year before. KLM
also showed a book loss of Fl 0.8m on the sale of computer equipment in the
latest quarter compared with a Fl 62.7m book profit in the previous year on
the disposal of older DC-10 aircraft.
Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, told the airline's shareholders' meeting yesterday
that the industry faced a difficult year. The fierce price competition on
fares between Europe and North America would be felt not only by KLM but
also by NorthWest, as well as by competitors.
KLM declined to predict full-year results, citing the onset of price wars
over the North Atlantic and the uncertainty surrounding the results of the
company's holdings in other airlines.
The first-quarter results were below analysts' forecasts, and the company's
shares closed down 4.5 per cent at Fl 27.70, though above the day's low of
Fl 26.
KLM noted that the 18.8 per cent rise in operating profit was achieved
against the background of a lower dollar and the outbreak of fierce
competition on important North Atlantic routes.
The airline, which is in the midst of a cost-cutting programme, added that
the productivity of its workforce improved by 14 per cent compared with the
first quarter of last year.
Total traffic at KLM and its Cityhopper subsidiary, including passengers,
cargo and mail, rose by 12 per cent to 1.35bn tonne-kilometres.
But traffic revenue (excluding newly-consolidated Air Littoral of France and
Transavia, the Dutch charter airline) increased by only 9 per cent,
reflecting fare-cutting and negative currency movements.
Total turnover, including new consolidations, increased by by 17 per cent to
Fl 2.2bn, outstripping a 16 per cent increase in total costs to Fl 2.0bn.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cut-rate paper for Efim's
creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Efim, the Italian state holding company which went into
voluntary liquidation last month, are to be issued bonds paying interest at
only about half current market rates, the Italian au-thorities announced
yesterday.
Although they will receive back the full value of their loans when the bonds
mature after five years, Italy's unilateral decision to first freeze
payments and then cut the interest rate has already angered the country's
foreign bank creditors.
The difference in interest rates between those on the bonds and current
market levels means creditors will receive only about 80 per cent of the
total principal and interest that would otherwise have been due.
Mr Piero Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, noted that after allowing for
reclaimed tax, the figure would be about 90 per cent. Mr Barucci stressed
that the difference would decrease should market interest rates fall during
the life of the new bonds.
Under the terms for the new paper, announced last month but only revealed in
detail yesterday, creditors will be given paper, denominated in either lira
or ecu. The coupon on the lira bonds will be 7.25 per cent, while that for
the ecu will be 4 per cent.
The details received a hostile reception from foreign banks. The decision to
offer paper in more than one currency and to pay interest retrospectively
from July 18, when Efim was wound up, was appreciated, but bankers reacted
angrily to the coupon levels.
The details came in a government decree, replacing original legislation
which put Efim into voluntary liquidation and froze its debt. Under the
changes, Efim subsidiaries which are trading profitably will be able to
resume payments to creditors.
Efim, with debts of L8,500bn (Dollars 7.66m), owes about L3,500bn to foreign
banks.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aegis restructuring proposals unpalatable
says James Capel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING proposals announced last week by Aegis, the European media
buyer, were yesterday criticised as 'uniformly unpalatable' by James Capel,
the broker.
Aegis, which last month saw the resignation of Mr Peter Scott as chairman,
is planning a refinancing which will further increase the control of its two
main shareholders, Mr Gilbert Gross and Warburg Pincus, the US investment
bank. Mr Gross is still due deferred payments from Aegis after it bought his
Carat business in France in 1988.
In a circular, prepared by its media research team, Capel argues that Mr
Gross and certain associates are being allowed to lift their stake in Aegis
when its share price is weak because of Mr Scott's resignation and
uncertainty about a French government inquiry into media buying companies.
'Shareholders are seeing earnings per share sacrificed and their interests
generally being unrepresented,' the circular said.
Aegis rejected the criticism as unfair. 'We are convinced the package is in
the interests of all shareholders,' it said.
The proposed refinancing will lift the stake held by Mr Gross and his
associates, mainly group managers, from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per cent,
although they will only hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights. Warburg
Pincus will increase its share of voting rights from 14.8 per cent to 16.4
per cent.
The proposals need approval from 75 per cent of shareholders at an
extraordinary meeting next month, where Mr Gross and his associates will not
be able to vote.
Some UK institutions are unhappy because the company's share price has
collapsed from 129p earlier this year to 39p yesterday. They are also
concerned by Aegis's decision to shift its head office to Paris since this
will free the company from London's takeover code.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Japanese exposure hits F&amp;C value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNSUCCESSFUL foray into the Japanese market hit net asset performance at
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust in the first half of 1992.
Net asset value per share at the UK's largest investment trust fell 1.7 per
cent to 181.4p in the six months. Over the same period the FT-A All-Share
Index rose 2.4 per cent.
In the period Foreign &amp; Colonial withdrew money from equity and fixed
interest markets in the UK, US and Europe in order to commit funds to Japan
and Latin America. However, the Japanese Topix index dropped by 29.9 per
cent over the period.
Mr Michael Hart, joint manager, said he was still looking for value in
Japan. 'When the tide turns and sentiment improves,' he said, 'the market
could race away.' However, he was nervous about the high ratings demanded by
US equities and the high dollar earnings content of some European companies.
In the UK market he hoped for some recovery with the FT-SE 100 Index perhaps
bouncing back to 2,500 by the end of the year.
At the end of June, the trust's asset mix was (in percentages): UK 43.9;
Europe 16.9; North America 25.1; Japan 8.6; Far East 3.7; and Latin America
1.8.
Revenue was boosted by bond profits and the total reached Pounds 25.8m
(Pounds 25.8m), with earnings coming out at 2.31p per share (2.19p).
The interim dividend is increased to 1.12p (1.07p) and the total is forecast
at 3.35p (3.19p).
COMMENT
It is very much in Foreign &amp; Colonial's nature to under perform in bear
markets. Its philosophy is to gear up when share prices are depressed in
order to benefit doubly when they rise again. Obviously it was premature in
wading into the Japanese market but its bottom-fishing strategy has been so
successful in the past - this year should see the 22nd consecutive rise in
annual dividends - that it seems more than likely it will work again. With
the number of shareholders - now 53,330 - steadily increasing, the discount
to net asset value does not look excessive at about 10 per cent. The trust
still seems one of the best ways for the private investor to have a stake in
world equity markets.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Showing how to find the wood through the
trees - Andrew Jack on the book which has sparked a storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERRY Smith, the suspended head of UK research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
likens company accounting in the 1980s to a jungle with its own rules and
many species of animal.
Little did he know that he would be one of the first forest prowlers to be
devoured as a tropical storm erupted over his forthcoming book, called
Accounting for Growth.
In a draft obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Smith describes his aim as
trying to explain how a company which is reporting profits can still go
bust. He says he intends not so much to help readers make money from
investments as to prevent them from losing it.
He cites three large recent corporate collapses - Polly Peck, British &amp;
Commonwealth and Coloroll - and argues they were in part the result of
techniques of creative accounting or financial engineering.
He then systematically addresses 12 techniques used in companies' accounts
which he says can massage their figures to produce growth in earnings per
share and make the balance sheet appear less geared than it actually is.
The 'accounting health check list' items - in order of greatest frequency -
are:
 - extraordinary and exceptional items;
 - disposals profits on sales of assets taken above the line or by
deconsolidation of subsidiaries in anticipation of sale
 - pre-acquisition write-downs: making provisions to adjust purchases to
their 'fair value';
 - capitalisation of costs such as interest and research and development;
 - pension fund surplus used to reduce the regular annual charge or to
create a pre-payment asset;
 - contingent liabilities;
 - issues of convertibles with premium put options or variable rate
preferred stocks;
 - deferred consideration: earn-out commitments on acquisitions;
 - changes in the method or time over which assets are depreciated;
 - capitalising brands in the balance sheet;
 - off-balance sheet finance, using quasi-subsidiaries, or the sale and
re-purchase of assets and joint ventures
 - mismatches between the currency of borrowing and deposit.
A section towards the end of the book highlights the incidence of these
techniques among more than 200 of the largest quoted UK companies, by market
capitalisation, at the beginning of the year. A series of tables shows which
of the techniques each employs.
If the uses are added together for each company, Grand Metropolitan - which
complained to UBS after reports of the book appeared - scores highest, with
nine of the 12 techniques. Ladbroke and Trafalgar House use eight, and 41
companies use at least five.
Mr Smith stresses that use of the techniques does not mean a company uses
creative accounting, nor that it is doing anything detrimental. Use of an
extraordinary item could represent the most conservative approach, for
example.
All the accounts listed follow UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,
meaning that they present a 'true and fair' view as defined by the law. But
the key word, he argues, is 'view', since the accounts simply show someone's
opinion.
He stresses that he has made no attempt to show how significant the use of a
particular technique is to a company's accounts, and he makes no attempt to
rank the techniques in any order of importance.
But he points out that the scores awarded in a previous version of the guide
 -the original 1991 brokers' circular on which the book is based  - proved
an accurate pointer to companies for investors to avoid, judging by their
share price performance.
The final section of the book provides suggestions for readers of accounts
on how to avoid the pitfalls of creative accounting, which he calls
'survival techniques in the accounting jungle':
read the accounts backwards: place less emphasis on the glowing statements
from the chairman and more on the resolutions for the annual meeting; the
notes such as contingent liabilities, pension funding, and interest payments
and receivables;
read the accounting policies and compare: see them in the light of the
effect they will have on profits, looking at issues such as depreciation -
whether the treatment has changed and how it compares with competitors'
practices;
screen the accounts using various filters: comparing net interest
income/expense with average net cash/debt; the tax rate charged with the
statutory rate for companies; the change over a series of years in the
proportion of net assets which are depreciated;
watch for transfers between balance sheet and profit and loss account:
examples include converting development properties to investment properties
before writing them down; and making provisions in the balance sheet against
the value of acquisitions and for their reorganisation which are not then
passed through the profit and loss account. This can be checked by comparing
the net asset value with movements in profit, and by the new statement of
recognised gains and losses proposed by the Accounting Standards Board;
cash is king: profits can be manufactured by creative accounting, but
creating cash is impossible. Cash is more important than profits because it
pays dividends and explains why businesses fail. The new cash flow statement
considerably improves on the figures presented up till now;
if in doubt, don't invest: none of the accounting techniques analysed are in
breach of UK accounting standards; the auditors will not draw attention to
them; and most analysts focus on earnings per share. That means small
investors must perform their own analysis, posing questions directly to the
company.
Accounting for growth - stripping the camouflage from company accounts, by
Terry Smith, is due to be published by Century Business on September 15.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cost reductions behind Glynwed's
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International reduced its workforce by 450 during the first half of
this year as management continued to assault costs.
Cost reductions and a fall in interest charges were the main factors behind
the 48 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 15.4m.
The fall in the number of employees worldwide meant that in the last 18
months the group had shed more than 1,800 jobs, taking the payroll down to
some 11,500 from a peak of 13,600 in 1989-90.
There had been little or no improvement in Glynwed's markets since the 1991
first half, reported Mr Gareth Davies, chairman. Even in the highly
profitable plastics division there had been a pause in the demand from key
customers, like British Gas and the water companies. Activity in the
engineering steels market remained low, although slightly higher than last
year.
Output from metals services businesses had been higher this year than in the
closing months of last, but remained lower than it was in the first half of
1991.
COMMENT
Glynwed may be trying more to penetrate overseas markets, but the fact
remains that about 70 per cent of its turnover is in the UK. The hopes it
had of a gradually strengthening domestic economy have been thwarted, like
everybody else's. Charting the course of profits is a question of setting
poor markets against financial gains from past and, no doubt, future cost
cutting. An outcome of Pounds 40m pre-tax for the year, translating into
earnings of 13p a share, does not look unreasonable. That gives the shares,
at 196p, a prospective multiple of 15; worth holding for an upturn in demand
next year or 1994.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Panel censures two of Dowty's advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NOT so gentle art of ear bending, whispered innuendo and off-the-record
muck-raking that are part of all hostile bids took a knock yesterday when
the Takeover Panel censured two of the professional advisers to Dowty, the
aerospace group taken over by TI in June.
The Panel reserved its most serious criticism for Burson-Marsteller, Dowty's
public relations company, which it said had made 'serious breaches of the
Takeover Code'.
The unusual force of the Panel's censure was helped by a tape recording of a
conversation between a Burson director and an independent analyst.
The over-zealous Burson director was captured on tape saying that Dowty
would make pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m in the year to March 1993, a
forecast Dowty was not able to make formally under the terms of the Takeover
Code.
The same director said that Dowty had found a buyer for its information
technology division, a statement wide of the mark and described by the Panel
as 'material new information' but 'incorrect'.
Lazards, Dowty's financial advisers, were also criticised for being 'unable
to control the release of information by their client's public relations
advisers'.
Under pressure from TI five days before the offer closed, Dowty was forced
to state that the Pounds 55m profits forecast being whispered at deafening
levels around the market was not based on anything it had said.
The Panel said it made no distinction between comments made by advisers 'off
the record' and those made in a more formal manner.
'There are many ways of implying information and opinions during discussions
without specifically stating such information or opinions', the Panel said.
Such utterances were likely to represent breaches of the code.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cowie raises bid terms for rival Henlys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T COWIE, the motor trader, yesterday raised its bid for rival Henlys Group.
The new, and final, terms are seven Cowie shares for every 10 Henlys, an
increase from the previous 1-for-2 offer.
A partial cash alternative has been introduced. Henlys shareholders can opt
for one Cowie share plus 40p cash for every two shares held.
Cowie also forecast a dividend of 6.25p for the year, a rise of 28 per cent
over 1991, to which accepting holders would be entitled. Henlys continued to
oppose the offer saying it had 'no hesitation in urging shareholders to
reject it'.
With Cowie shares unchanged at 115p, the all-share offer is worth 80 1/2 p
per Henlys share, and the partial cash bid 77 1/2 p. Total value of the
paper terms is Pounds 30.5m, and the partial cash terms Pounds 29.3m. Henlys
shares closed at 75p, up 6p. The offer will close on September 1, barring
the appearance of a competing bid.
Cowie said the new terms would give Henlys holders a 40 per cent increase in
capital value and a 45 per cent lift in income for 1992. Henlys has forecast
a dividend of 3p for 1992.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, Cowie chief executive, said his company's share price was
depressed because of the fall in the stock market and the bid. But he was
confident it would return to its former levels of about 150p. He said the
shares were also more marketable than Henlys'.
There was 'compelling commercial logic' to the bid which would
'substantially enhance the prospects' for both companies' shareholders,
Cowie claimed. The combined group would be the fourth largest motor dealer
in the UK, providing economies of scale and synergies with Cowie's other
activities.
Mr Hodgson said analysts were expecting Cowie to make a pre-tax profit of
Pounds 25m in 1992, while Henlys was forecasting a loss. He pooh-poohed
orders won recently by Henlys' bus and coach division saying these were
routine orders and Henlys had given no indication of likely margins or
profits from them.
Mr Steven Lonsdale, finance director, said Henlys had reported that its bus
and coach building side had a full order book for the second half of 1992,
but even so the division was forecast only to break even at the operating
level.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: WPP sees recovery as profits fall 89% after
exceptionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARTIN SORRELL, chief executive of WPP Group, the marketing services
company where shareholders approved a capital restructuring last week, said
that there were some early signs of a recovery in media advertising.
He said he had been encouraged by the group's trading in recent months,
although it was hard to tell whether that might be a pulling forward of
business because of the Olympic Games. New business billings of Pounds 475m
(Pounds 440m) were won in the first half.
His comments accompanied interim results which were in line with forecasts
made in the restructuring circular. WPP shares rose 1p to 38p.
Profits before exceptional items were Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 13m), in line
with the forecast of profits in excess of Pounds 14.2m.
Net exceptional charges of Pounds 12.7m, compared with gains of Pounds 3m
from asset sales, included costs of Pounds 13.5m associated with the
refinancing. That left a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.82m (Pounds 16m).
Turnover was up 6.2 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn (Pounds 2.35bn) and group
revenues rose 3.3 per cent to Pounds 601.1m.
The US and UK operations, which make up two thirds of the business, suffered
revenue falls of 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, but rose by 6 per
cent in continental Europe and 8 per cent in the rest of the world.
Margins fell slightly from 6 per cent to 5.8 per cent, and Mr Sorrell said
he aimed to cut staff costs as a proportion of revenues and reduce excess
property costs. Staff numbers fell by 5 per cent to 20,631.
Losses per share were 8.9p (nil) but on a pro-forma basis, taking account of
the restructuring, and before exceptional items, earnings per share would
have been 5.1p or 2.7p fully diluted.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Sea Containers shows improvement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sea Containers, the Bermuda-based container leasing, ferries and hotels
group, yesterday announced second quarter pre-tax profits down from Dollars
15.8m to Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 7m).
The result was struck on turnover up from Dollars 97m to Dollars 115.5m.
However, the figures for the corresponding period last time benefited from a
non-recurring Dollars 6.2m out-of-court settlement of a long-standing claim
against British Rail.
Stripping out this gain, pre-tax profits for the period showed a near-40 per
cent increase. After a tax charge of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 204,000 credit)
net profits came out at Dollars 13.3m (Dollars 16.1m). Fully diluted
earnings per share emerged at 80 cents (Dollars 1.31 adjusted for scrip
issue).
This brings pre-tax profits for the half year to end-June to Dollars 4.75m
(Dollars 5.34m) on revenue ahead to Dollars 193.8m (Dollars 172.8m).

<TEXT>
SOTHEBY'S Holdings yesterday announced a marginal improvement in pre-tax
profits, from Dollars 17.7m to Dollars 18.4m (Pounds 9.6m), for the second
quarter to end-June.
Turnover of the auction house, which is controlled by the Detroit-based
Taubman family and is quoted in London and New York, rose from Dollars 76.1m
to Dollars 77.9m in the period.
Earnings came out at 20 cents per share against 19 cents last time and the
second quarter dividend is a same-again 15 cents.
This brings pre-tax profits for the half-year to Dollars 9.1m against
Dollars 9.12m from revenues up from Dollars 108.5m to Dollars 114.3m.
The company said that the modest increase in sales during the first half,
combined with the improvement in consignment activity, led it to believe a
gradual recovery in the art auction business was under way.

FT  14 AUG 92 / UK Company News: MMC takes the shine off shoe polish merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCLUSION by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the merger of
the Cherry Blossom and Kiwi shoe polish brands might act against the public
interest was based on a fear of a substantial increase in prices.
The MMC was primarily concerned about the 'self-selection' market,
essentially sales through grocery outlets. It said that Sara Lee's
acquisition of the Cherry Blossom brand from Reckitt &amp; Colman last October
had increased its share of that market segment from 44 to 74 per cent.
That was 'a significant reduction in competition in the supply of shoe
polish products to the self-selection market', which would give Sara Lee
'the opportunity . . . to introduce substantial increases in prices to
retailers without constraining forces being brought into play.'
The MMC said that would be against the public interest, although 'shoe
polish products are low-value items, infrequently purchased, and demand is
largely insensitive to price'. Also it found that consumers' brand loyalty
was not particularly strong.
Professor Patrick Minford, the economist and a member of the panel reviewing
the merger, said in a dissenting report that 'there is considerable
countervailing power from supermarket chains' and a 'large array of
alternative suppliers.' He said there were no barriers to imports, except
transport costs which were low.
However, the MMC took evidence from supermarket chains, some of which said
that competition would weaken. Only J Sainsbury and Superdrug have own-label
shoe polishes. In evidence Tesco said that 'in its experience where a
supplier had a dominant market position that position could be exploited
against a company like Tesco.'
The MMC concluded that the threat that Sara Lee would close its factory in
West Yorkshire, which employs 90 people, and move to France if required to
divest, was insufficient to outweigh the benefits.
Professor Minford disagreed. 'Loss of output and employment in Yorkshire, an
area of high unemployment, would clearly be a serious damage to the public
interest.'

FT  14 AUG 92 / Hanson reports 21.2% fall pre-tax after nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday reported a 21.2 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June 30 as the economic
climate affected both sides of the Atlantic.
The fall in profits, from Pounds 967m to Pounds 762m, was exacerbated by the
weakness of the US dollar and the absence of any natural resources
disposals. Last year's profits were boosted by Pounds 127m from the sale of
Newmont Mining, which was swapped for Cavenham Forest Industries.
This year's sales of British Ever Ready and the 2.8 per cent stake in
Imperial Chemical Industries were taken below the line and extraordinary
income was Pounds 144m against Pounds 23m last time.
After adjusting for the sale of these businesses, turnover increased from
Pounds 5.82bn to Pounds 6.11bn.
Mr Derek Bonham, chief executive, said: 'After adjusting for the different
exchange rate (which boosted last year's profits by Pounds 41m) and last
year's natural resources profit, this year's pre-tax profit decreased by
only 5 per cent.'
This year's profits continued to be boosted by acquisition benefits. These
included a full seven months' contribution from Beazer, the US construction
business, and a nine months' contribution from Cavenham.
Earlier in the day Hanson announced that discussions with parties in the
Canary Wharf project had ended. Hanson's shares rose 2 1/2 p to close at 195
1/2 p.
Mr Mark Cusack, conglomerates analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The
fact that Hanson looked at Canary Wharf and rejected it is no surprise. Mr
Bonham had a realistic view that market reaction would have been cynical and
sceptical if it had bought Canary Wharf.'
Hanson is to concentrate on building its core businesses, through
acquisitions and growth, and is planning to sell some smaller companies on
both sides of the Atlantic.
While the group found no tangible evidence of a recovery in the UK it said
economic conditions in the US were improving slowly.
Lord Hanson believes that the delayed recovery in the UK will mean that many
of the companies which just managed to survive last year are now in worse
trouble and may be forced to turn to a big company such as Hanson for help.
In the three months to June 30 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 379m to
Pounds 274m on sales of Pounds 1.88bn (against Pounds 1.89bn). Fully diluted
earnings per share for the three months to June 30 were 4.6p, down from 6p.
Net debt fell from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 1.1bn and is expected to fall to
below Pounds 800m by the year-end.
The second quarterly dividend was unchanged at 2.75p.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Royal cuts dividend after Pounds 79m interim loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS of the housing market have undermined recovery at Royal
Insurance, one of the largest UK composite (general and life) insurers,
which made interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 79m.
The group, which reported a loss of Pounds 97m at the same stage in 1991,
reduced its interim dividend to 2p from 11.25p.
The result was heavily skewed by poor results from domestic mortgage
indemnity policies, which insure mortgage lenders against a percentage of
losses from sales of repossessed properties. Claims and provisions against
such claims amounted to Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 22m at the same
stage last year.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, expected mortgage indemnity losses for
1991, 1992 and 1993 to top Pounds 500m, compared with an estimate of between
Pounds 400m and Pounds 450m made earlier this year. 'More of the claims are
coming through. The recession is biting even harder,' he said.
The group also said it was separating UK life operations from general
insurance business, in a restructuring scheme which will transfer some
Pounds 500m of debt and ownership of the life company from the insurance
operating subsidiary to the holding group.
The restructuring increases the solvency ratio (net assets as a percentage
of non-life premium income) of the general insurance subsidiary to 40 per
cent. Without it the ratio would have fallen below 30 per cent.
Mr Gamble was cheered, however, by a fall in underwriting losses on most
other lines of business as a result of premium increases, more selective
underwriting and tighter control of costs. Underwriting losses in the UK
fell to Pounds 172m from Pounds 195m and to Dollars 148m (Pounds 77m) from
Dollars 200m in the US.
The group has reduced its exposure to the UK motor market and insures 30 per
cent of its 1m policyholders via its direct writing subsidiary, The
Insurance Service.
At the new Royal Insurance operating subsidiary, general insurance
underwriting losses of Pounds 310m (against a loss of Pounds 361m last
time), estate agency losses of Pounds 9m (up from a loss of Pounds 8m) and
long-term insurance losses of Pounds 12m (against a profit of Pounds 8m),
were offset by investment income of Pounds 235m (down from Pounds 247m).
Income from associated undertakings fell to Pounds 9m from Pounds 20m.
Profits at the new life subsidiary, Royal Life Holdings, rose to Pounds 27m
from Pounds 26m.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Fortunes diverge for UK insurers: Varied exposure to housing
market has created contrasting results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fortunes in the UK insurance industry appear split following the publication
this week of the first-half results of three of the biggest composite
(general and life) companies.
Interim figures show General Accident and Commercial Union clawing their way
back to profit after internal rationalisation, price increases and tighter
underwriting disciplines imposed in the wake of the industry's worst ever
losses in 1990 and 1991.
General Accident made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.5m in the three months to
June and slashed its six-month losses to Pounds 21.2m compared with a Pounds
105m deficit at the halfway stage last year. Commercial Union reported a
profit of Pounds 2.3m for the second quarter and reduced its six-month loss
to Pounds 18.1m.
But in spite of implementing the same recovery measures, Royal Insurance is
still submerged under the weight of losses stemming from the slump in the
housing market and the high level of repossessions.
Claims and provisions on its book of domestic mortgage indemnity, or DMI
policies - which cover mortgage lenders against losses on the sales of
repossessed properties - cost Royal Pounds 100m in the first half,
converting a small profit on other lines into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 79m.
Although that represents an Pounds 18m improvement on last year, the company
faces at least another Pounds 150m of mortgage indemnity claims over the
next 18 months, depressing future prospects.
Mr Roy Elms, director of underwriting, said: 'We've got that albatross
around our neck. Anybody who doesn't have it has a tremendous advantage over
us.' 'DMI is a bloody curse,' added Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive.
Royal's overall losses from mortgage indemnity between 1990 and 1993 will
cost the company more than Pounds 500m, an amount equivalent to more than a
third of its capital and reserves at the end of June. Underwriting losses
from mortgage indemnity for the whole industry between 1991 and 1993 could
reach Pounds 2.6bn, according to SG Warburg, the securities house.
Some analysts are talking about a 'decoupling' of the sector in which those
companies least exposed to mortgage indemnity difficulties will be able to
take advantage of the upturn in pricing and grow at the expense of their
hard-hit rivals, which, as well as Royal, include Eagle Star (a market share
of DMI of about 15 per cent) and Sun Alliance (which has more than 20 per
cent of the DMI market).
Sun Alliance, the biggest and most powerful UK insurer in the 1980s, is
doubly disadvantaged by the severity of the UK recession because of its
heavy investment exposure to UK equities, according to some observers.
This week's results show that GA and particularly CU are well placed to take
advantage of the problems of their rivals. Both companies are raising
capital to finance possible expansion.
GA is seeking shareholders' permission to issue up to Pounds 300m in
preference shares in order to increase its room for manoeuvre in the upturn,
while CU launched a successful Pounds 100m preference issue in May and has
increased its share of the UK market over the past 18 months.
Mr Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel, the securities house, says
observers have 'perhaps underestimated how quickly the companies could
recover'.
At any rate, analysts believe that exposure to mortgage indemnity will
become an increasingly important factor in insurance share ratings.
Mr Tom Bennett, of securities house Banque Paribas Capital Markets, who has
posted buy notices on the three companies - CU, GA and Guardian Royal
Exchange - least exposed to the housing market, said: 'These guys are
sitting pretty. Their major competitors have been shot to pieces by DMI.'

FT  14 AUG 92 / Glynwed half-year profits rise 48%: Buoyant result contrasts
with lower trend among other engineering groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International, the diversified UK engineering group, yesterday
reported a sharp increase in half-year pre-tax profits and a clear
indication that dividends will not be cut.
The result contrasted with the trend of lower earnings among other
industrial groups in the West Midlands, the traditional heart of the UK
engineering industry.
Glynwed's share price rose 13p to 196p on the results, valuing the group at
more than Pounds 400m.
Glynwed's pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.4m in the first six months of 1992
were 48 per cent higher than in the 1991 first half. This translated into
earnings per share of 4.96p, compared with 3.65p this time last year.
The rise in Glynwed's fortunes owed more to cost-cutting and reductions in
its interest charges than to demand for its products in recession-hit
Britain, where it does 70 per cent of its business.
The stock market had feared that Glynwed would cut its interim dividend. In
fact, for the fourth successive year, Glynwed held it at 4.15p.
Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, said Glynwed would earn enough this year not to
have to follow last year's experience of dipping into reserves to keep up
payments to shareholders.
'We should be able to cover the dividend,' said Mr Davies. This implied
that, again as in the past three years, the final dividend would be 11.65p.
He said that in order to cover the dividend Glynwed would need to earn
Pounds 36m in annual pre-tax profits. 'Profits will be well ahead of those
for 1991,' he added.
However, output of Glynwed's consumer and building products, its plastics,
copper tubing, engineering steels and metals services were at best flat and
sometimes lower than in the 1991 first half.
'We have no expectation of anything other than slow recovery,' said Mr
Davies.
Turnover during the 1992 first half, at Pounds 458.5m, was Pounds 47.5m less
than in the same period last year, although that is partly explained by the
sale of three businesses.
However, the sale of these business reduced borrowings by Pounds 12m. This,
and the reduction of capacity to match expected low demand, led to a small
increase in the operating profit to Pounds 21.5m from Pounds 20m. Further
financial gains from lower costs and higher productivity are expected to
show in the second-half.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Rescue of Canary Wharf hits snag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG opposition to the US consortium bid for control of Canary Wharf, the
east London property development, was voiced at yesterday's meeting of the
project's 11 bank lenders.
A European banker said yesterday that the consortium's insistence that any
money it puts into the project should be repaid ahead of the banks was 'a
big problem'. However, the banks have not rejected the offer. After a
meeting lasting most of the day, the banks set up a sub-committee of three
banks, including Lloyds of the UK and Credit Suisse of Switzerland, to
negotiate with the consortium's US adviser, Smith Barney.
In a separate development, Hanson, the conglomerate, dropped plans to make
an offer for Canary Wharf, which is in administration under UK insolvency
procedures. Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive, explained: 'A big
investment like Canary Wharf could have added an extra Pounds 1bn to net
debt; it would have been negative to our profit and loss account for several
years and there was no payback for 10 years.'
The US consortium is led by Mr Larry Tisch, the media billionaire, and was
formed by Mr Paul Reichmann, the Canadian developer who set up the project.
It is proposing to inject Pounds 350m (Dollars 668m) into Canary Wharf to
complete the project and contribute to building the Jubilee Line underground
train extension to Docklands.
The interest rate paid on the Pounds 350m would be a normal bank rate of
interest. However the consortium would also receive a 50 per cent equity
interest in the project. The remainder of the equity would be split between
the 11 banks and Olympia &amp; York, Mr Reichmann's company which built Canary
Wharf.
The banks, owed Pounds 576m, are concerned that they would be relegated to
'a second mortgage position' if they accept the consortium offer, a banker
said.
At yesterday's meeting, the banks accepted that there is a month left for
the private sector to find Pounds 160m if the Jubilee line is to be built. A
banker admitted that the consortium bid is the firmest rescue plan for
Canary Wharf yet, although banks are looking at five other proposals. 'If
the banks turn it down, there is a risk that there will be no Jubilee line
and the project will be liquidated', a financier said.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be unwise to read too much into Hanson's decision to forgo
involvement in Canary Wharf or to take the Pounds 144m gain from the sales
of British Ever Ready and its ICI stake below the line. Hanson has pulled
back from grandiose schemes before, for instance, its mooted role in UK
power privatisation. Disposals have also been taken below the line, despite
the different treatment accorded its Newmont Mining stake in 1991.
Nonetheless the two developments tend to confirm suspicions that the
sober-minded influence of its new top management is growing.
If that is so, Hanson will increasingly be measured by the underlying
profitability of its mainstream businesses. After adjusting for exchange
rates and last year's Newmont gain the fall in profits slowed to 5 per cent
in the first nine months compared with 6 per cent in the first half. The
company is more optimistic on the US outlook. But it is not clear how far
full year figures will rely on interest earnings or on the release of
provisions.
Besides, Hanson's gearing to US recovery can be overstated, not least
because of Peabody's dependence on long-term coal contracts. Hanson is
unlikely to benefit next year from the abnormally low tax rate - of 18 per
cent in the first nine months - resulting from the ACT effect of its switch
to a quarterly dividend. That, together with uncertainty about the speed at
which the payout will rise, hardly makes the shares a raging buy.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic news has been filled with such unremitting gloom of late that
yesterday's figures for manufacturing output stand out a little more than
they deserve. An 0.2 per cent increase in June together with small upward
revisions for April and May were better than financial markets had expected.
Output actually rose by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter over the first,
raising the possibility that GDP may have been flat during the period
instead of falling as the City had begun to assume. But if that means the
scribblers may be spared the trouble of downgrading their 1992 forecasts yet
again, it does not allow them to revise them upwards either.
It is not as if CBI survey evidence points to a further rise in
manufacturing output during the current quarter. Nor is there much
consolation in a 29,100 monthly increase in July unemployment which is above
the quarterly trend in recent months. The good news might be that average
earnings growth has fallen to 6 per cent, but that also is a measure of the
extent to which the economy is still under pressure. So it is not the ideal
moment for sterling to close at just DM2.8170. Though still some four
pfennigs above its absolute D-Mark floor, sterling is painfully close to the
point where the government must raise interest rates or lose the market's
trust in its determination to defend the parity.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Accounting smoke and mirrors may persuade Royal's management that life is
not so bad, but the markets will take more convincing. At first sight, the
transfer of Royal Life to the group's holding company increases Royal
Insurance's solvency ratio from an uncomfortable 26 per cent to a near
average 40 per cent. But the improvement is as cosmetic as it is startling;
other composite insurers would also increase their ratios in varying degrees
if they accounted in the same way. An unkind observer might conclude that
Royal had sought a buyer for its life operations, but could find only
itself.
The timing of the reorganisation is interesting. The move has not been
prompted by the regulators, or by the possibility of brokers switching
business to companies with stronger balance sheets. But the management
clearly feels a need to present its composite business in a better light.
At the operating level things remain difficult. The company has raised its
estimate of losses on mortgage indemnities from around Pounds 175m to Pounds
250m in only three months. A decision to focus on higher quality business
and reduced market share may be sensible, and some sectors show the benefit
of premium increases. But with the balance sheet already weakened, props for
the share price are being knocked away. Total dividends this year might come
to 5p per share, leaving little yield support. If losses from mortgage
indemnity or elsewhere rise, stated net asset value may not be a reliable
guide to the share price. Investors looking to a bid for support may wait in
vain. Few insurers can afford to buy and, through its exposure to mortgage
indemnity, Royal may already have swallowed its own poison pill.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Cold water treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's bounce in water company shares was a clear expression of relief
that Ofwat's statement on the cost of water quality contained no nasty
surprises. Indeed, Mr Byatt made plain that substantial real price increases
will be required if tough environmental standards are to be met. It is only
natural for water companies and the market to applaud. Yet future capital
spending requirements remain as vague as ever.
Ofwat's own estimates to 2005 range from Pounds 28bn to Pounds 43bn,
depending on the stringency of the quality regime. The regulator wants the
sector to operate with a higher level of borrowing, but, even on the lower
of these figures, real price increases will be required simply to keep the
water companies within their bank and bond market covenants for interest
cover. If expenditure is near the top end of this range, debt finance alone
will hardly suffice.
Moreover, harmony between the industry and the regulator is only skin-deep.
The companies will resist yesterday's proposal that real annual efficiency
gains of 5 per cent should help offset the cost of water quality.
Shareholders will suffer in the form of lower dividends if unattainable
efficiency targets are set.
The industry has also failed to convince Mr Byatt he was wrong to propose a
reduced 6 per cent rate of return on equity from 1995. He concedes that
highly-geared water companies may require a higher rate of return to attract
capital, but there will be generally less scope for dividend growth in the
second half of the decade. The sector has still outperformed the market by
50 per cent since privatisation. That going cannot be maintained.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Standard allowance for mortgage tax relief would be
fairer to all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN A HUTCHISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a chartered quantity surveyor I do not pretend to have a full
knowledge of the problems facing borrowers, lending institutions and
government in the current housing crisis, but would offer the following for
consideration.
The present system of tax relief on interest paid appears to be a universal
benefit, but is it fair? For example, take three individuals: 'A' buys a
house on a 20-year mortgage and enjoys the benefit of Pounds 600,000 tax
relief compounded allowance. 'B' buys and sells several houses over a period
of 40 years and enjoys Pounds 1.2m tax relief compounded allowance. 'C' does
not buy at all and therefore receives nil tax relief compounded allowance.
Perhaps, therefore, the government should consider a standard tax relief
compounded allowance per person (say Pounds 750,000) with the flexibility of
use left to the individual counselled by his/her lending institution. For
example Pounds 75,000 tax relief for a period of 10 years and nil tax relief
for the remaining years they choose to have a mortgage (or series of
mortgages). The system of salary multiples which determines the borrowing
limit should be maintained to prevent abuse of the system. Those individuals
who opt not to buy could be allowed an enhanced pension on retirement or the
opportunity to sell their 'benefit' to others.
This would not necessarily cost the government more than the present system
but has the advantage that it could be adjusted every so often to boost or
dampen the domestic housing market irrespective of interest rate movement.
Furthermore, the government would probably have a better estimate of the
cost to the Treasury of mortgage interest tax relief than it can possibly
have at present.
This system could be of immediate benefit to those borrowers teetering on
the brink of 'the repossession route'. It may also prove attractive to
others who are keen to buy their own property or move to larger property,
but are reluctant or have limited resources through family commitments at
this juncture. Finally, if practicable it could be applied retrospectively
to those already in 'the repossession route' but not yet homeless, or those
who find themselves in the unfortunate position of having a mortgage in
excess of their property's value. In the last circumstance, if the borrower
cannot hold out then perhaps he or she could surrender their 'benefit' or
part of it to raise sufficient funds to make good the shortfall. John B
Hutchison,

FT  14 AUG 92 / Letter: Misleading to say pay increases in manufacturing
self-financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL A JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You suggest that pay settlement levels still pose a threat to economic
recovery ('Industry pay deals remain stuck above 4 per cent', August 10).
The Engineering Employers' Federation agrees. Pay settlements have fallen
dramatically since late 1990, but that does not mean the wage-price spiral
is broken. Recession, not yet a new pattern of pay expectations, has
provided the downward pressure on pay and inflation. The average recent pay
settlement among EEF members has been about 4 per cent. With 'pay drift',
this could amount to some 6 per cent on earnings. At the bottom of a
recession, 6 per cent earnings growth is far too high if inflation is to be
reduced to 2 or 3 per cent.
It has been claimed that pay increases in manufacturing are 'self-financing'
through productivity gains. That is highly misleading, because competitive
pressures often require manufacturers to reduce prices. A productivity gain
passed on through lower prices is not available to 'finance' increased pay.
The EEF supports the CBI's call for no increase in the public sector pay
bill and for a shift in public spending from consumption to investment.
However, complacency now about pay increases in the private sector would be
a certain recipe for renewed inflation when the economy recovers.

<TEXT>
Sir, Considering the usual enlightened approach by the Financial Times
towards age, Observer's continuing obsession with retirement and the age of
directors ('An age old problem', August 10, is the latest instalment) is
puzzling.
Why should the age of directors or the duration of their appointment be of
importance to shareholders? Is there any reliable evidence that younger
directors run better companies than old ones? If age is so important, why
does his or her age, and the duration of his/her appointment, not appear at
the head of Observer's column? The same could apply to all your reporters
and editorial writers.
The continued contribution to the economy of older men and women should be
encouraged rather than criticised.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Rampaging bulls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE besetting gloom on world stock markets, it is rare to find
investors queueing to buy new share issues; rarer still to find an exchange
the subject of a riot by tens of thousands of over-enthusiastic citizens.
Yet that is precisely what unfolded in the southern Chinese town of Shenzhen
this week, as angry would-be investors rampaged after being excluded from
the local stock exchange's latest share issues.
While such civil strife is bound to evoke memories of the bloody crackdown
of June 1989, this was no Tiananmen. The authorities, conscious that
Shenzhen is the showcase of China's market reforms, seem to have handled the
violence with restraint. But the events of Monday night did spell out an
important message concerning the pace and scale of economic reform - one
which China's Communist rulers would be most unwise to ignore as they
prepare to debate the issue at their 14th party congress this autumn.
In one sense, the Shenzhen riots might seem a setback for reform. Party
conservatives will argue that they highlight the threat to stability posed
by no-holds-barred liberalisation. In fact, the opposite is true: the riots
illustrate violent enthusiasm for the sort of reforms that are favoured by
Mr Deng Xiaoping, the nation's pre-eminent leader, and that are producing
double-digit economic growth rates. But they also illustrate the dangers
inherent in China's erratic approach to the market - and the pent-up
pressures for faster reform.
The speculation, and accompanying corruption, in Shenzhen is symptomatic of
one of China's basic structural problems: the disparity between vast
liquidity in private hands and limited opportunities for private investment.
This gap, coupled with the authorities' tendency to let go of the monetary
reins at a time of reform, has been largely responsible for the 'stop-go'
cycle of overheating and deflation displayed by the Chinese economy in the
past decade.
All the signs are that the overheating is now happening again, fuelled by a
surge in credit to prop up state industry. To help avert another
crash-landing, with potentially worrying political consequences, the
authorities need to move rapidly to create more investment opportunities -
in fixed assets such as housing, for example - to liberalise consumer prices
further, and to put their own finances in order.
This week's events carry another warning for the gerontocrats in Beijing,
for they show how the huge regional disparities in China's economic
development can breed unrest. It was policy in the 1980s to relax state
controls only in certain ring-fenced areas of the south, but this has become
untenable. The reform bug is catching: people are flocking to park their
money in Shenzhen from all over the country.
If China is to avoid national discord born of regional anomalies, the
government must not only advance reform in the south, but also allow other
regions to emulate the Guangdong experiment.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Slim pickings for the hungry bear: The depth of Russia's
economic crisis raises the question of whether western aid is adequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after Boris Yeltsin stood on a tank and faced down a coup in Moscow,
Russia's economic outlook seems bleak.
Instead of striding into a bright capitalist future, people are complaining
that life has never been so tough. In the short run, the reforms of acting
prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar appear to have ravaged industry and left the
country on the brink of hyper-inflation. With the economy in chaos,
political power seems to be draining away from market-oriented liberals and
towards industrialists far less well disposed towards the west.
The plight of Russia and other former Soviet republics raises an
uncomfortable question: have the western democracies done enough to
lubricate the passage of economic reforms? Will future historians regard
1992 as the year when myopic leaders, preoccupied with domestic problems,
failed to rise to one of the great economic challenges of the 20th century?
Russia's economic trauma is worse than anything seen in eastern Europe and
unimaginable to most in the west. Mr Yukon Huang, a senior Russia specialist
at the World Bank, estimates that Russian imports have dropped by about 70
per cent in the past year or so, partly as result of the collapse of trade
with both eastern Europe and the other republics. Production has already
fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent and may fall by a further 10
per cent to 15 per cent before the economy begins to stabilise. This is
about twice as severe as the Great Depression that shattered US economic
confidence in the early 1930s. Mr Huang reckons inflation could rise to an
annual rate of 2,000 per cent this year.
Given the political imperative of preserving stability in what is still a
nuclear superpower, the scale of western assistance looks puny. Last week,
the International Monetary Fund - chosen to spearhead the western aid effort
 -finally approved its first loan, a Dollars 1bn credit line for the
remaining five months of this year. The World Bank followed with its first
offering - Dollars 600m for the purchase of essential imports. The US House
of Representatives, meanwhile, has belatedly followed the Senate in
approving Dollars 1.2bn in US bilateral aid for Russia.
These dribbles of support are part of the much-vaunted Dollars 24bn
financial aid package announced in April by President George Bush and other
western leaders. Even if the Dollars 24bn had been made available
immediately, it would not have been nearly enough to offset the vicious
compression of Russian imports. In practice the Dollars 24bn has proved
illusory. Up to Dollars 10bn represents debt relief, while a further Dollars
6bn is earmarked for a rouble stabilisation fund that the IMF is not
prepared to activate until Russia has made much greater progress towards
macroeconomic stability. Much of the remaining Dollars 8bn reflects a
continuation of export credits provided for the past several years.
The delays in approving even small loans for Russia have prompted strong
criticism from independent analysts. In a New York Times column, Mr Stanley
Fischer, an MIT professor and former chief economist at the World Bank,
claimed that western aid was so meagre as to have become 'politically
invisible' in Moscow. The west's policy of slow, diffuse support, hedged
with conditions, had played into the hands of President Yeltsin's
reactionary opponents. And in an implicit criticism of the IMF's role as a
monitor of economic reforms, he said the Group of Seven countries should
take direct charge of western efforts to help Russia.
A former IMF official who closely follows the Russian reforms is equally
critical. 'I believe the IMF could have been more courageous in mobilising
western support for Russia,' he says. He also criticises the scale of the
IMF's own effort, arguing that a team of seven economists, flying in and out
of Moscow on short visits, is wholly inadequate. 'There is only one
specialist working on Russian monetary policy when the problems are some of
the most complex seen this century.' He says the shortage of manpower
prevents the IMF getting to grips with some of the thorniest problems, such
as the monetary implications of the build-up of huge debts between
enterprises.
Mr Fischer and other analysts fear that Russia will fail to qualify for
further IMF loans (beyond the Dollars 1bn approved last week) because the
financial targets set by the fund are unattainable. In a briefing last week,
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, again stressed that it was
'absolutely essential' that Russia reduce its budget deficit to 5 per cent
of gross domestic product in the second half of this year. On present trends
Russia is heading for a deficit of 15 per cent or more of output. The IMF
also wants Russia to reduce its monthly inflation rate to about 9 per cent;
this target is also widely seen as out of reach.
Critics of western support for Russia should perhaps direct most of their
fire at the G7 leaders rather than the IMF, which remains very much their
instrument. With worldwide commitments, Mr Camdessus cannot conjure either
staff or cash out of thin air: it was only this month that the US Congress
finally approved America's share of a long-overdue capital increase for the
fund. Nor can the IMF be expected to abandon financial disciplines honed
over decades: if it gave cash without strings to Russia, it would receive
similar demands from indebted third world countries.
The IMF has already bent its own rules. The Dollars 1bn credit was rushed
through within nine weeks of Russia's membership (rather than a more normal
nine months) and, unusually, was justified on the basis of past reforms
rather than future commitments. The concessions were made to trigger the
release of other loans (such as the World Bank credit) and to open the door
to debt rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations.
So what could western governments have done differently? In theory, one
option would have been to accept that the transition from communism to
capitalism is a unique long-term development challenge. The IMF's expertise
lies primarily in the macroeconomic task of helping market economies adjust
to short-run balance of payments imbalances, not in the microeconomic task
of creating markets and capitalist institutions from scratch. The G7 could
thus have created a new organisation dedicated solely to assisting the
formerly communist countries and destined for oblivion once its historic
task was complete.
Properly funded and staffed, such an agency could have made larger loans
more rapidly than the IMF. It could have offered Russia more help during the
crucial early months when confidence in Mr Gaidar's team was high, without
setting dangerous precedents for other countries. Uninhibited by rules
invented to meet the contingencies of previous decades, it could have
improvised freely in response to crises.
The G7 may argue that a new agency was not necessary because it would have
ended up advocating similar policies to those of the IMF, while lacking the
fund's practical experience. There is some substance to this objection. IMF
policies are not invented by some mysterious alchemy at its Washington
headquarters. The main elements of its package for former communist
countries - as rapid progress as possible towards balanced budgets, tight
credit, liberalised prices, exchange rate convertibility, privatisation and
a social safety net - reflect the consensus wisdom of finance ministries,
central banks and many top academic economists.
A central plank of conventional wisdom, moreover, is that the first step
towards free markets must involve macroeconomic stabilisation - tight
budgets and money - which is the IMF's speciality. The present intention is
that other agencies with microeconomic expertise, such as the World Bank,
will step up assistance on privatisation and structural reforms as and when
the fund completes its macro task.
Some conservative economists doubt that any effort by foreign public sector
agencies could achieve much in Russia. The prospect of transfers from the
west is merely 'sand in the gears' of economic change, argues Mr Steve
Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins university and a former
member of President Ronald Reagan's council of economic advisers.
Mr Hanke points to Chile and to Guangdong province in southern China as
examples of radical economic transformations achieved with practically no
foreign aid. In Guangdong, internal moves to restructure enterprises and
liberate markets have won the confidence of foreign private investors who
have poured cash into the province. The results are spectacular: industrial
output rose 27 per cent last year, having grown at an average annual rate of
20 per cent for the previous decade. Parts of the region could be mistaken
for Hong Kong.
Economic progress in the region began with grassroots liberalisation rather
than the unpopular austerity of a top-down macro 'stabilisation' programme.
Once foreign investors were convinced the Chinese meant business, they were
only too keen to get a slice of the action. Yet the relevance of southern
China for Russia is limited. Russia is no longer an autocratic state capable
of embarking on a closely controlled, gradualist programme of economic
reform. Indeed, in a freshly democratised nation, one of Mr Gaidar's
principal headaches is the ability of the industrial lobby to block the
restructuring of state enterprises and sabotage monetary policy.
Ultimately, the west's reluctance to create institutions or back Russian
reforms with large amounts of cash reflects the disarray in its own economic
backyard, rather than a rational appraisal of the alternatives. If the US
had ended the 1980s boom with budget surpluses rather than chronic deficits,
it is safe to bet that it would have ploughed far more money into Russia. It
would certainly have made a greater effort to supply the technical manpower
urgently needed to help devise and implement structural reforms.
In spite of the formidable obstacles, Mr Camdessus seems quietly confident
that Russia will hold to its reform path, despite its present pain, and that
more ambitious IMF and World Bank programmes will be approved in due course.
If Mr Gaidar loses power, the IMF will work with his successors in an effort
to keep its show on the road. Having decided that big economic sacrifices on
behalf of the formerly centrally planned economies are neither possible nor
necessary (except in the special case of Germany), western leaders can only
pray that their point man's optimism eventually proves justified.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Water costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS WITH motherhood and apple pie, it is hard to be against higher water
quality standards. Not so the cost of such improvements, which is
potentially enormous. Yesterday's report from Mr Ian Byatt, the UK water
regulator, estimates that water bills could rise as much as 50 per cent in
real terms by the end of the century - and double by the year 2005. With
water bills already accounting for more than 1 per cent of average net
household income, Mr Byatt is right to express concern about the ability or
willingness of customers to afford such rises.
Certainly there are improvements which need to be made in the quality of
water supplies and the removal of sewerage. Avoiding outbreaks of bacterial
contamination of drinking water requires further investment. And
improvements in sewerage disposal are needed if bathing beaches are not to
suffer avoidable pollution.
However, there are grounds for questioning whether some targets imposed by
the EC and other environmental watchdogs are not excessive. The EC target
for nitrate residues, for example, is set at a level which is the subject of
considerable scientific controversy. Water companies may be required to take
expensive steps to remove impurities from moorland water which do little
more than give it a brownish tinge. Further investment is to be required to
remove pesticide residues from water which is already 20,000 times less
contaminated than vegetables cooked in it.
Existing EC directives must, of course, be enforced (although even then
there is scope for interpretation of the requirements, as Mr Byatt pointed
out). But any new regulations should be subject to much closer scrutiny
before they are agreed. The case for higher standards needs to be
established by adequate scientific re-search and analysis. And the benefits
of such improvements should be weighed against their cost.
Even when the case for higher water standards is made, the cost should not
always fall on the consumer. If nitrate and pesticide residues have to be
removed expensively from water supplies, the principle that the polluter
pays suggests a tax on the originator of the contamination to cover the
cost.
There is also scope for savings to offset cost increases. Installing meters
offers a cheaper way of balancing supply and demand in areas of shortage
than increasing capacity. Mr Byatt indicates that he sees opportunities for
greater efficiency improvements when the price limits formula is revised in
1995. And further cost reductions could be achieved if the return on capital
in the water industry fell to reflect the very low risk in this essential
utility.
Even if all these savings are made, there will still be real rises in water
bills over the next 10 years. But if the increases are at the bottom of the
range suggested in Mr Byatt's paper, it will be due to his assiduity in
pointing out the cost of environmental rules. Consumers should welcome his
initiative in opening the debate.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Personal View: Risky bet on lotteries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DR EMANUEL MORAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are insufficient funds to support UK theatres and opera houses, to
improve sports facilities, to retain art treasures for the nation and to
restore historic buildings. The government's solution to all these is a
white paper entitled 'A national lottery raising money for good causes'.
The white paper refers to two principles on which gambling policy is based.
First, gambling should be properly regulated to ensure that it is conducted
honestly and fairly; second, the demand for gambling should not be
positively encouraged because, if taken to excess, it can cause distress for
the individual and the family and have damaging consequences for society as
a whole. Proceeding from the view that lotteries are the 'softest' form of
gambling, the government is said to believe that a fairly relaxed regime of
control for a national lottery is consistent with overall government policy
on gambling.
This assertion is, at best, naive. The white paper makes it clear that, for
a national lottery to succeed, it will have to be widely encouraged. It
cannot be assumed, therefore, that the dangers of excess which characterise
all types of gambling would not occur in a national lottery. One should not
extrapolate from the limited experience in the UK which is confined to small
lotteries. Recent reports concerning the Irish National Lottery and of other
overseas lotteries suggest that there will also be difficulty in preventing
abuse by mass-buying and syndicates. In such circumstances, limited controls
would be inadequate. Further, the advent of a national lottery will result
in the pools as well as other sectors of the gambling industry wanting some
relaxation of the controls on them, and the white paper states that the
government would be prepared to consider the case for this.
Much is made, in the government document, of the fact that the proposed
national lottery is for 'good causes'. But whatever the intentions
concerning the use of the money that will be made out of a national lottery,
the fact that the latter is nevertheless a form of gambling is played down
throughout.
For many people gambling, within limits, provides a pleasurable and harmless
activity and the existing lotteries are a means whereby such activity can
benefit charitable, sporting and other good causes. In a national lottery,
however, it is to be expected that the gambling element would predominate
over any considerations of charitable giving. It is an undesirable departure
in public policy that the government, through the establishment of a
national lottery, should endorse gambling, as a substantial fund raiser.
A national lottery is not an efficient way of raising revenue. The
government estimates that Pounds 1bn could be obtained from such a lottery
for good causes. While one can wholeheartedly support the proposition that
such a sum should be spent on the arts, sport and the heritage, it is
arguable whether we should raise three times this amount and then give half
of it back to some winners, in order to do this.
An alternative, for example, would be to add an appropriate amount to the
duty on cigarettes and in this way find money for the 'good causes'. The
impact on the retail price index would be far outweighed by the beneficial
health effect and cost savings for the NHS, resulting from the reduction in
the amount that is smoked.
However, the true intentions of the government become evident in the actual
implementation of the proposed national lottery. Since the social impact of
gambling is of such importance, the Home Office has until now been the
department responsible for the law and policy on gambling. Consequently, the
social factor has been the primary consideration in the formulation of
public policy on gambling. Those, including the Exchequer, who benefit
financially from gambling in any way, are consulted but do not take the lead
in this matter. Yet the Department of National Heritage, whose purpose will
be to maximise the turnover of the national lottery, is to be responsible
for the legislation to authorise it.
This is a serious departure from established procedure and will result in a
significant weakening of the policy of providing gambling facilities on the
basis of unstimulated demand. It is not surprising that the betting industry
has already indicated that it will seek a lifting of restrictions on betting
offices. The result is likely to be an increase in excessive gambling, with
all its damaging consequences.
The white paper states that it would be inappropriate for a national lottery
to be seen as a way of funding the National Health Service, education or
similar programmes. This implies, however, that the arts, sport, heritage
and other charitable purposes are lower-division activities which can never
look to securing adequate finance from central and local public funds, or
from individual and collective private charity, and must look for help
through inciting people to gamble.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Time to think long-term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE-TENTH of Britain's labour force is now out of work; the number of people
who are unable to find work is greater than the 2.75m who appear in the
official figures; and both measures of joblessness are likely to carry on
rising this year, next year and probably the year after that too. There is
little the government can do to prevent this, at least while real interest
rates are so high. But it is not powerless. It should act decisively to
ensure that the unemployed are able to re-enter employment and thereby hold
down inflationary pressures when the recovery finally comes.
The government's strategy for dealing with the unemployed looks increasingly
behind the times. Job clubs and other measures to help them search for
employment or prepare for interviews make eminent sense when the economy is
growing. But few economists now expect a recovery this year. The fall in
output may have come to a halt, as yesterday's figures suggest. But there is
little sign that it will start rising soon. The longer recovery is
postponed, the larger the pool of long-term unemployed will become.
Cutting the availability of unemployment benefit from a year to six months,
as the government is reported to be considering, would not be an
improvement. As a way of saving money and cutting the budget deficit, it
would be negligible. Of the 600,000 people unemployed for between six months
and a year, less than half are eligible for unemployment benefit; and the
majority of those would simply shift over to the means-tested supplementary
benefit instead.
If the UK were plagued by large numbers of long-term unemployed who were
unwilling to take available jobs, then cutting supplementary benefit would
make more sense. But no-one could seriously argue that this is currently the
case. Even when growth is buoyant, the evidence that simply cutting welfare
payments helps people back into jobs is weak. Denying welfare payments to
unemployed American men has not prevented a rapid growth of long-term
joblessness there. And Britain's Restart programme, which toughened
eligibility rules, proved more effective at shifting the long-term
unemployed off the register than into employment.
What does make sense is for the government to make benefits conditional on
participation in one of the currently neglected schemes designed to keep the
long-term unemployed active: Employment Action and Employment Training. It
should also explore training initiatives for those who would benefit: a
revival of the acclaimed Training Opportunities Programme for some, remedial
education for others. It would require many more places, and more money,
than the government has so far should been willing to provide. But in the
long-term, it would be worth the cost.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: Mementoes of a wayward collector - Lynn MacRitchie
explores the obsessive world of the artist Annette Messager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long Hayward Gallery tribute to Magritte now over, those still with an
appetite for Surrealism may find the last days of the Annette Messager
exhibition worth catching.
Born in 1943, this French artist is of a generation whose work was informed
by radical politics of all kinds, including feminist and psychoanalytic
theories. For her, the tools of pop art, such as found objects, comic books
and magazine photographs used as a source of images, were a familiar
vocabulary of expression.
The pop artists were not the first, however, to see the possibilities
offered by seemingly innocent objects, and it is to those old masters, the
Surrealists, that this intriguing show owes its most profound debt.
What Messager shares most obviously with them is a quality of obsession. She
presents her work as made by two separate personae: 'Annette Messager' and
'Annette Messager, collector'. As the second, she shows selections from a
range of 'collections' gathered at first in her small Paris flat (she now
boasts a more spacious studio and a sometimes more expansive style).
The 'collections' can be of anything. Two examples in the exhibition are
dozens of framed copies of the artist's signature, written over and over
again in ever varying styles in an attempt to achieve the perfect specimen,
and 'Le bonheur illustre' (Happiness illustrated)', photographs of exotic
locations, animals and dreamy couples culled from advertisements and travel
brochures and carefully copied in gaudy coloured crayon.
Even works which are not signed by Messager the collector display this
obsessive gathering of images. 'Peche' (Sin) is made up of dozens of black
and white photographs of indeterminate events, which could be love scenes or
brutal attacks. Above each image, taken from found sources such as
detective, film or sex magazines and splattered over with coloured inks,
hangs a further image of a finger, pointing.
'Mes voeux' (My wishes) is a similar collection of images, this time of body
parts, noses, mouths, eyes, ears, genitals, photographed separately and
individually framed, hung clustered in a circle at the end of long trails of
string.
Also in the true Surrealist tradition is her recognition of the resonance of
objects. One of the most beautiful works in the show is a series of
vitrines, each holding a single dress. In one, the filmy white garment
enfolds a large close-up photograph of a face, the features magnified, a
combination of beauty and horror. In others, the dresses are covered with
images, photographs, drawings, words, which seem to encapsulate the mood of
the garment, the new worlds that slipping it on might suddenly reveal.
A plain black dress is covered with snapshots of lovers kissing, a mauve
gauzy gown, the cloth itself patterned with good luck charms (horseshoes,
four leafed clovers) is scattered with small drawings of mysterious symbols,
each one an embodiment of possibility, including the possibility of
disappointment, of loss.
Missing from this show is perhaps her most sinister collection, known as
'Les Pensionnaires' (The Lodgers), the corpses of sparrows which she
arranges and displays in various ways, always dressed in tiny knitted
garments. Here, she echoes Max Ernst and his terrifying bird-headed
creatures.
In other pieces, such as the 'Petites Effigies' (Little Effigies),
arrangements of soft toys, she anticipates Mike Kelley, whose installations
featuring toys gleaned from thrift shops and rubbish dumps were recently at
the ICA.
Compared with Kelley, whose message is strident, urgent, seeking to tear a
way through to the child in all of us, to rub our noses in the carefully
hidden chaos of our emotions and desires, Messager maintains the Surrealist
tradition of mystery. Her works, no matter how disturbing, always have the
quality of an elaborate game, even when, as in 'Les effroyables aventures
d'Annette Messager truqueuse' (The horrifying adventures of Annette
Messager, the trickster) the game is played against herself. In this piece
(not in the exhibition), a series of drawings, comic book style, Messager
shows herself impersonating the 'heroines' of that icon of the movement, the
Marquis de Sade, depicting herself submitting to a variety of tortures and
humiliations.
This theme is exemplified in the Camden show in 'Les tortures voluntaires'
(Voluntary tortures) another collection, this time of photographs of women
undergoing various bizarre forms of 'beauty treatments'. These teasing and
disturbing works indicate the presence of a very knowing magician, one whose
tricks are underpinned with self awareness.
The mysteries that the Surrealists loved to conjure are with us still;
Messager reminds us that, however random or unlikely the means of their
manifestation, their source lies within ourselves.
Annette Messager's exhibition 'Telling Tales' is at the Camden Arts Centre
until August 30.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: John Cage - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE composer John Cage died on Wednesday in a Manhattan hospital, three
weeks short of his 80th birthday. Celebrations for that event were already
in place across Europe and the United States, for Cage was much loved on the
international new-music circuit.
In many ways he could be regarded as the most influential figure in post-war
music, one whose ideas ramified across the avant-garde arts. His own works
may not endure (his own artistic stance would surely have rejected such
conventional concepts as greatness and posterity) but his significant
position among the convolutions of music in the second half of the 20th
century is assured.
Born in Los Angeles in 1912, Cage started his conventional musical training
in his late teens, and his brief spell of study with Schoenberg in 1934 has
become a legend in itself; Schoenberg refused to contemplate Cage's
compositions, describing him as 'not a composer, but an inventor - of
genius'.
Within the next decade, however, he was beginning to create his own musical
sound world, freed of the received ideas of his training. But while the
percussion orchestras and prepared pianos of his pieces of the 1940s brought
him close to the world of American experimentalism, his own philosphical
inclinations led him far from their homespun transcendentalism.
From the late 1940s Cage studied Eastern philosophies, and in 1950 began
working with the Chinese I Ching, first using its chance procedures to
determine the details and structure of his compositions in his Music of
Changes a year later.
From that first loosening of the composer's control over the shape and
content of his music, it was a natural progression to a totally open-ended
concept of what a musical composition could be, and quickly on to the
notorious 4' 33' for any instrument or ensemble of 1952, in which the
performers sit mute on the platform and the music consists of the external
sounds that break their silence.
Cage's ideas quickly attracted a small group of disciples in the US -
composers such as Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff, the pianist David
Tudor - and he established connections with visuals artists such as Robert
Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns; his lifelong collaboration with the dancer
Merce Cunningham dated back to the 1930s.
His significance to the European avant garde was slower to take root, but in
the late 1950s he was discovered by the generation of Boulez and
Stockhausen, who used his ideas of open-ended form to wriggle out of the
strait-jacket of total serialism that threatened to stop their musical
revolution in its tracks.
The conceptual break made, Cage's subsequent work, his writings and lectures
as much as his music, merely expanded and exploited that sense of absolute
freedom in which nothing need be excluded from the work of art.
His tape-pieces as much as his joyful instrumental collages utilised any
sound material to hand, while his notated works used an increasing variety
of means - astronomical charts, paper imperfections, computers  - to free
his music from any taint of creative discrimination.
By the 1980s his stature had turned decisively from that of derided
eccentric to revered elder statesman; his own patent enthusiasm and
open-handedness, his childlike fascination for games, as well as his serious
interest in mycology all added to the portrait of a humane, multi-talented
thinker.
Whatever was done in his name by artists of subsequent generations, Cage's
intentions were never ill-meant; subversive in the best sense of the word,
they provided a necessary corrective to the over-insistent dogmas of the
post-war years and can take much of the credit for the polyglot musical
world in which composers today can work.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Arts: She Stoops to Conquer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUNS were not only banging away on the grouse moors on the Glorious Twelfth.
Chichester's exuberant new staging of She Stoops to Conquer, which opened
that evening, has shooting, birds falling dead from above, birds exploding
in clouds of feathers, a splendidly docile dog and an equally docile ferret.
It also has a marvellously robust play, ideal for Chichester, whose audience
responded with wave upon wave of laughter and rounds of applause after
several strong exit lines.
There are many reasons why Goldsmith's 1771 comedy is so strong, but, if
there is one that makes it a classic, it is the character of the younger
Charles Marlow. Relaxed with working-class women to the point of debauchery
but terrified of the refined women of his own class, he still epitomises the
inhibitions of a certain type of Englishman. He is too shy even to look at
Kate Hardcastle, the girl his father intends him to marry; but when she
fools him into thinking she is a serving-wench, he looks, pursues and is
conquered.
Add to that Goldsmith's vigour of language, an array of vivid characters,
and the ingenious farce ingredient whereby Marlow thinks he is staying, not
with his prospective in-laws but in an inn (and treats Mr Hardcastle like
the innkeeper in scene after scene) and you have a perfect comedy. It takes
well to the difficult Chichester stage. David Walker's designs bring each of
the many changes of scene prettily to life, and Peter Wood's direction
injects everything with gusto and panache.
Wood has assembled from his richly talented cast performances that are
excellent within a charm-school, flash-eyes-and-teeth kind of way. Energy is
high, diction and projection first-rate. Denis Quilley is a warm
hail-fellow-well-met Hardcastle, slightly too suave; Jean Boht a game,
silly, bossy and amiable Mrs Hardcastle who (despite a wandering accent)
underplays the character's delicious social affectations. As their niece
Constance, Leonie Mellinger gives the most captivating, and objective,
playing in the cast.
Iain Glen has everything to be an ideal Marlow - with the looks, voice, and
manner (though he bows poorly) of a half-repressed rake. He even emphasises,
interestingly, the note of disdain in the role. But, like most of the cast,
he is always projecting his own awareness of what a charming comic character
he is presenting. His way of raising his brows and batting his eyelids at
the audience in mock-innocence could not be prettier.
Likewise, the bright smiles of the nasal Tom Hollander, as his pal Hastings,
are winning in a predictable, Georgette Heyer, manner.
As Kate Hardcastle, Susannah Harker has Burne-Jones beauty, doe-like eyes
and appealing animation. She is not, however, witty - her remark 'he is good
enough, for a man' tumbles by the wayside - and her voice is never as
individual as her cheekbones and profile lead you to hope. The bright-eyed
Jonathon Morris is too cute and smart to convince for a moment as her
half-brother Tony Lumpkin. But, like the rest of the cast, he is a natural
stage animal.
An excess of stage business during several scenes sometimes suggests that
Wood does not always trust his play or players to keep the audience amused;
but he is wrong. One brilliant scene follows another, and you are taken
unawares by the lines. How about this one: 'I vow, since inoculating began,
there's no such thing as a plain woman.' Goldsmith rules.

SHOSTAKOVICH'S Fifteenth Symphony, so laced with quotations, is a gift to
the thematically conscious programme-builder. In Wednesday's prom it
appeared alongside Rossini's Overture to William Tell, whose most famous
theme dodges in and out of the symphony's first movement.
Both works were thrillingly delivered by the BBC Philharmonic and reflected
the prodigiously wide-ranging gifts of their conductor, Edward Downes.
With his recently acquired knighthood and formal appointment at the Royal
Opera House, Downes may be receiving the wider recognition his great gifts
deserve, but it is useful to be reminded of the breadth of his sympathies,
which stretch through the operatic and orchestral repertories right up to
contemporary British works.
The brilliance of the Rossini may be relatively easy to spark, but the
Fifteenth Symphony is a much more refractory nut. In a fascinating interval
talk during the Radio 3 relay, David Fanning delved into the work's maze of
references, its mingling of external allusion and musical autobiography,
finally dismissing any thoughts of an explicit scenario to the work and
settling instead for viewing the work as a purgatorial experience.
As such it surely invites comparison with Mahler's last two symphonic works.
Shostakovich followed his song symphony about death, the Fourteenth, with
this fugitive piece; Mahler followed his death-song symphony, Das Lied von
der Erde, with the unfinished Tenth, whose third movement is explicitly
labelled 'Purgatorio'.
Such parallels must surely have struck the hypersensitive Shostakovich. But
Downes resisted all temptation to turn the work into a superficial quotation
game; his steady unfolding - beautifully paced and wonderfully played by the
BBC Philharmonic - placed the emotional weight on the second and fourth
movements, menaced by their Wagnerian references, yet preserving their
implacable flow. Even the closing pages, so easy to turn into a tear-jerking
slow fade, were perfectly defined, unblinking and unafraid.
Between overture and symphony the young Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes
played Britten's Piano Concerto, and in this context made it seem the most
eastward-looking of all Britten's works, his closest stylistic approach to
the pre-war Soviet music of Prokofiev and Shostakovich.
Andsnes made light of the technical difficulties, propelling the music at an
exhilarating pace with crystalline passage-work. The Proms audience was
suitably impressed and demanded an encore, a fragment of Grieg shot through
with Chopin-esque shading.
* * *
Barely 50 minutes after the applause for the BBCPO had died away the
evening's second concert in the Albert Hall was in progress. The Australian
Chamber Orchestra is the house band of the concert hall at the Sydney Opera
House. Its artistic director is Christopher Hogwood; Charles Mackerras and
Richard Hickox are regular conductors. Hickox was in charge of the orchestra
here, with Steven Isserlis recruited as soloist for Haydn's C major Cello
Concerto.
Isserlis's impassioned playing was the most enlivened part of the evening.
The orchestral contributions were routine and monochrome. Betwen the
concerto and Mozart's G minor Symphony, the orchestra brought a short piece
written for them by Peter Sculthorpe: a Lament from 1976, derived from his
theatre piece Rites of Passage and receiving its British premiere. As a
well-crafted string meditation, it is effective enough, but it left neither
a lasting impression nor a distinctive flavour.

and Simon Cohen on legal and moral problems of genetic research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON and SIMON COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and UK patent offices face a delicate decision: whether to allow
applications to patent human genes. The decisions, and any resulting
litigation, will cover difficult technical issues and also ethical issues on
which the law gives little guidance.
A patent confers monopoly rights over its subject-matter so that the
inventor can exploit it commercially for a period without having to face
direct competition. One of the tasks of patent law is to define the scope of
this incentive for innovation so that others are not unreasonably deterred
from research in the same field.
The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are carrying out research to
identify the hundreds of thousands of genes believed to exist in the human
genome, or genetic map. The UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) and others
are collaborating in the project.
Individual genes have long been patentable in principle, but many scientists
believe patents should be reserved for cases where the use of the gene is
known: for one researcher to be given a monopoly over a gene of unknown
function might discourage research by others into that function.
On the other hand, the value of the research to the US biotechnology sector
will be much reduced if the results cannot be patented.
In 1991, with US government support, the NIH filed patent applications with
the US Patent Office for some 3,000 fragments of human genes without knowing
what they do. Scientists in other countries, including the UK, protested.
Last month, however, the MRC lodged its own application with the UK Patent
Office for about 1,100 human gene fragments. Dr David Owen, the MRC's
director of industrial collaboration and licensing, said the main purpose
was to secure its position should the NIH application succeed: the MRC can
more readily discuss non-assertion of patent rights if it has some of its
own.
The US office is accelerating the NIH application, and is expected to deal
with it at this preliminary stage more quickly and thoroughly than usual. If
its decision is an unqualified negative, the MRC may well withdraw its
application. If, as seems likely, it is a qualified affirmative, the
deliberations of the UK office can be expected to take some time.
There are three main issues under UK law: the distinction between a
discovery and an invention; the requirement of industrial applicability; and
morality.
A discovery is made by finding out or characterising the existence of a
property that already exists, but which was previously unknown. The
sequencing and writing-down of the nucleotide sequence of any particular
human gene fragment would amount to a discovery: it exists and always has
existed - the difficulty has been in ascertaining its existence. In
contrast, an invention involves the application of the property or the
method of ascertaining its existence. Under section 1 of the Patents Act
1977, a patent is not available for a discovery, only for an invention.
The English Court of Appeal had to consider this in Genentech v Wellcome
(1989) RPC 147, a case relating to production of the enzyme, tissue
plasminogen activator (t-PA). It said: '. . . you cannot patent a discovery
but if, on the basis of that discovery, you can tell people how it may be
usefully employed, then a patentable invention may result. This . . . would
be the case even though, once you have made the discovery, the way in which
it can be usefully employed is obvious enough.'
In other words, the cataloguing of gene and protein sequences time - was an
unpatentable discovery. But the existence of a practical use for this
discovery in the production of commercial quantities of t-PA, even though
itself obvious once the sequences had been discovered, transformed an
unpatentable discovery into a potentially patentable invention.
An invention must also be capable of industrial application - capable of
being 'made or used in any kind of industry, including agriculture.' This
requirement was new to UK law in the 1977 Act, so there has been little
judicial interpretation of it.
It would be difficult to argue that a gene is industrially applicable if its
functions are unknown. It could be said that virtually every identified gene
is or will be inherently useful, if not for its therapeutic properties, then
in research as a genetic probe or as a marker, but this would effectively
introduce a presumption of industrial applicability.
In US law, an invention has to be 'useful' or to produce a 'specific benefit
. . . in currently available form' (Brenner v Manson, 148 USPQ 689, 1966, US
Supreme Court). The definition has been moderated to include materials still
in the research phase but this still pre-supposes a specific potential use.
This issue is likely to prove the most testing obstacle for scientists
currently applying for patents on human gene fragments. But the moral issue
must also be considered.
A moral decision distinguishes between right and wrong. Arguably, this is a
decision which patent offices should not be called upon to decide.
The European Patent Convention (to which the UK is a party) precludes the
patenting of inventions, the publication or exploitation of which would be
'contrary to ordre public or morality'. The UK Act translates this as
'generally expected to encourage offensive, immoral or anti-social
behaviour'.
According to the concept of the separation of powers, a moral decision
should be reserved to the political power. When the choice has been made, it
should be formulated in primary legislation, with the rules and guidance
needed for its application in individual cases by the judicial power. While
application of the law may involve a moral judgment in a marginal case,
judges should not be called upon to make the essential moral choice.
Where legislation pre-dates a particular development, it may not provide the
guidance needed on any moral issues raised. Leaving these to judicial
interpretation of wording not designed for that purpose risks politicising
the judicial process - as witnessed by the abortion controversy in the US.
Dr Owen takes the view that the moral acceptability of patenting human genes
should be addressed by legislation. Patent offices apply a series of
essentially technical tests to decide whether a patent should be granted.
Adding the duty to decide the moral question is capable not only of failing
to give a proper moral judgment, but also of muddling the technical
assessment of inventions.
The European Patent Office had to consider the issue in the 'Harvard Mouse'
application (Oncomouse/Harvard (1989) OJ EPO 451) for the Oncomouse, a breed
of mouse developed at Harvard that contains human cancer genes and develops
tumours soon after birth. Balancing the suffering of animals and possible
risks to the environment against the invention's usefulness to mankind, it
decided that the 'Oncomouse's purpose of facilitating cancer research and
treatment was of paramount importance for the welfare of mankind' and
granted the application.
Genetic science raises a number of issues which are not covered by patent
legislation. The patenting of human genes raises questions of right and
wrong, such as whether properties of human life and identity can be 'owned'
by the patent-holder, and the line to be drawn between eugenics and a cure
for cancer. Judges and patent examiners need guidance on these issues. The
question of animal experimentation is another moral issue.
Other issues of a socio-economic nature also need resolution at political
level, including: does genetic engineering endanger the diversity of life
forms; is the protection of health adequately secured; and is the
environment adequately protected?

FT  14 AUG 92 / People: Watkins' unscheduled arrival at LT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a surprise move by the Department of Transport, Alan Watkins, the former
boss of engineering group Hawker Siddeley, was yesterday appointed as the
Pounds 100,000-a-year chief executive of London Transport.
The surprise is that almost no one knew the job vacancy existed. Until now,
the function has been carried out by Wilfrid Newton, London Transport's
chairman.
Last year, however, London Transport quietly called in McKinsey, the
consultants, to have a look at its management. One recommendation was that
LT should follow the current fashion for separating the roles of chairman
and chief executive, leaving the former to concentrate on strategy and the
latter to run day-to-day the business.
Watkins, 53, has been kicking his heels since losing his job at Hawker
Siddeley after the hostile takeover last year by BTR, Sir Owen Green's
conglomerate. He had landed that job only two years earlier after spending
his previous working life at Lucas Industries.
One slightly puzzling aspect of his appointment to London Transport is why a
professional engineer (and a born-and-bred Brummie) would want to run the
capital's buses and Underground trains, particularly when it means a
considerable drop in pay from the Pounds 260,000 a year he picked up at
Hawker Siddeley.
Watkins, pointing out that there are not all that many large engineering
groups around with vacancies for chief executives, explains there is anyway
a big engineering content in London Transport - all those trains, tracks,
signals and bus garages. He says he relishes the task of building on the
recent small signs of improvement in services.
And the money?'The financial rewards are secondary. And anyway, it's a good
deal more than most people earn.'
*****
Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, has persuaded former home
secretary Kenneth Baker to become his personal adviser. Baker, who left the
cabinet after the April election, has also joined the Hanson board as a
non-executive director.
An enthusiast for high technology in general and ICL in particular, Baker
returned from the political cold in 1981 to become minister for information
technology at the Department of Trade and Industry. Previously seen to be
too closely allied to the old Heath administration for a cabinet position,
Baker had written a paper to Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher outlining why Britain
should have a minister specifically responsible for IT. She created the post
and gave him the job, which he inhabited until 1984.
Within two years he had boosted government support for the field to Pounds
250m from Pounds 30m - a point that Bonfield, who came from Texas
Instruments onto the ICL board the year Baker took up office, has perhaps
not forgotten.
ICL, which is 80 per cent owned by Fujitsu, also notes that Baker has been
an advocate of improved links with Japan. He is a director of the UK-Japan
2000 Group, and his business interests in the 1970's took him to Japan.
Baker, meanwhile, has plenty of time for Bonfield. 'He is one of the great
successes of the British technology industry' he said yesterday.

Societe Generale has promoted Patrick Pagni (left), boss of its UK
securities operation Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST), to become
general manager of the London branch and UK general manager. Pagni succeeds
Jean Huet, who moves to New York to take charge of the French bank's US
network.
Pagni, 43, is a high flyer originally from the international division in
Paris; he spent four years as the senior officer in Hong Kong between 1984
and 1988, with spells in Los Angeles, and, briefly, New York, beforehand.
His achievements at SGST, where he took over as boss at the end of 1990,
have been mainly to supervise the expansion of equities sales and research
at the traditional Eurobond house, 'though we are not home yet,' he admits.
His place at SGST is taken by Paul Tisch, 46, (right) who has been at
Strauss since 1970, recently in charge of the equities division. Another
Strauss veteran, Keith White, 44, at the firm since 1963, becomes deputy
chief executive, retaining control of the Eurobond side. In turn, David
Attard, 39, who arrived from S G Warburg Securities two years ago, steps
into Tisch's shoes.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Management: A daunting menu for managers - Companies are in
danger if they ignore innovative ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOOD management ideas have always taken a long time to trickle down from
concept into common practice. At least 20 years has been the norm even
within a single country, let alone between continents thousands of miles
apart. Many Japanese companies were practising what is now called Total
Quality Management by the early 1960s, but only in the last few years has it
become common currency in the West.
Yet now, like everything else in business, the pace of managerial innovation
is accelerating under the influence of global competition and
communications, and all the other factors that make management today so
hectic. Woe betide the company - of any size - that takes a decade or more
to emulate the management innovator in Tokyo, Turin or California.
Take two powerful but contrasting concepts which ) just happen to be
slightly connected. The first has still not become common practice after
more than 20 years, while the second is doing so in less than half the time.
The first is 'supplier networks' (or 'vendor networks' in the US): the
establishment of close relationships between a company and a limited number
of carefully selected long-term suppliers, each of which has its own network
of sub-suppliers. This approach replaces the traditional annual bidding war
between a vast number of actual and potential suppliers, in which the
customer company chooses largely on the basis of whose price it can squeeze
most viciously.
The latest variant of this approach is 'partnership sourcing'. Japanese
companies, and American pioneers such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, were using
it back in the 1960s. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer would also claim to have
done so for years (though some critics describe its attitude to its supplier
network as dictatorship rather than partnership).
The pioneers have demonstrated for decades the advantages of forging much
closer relationships, with far fewer suppliers. The benefits include a
reduction of the customer company's total cost through three factors: better
quality; faster and more reliable delivery; and greater product or service
innovation than is possible when customer and supplier companies behave as
adversaries.
But only now is partnership sourcing starting really to catch on. A survey
this summer by the Confederation of British Industry suggested that the
proportion of UK companies that use it has still not quite reached half.
The second concept is 'time-to-market': the acceleration of the complicated
process by which a company develops a new product or service from initial
idea into launched reality. Western companies first heard of this about nine
years ago and then just in the electronics industry. Most other industries
did not pick up the message until the middle or late 1980s. But today there
is hardly a company anywhere that is not trying to introduce products or
services more rapidly by accelerating its 'development cycle', as the jargon
calls it.
The connection between the two concepts is that a close relationship with
one's external suppliers can help immeasurably in shortening time-to-market.
But this is by no means the only facet involved in accelerating one's
development cycle, and it tends to receive less attention than purely
internal ones. These include the dismantling of departmental walls to
introduce so-called 'simultaneous engineering' - in which previously
sequential engineering tasks involving different specialists are carried out
in parallel.
Some advocates of supplier networks feel that 'time-to-market' has taken off
more rapidly than their concept for reasons other than the general
acceleration of managerial innovation. They argue that time-to-market is a
simpler idea to grasp than are supplier networks (or partnership sourcing),
and that its benefits are more obvious at first sight. There is a sliver of
truth in this.
Yet the 'relative simplicity' explanation does not really hold water. It is
true that, at first sight, some companies find it difficult to weigh the
advantages of partnership sourcing against its disadvantages: primarily the
loss of short-term flexibility if a supplier's performance slips, or a
competitor offers slightly lower prices.
But the same perceptional problem applies to 'time-to-market'. Managers
often find it hard to become convinced of its essential message: not merely
that it is possible to accelerate the development process without reducing
its effectiveness or increasing its cost, but also that faster can mean more
effective and cheaper.
When it comes to implementation, time-to-market can actually be more tricky
than partnership sourcing: overcoming a lifetime of inter-departmental
wrangles within a company is often a more monumental task than encouraging
internal adversaries to get closer to the company's suppliers. There is an
old but valid management adage that insiders often prefer dealing with
outsiders to collaborating with each other.
The more rapid adoption of time-to-market is explained in part by the
general acceleration of management innovation. But there may also be a more
fundamental factor: that managers are at last realising that such concepts
are not stand-alone approaches to be adopted one after the other over
several years, but that they are intricately intertwined and must be
digested rapidly in parallel. That certainly applies to the concepts
discussed here.
It all adds up to a pretty daunting managerial menu. But a very necessary
one in today's competitive conditions.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Management: A heavy scent of power and lilies - Lucy
Kellaway visits Eve Pollard's room by the Thames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO SIT outside the office of Eve Pollard, editor of the Sunday Express, is
rather like waiting to see the headmistress. The bench outside her room is
visible right across the busy newsroom, so that those waiting for an
audience are in full view of the rabble of journalists and secretaries, who
look on with undisguised curiosity.
And wait is precisely what one has to do. The first woman editor in Fleet
Street is booked ahead for months - her next free lunch is on October 31 -
and all dates are liable to be rescheduled at least once. On the Friday
afternoon I visited Express Newspapers' glass and marble palace on
Blackfriar's Bridge, Pollard was still having lunch.
Eventually she appears, sweeping across the newsroom waving her arms at the
journalists who run after her. 'Not now, not now,' she says. Travelling at
great speed, she reaches her office, full of welcoming smiles. She promptly
disappears into the adjoining conference room clutching a large make-up bag,
to smarten herself up for the photograph. She explains that the previous
night she was out late celebrating the newspaper's transformation into a
tabloid, and bemoans the necessity for make-up.
Pollard's style is not what one expects from a women who has made it in a
man's world. Others may behave as token men, but she makes no apology for
her sex: she is aggressively feminine. Her suit is tight and distractingly
low-cut. On her desk is a vase of heavily scented white lilies, and behind
her is a silver champagne bucket full of dried flowers. On the walls are
pictures of her daughters, and trophies marking her considerable
achievements as editor of a long line of magazines.
The television, which faces her desk, is tuned permanently to Sky News with
the volume off. By the door is a safe, used for extra sensitive scoops, but
apparently empty at the moment. In pride of place is an intimate photo of
Pollard sitting with John Major on a chinzy suite during the last election.
'That was rather hairy,' she says, giggling, but declining to elaborate.
The breathtaking view of St Paul's Cathedral shouts power - but otherwise
there is no sign that Pollard is trying to intimidate. The office itself is
fairly small - her predecessor had a grander one, but she prefers it that
way.
When receiving visitors she places herself behind her desk, in order to
prevent men 'spending all their time examining if your heels are scuffed'.
The remark is typical of her chummy, girly tone. 'You know how awful men
are,' she says. Indeed she reckons that when dealing with them a quite
different style is required. 'I can't just talk like this. I have to assert
myself, and say this amplified 17 times, or they don't listen.'
Apart from the need to speak up, what other managerial tricks has she learnt
in her successful first year as editor? Pollard thinks, and decides that her
primary job is not to manage. Instead she sees her role as 'making the
difference - thinking of the stories, of ideas - being innovating,
challenging'.
To help with those ideas, she has on her desk copies of the Wall Street
Journal and Liberation, the left-of-centre French daily - surprising choices
given that her paper favours such stories as 'Diana beats her bulimia'.
Pollard admits to not fully understanding the French paper, although she
says she likes the way it looks. She reads all the other newspapers before
arriving at work in her chauffeur-driven jag soon after 10am. The car is 'a
luxury, a treat', and the journey itself gives her time to speak to at least
three people on the mobile phone.
Once at work, the days take a predictable shape. 'You have conferences,
meetings, you think of ideas, and if you are lucky you don't have lunch.'
But Pollard, it seems, is always unlucky, constantly dining with
'politicians, publishers, contacts, even sometimes with advertising people'
 -she rolls her eyes.
When in the office, she is at home to whoever should come and see her. 'Most
of the time the door is open, and people put their heads round.' She likes
to rely on old-fashioned means of communication - 'the blower' is her
favourite. She discourages people from sending memos, and dislikes computer
messages. Instead she wanders around 'visiting the art desk, looking at the
dummies, and talking to people'. As the day of publication draws closer, she
becomes more involved, eventually moving out of her office altogether to sit
on the desk with the other journalists.
On these days she does not go home until the night is well advanced - on
others she is rarely out of the office before 9.30pm. It is a long week.
What keeps her doing it? Her reply shares the qualities of tabloid
newspapers: less than complete truth delivered with an appealing directness.
'It's the money,' she says.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Setback for BR on Channel freight trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL will have no freight locomotives capable of pulling trains
through the Channel tunnel when it opens late next year, it emerged
yesterday.
Delivery of the 46 electric locomotives being built for Channel tunnel
freight services has been held up because design modifications have become
necessary.
As a stop-gap measure French national railways (SNCF) has agreed to adapt a
number of its electric locomotives so that they can pick up freight trains
at Folkestone, near the British end of the tunnel, and pull them through.
This will be the first time that French locomotives have gone into regular
service on British tracks.
As a result of this arrangement BR will still be able to offer an
international freight train service when the tunnel opens by using existing
diesel locomotives to run freight trains to the tunnel before handing them
over to the French.
The development will anger people living near the freight routes because
diesel locomotives are much noisier than electric ones. Many of the freight
trains will travel at night.
The need for locomotive and crew changes will also jeopardise BR's ability
to fulfil the journey times it has promised its international freight
customers.
The freight locomotives are being built by Brush Traction, part of the
Hawker Siddeley engineering group which was taken over last year by BTR, the
industrial conglomerate.
BR's Railfreight Distribution subsidiary said modifications had become
necessary because of difficulties in accommodating all the equipment needed
to cope with different voltages and signalling systems in Britain, the
tunnel and France.
The delay is the latest in a series of embarrassing setbacks for BR in the
delivery of its Channel tunnel rolling stock. It seems unlikely that any
passenger trains will be ready for at least six months after the tunnel
opens, and the sleeper trains will not be delivered until 1995.
BR said no new delivery schedule had been set for the freight locomotives,
but it had made contingency plans for the first six months of Channel tunnel
operations.

THE Society of Names, an umbrella group of dissatisfied loss-making Names at
Lloyd's, is stepping up its campaign for an 'independent and enlightened
outsider' to become chairman of the insurance market.
The society, which was formed last year by Mr Tom Benyon, the former
Conservative MP for Abingdon, is being supported in the initiative by the
leaders of 13 action groups of Lloyd's Names.
The society is highly critical of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the
biggest organisation of Names, the individuals whose assets provide the
insurance market's capital base.
Yesterday Mr John Rew, society chairman, criticised plans to appoint Mr
David Rowland, the chairman of brokers Sedgwick, as chairman of the
insurance market.
'Rowland is an insider. Lloyd's has to have a major refinancing and for that
the new chairman must be an enlightened outsider,' said Mr Rew.
Mr Rew, the co-editor of Chatset Lloyd's League Tables, the statistical
guide to the market, took over as leader of the group from Mr Benyon earlier
this month.
Mr Benyon called for the market's present chairman, Mr David Coleridge, to
'resign forthwith' instead of at the end of the year as is planned.
He also called on other members of the council, Lloyd's ruling body, to
resign.

THE Audit Commission, the local authority watchdog, will give as much
attention to the efficacy of local citizen's charters as to traditional
efficiency studies, its new controller said yesterday.
Mr Andrew Foster, the deputy chief executive of the National Health Service
appointed yesterday to succeed Mr Howard Davies, now director-general of the
CBI, said he would give priority to 'putting the user of public services at
the centre (of the commission's work) rather than having structure and
resources always at the centre'.
That will be welcomed by councils, often critical of the commission for
analysing efficiency in isolation from quality. Mr Foster said that up to 20
councils were inadequately prepared for the transfer of community care from
the NHS to local government next year.

LORD JUSTICE BINGHAM, who is to succeed Lord Donaldson as Master of the

whether it would be published in full, Robert Rice writes.
'The question of publication is entirely for others and I have no input
now,' he said. 'But certainly there is material in the appendices which I
would expect to be unpublish-able.'
He said it would have been impossible to conduct the inquiry in public
because a great deal of the material could not have been disclosed without
prejudicing possible criminal proceedings.
Sir Thomas, who favours a number of reforms, said that provided there were
safeguards to ensure the quality of advocacy, he was in favour of wider

fortunes
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government, business and financial sectors reacted with relief
that the free trade pact talks were over, but are evidently concerned the
treaty is a hostage to President Bush's political fortunes.
The Mexican stock market hardly moved on Wednesday, as investors spoke of
the many obstacles before a treaty becomes law. Mr Manuel Robleda, Mexican
stock exchange president, told the EL Economista newspaper: 'Now comes the
most difficult step of realisation of the agreement. This will be reflected
in the equity market and economy, mainly because statements in favour and
against will provoke ups and downs and confusion amongst investors.'
The Mexican government is ready to start lobbying hard in the US, but will
be wary of becoming too involved in the its electoral process. It is likely
to follow the same strategy as last year, when it successfully persuaded
Hispanic groups, business leaders, and local newspapers to support renewal
of 'fast-track' trade legislation, on which passage of Nafta then depended.
At home, the Mexican government is on surer ground, with the private and
official labour sector firmly backing the treaty. Mr Fidel Velazquez, the
nonagenarian labour chief, told El Economista: 'The free trade pact will not
resolve all problems of the workers, but constitutes a strategy to improve
living standards, because undoubtedly, new businesses will be established.'
Practically the only opposition comes from the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution (PRD), dissident unions, and various ecologists and academics. Mr
Porfirio Munoz Ledo, former president of the ruling party and now a PRD
leader, said: 'If we liken it to a Shakespearian tragedy, it is an agreement
between three dying kings. In the Mexican case, the government is trying to
project a positive image, offering the expectation of economic medals just
as illusory as Olympic medals'.
The support owes much to government control of much of Mexico's media, but
could backfire if the treaty were rejected by the US Congress. Any ruling
party candidate for the 1994 elections would have a tough job explaining why
the government put Mexico through negotiating the treaty with nothing to
show for it. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's trade minister, said Mexico
would not re-negotiate the treaty to suit another presidential candidate.
While this may be bluff, Mexicans are unlikely to accept any substantial
revisions to the treaty.

MEXICO'S labour ministry has failed to resolve a company lock-out of more
than 14,000 Volkswagen employees and strikes by some 22,000 textile workers,
prolonging the country's worst labour strife for more than a year.
The lock-out, which began on July 28, is costing VW the equivalent of some
Dollars 5m a day. The company is seeking to cancel its collective contract
with the union, after dissident workers went on strike. These appear to be
backed by many, if not all, of the union members. They say they were not
given details of a new labour contract, which introduces Japanese-style work
groups and quality control to the plant.
VW's Mexican operation produced more than 200,000 cars last year, and is the
leading seller in the Mexican market.
The company is is encouraging some German 40 parts and components suppliers
to operate in Mexico, to help it meet new rules of origin required by the
North American free trade agreement (Nafta).
The work groups are to let the company operate 'just-in-time' inventory
management with its new Mexico-based suppliers.
VW expects to face tougher competition in Mexico from US imports after Nafta
is implemented, while it intends to expand exports to the US and Central and
South America in the near future.
Cotton textile workers have been on strike since July 9, after employers
declined to offer more than 10 per cent wage rises and tried to eliminate
rigid work demarcations.

HONDA has had problems this year persuading US customs officials its
Canadian-assembled Civics meet existing 50 per cent local content
requirements in the 1989 bilateral free trade pact between the US and
Canada, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo.
Japan's vehicle industry warned yesterday that tighter rules of origin under
Nafta hindered expanding local output in North America. Honda's problem
centres on varying readings of content-measuring rules. One of the few
aspects of Nafta greeted in Tokyo was tighter definition of how content is
measured in goods eligible for preferential tariffs.
Attention focused on an unwelcome rise to 62.5 per cent in minimum local
content of vehicles made in one Nafta member country but sold in another, if
their manufacturer wishes to avoid punitive tariffs. Japanese vehicle groups
made 250,000 cars in Canada last year, with 80 per cent for sale in the US.
Local content levels at best are not much above the present minimum: the
proportion for a Canadian-made Toyota Corolla was put at 53 per cent
yesterday.
Honda and Toyota account for two-thirds of Canada's output of Japanese cars.
The rest comes from a Suzuki venture with GM, expected to be exempted from
the stipulation; its output would be used only in calculating GM's overall
North American content ratio. The Nafta ratio would not rise until halfway
through an eight-year period phasing in the requirement. But some in the
industry said North American component suppliers could not always compete on
price or quality grounds.

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINE government officials yesterday denied that the country's foreign
debt reduction package was in danger. This follows an overwhelming
preference by creditor banks for swapping Dollars 23bn worth of debt for par
bonds, rather than accepting discount bonds that reduce debt principal by 35
per cent, reports John Barham in Buenos Aires.
About 80 per cent of banks have now applied for par bonds because these, as
well as preserving the full value of the debt principal, also pay higher
interest than discount bonds. In previous debt reduction schemes for other
Latin American countries, par bonds offered lower, fixed interest rates
while discount bonds yielded higher, floating interest rates.
Concern has been growing all week that a low degree of preference for
discount bonds would threaten the reduction package. Argentina is now asking
banks to take more discount bonds.
However, Mr Horacio Liendo, who negotiated the agreement for Argentina,
said, yesterday: 'In no way does this affect Argentina's Brady plan.' Mr
William Rhodes, Citicorp's veteran debt negotiator, said that he expected a
signature ceremony to be held in Buenos Aires on September 9.
Mr Liendo said that unusally low international interest rates have cut the
attraction of discount bonds to the point where, at current rates, Argentina
would pay Dollars 920m in annual interest if all banks took par bonds and
Dollars 720m a year if they only took discount bonds. Argentina is now
paying Dollars 810m a year in interest.
The par bonds are also more costly for Argentina to back with collateral, in
the form of US Treasury zero-coupon bonds. Discount bonds would require 35
per cent less collateral.
Officials reckon that the par bonds would cost Argentina Dollars 300m more
to back with collateral.
Argentina has already won commitments from multilateral lending agencies for
long-term loans totaling Dollars 2.4bn that would be used to buy collateral.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, said yesterday that his
government was 'absolutely committed' to securing parliamentary approval for
the North American free trade agreement, despite public scepticism about the
benefits of liberalised trade with the US and Mexico.
Mr Wilson also said in an interview that any other country wishing to accede
to Nafta would have to accept the basic framework of the trilateral deal
which was unveiled earlier this week.
Chile has already expressed an interest in joining Nafta, and Mr Wilson
predicted that other countries were unlikely to need much persuading to
follow suit.
But he said that they 'will have to accept the disciplines and have in place
a trade policy regime consistent with the agreement'.
The US, Canadian and Mexican governments are likely to submit the Nafta
agreement simultaneously to their legislatures either in December, or early
next year.
The US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA), which came into force in January
1989, was the most divisive issue in Canada's 1988 general election
campaign.
Recent opinion polls show that a majority of Canadians are still opposed
both to the FTA and Nafta.
The FTA is widely blamed for worsening the recession by encouraging
manufacturers to centralise their oper-tions in the US, at the expense of
Canadian jobs.
Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, is expected to call the next
election in either summer or autumn 1993, but Mr Wilson said he expected the
free trade debate to be less heated than it was four years ago.
'People have come to realise that liberalisation of trade is happening
everywhere,' he declared.
The Canadian government is likely to base its case on improvements in Nafta
compared to the bilateral free trade agreement, and on the general benefits
to consumers of liberalised trade.
Among the improvements cited by Mr Wilson are a two-year extension of the
duty drawback for foreign motor manufacturers in Canada, along with the
retroactive resolution of a highly-charged dispute with the US over the
local content of Ontario-built Honda cars.
Another improvement cited by the minister was the inclusion of environmental
and financial services issues in the mechanism for settling disputes.
The Nafta agreement provides for environmental experts to be included in the
bi-national panels which will review trade disputes.
Mr Wilson also noted that Canada's exports to Mexico almost doubled in the
first five months of 1992.
The Canadian embassy in Mexico City had handled more commercial inquiries in
the first three months of this year than in the whole of 1991, he added.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS of weak growth of US retail sales and almost flat consumer prices
yesterday provided further evidence of sluggish economic conditions.
In a separate report, the Congressional Budget Office said the economy had
yet to enter a 'self-sustaining recovery' but appeared to be on the verge of
one. It forecast growth of 1.9 per cent this year, rising to 3.1 per cent
next year.
Like most other forecasters, the CBO, an independent advisory body for
Congress, has consistently over-estimated economic growth in the past couple
of years.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, after
seasonal adjustment, slightly more than expected in financial markets.
However, its estimate for June was revised sharply down to show a
contraction of 0.3 per cent instead of a gain of 0.5 per cent.
Retail sales have made no significant headway since February.
The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 3.2 per cent in
the year to July - a smaller increase than expected. The increases followed
average gains in consumer prices of 0.2 per cent in the preceding three
months.
Excluding food and energy, which tend to be volatile, consumer prices rose
0.2 per cent last month and by 3.7 per cent in the past year.
Many analysts expect the underlying rate of inflation to fall to 3 per cent
or less in the coming year.
C J Lawrence, a New York broker, said the retail sales figures were
consistent with economic growth of 1.5-2 per cent in the third quarter - a
slight improvement on the second quarter but well short of the 3-4 per cent
the Bush administration had hoped for earlier this year.
The CBO said the recovery was hobbled by high levels of household debt, a
glut of office space and fiscal retrenchment by state and local governments.

<TEXT>
MR Lawrence Eagleburger, known to all as Larry, does not exactly fit the
popular image of a US secretary of state, forever on shuttle diplomacy,
smoothly speaking in subtle nuances, and frequently at war with thenational
security adviser in the White House.
He is 61, overweight, a chainsmoker afflicted by circulatory and respiratory
ailments, and walks with a cane. He is also blunt, funny and, above all, a
professional diplomat. He is the first career foreign service officer to
have become deputy secretary of state, albeit after having left to work for
Henry Kissinger and Associates from 1984-89.
Mr Eagleburger has not been a member of the inner circle of advisers to
President George Bush and Mr James Baker, who have formulated US foreign
policy. His main role as deputy has been day-to-day departmental management,
with a special focus on subjects in which Mr Baker was known to be less
interested, such as Haiti and, as often as not in the last year, Yugoslavia.
He joined the foreign service in 1957 and became Dr Kissinger's right hand
in the White House of President Richard Nixon's first term before rising to
the ambassadorship to Yugoslavia in 1977-80.
The intertwined connections with Dr Kissinger and Yugoslavia are the most
controversial aspects of Mr Eagleburger's career. His closeness to Marshal
Tito and the Serbian political hierarchy is seen as one reason why the US
was slow to wake up to the profound, now tragic, changes in what was
Yugoslavia. He recently admitted that he misjudged the character of Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman.
His appointment now as acting secretary, through Mr Baker's move to head the
White House staff, means he will not be subject to Congressional
confirmation. The Bush campaign had made no secret of its wish to avoid,
before the US presidential election in November, hearings on what was
Yugoslavia.
As caretaker, however, his chances of making an independent mark are
limited, with Mr Baker still in effective control from his new perch.

THE European Commission yesterday gave a guarded welcome to Nafta, but urged
the US, Mexico and Canada to respect world trade rules in setting up the
free trade area.
A official said Brussels would not pass detailed comment on the deal until
the Commission had been officially notified of the contents of the
agreement. 'The Commission always welcomes free trade areas, on condition
they respect Gatt rules'.
The EC states have agreed to form an ambitious European free trade zone
(European Economic Area) with the European Free Trade Agreement (Efta). An
EC official said Nafta would offer attractions to outside investors. 'We
can't do anything about that. That's what markets are about'. The EC is
likely to study Nafta's car, textile and financial services clauses.

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE vehicle industry reacted with alarm yesterday to tougher
requirements for local content under the North American free trade agreement
(Nafta), which it said would particularly affect its car output in Canada,
Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo.
Government and business leaders generally gave a cool response to the
tripartite pact, saying it seemed to increase barriers to goods from
outside.
Japan is asking Gatt's secretariat to set up a working party on the pact.
This would be charged with examining whether Wednesday's US-Canada-Mexico
agreement met Gatt requirements for member countries. The accord 'could be
inconsistent with Gatt principles,' said Mr Yasuo Tanabe, director of North
America trade policy planning at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
His comments were echoed by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association
(Jama), which described the agreement's provisions as counter to a freer
global trade system. Japan will also air its qualms with the three
countries. Officials made clear they were reserving judgment until then,
when they would also have seen the full text.
Mr Tanabe said Japan welcomed free trade pacts with 'a positive effect to
outside countries' flow of trade and investment and to global trade as a
whole'. The agreement should not deflect attempts to reach an overdue
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks which should remain the
top policy issue for Gatt member nations.
Mr Hajime Ohta, director of international economic affairs at the Keidanren,
Japan's private-sector federation of economic groups, said that as in the
case of the US-Canada free trade pact, much would depend on how Nafta would
be interpreted and implemented. Operation of the accord would have to be
transparent to outsiders, but local content rules 'might be a violation of
the Gatt code'.

WITHIN hours of the White House announcing agreement on Nafta, faxes
nationwide began spewing out the praise and doubts of business, labour, farm
groups and think-tanks.
Commentators' views ranged widely. Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the
Inter-American Development Bank, called the agreement 'a demonstration of
Latin America's maturity' as it prepared to meet the challenge of free
trade. Mr Jack Valenti, Motion Picture Association president, said the pact
would be closely studied but he continued to have 'deep concerns about
Canada retaining its 'cultural exemption''.
Business was generally swept away by the vision of three thriving North
American economies. The National Foreign Trade Council said 'the job loss
issue was an obvious concern,' but US export growth to Mexico in the past
five years has already created 650,000 new jobs.
Mr Kay Whitmore, Eastman Kodak Company chairman, said the pact was
'potentially ..win, win, win'. The liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs
said indeed it was 'win, win' for the US, Canadian and Mexican
multinationals and financial institutions.
The US Farm Bureau praised the pact; the National Association of Wheat
Growers saw it as 'lopsided', with the US unable to 'force price
transparency' on the Canadian Wheat Board. Textile makers were pleased, but
the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel said Nafta showed
the difficulty 'for governments to overcome vested special interests in
trade negotiation'.
It criticised Nafta's rules of origin for apparel requiring clothing to be
made exclusively of North American materials from the yarn forward. These
would provide an incentive for US apparel makers to transfer output to
Mexico, but provide none for importers to transfer production from Far
Eastern suppliers to Mexico. The Council of Americas urged talks with Chile
to start now.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA is prepared to take tough decisions in order to keep its economic
reform programme on course, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said
yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Singh said the government
wanted to reduce inflation and the fiscal deficit further before agreeing
with the International Monetary Fund on an Extended Fund Facility borrowing
which would replace its current standby borrowing.
'I would like the quality of our adjustment to be improved, to be seen to be
improving, so that whatever we promise, we can deliver,' the minister said.
To do this, the government has to take highly political decisions in the
next few months, including a reduction of fertiliser and petroleum
subsidies.
'Farmers are 70 per cent of the population and last year we raised prices of
fertiliser by 30 per cent in one go,' Mr Singh said. 'These are difficult
decisions but we have to grapple with them.'
He rejected suggestions that the impetus for reform had been weakened by the
Rs35bn (Pounds 636m) financial markets scandal and said that 'the economy is
at long last showing distinct signs of improvement'.
Year-on-year inflation dipped below 10 per cent this week as the effects of
the July 1991 devaluation of the rupee dropped out of the calculations,
although economists remain to be convinced that the drop is durable. Exports
recorded a 0.4 per cent year-on-year increase in dollar terms in the second
quarter.
Industrial production is also showing faint signs of improvement. But there
are fears that the slowdown in the banking system resulting from the
financial scandal - with banks embroiled in a series of investigations of
their books - is limiting the flow of finance to industry.
The scandal, in which several foreign banks are heavily involved, would not
deter India from allowing in foreign banks, provided that they acted within
the law, Mr Singh said.
Separately, a senior finance ministry official said India expects to unveil
rules for direct foreign institutional investment in the stock market within
two or three weeks.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Spenders fail to lift Japanese economy: Steven Butler
reports that consumers are becoming more choosy as incomes stagnate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese consumer's love affair with fast cars, designer suits, and
big-screen televisions was supposed to save the Japanese economy from
recession. That at least is what government officials were confidently
predicting just a few months ago.
Like so many other theories about the Japanese economy, however, this one
has gently cracked open in recent months under a wealth of accumulating
evidence that the Japanese are becoming more and more choosy about when and
where they open their wallets.
Department store sales are terrible - off 3.7 per cent year-on-year in June
 -while car sales fell by 6.2 per cent in the first seven months of the
year.
The theory that Japanese consumers would keep spending money, in spite of a
plunge in stock market prices and land values and a steep drop in corporate
profits, seemed to have a sound basis. A structural shortage of labour
caused by Japan's low birth rate, it was argued, would keep employment at
high levels. With employment and income secure, and debt levels modest,
consumers would see little need to trim extravagant spending habits formed
during the era of easy money of the 1980s. Strong consumer spending would
therefore provide a firm bottom for the economy.
In the event, however, Japanese consumers have been cautious with their
money because companies are finding ways to limit how much they pay
employees, and because jobs, it turns out, may not be so secure after all.
According to the Labour Ministry, real wages in the manufacturing sector
have declined for much of this year, with May registering a year-on-year
decline of 1.1 per cent. Overtime hours were off by 22.8 per cent in May as
companies reined back production to clear excess inventories while saving on
wage costs.
Unemployment has stayed at apparently low levels of just 2.1 per cent. But
the unemployment figures do not register the thousands of women who work
part time, have been laid off and simply returned to the home.
While the statistics show that net jobs continue to be created in the
economy, there were 10,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in the second quarter
than a year earlier.
The pressure so far has been mainly on small companies. The Teikoku Data
Bank, a private research company, yesterday said that bankruptcies in July
had hit the highest level in five and a half years, with 1,213 companies
unable to pay their debts. The level of debts, at Y784bn (Pounds 3.2bn) was
also the highest for the year. Teikoku said more than half of the
bankruptcies were caused by slow sales. The demise of so many companies,
many of which are in mainstream manufacturing industries, inevitably affects
consumer spending.
A number of large companies, such as Sanyo Electric and Nomura Securities,
have announced programmes for gradual reduction in staff and there is
mounting anecdotal evidence of early retirement programmes. So far, however,
big companies have managed to avoid the layoffs that five years ago drove
the unemployment rate up to 3 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities, argues it is only a
question of time before salaried employees are affected. Amid fears of an
impending labour shortage, companies hired more salaried staff in 1991 than
at any time in the last 20 years, boosting full-time employment by 3.1 per
cent.
With demand sluggish, he argues: 'There is no way companies are going to be
able to carry this level of employment.'
The element of uncertainty is making consumers cautious. Mr Barker estimates
real consumption will grow by 2 per cent, or possibly as little as 1 per
cent this year, compared with 2.8 per cent last year and 4.1 per cent in
1990.
Salomon Brothers takes a more optimistic view that real consumption is
likely to grow by 2.7 per cent this fiscal year.
Consumer spending accounts for 57 per cent of national income and private
capital investment for 19 per cent. With spending sluggish and investment
stagnant, it is plain that only a big boost in government spending can get
the economy going again.

UP TO 1,000 unaccompanied children and adolescents, who have fled civil war
and famine in southern Sudan, have 'disappeared' under the supervision and
protection of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in
north-western Kenya.
Senior aid workers said they were concerned that the children might have
been pressured to cross back into southern Sudan and press-ganged by
Sudanese rebels into joining the battle for the besieged government-held
garrison town of Juba.
Earlier this week, Oxfam, the British charity, said that 300,000 people
trapped in the town had 'run out of food and face imminent starvation' after
a food airlift to Juba was suspended last month.
'This is a very, very worrying development,' a senior aid official said of
the children. 'There has been repeated international concern expressed that
these children have been exploited by the SPLA (Sudan Peoples Liberation
Army) and now they suddenly disappear back into the war-ravaged area under
the noses of the UNHCR protectors.
'The UNHCR has not fulfilled its mandate and verified the voluntary nature
of their movement and the concern is that they have been forced to become
child-soldiers on the Juba front.'
Mr Carrol Faubert, the UNHCR representative in Nairobi, confirmed that some
refugees from Lokichokio had left the camps and been seen in Narus, in
southern Sudan.
He said up to 3,000 people in all could have 'gone missing' from Lokichokio
but that an accurate figure would not be established until the UNHCR
completed transferring the refugees to a new camp at Kakuma, much further
away from the Sudanese border.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Ghana's tough economic reforms face the ballot box test: A
half-completed programme yet to deliver higher incomes is in danger of
falling to populist appeal

<TEXT>
AS GHANA prepares to make the transition from military rule to democracy for
the third time in its turbulent post-colonial history, it faces one of
Africa's most critical questions: will democracy be compatible with
continuing an austere economic reform programme?
Almost nine years of radical and often unpopular economic reforms by the
military government led by Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings have given Ghana
positive growth and laid stable foundations for sustained development.
However, as with so many African countries that which have pursued reform,
the long-term benefits, in terms of a leap in incomes, are yet to come. In
Ghana as elsewhere, adjustment is too easily seen as 'pain without gain'.
Now, as the half completed programme is being presented to the Ghanaian
electorate, there are concerns that politicians, for short-term political
gain, will pander to populism and exploit the hardships of adjustment.
There has already been a re-emergence of old political parties and leaders
who appear wedded to the discredited, but popular, economic theories of the
past.
In a recent interview Dr Hilla Limann, Ghana's last elected civilian
president and a presidential aspirant this year, attacked the economic
reform programme and devaluation as a 'terrible disaster' imposed on Ghana
by the 'dictatorship' of the International Monetary Fund who want to 'stuff
their own pockets'.
Many Ghanaian businessmen believe that if the next civilian regime, which
will be inaugurated next January, fails to deliver political stability and
attempts to delay or turn back the economic recovery programme, western
donors and foreign and Ghanaian investors are likely to turn away.
'The analysis of the old politicians against economic adjustment is really
horrifying,' says Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of the United Africa Company,
a Unilever subsidiary. 'Many of them seem unable to see the enormous changes
which have taken place in the world. If they get it wrong again there will
be no more chances for Ghana.'
Ghana's civilian and military governments imploded throughout the 1960s and
1970s as a result of corruption, economic mismanagement and political
instability. By 1981 Ghana was on its knees with runaway inflation,
collapsing production, an overvalued cedi and a debt burden the country
could no longer service.
Despite his early socialist rhetoric, President Rawlings, who seized power
for a second time in 1981, has pursued an austere adjustment programme which
has given Ghana an average real growth rate of 5 per cent a year, restored
confidence and stimulated investment. But many Ghanaians, especially urban
workers, have suffered and much more, such as privatisation and creating a
better private sector environment, has to be done to achieve what is seen as
necessary growth rates of 8-10 per cent.
Most politicians, looking for an easy vote-catching economic critique of the
government, have so far opted to exploit the constituency of discontented
people hurt during the past nine years by devaluation and cuts in the public
service. It is not yet clear how the electorate will respond to a populist
appeal by old-guard leaders.
In an interview President Rawlings said: 'I think Ghanaians are much more
critical of political leaders today than before and they may be much more
politically conscious than people in western Europe.' But he conceded that
his attempt to instill a participatory political culture into the country
could only be tested at the ballot box.
Mr Joseph Abbey, Ghana's ambassador to the US, said: 'We are hoping that
Ghanaians will have the political maturity to judge the programme not on
their direct material benefits but on the solid foundations we have laid
down for future economic take-off.'
So far the signs are not encouraging. At least seven political groupings
have already been formed and the difference between them is largely personal
and generational. Earlier this week they threatened to boycott the elections
unless President Rawlings accepted demands for an interim government,
international supervision of the polls and the release of all political
detainees.
The key political question is whether President Rawlings is going to run.
For the moment he appears determined to delay any announcement to the last
minute to keep the opposition in disarray. Most political observers,
however, believe he will run.
Mass rural electrification, road building and eight years of economic growth
and stability have won him much support, in particular in the rural areas
where reforms have had their strongest impact on higher incomes. However
many Ghanaians are critical of the regime's poor human rights record which
includes executions, kidnappings, arbitrary detention without trial and
confiscation of property.
The strongest challenge to President Rawlings, widely considered the most
dynamic political force in Ghana, could come from the People's Heritage
Party (PHP) which has developed a strong organisation on the ground and
attracted a younger generation of new politicians. Its two presidential
hopefuls are General Emmanuel Erskine, who led United Nations peacekeeping
efforts in Beirut, and Mr Jonathan Frimpong-Ansah, a former central bank
governor.
Despite the attempt of old-guard politicians such as Dr Limann to exploit
and whip up the anti-adjustment constituency, optimistic businessmen are
hoping that whomever is elected president in November will quickly realise
that there is a logical inevitability about continuing and deepening the
reforms.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Trade surplus at july record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN posted another huge increase in its trade surplus in July, which
reached Dollars 9.24bn (Pounds 4.9bn) on a customs cleared basis, 40 per
cent higher than a year ago, the Finance Ministry said yesterday, Steven
Butler reports from Tokyo.
The figure is the highest ever recorded in July and puts Japan on course to
achieve the record trade surplus this year that many economists have
predicted.
The trade surplus has been rising as the weakness in the Japanese economy
puts a damper on demand for imported goods, while Japanese companies seek to
unload excess inventories on overseas markets. The higher value of the yen
compared with last year has also added to the magnitude of the surplus.
The politically sensitive bilateral surplus with the US soared by 27.3 per
cent in July to Dollars 3.83bn. Japan's surplus with the European Community
rose by 35.3 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.
Japan enjoyed brisk exports of office equipment, cars, semiconductors,
electronic parts, and motors and engines.
Total exports grew by 10.8 per cent to Dollars 29.47bn, while imports
increased by just 1.1 per cent to Dollars 20.23bn. The sluggish pace of
imports came in spite of a 27 per cent rise in the value of crude oil
imports.
Japanese officials have sought to explain the persistent rise in the trade
surplus over the past year as a product of special factors such as the
strength of the yen or the weakness of commodity prices.
It has become increasingly obvious, however, that Japan's efforts in the
late 1980s to restructure the economy by relying more on domestic demand
have simply failed. Frustration has grown among Japan's trade partners over
the apparent inability of the government to take effective measures to stem
the surplus.

<TEXT>
Australia's gross domestic product grew by a modest 0.6 per cent in the
three months ending June, confirming that the country's recovery from
recession would be a long slow haul, writes Emilia Tagaza from Canberra.
The rise was the largest since the recovery began a year ago and brought the
1990-91 annual growth rate to 1.6 per cent.
Following the release of the national account figures yesterday, the
currency regained some of its lost ground. But analysts said the markets
would remain edgy until the exact size of the projected budget deficit is
known next week. It is expected to be around ADollars 14bn (Pounds 5.4bn).
The June quarter growth was driven by consumer spending, which rose by 0.9
per cent, and exports which rose by 6.9 per cent. The most encouraging
result was a 3.7 per cent increase in business investment, which was the
first rise in over a year and could indicate that private business is
finally regaining confidence in the country's future.

A bomb, allegedly planted by Moslem separatists, exploded at Hat Yai railway
station, not far from the Malaysian border, in southern Thailand yesterday,
killing three and injuring more than 70, Peter Ungphakorn writes from
Bangkok.
Police said they found at the site a letter identified as coming from the
Pattani United Liberation Organisation (PULO), an outlawed group seeking
independence for Thailand's four southern-most provinces.
Moslems are a minority in largely Buddhist Thailand, living mainly in
southern and central provinces. Most are fairly well assimilated but
resentment against the majority is felt particularly strongly in the deep
south, where Malay nationalists and Islamic fundamentalists have been
agitating for years for independence.

A radical agreement has been signed between labour and management at the
Harmony gold mine in the Orange Free State which opens the way to more
co-operative labour relations in the gold mining industry, writes Philip
Gawith from Johannesburg.
The agreement, reached between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and
Harmony, a member of the Rand Mines group, includes a pay increase of less
than 2.5 per cent, a profit-sharing scheme, an agreement to minimise the
effect of work stayaways on production and the introduction of a 'collective
bargaining fund'.
Harmony, which employs 14,000 people, is the largest gold mine in South
Africa, but has been threatened with closure because of marginal
profitability.
The agreement follows close on the heels of an important Code of Conduct
signed between NUM and the Anglo American group in June seeking to stop
violence on the mines and the abuse of a wide range of labour and civil
rights.
It also provides for negotiations with NUM on new work practices and new
technology to improve efficiency, negotiations on skill training and an
improved production bonus.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The man who must bite Italy's budget bullet: Haig Simonian
interviews treasury minister Barucci, key figure in the government's war on
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PIERO Barucci, Italy's treasury minister, may be forgiven for thinking he
is one of the most sought-after men in the country. As an architect of the
new government's accelerated privatisation programme, 'at least 200'
merchant bankers are now knocking on his door to sell their wares.
A similar-sized posse of executives - this time creditors - would like to
discuss their grievances at the government's handling of Efim, the state
holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month.
Dissatisfaction over Efim, especially among foreign banks, which reacted
frostily to yesterday's cabinet decree on the company's debts, could come at
a bad time for the government, which will have to rely largely on foreign
markets to take up its privatisation issues.
As if that was not enough, the first assault on the popularity of the
treasury minister, traditionally the lynchpin of the government's economic
policy, could come from Italians anxious to hear what his 1993 budget plans,
to be announced next month, will hold.
Mr Barucci is in the front line of the fight to axe spending and tackle the
ballooning budget deficit. The challenge has already triggered reports of
'draconian' measures in store.
'We intend to be decisive, not dramatic,' says Mr Barucci in his first
interview since taking office. 'The budget will be neither Shakespeare nor
Verdi'. The trick, he admits, will be to reduce private consumption without
plunging the fragile economy into recession.
'On taking office, we were confronted by a foreign exchange and bond crisis
following the Danish referendum result and signs that our 1992 deficit would
reach L180,000bn (Pounds 84bn),' he says. 'We had to move fast to cut that
figure and reassure the financial markets. It should be considered a miracle
in the Italian context that we managed to transform our decree on a
L30,000bn emergency 1992 budget into law within a month'.
With the immediate crisis behind them, ministers are now looking ahead.
However, their room for manoeuvre is limited by the continuing weakness in
world economic growth, meaning Italy's economy will expand by less than 2
per cent next year, and the fact that the deficit is still swelling. And
they need to maintain a tight monetary policy to fight inflation, despite
the attractions of lower interest rates, which would reduce the immense
burden of servicing the deficit.
'We have already managed to pass four decrees which will should bring the
deficit under control. But you can't expect them to take effect in just a
few months. That's the problem we face with next year's budget'.
The decrees cover various spending categories, notably Italy's bloated
pensions system. Its mushrooming growth has been among the biggest
contributors to the deficit. Mr Barucci is confident the measures to reform
pensions will be enough, in spite of criticisms that they are too tame.
'The 1993 budget will have to be decidedly anti-inflationary, but it will
also have to guard against recession,' notes Mr Barucci. He recognises the
risks in choosing the wrong policy mix. 'It's a real puzzle, which we'll
have to address by a careful balance between fiscal and price policies.
That's why I've always said the hardest test for this government will be in
September'.
Mr Barucci is taciturn about what will be unveiled on consumption. Rumours
are already circulating about a possible rise in the basic rate of income
and value added tax from their current levels of 19 per cent. 'Nothing has
been decided yet,' he says. 'We'll start discussions on the basis of
projected figures at the end of this month. But it will be the end of
September - the official deadline for the 1993 budget plans - before you see
the details.'
But while Mr Barucci appreciates the government, based on a wafer-thin
16-seat parliamentary majority, could easily be toppled, he draws confidence
from its achievements so far, based partly on MP's distaste for new
elections and the lack of an effective opposition.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Shoe shine deal gets the boot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERGER of Kiwi and Cherry Blossom, Britain's two largest brands of shoe
polish, has been blocked by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
Following the advice of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Mr Heseltine
yesterday ordered Sara Lee, the international consumer products group which
owns Kiwi, to sell Cherry Blossom. The US company had bought Cherry Blossom
and other brands from Reckitt &amp; Colman last October.
The MMC - in a report full of implicit condemnation of the slovenliness of
dirty shoes - discovered the end of national service more than 30 years ago
had contributed to a long-term decline in the shoe polishing habit.
The Navy Army and Air Force Institutes - the Naafi - each year still buys
more than Pounds 230,000 of shoe polish, mainly Kiwi. That makes it one of
the largest customers in a market worth Pounds 13.5m at manufacturers'
prices and twice as much at retail.
Outside the military, however, the MMC report notes, 'less importance is
attached to having well-polished shoes' these days. The greater use of cars
 -another modern-day idleness - also meant shoes were less exposed to rain
and dirt. Even worse, the traditional leather shoe was being replaced by
'trainers' and 'sneakers' which might not be cleaned at all.
In this shrinking market, the combined company accounts for 74 per cent of
UK sales outside the shoe trade. Fearing a sharp rise in prices, which could
take even more of the gloss off Britain's footwear, the MMC recommended
divestment.
Professor Patrick Minford, the maverick, free market Liverpool University
economist, dissented from his colleagues on the MMC panel. At 49, just too
young to have experienced national service, he gave priority to the
interests of 90 workers in Honley, West Yorkshire. Sara Lee said the
factory, which makes both brands, might close if it lost the Cherry Blossom
business, with production moving to France.
Prof Minford argued that the possible loss of jobs in an area of high
unemployment would be a 'serious damage to the public interest'. He said
imports of shoe polish could provide alternative supplies to maintain
sufficient competition, and the price of shoe polish would be set by the
going international rate.
Mr Euan Venters, Sara Lee's marketing director in the UK, said the company
was 'surprised and disappointed' by the decision.

mixed data

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets traded in a narrow range yesterday, following a mixed batch
of new economic figures which provided little fresh information on the
condition of the recovery, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.56 at 3,313.27,
with the index spending all day only a few points either side of Wednesday's
close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also finished slightly
weaker, down 0.03 at 417.75, while the Amex composite closed 0.27 higher at
386.73 and the Nasdaq composite 0.14 firmer at 570.99.
Turnover on the NYSE was 187m shares. The day's economic statistics were a
mixture of good and the bad.
The 0.1 per cent increase in July consumer prices was good news, as was the
bigger-than-expected 0.5 per cent rise in last month's retail sales; but
that was offset by a big downward revision of the June retail sales data,
which was changed from an original 0.5 per cent rise to a fall of 0.3 per
cent. If the last two months are taken together, the figures show that
retail sales growth remains very weak.
The latest weekly jobless claims numbers were also released, revealing a
66,000 fall, but the figures were heavily distorted by the recent temporary
shutdown of some General Motors plants.
Overall, the economic data provided no real direction for the market,
explaining why share prices languished in a narrow range.
Among individual stocks, General Motors rose in early trading on news that
the car maker's Hughes subsidiary has forged a pact to get billing services
for its satellite television service from Digital Equipment and Network
Computing.
After weak 10-day car sales figures were released, however, GM fell back to
end down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 1/2 .
Northrop fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 25 1/8 after two broking houses,
Wertheim Schroeder and Prudential, cut their earnings estimates following
the announcement from the company of a Dollars 2.13 a share charge for the
third quarter.
Gap Stores firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 31 7/8 in turnover of 2m shares on
news of second quarter profits of Dollars 37.7m, up slightly from a year
ago. The company also reported that comparable same stores sales were up 6
per cent on last year.
Ohio Edison rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 in turnover of 1.1m shares after
the utility announced that it would freeze its basic electricity rates until
the year 2000 and provide Dollars 75m to fund energy-efficiency projects for
consumers.
On the Nasdaq market, SciMed Life dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 in
heavy trading after the Baltimore-based brokerage house, Alex Brown,
downgraded the stock from a 'strong buy' to a 'buy' because of concerns
about flat market share growth. American Software plunged Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 9 1/4 on a profits warning.
Canada
TORONTO shares ended lower for the second consecutive day, in moderate
trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index lost
17.30 points, or 0.51per cent, to close at 3,360.45.
Declines led advances by 285 to 238, volume of 21.2m shares was well below
the previous 38.2m, and trading value was CDollars 246.2m against CDollars
404m.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed watches the dollar slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR again threatened to drop to its all-time low against the D-Mark
yesterday, but central banks did not intervene to support the US currency,
writes James Blitz.
After opening at around DM1.4680 in European trading, the dollar fell
through the DM1.4610 level at which the Federal Reserve and European banks
had extensively intervened on Monday. It closed in Europe at DM1.4590, and
lost further ground in New York to DM1.4553.
The dollar was partly weighed down by poor US indicators. The retail sales
figure for July was up 0.5 per cent, and the June figure was revised down to
a fall of 0.3 per cent from a rise of 0.5 per cent. But analysts pointed to
more fundamental reasons for dollar weakness: the fear of higher German
rates and the belief that central bank intervention to support the dollar is
proving increasingly tricky.
Dealers believe that another rise in the German Lombard rate is possible,
widening the differential with short-term US rates. The Bundesbank's
withdrawal of funds from the German money market in its intervention on
Wednesday pushed call money up to the Lombard rate level, which has clearly
worried the market. One London analyst said that a big test now is how the
Bundesbank reacts to the forthcoming figure for 2nd Quarter GDP, which could
show a drop of between  1/2 per cent and 1 per cent. 'If the Bundesbank
keeps call money tight, it will show that the risk of recession is still not
forcing them to cut rates,' he said.
There is a feeling, too, that central bank intervention cannot easily turn
the market. Some dealers doubt the Bundesbank's commitment to buy dollars
and sell D-Marks, because this will exacerbate its money supply problems.
Others believe that intervention can only work when the economic
fundamentals favour the currency that is being supported. As they say in the
US markets: 'You cannot stop the dollar on a dime.'
Fears of a German rate rise took their toll in Europe. The pound was not
saved by better-than-expected economic indicators, and closed at a new
27-month low against the German currency of DM2.8170. The possibility of
heavy intervention to support the currency is increasing: one analyst warned
yesterday that the Bank of England will soon come out 'with guns blazing.'
The Italian lira fell sharply against the D-Mark to L759.3 after a previous
close of L758.0. The lira's difficulties were compounded by Moody's rating
agency, which announced a two-notch downgrade in Italy's foreign currency
credit rating. The French franc fell to a 5-month low against the D-Mark,
closing at FFr3.392 from FFr3.390.

FT  14 AUG 92 / The Property Market: Partnership in the cities - Vanessa
Houlder explains how the developers' role is being reassessed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the 1980s, much of the responsibility for regeneration of the inner
cities was placed on the shoulders of the property developers. Today,
dissatisfaction with the results of this arrangement, together with the
downturn in the UK economy, have prompted a reassessment of the developers'
role.
There is a move towards greater co-operation between property developers,
central government and local authorities, while a new quango, the Urban
Regeneration Agency, is designed to overcome the shortcomings of both local
government and the private sector.
With the onset of the recession in the past couple of years, which has
claimed a large number of casualties in the property sector, the developers
have largely lost their enthusiasm for inner-city projects. Their central
role in urban regeneration has also come increasingly under fire.
Critics say that billions of pounds have been poured into flagship property
schemes, while public transport and social housing have been neglected. Even
where developments have transformed the appearance and vitality of inner
cities, they have rarely provided substantial numbers of jobs for local
people.
Nevertheless, private sector-led growth is still widely considered to be the
main long-term answer to urban deprivation. But the framework in which the
private sector operates in inner cities is changing, partly as a result of
new government initiatives.
Two announcements made by the Department of Environment over the last month
 -its proposals for the Urban Regeneration Agency and the second round of
the City Challenge scheme - are directly concerned with regeneration.
The Urban Regeneration Agency is designed to bring derelict and under-used
land back into productive use. Its advocates say it will overcome the local
authorities' lack of property expertise and the private sector's aversion to
risk, by researching schemes, reclaiming sites, installing infrastructure
and selling off land in plots.
The URA, which will manage City Grants and Derelict Land Grants and
encompass English Estates, the government's property development arm, is
intended to bring greater cohesion to the country's urban programmes, which
were described as 'a patchwork quilt of complexity and idiosyncrasy' by the
Audit Commission in 1989. Even so, it leaves out the Urban Development
Corporations, City Challenge, the Urban Programme, Task Forces and City
Action teams. Some critics argue that, rather than replacing existing
agencies, it merely adds another bureaucratic layer.
Another widespread criticism is that it is underfunded. Its proposed budget
of Pounds 250m - only one and a half times the budget of the Welsh
Development Agency - is small beer, considering the 150,000 acres of vacant
land in towns and cities.
Critics also attack the URA's lack of an inward investment arm. 'It is no
use producing sites if no one wants them - we must create demand from
end-users,' says Mr Nigel Smith, a partner of Drivers Jonas, the chartered
surveyor.
Yet another reservation is voiced by Mr Christopher Jonas, president of the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, who believes the URA's remit is
too narrow, as it ignores social infrastructure like housing, schools, shops
and hospitals: 'Promotion of housing should be a priority in inner cities.'
But the narrow definition of the URA is defended by Mr Smith of Drivers
Jonas. 'I see little point in the URA burdening itself with a vast
bureaucracy handing out grants for creches, youth clubs, youth groups, day
centres and the like,' he says. The URA's consultation paper states that it
should work alongside other programmes 'to ensure that communities gained
the maximum benefit from the development it brought about'.
The onus on a government agency to work in partnership with other
participants in urban development is, in some respects, a break with the
past. In the 1970s, the local authorities shouldered the burden of urban
regeneration, to the exclusion of the private sector. For most of the 1980s,
the local authorities were excluded as the private sector took the
initiative.
But, increasingly, they are beginning to work together. Evidence of their
ability to do so is provided by City Challenge, a scheme in which local
authorities compete for extra government cash. Despite many criticisms, City
Challenge's emphasis on a partnership between central government, local
government, the private sector and voluntary groups is widely applauded.
'The methodology is almost more important than the money on offer,' says Mr
Gerald Cary-Elwes, secretary-general of the British Urban Regeneration
Association.
In general, however, the amount of public money on offer for urban
regeneration is critical for maintaining its momentum at a time of
recession. Mr David Taylor, managing director of AMEC Development, one of
the few developers still active in inner cities, says the proportion of
public money needed to make an inner-city scheme viable has increased from
20 per cent of the total to 30-50 per cent of a scheme's total cost.
In addition, prospective property developers could be discouraged by revised
proposals for a Contaminated Land Register, which identifies polluted sites.
The proposed changes have been fiercely criticised by those involved in
inner cities, where contamination is common, because sites cannot be removed
from the register, even when they have been treated.
Even when developers do invest in inner cities, they still have to overcome
the lack of demand for their product, particularly in the office sector.
However, the outlook is not uniformly bleak. This week, for instance,
Cardiff Bay secured a 115,000 sq ft relocation of NCM Credit Insurance. And
even where demand for offices cannot be resuscitated, land costs may be
cheap enough to generate demand for other uses, such as housing and the
expansion of universities.
But few inner cities expect to attract large-scale manufacturing jobs. There
have been some successes: in Newcastle, for example, Twinings has built a
tea factory opposite the Meadowell estate, one of the country's most
turbulent housing estates. But it is generally recognised that the decline
of manufacturing industry in inner cities, which provided most of its
inhabitants' jobs, cannot be reversed.
This mismatch between the skills of those who live in inner cities and the
type of jobs that have been created by urban regeneration policies is at the
root of the inner cities' predicament. A report by the independent Policy
Studies Institute last month suggested that the problem is getting worse,
not better. Over the past 15 years, deprived inner-city areas have seen
teacher-pupil ratios and examination results decline. And, with the
exception of the north-west, it was found that fewer people from deprived
areas than expected were on employment training schemes.
The report said it was too early to judge the success of schemes such as
City Challenge or the Urban Regeneration Agency. However, it concluded that,
'given the record so far, it is difficult to have much confidence in more of
the same or to feel at all hopeful about the future prospects for deprived
urban areas'.

FT  14 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Spanish rally on better inflation figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH government bonds rallied on news of better-than-expected inflation
figures and indications that the government will start issuing short-dated
paper next month.
The CPI rose 0.3 per cent in July and by 5.2 per cent year-on-year, well
below expectations. The 10-year government bond opened with a yield of 12.24
per cent and ended the day at 12.12 per cent.
In Portugal, news that the central bank will lift all controls on capital
movements by the end of 1992 was seen as giving encouragement to the
Portuguese debt market.
The Bank of Portugal said all remaining limits on capital movements would be
lifted in three steps between August 31 and December 31. It said
non-resident investors would be allowed to resume trading in floating
interest rate bonds (FIPs) from October 31.
Foreigners invested heavily in FIPs, which carried coupon rates of over 19
per cent at the time the central bank banned non-residents from buying them
on July 5 1991.
AUSTRALIAN government bonds continued to tumble yesterday due to the
combination of the Australian dollar's weakness, concern about the Budget on
August 18, and disappointment that interest rates are unlikely to be cut
further.
Turnover on the Sydney Futures Exchange reached a record level at 213,000
contracts, including a record 47,000 lots of the 10-year bond futures
contract and a near-record of 63,000 lots of the three-year bond futures
contract.
The 10-year bond future fell from 91.64 at the opening to a low of 91.42
before recovering to trade at 91.58 in London time. In the cash market, the
10 per cent October 2002 bond ended the day yielding 8.51 per cent, against
8.36 per cent at Wednesday's close.
AFTER a mixed bag of economic reports had left US Treasury prices unmoved in
morning trading, the long end of the market fell sharply mid-afternoon under
the weight of the new supply.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down one full
point at 107 3/32 , yielding 7.397 per cent. In contrast, the two-year note
was only down  1/32 at 100 5/32 , to carry a yield of 4.149 per cent.
The day's economic news was inconclusive. Bond market sentiment was buoyed
by the 0.1 per cent rise in July consumer prices, while the
bigger-than-expected 0.5 per cent gain in last month's retail sales was
offset by the downward revision in the June sales data to show a 0.3 per
cent fall. Weekly jobless claims fell more than anticipated, but the figures
were distorted by special factors such as the shutdowns at General Motors'
plants.
The only other influence on the market yesterday was the afternoon sale of
Dollars 10bn in 30-year bonds. Although the auction went well, a lack of a
buying after the sale, and concern about the impact of the new supply on
prices, left bonds sharply lower at the long end.
HOPES of a cut in interest rates helped to buoy Japanese government bonds.
Although dealers noted some selling of 10-year bonds early in the day, they
said prices picked up later as investors bought at the lower levels. The
yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 4.92 per cent and closed at 4.90
per cent.
UK government bond prices slipped back on sterling weakness and funding
concerns despite in spite of the release of favourable economic news.
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 96.13 to 96.09, while the 11 3/4
per cent gilt due 2003-07 dropped  9/32 to 114 5/16 . The fall in prices was
held in check by good average earnings figures which showed a fall from 6.25
per cent in May to 6.0 per cent in June.
SCANDINAVIA'S government bond markets suffered sharp price falls with
political uncertainty hitting the Danish market while funding concerns
helped to push up Swedish bond yields,
The Danish 8 per cent bond due 2003 dropped from 90.50 to 89.80 on fears
that a general election could be called shortly, but the bond market later
recouped its losses to close little changed on the day.
The Swedish 10 1/4 per cent bond due 2003 opened with a yield of 10.15 per
cent, and ended the day yielding 10.37 per cent.

advertising

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIERCE competition in the UK travel market and continued weakness in North
American newspaper advertising helped lower Thomson Corp's second-quarter
earnings by 11 per cent.
The Canadian-controlled group, the UK's largest tour operator, reiterated it
was 'not prepared to concede market share' to its competitors in the travel
market. Despite heavy discounting of brochure prices, Thomson said it had
not cut back its summer holiday capacity. Although Thomson Travel's sales
climbed by 11 per cent in the second quarter, operating profits dipped to
USDollars 30m from Dollars 32m a year earlier.
The group as a whole reported a drop in second-quarter earnings to Dollars
70m, or 12 cents a share, from Dollars 79m, or 13 cents a year earlier.
Sales rose to Dollars 1.53bn from Dollars 1.4bn.
The fall was most pronounced at Thomson's North American newspapers, where
operating profits fell to Dollars 54m from Dollars 64m on virtually
unchanged sales. The company said prospects have receded of 'an imminent
economic recovery of sufficient strength to generate significantly higher
revenue growth'.
The UK regional newspaper business also remains weak, with the recession
more than offsetting gains in circulation and expanded advertising market
share.
Thomson Tour Operations' 1991/92 winter sales were 24 per cent higher than
the previous year, and sales of summer 1992 holidays were 'marginally
ahead'. But said over-capacity has resulted in prolonged price discounting.
By contrast, Lunn Poly, Thomson's travel shop subsidiary, posted a
substantial first-half profits increase.

Chrysler board

<TEXT>
MYSTERY surrounds yesterday's decision by Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire
investor, to withdraw his request for representation on Chrysler's board.
The reversal comes less than a week after Mr Kerkorian indicated that he was
no longer willing to remain a passive investor in Chrysler.
Neither Chrysler nor Mr Kerkorian are revealing enough details to account
for Mr Kerkorian's change of heart after his meeting this week with Chrysler
executives, including chairman and chief executive Mr Lee Iacocca, his
designated successor Mr Robert Eaton, and Mr Malcolm Stamper, chairman of
the nominating committee of Chrysler's board.
Mr Kerkorian, who holds a 9.8 per cent stake in the car maker, had initially
cited concern about Mr Iacocca's future role at Chrysler as his reason for
pressing for stronger board representation. Mr Iacocca said in March that he
would step down at the end of this year.
Mr Kerkorian, a friend of Mr Iacocca's, said the recent discussions had
convinced him that the interests of Chrysler's shareholders are well
represented by its current board. He added that he was comfortable with Mr
Iacocca's plans to continue as a director of Chrysler and chairman of the
company's powerful executive committee after the end of the year.
Mr Iacocca, for his part, reiterated his confidence in Mr Eaton. 'I expect
to remain active in Chrysler's future and plan to continue to serve the best
interests of its shareholders,' he added.
Mr Iacocca's reluctance to abdicate at Chrysler has been no secret. He has
reportedly been unhappy with the company's board since it blocked his
attempts to extend his tenure as chairman and chief executive beyond the end
of this year. Yesterday's announcement leaves the question of whether this
was a storm in a tea cup or whether more was decided during the discussions
than either party is willing to reveal.

FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson faces lawsuit
over drug pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, the US healthcare group, is being sued for charging 100
times more for a drug in humans than animals. The medicine, Levamisole, is
the first effective treatment for colo-rectal cancer. It is also used to
de-worm sheep, horses and cattle.
A suit has been filed in Cook County, Illinois, alleging the drug costs
Dollars 1,495 a year in humans but only Dollars 14.95 in sheep. The
plaintiff, Mr Frank Glickman, said this was unfair pricing practice and
'outrageous and unconscionable'. His lawyers want the suit to be considered
as a class action.
The suit follows considerable pressure on drugs groups in the US to restrain
price increases and keep down the cost of new medicines.
About 20,000 Americans could be treated with Levamisole, according to Dr
Charles Moertel, of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Cancer of the
colon and rectum is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in
the US. Dr Moertel believes 7,000 deaths could be prevented if the treatment
was widely used.
Mr Robert Kniffin, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice-president for media relations,
said: 'It is one of the wonders of modern US society that you can sue
anybody for anything and get publicity for it.'
He said Levamisole had been available for veterinary use for about 20 years.
But Johnson &amp; Johnson had invested tens of millions of dollars on clinical
trials to ensure it was safe and effective in humans. About 1,400 studies on
40,000 patients had been conducted. The company needed to recoup its
investment. It had a programme to provide the medicine for those unable to
pay.
The drug was not dearer than other cancer therapies, and was cheaper than
hospital care, said Mr Kniffin. 'We don't see any merit in this law-suit. If
it comes to court we will prevail.'
Levamisole, which is also known as Ergamisol, was licenced in the US two
years ago for colo-rectal cancer. Combined with another drug, it reduces the
risk of a cancer relapse by up to 41 per cent.
Mr Kniffin said patients should not take the veterinary version. Active
ingredients might be similar, but other chemicals in the drug would be
different and could have harmful side-effects.

<TEXT>
THE BIDDING war for the missiles and aircraft unit of LTV Corporation, the
bankrupt steel company, yesterday ended in victory for the Dollars 475m bid
from a group composed of Loral Corporation, Carlyle Group - an investment
banking firm - and Northrop, the defence contractor.
After a lengthy hearing in the Manhattan bankruptcy courts yesterday
afternoon, Judge Burton Lifland - overseeing the LTV bankruptcy - said that
he was willing to accept the Loral group's offer.
His endorsement came after a long recess in which final details of the offer
were hammered out. It also followed submissions from representatives of
various LTV creditors - including the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
the federal agency which underpins pension benefits and LTV's largest
creditor - that the Loral group's bid was the highest and best offer on the
table.
Creditors had been confronted by a rival offer from Martin Marietta, another
US defence contractor. This offer, however, remained at Dollars 440m
yesterday - although terms were adjusted to offer Dollars 425m in cash and
the remaining Dollars 15m in preferred stock.
Judge Lifland declined to allow a Dollars 10m payment to Martin Marietta if
its offer was topped by a better bid, but he did acknowledge that the
unsuccessful suitor had played an important role in the sale process. He
said he would permit a smaller Dollars 5m payment.
The auction of the missile and aircraft businesses represents the final
throes of the LTV bankruptcy, which has dragged on for over five years.

Equitable Life parent
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITABLE Companies, the parent group of Equitable Life, the fifth largest
US life insurer, reported a second-quarter after-tax loss of Dollars 17.6m
in the wake of heavy losses from real estate investments.
The result, however, was still a big improvement on the Dollars 212.6m loss
incurred at the same stage of 1991.
Yesterday's results cover the period before Equitable was transformed from a
mutual to a stock company by last month's Dollars 392m stock-market
flotation. The group had to take an extraordinary Dollars 25.9m charge to
cover the cost of the demutualisation, which meant the final second-quarter
net loss for Equitable was Dollars 43.5m.
The primary factors for the losses on Equitable's insurance investment
portfolio were additions to valuation allowances and write-downs in publicly
traded securities, which over the past six months have totalled Dollars
131.7m, although they were partly offset by investment gains of Dollars
61.8m.
The bulk of the investment losses was for valuation allowances set aside for
mortgages. Equitable said problem commercial property mortgages at June 30
represented 7.5 per cent of the commercial portfolio, up from 4.4 per cent
at the end of 1991.
After the write-downs and additions to valuations, Equitable's insurance
units had an after-tax loss of Dollars 43.7m in the April-to-June period,
against a Dollars 218.5m loss in the 1991 second quarter.
Equitable's investment businesses segment, which includes the brokerage firm
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, contributed after-tax profits of Dollars 48.9m,
almost double the contribution of a year ago.

ZENITH Electronics, the troubled US television maker, has unveiled a new
financing plan that may help steady the company following several years of
debilitating losses.
Zenith has been hit by losses in consumer electronics and investments in new
technologies, such as high definition television.
The financing plan includes a public offering of 8m common shares, which
will raise approximately Dollars 55m, and a new three-year Dollars 60m
working capital loan from the Bank of New York. The new credit facility will
replace its existing agreement, which expires at the end of the year.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Zenith said of the
8m shares to be sold, 1.2m would be offered outside the US. The company has
29.3m shares outstanding.
It also said the underwriters will have the option to issue up to 1.2m more
shares on the same terms to cover over-allotments.
Salomon Brothers and The First Boston Corporation were named as managers of
the underwriting group.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US producer prices for finished goods rose 0.1 per cent last month and by
1.7 per cent in the year to July, indicating that inflationary pressures
remain subdued, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
The figures were in line with forecasts in financial markets and followed a
0.2 per cent increase in producer prices in June.
Excluding prices of food and energy, which tend to be volatile, the 'core'
producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.5 per cent in the
past year. It has held steady at this level for several months.
The moderation of wholesale price inflation was interpreted in financial
markets as further evidence of an unusually lacklustre economic recovery.
Most analysts expect it to feed through into lower consumer price inflation,
which is running at an underlying rate of about 3.5 per cent.
Reuter adds: Mr Robert Dederick, an economist, said wholesale inflation was
well in check. 'The prolonged period of stagnation has caused a lot of pain,
but there has been some payoff in the form of reduced inflation.'
The tame inflation picture could give the Federal Reserve room to cut
interest rates further to spur the economy, without fear of igniting new
price pressures.
Fed policymakers are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
NEARLY 300,000 people trapped in the besieged southern Sudanese garrison
town of Juba face starvation after international food airlifts were
suspended last month, foreign aid agencies said, Reuter reports from London.
'It is feared that unless a regular food pipeline into Juba is established
urgently a large proportion of the population will starve,' said a report
issued yesterday after a meeting of international aid agencies in Juba on
Tuesday.
The report by Britain's Oxfam, Christian Aid and Cafod (Christian Fund for
Overseas Development) and the Norwegian Church Aid group said the city's
293,000 people had run out of food and 'face imminent starvation'.
The population of the city, 1,300 km south of the capital Khartoum, has been
swollen by refugees from Sudan's nine-year civil war.
The report said airlifts had been intermittent during early July and since
July 18 no flights carrying food for civilians had been allowed to land at
Juba, southern Sudan's main town.
The mainly Christian-animist Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) has been
fighting the Khartoum government since 1983 over what it sees as Moslem
domination of Sudan. It wants a referendum in the non-Moslem south and other
marginal areas, with the option of separation.
The agencies appealed to the government and SPLA to approve a resumption of
the UN relief flights and establish safe corridors out of Juba for civilian
evacuation .

FT  13 AUG 92 / Technology: Skeletons come out of the closet - Aluminium
makers are moving into the fast lane in the race to build car bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An avalanche of new business for aluminium producers could be on the
horizon. Hydro Aluminium of Norway's decision to start producing spaceframes
 -skeleton-like car bodies - in Michigan, traditional heartland of the US
automotive industry, is a hopeful sign for aluminium makers.
Hydro's initiative follows that of Alcoa (Aluminium Company of America), the
world's biggest aluminium group, which is setting up a Dollars 70m (Pounds
36m) plant to make aluminium car spaceframes at Soest, near Dusseldorf, in
Germany. These will go into the new top-of-the-range Audi V8 car expected to
be launched next year.
Ivar Hafsett, president of Hydro Aluminium, says his company is converting
an existing facility in Michigan and it will have one specific customer, but
he will not identify the customer yet. However, the timing of the project
fits in with the expected launch of the Impact electric vehicle which
General Motors, the world's biggest automotive company, is to build at an
annual rate of 10,000, starting next year.
The Impact has been developed to meet California's requirements for some
totally pollution-free cars.
Hydro is part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group which is 51
per cent-owned by the state but is also quoted on several stock exchanges.
It has a relatively long history of aluminium spaceframe development.
Five years ago the Treser convertible sports car, with a Hydro spaceframe,
almost went into production. Several pre-production prototypes had been
built and Treser's Berlin factory was ready to start up when expected
finance failed to materialise and the venture failed.
Hydro expects better luck with the Ethos, a two-seater sports car using an
aluminium spaceframe, a body of fully recyclable thermoset plastic panels
and a three-cylinder, two-stroke Orbital engine.
This was the result when Pininfarina of Italy set out to design a car that
was fun to drive, environmentally friendly, safe and not too expensive for
the younger motorist. It is scheduled to go into production in Turin in
1995. With Porsche of Germany, Hydro is also developing another small-volume
sports car which is expected to be on the market in the mid-1990s.
Work so far indicates that, by starting from scratch with an aluminium
spaceframe, a manufacturer can cut the weight of a car's 'body-in-white'
(the unpainted structure before any components are fitted) by 40 per cent
compared with a conventional steel sheet structure but achieve the same
performance.
As the car's suspension, brakes, wheels, engine and gearbox can also be
scaled down because of this initial weight saving, most engineers agree that
the total weight of a car can be reduced by 20 per cent. The Pininfarina
Ethos, for example, is 3.63 metres long but weighs only 700 kg.
The full advantage of aluminium spaceframe technology can only be realised
by starting with a blank sheet. Aluminium can be made competitive with
steel, a much cheaper material, because the number of components required
can be cut by half.
This reduces capital, tooling, labour, stock and other costs. On top of this
the car has corrosion protection, recyclability, a shorter development time,
greater styling flexibility and can be built in a smaller assembly plant.
No wonder, then, that there are several spaceframe concepts being evaluated
by supplier-manufacture teams, apart from those involving Hydro and Alcoa.
Alcan of Canada has chosen to build its spaceframe of sheet aluminium. This
technology is being used by Jaguar in its XJ220, for the Ferrari 512GT
America coupe and in some Bertone sports cars. Alcan also provided some of
its technology when Honda was developing the NSX sports car.
Like GM with its Impact, BMW's M-Technik offshoot is using an alu-minium
spaceframe in its prototype electric vehicle for California; and Toyota's
AXV-1V concept car has a structural frame of aluminium.
Nevertheless, according to Hafsett, the aluminium industry still has a great
deal of work ahead before it can achieve the final breakthrough - the use of
the technology in mass-produced cars. At present aluminium spaceframes are
suitable only for relatively small-volume models, produced at a rate of no
more that 100,000 a year.
Much will depend on another project in which Hydro is involved - the FFr360m
(Pounds 37m) Mosaic venture with Renault. This is part of the Eureka
programme in which European car producers and their suppliers have joined
together to do some basic research.
'Our decade will see a lot of spaceframe-based experimental cars and cars
made in small volumes. The ultimate breakthrough to mass-produced cars will
have to wait until the next century,' says Hafsett.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Styled with a
built-in sense of identity - National designs can reflect culture and custom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do everyday things have a different look and feel from country to country?
Many designers not only believe so: they are determined to keep it that way.
Their hope is at odds with trends towards closer European union and greater
international trade. Yet 'national design' can provide a much needed sense
of identity while preserving - or even enhancing international competition.
National identities within Europe have come centre stage since Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty. In design, Denmark itself has a strong
identity - a spare, practical style that we see in furniture, tableware and
Bang and Olufsen hi-fi. The same values apply equally to Danish heating
equipment and electronic instruments.
According to Jens Bernsun, director of the Danish Design Centre, Denmark is
one of the few countries where famous design classics are also popular with
the general public. Many of the Danish designs on show in museums around the
world can also be found in hundreds of thousands of Danish homes.
The Netherlands is the polar opposite of Denmark in Community terms, a great
believer in European integration. Yet it too has a strong design identity,
evidence that supranational ideals need not be pursued at the expense of
national character.
Holland's public sector companies have long been exemplary patrons of
design, the legacy of the country's historical need to design its geography.
'Holland has always been shaped by human hands, by the official sector,'
says Gert Dumbar, a leading designer.
The Dutch post and telecommunications company, PTT, continued that tradition
when it commissioned a corporate identity from Dumbar to signal its recent
privatisation. The result was a collage of elements hinting of Mondrian and
the country's canal-crossed landscape.
National design's ascendancy over globalism provides a visual parallel to
the more general debate between McKinsey and Co's Kenichi Ohmae, author of
The Borderless World (Harper Business), and Harvard Business School's
Michael Porter, who holds that national stereotypes have their basis in fact
and should be confronted and even exploited.
As Porter writes in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (Macmillan):
'Companies at first glance seem to have transcended countries. Yet
differences in national economic structures, values, cultures, institutions,
and histories contribute profoundly to competitive success.'
The Japanese have alphabets that gave good reason for the invention of the
fax machine. The Polaroid camera satisfies an American wish for instant
gratification. The British drink prodigious quantities of tea, hence the
recent advent of the jug kettle.
These examples show that differences of culture and custom can determine
where innovation occurs.
What is true for innovation in products can be true too in their styling.
The UK is the main market for jug kettles, but exporters such as Tefal of
France make them for the British, ignoring the British design idiom in
favour of their own corporate look. One British designer who recognises this
shortcoming is Geoff Hollington. His proposal for a 'British' jug kettle has
elegant lines, a wooden handle, and Racing Green trim.
Elsewhere, more explicit moves are afoot to celebrate national identity.
In Slovenia, for example, Janez Suhadolc, a furniture designer, celebrates
the country's newfound independence with chairs that allude to the
architecture of Jose Plecnik.
Plecnik is Slovenia's equivalent of Catalonia's Antonio Gaudi who was active
in the 1920s and 1930s - when Slovenia last tasted freedom.
The concern extends beyond countries where political nationalism is running
strong, however.
Japan has spent decades copying the West at the expense of its own cultural
identity. Now some Japanese designers are seeking to unite high-tech product
style with national tradition. One result is a Sony Walkman with a
blue-white enamel finish which, according to the designer, evokes ceramic
chopstick holders. Sold only in Japan this model enjoyed a shelf-life six
times longer than a normal Walkman.
Some designs stem from observation of a culture rather than immersion in it.
The French television station TF1 has a logotype that resembles the label on
a pastis bottle. The reference is perhaps obvious, but head of programme
promotion Patrice Ferrand was happy enough. 'It nicely demonstrates its
national origin.'
Conversely Guardian Vie, the French life subsidiary of Guardian Royal
Exchange Assurance wanted a British-looking identity because the French
apparently believe British insurance companies to be more reputable than
their own. The designers responded with a G like a fragment of the London
Transport roundel and British public services colours that French visitors
will have seen here.
There is an ironic twist in both these cases. The TF1 identity is the work
of British designers Lambie-Nairn and Company, who also came up with the
current designs for the BBC television channels.
Guardian Vie's British look on the other hand came from Plan Creatif, a
Paris firm.
These acts of creation of national identity by foreigners are not without
precedent. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm points out in Nations and
Nationalism, 'more often than not the discovery of popular tradition and its
transformation into the 'national tradition' . . . was the work of
enthusiasts from the (foreign) ruling class or elite.'
The fear of designers is that by designing in a national idiom they may only
produce kitsch. Hobsbawm uses the phrase 'the invention of tradition' to
describe this activity. He refers, for example, to traditions such as the
tartan kilt, an 18th century English invention which is now ubiquitous
shorthand for Scotland.
Such traditions may be invented but they have also been successful. National
style can be whatever a good designer says it is.

Globalism in Design' (Rizzoli International Publications, Pounds 29.95)

FT  13 AUG 92 / Technology: Spinning a web - A Silicon Glen venture with big
ambitions / British entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NOT EVERY world leader is American.' This slogan on the cover of Spider
Systems' marketing brochure sets the tone. The eight-year-old
Edinburgh-based computer networking company thinks big and faces competition
head on.
'All our competition is American,' explains Martin Ritchie, managing
director and co-founder. 'We compare ourselves with them quite a lot. There
are no role models for a company like Spider in Scotland, so we are forced
to model ourselves on American companies.'
Indeed, within the Scottish high-technology industry Spider Systems has
become a corporate celebrity, a frequently cited if somewhat lonely example
of an indigenous electronics start-up company. With 1992 revenues of almost
Pounds 15m and 260 employees, Spider is now the largest and best-known
entrepreneurial venture in Silicon Glen.
Ritchie puts the lack of entrepreneurial activity in Britain down to
cultural factors. 'In the UK we are a nation of employees rather than
employers. As you grow up you don't think of becoming an employer.'
Yet whatever the cultural barriers may be, Spider Systems has hurdled them.
At the company's stylish Edinburgh headquarters there is an air of
confidence rare in a company of its size. 'Image is important,' Ritchie
maintains. The company logo, promotional materials and offices all reflect
its ambitions.
Spider's 'World Leaders' brochure is a bold example. Illustrated with the
satirical Spitting Image puppets of such figures as John Major, George Bush,
Margaret Thatcher and other political leaders, its message is clear; Spider
Systems is, or at least aspires to be, a world leader in its field.
However, the company's origins were pragmatic, rather than ambitious. When
ICL closed down its software development facility at Dalkeith, near
Edinburgh, in 1983, engineers were offered jobs in England. The five
founders of Spider Systems chose instead to stay in their native Edinburgh.
'We didn't want to move so we decided to set up a company to do interesting
and challenging work in what we believed was a growing field - computer
networking.'
Spider started with no external financing and picked up software development
contracts from former ICL customers. 'We were selective about the work we
did. It had to be interesting,' Ritchie recalls, 'otherwise there was no
point.'
In retrospect, Ritchie suggests, the founders' determination to find
satisfaction in their work served the business well. 'We stuck close to what
we were good at and specialised in networking.' If Spider had taken on a
broader spectrum of work it might have become another of the many product
development consultants that populate the Scottish high-tech industry, he
believes.
Spider made a 'conscious decision' not to set firm plans for the future.
'There was no four-year plan,' says Ritchie, 'the only thing a long-term
plan tells you is what won't happen.'
From its start in systems software, Spider moved into hardware development,
taking on a development contract from a US computer company, now defunct.
Gradually expanding its areas of operation, Spider launched the first
product sold under its own name in 1985 - a device for monitoring personal
computer networks that has formed the basis of subsequent products.
'The business plan was that if we could sell 23 units we would break even.
We hoped to sell 50 and turn a profit.' In the event, Spider sold more than
1,000 of its SpiderMonitors, and the product became a key element of the
company's business.
Still, Spider maintained what Ritchie calls a 'low-risk approach' to
expansion. Not until 1989 did the company draw on outside financing,
receiving Pounds 3m in two rounds from UK venture capital groups.
By British standards, Spider has set a record growth pace with annual
revenues increasing by an average of 60 per cent per annum until last year.
However, Ritchie points out that the company's growth has been slow compared
with that of American competitors.
'Our rate of growth has been restricted by the pace of growth that our
management could take.' When the company started, only two of the founders
had any management experience and none had run a business, he notes. 'In
British companies very few people had profit/loss and cash responsibilities
at that time,' he adds.
The Scottish Development Authority (since renamed Scottish Enterprise)
provided Spider Systems with advice and assistance, putting the company in
touch with a small business counsellor who became a non-executive director.
SDA also helped Spider Systems to acquire its headquarters building by
providing financing for the purchase of land and construction.
While acknowledging the assistance of SDA, Ritchie makes clear that 'you
don't build a company on the back of government support. It is good to feel
that there is somebody behind you, but at the end of the day you do it by
yourself'.
Competition from richly financed US companies is the biggest challenge
facing Spider Systems. David Simpson, chairman, has just returned from the
US where he has been investigating sources of additional financing: a
private placement or a public stock offering.
Lack of funding proved a serious problem for Spider when it attempted to
enter the US network equipment market. 'It was a case of not enough money
spent, but too much money lost,' says Simpson. Spider withdrew from the US
hardware market last year and sold US marketing rights to some of its
products.
However, Spider remains a strong competitor in the US networking software
market, selling to many of the largest computer and computer software
groups. Staying in touch with the US market is vital for Spider because new
technology is adopted faster in the US than in Europe. 'By the time products
are adopted in Europe, our US competitors already have 18 months'
experience,' says Ritchie.
After a rough year, in which the company recorded an Pounds 830,000 loss as
a result of its US retrenchment, Spider is getting back into its stride.
Although the recession has slowed growth, 'we are expecting 30 per cent
growth this year, and are currently on plan,' says Ritchie.
'We have sorted ourselves out and we can get on with building the company.
Simpson is determined that Spider will one day become a Pounds 100m
business. 'We must not shy away from ambition. We cannot be defeatist,' he
says.
The series will continue next week.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): An appointment with
a select few - A new trend among recruitment agencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scanning the appointments pages is like walking down the high street: the
same names are to be seen again and again. Also like the high street, the
old names have been replaced by new ones.
In recruitment advertising, the Benetton and Sock Shop equivalents are the
new 'selection' firms such as NB Selection, Selector Europe, Whitehead
Selection, K/F Associates and St James' Associates. Striking ads from these
companies now fill some 60-70 per cent of the appointments pages.
Consultancies of this kind - mostly spin-offs from leading executive
'search' firms - fill a gap in the market between top level search, in which
potential candidates are contacted directly, and the no-frills service
offered by agencies placing box-number adverts in newspapers. The fee is
usually less than for a search firm - 25 per cent of the successful
candidate's first year salary compared with 35 per cent for example.
Of the UK's top eight executive search firms, five have established
fully-fledged selection operations. NB Selection, established by Norman
Broadbent, was the first and now has 27 consultants in seven offices. Others
are also establishing regional networks.
'We have set out to capture business which was being reluctantly passed to
the recruitment advertising specialists. We were not sure they did a good
job for our clients,' explains Nigel Smith of search firm Whitehead Mann.
Search firms prefer to concentrate on pure executive search. But this is not
suitable when 'the population of potential candidates is large, and the
skills required are easily transferable,' explains Smith's colleague Nigel
Bates of Whitehead Selection.
According to Piers Marmion of Selector Europe, many of the jobs that would
have gone to search are now being advertised through selection firms, partly
because the recession has increased the number of candidates, while the
European market has also broadened the field.
How does 'selection' work? The client briefs the consultant, who puts out
the ad, sifts the responses, and presents a short list, all in about a
month. Shortlisted candidates are interviewed and appraised, references
checked. 'The research and direct approaches to individuals made by search
firms are replaced by advertising,' explains Nigel Humphreys of Tyzack, who
set up TX Selection three years ago.
Selection firms also emphasise the importance of their service to job
hunters. They 'see candidates as future clients and are anxious to protect
their reputations,' argues Nigel Rose of K/F Associates.
All selection firms have found that more unemployed people are reaching
shortlists, and Richard Boggis-Rolfe of NB Selection emphasises that 'we
have no prejudice against unemployed candidates - John Major proves that a
period out of work is no bar to future success]'

FT  13 AUG 92 / Isle of Man proposes corporate tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man yesterday issued a consultative document proposing the
reform of its corporate taxation legislation.
Its main aims are to simplify legislation, improve government cashflow and
enhance the island's competitive edge as a business location.
The consultative document was prepared by a working party set up in May
chaired by Mr Keith Harrison, chairman of the Manx company Royal Life
International and deputy chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland (Isle of Man).
Mr Harrison said yesterday that the island's basic company taxation
legislation had changed little since its introduction in 1918. Amendments
over the years had resulted in a complex system that created distortions.
Corporate taxation, at a flat rate of 20 per cent, accounts for about 40 per
cent of Manx government income. About Pounds 34m is raised from annual
assessments on 13,000 companies.
The working party aims to simplify the basis of assessment for companies
setting up on the island.
At present, a new company is assessed in its first year on income from the
date of commencing business to the following April 5; in its second year on
the whole of that year's income; and in its third year on the whole of the
previous year's income. After that, the assessment is on the income shown in
the previous accounting year.
The consultative document recommends that assessments be linked to a
company's accounting period. Mr Harrison said that would remove the
advantage of tax planning and create 'a level playing field for everybody'.
He said companies should concentrate on growth in their early years, rather
than being concerned with tax planning.
Most Manx companies end their year on December 31, which means a large
concentration of work in December and January for the tax office and related
professionals.
If the taxation system reflected company year-ends connected to the
commencement of business, the workload, and government income, would be
spread throughout the year.
The working party also wants to avoid the double taxation that can apply to
company dividends raised in the first three years of trading.
Relief on a dividend is allowed only once, but the assessment system in the
early years means a dividend may be included in an assessment twice  - in
the second and third years. Companies get relief on the first inclusion but
not on the second.
The consultative document suggests the consideration of a small company tax
rate. Self-assessment is another option under review.
The government has invited comment from the island's business and
professional community, before an interim report next spring. Mr Harrison
said he expected a final report with legislative recommendations to be
published by the end of next year.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Elf and Amerada swap gas assets
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELF Exploration UK, a sub-sidiary of the French state-owned oil company Elf
Aquitaine, has swapped North Sea assets with Amerada Hess, the US oil
company.
Elf, the fourth largest North Sea operator, said the deal would help it to
strengthen its position in the North Sea, and demonstrated its long-term
commitment to the area.
The deal gives Elf a 12.5 per cent interest in the Franklin discovery,
thought to be a potentially large gas field. Franklin, in Block 29/5b, is
very close to Elf's Elgin gas field, which is under appraisal, and the
company plans to develop the two together.
Elf said the deal would allow it to swap present for future production and
to consolidate its interests in the North Sea. If the appraisal is positive,
Elf will seek government approval to develop the fields in 1994, hoping for
first gas by 1998.
Amerada Hess will get Elf's 16.45 per cent interest in the Anglia gas field,
raising its total interest to 29.29 per cent. Anglia is producing 50m cu ft
of gas a day. Amerada Hess said the deal strengthened its position in the
southern gas basin of the North Sea.

BRITISH RAIL disclosed new plans yesterday for an international railway
station at Ashford, Kent, to serve continental trains passing through the
Channel tunnel.
If the government approves the scheme, the Pounds 80m station should open in
1994, providing people in south-east England with a way of joining Channel
tunnel expresses without having to travel into central London.
Plans for the station have met a series of delays. Last year the Department
of Transport threw out BR's plans for a Pounds 140m scheme on the grounds
that it was too expensive.
BR's new and less ambitious scheme, presented to Kent County Council
yesterday, would expand the existing Network SouthEast station to
accommodate international and domestic trains, and give it an international
departure lounge and a 2,000-space carpark.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Ballots posted to BCCI creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, the liquidator of Bank of Credit and Commerce International,
started balloting creditors yesterday to sound out opinions on the
compensation deal negotiated with the Abu Dhabi government, the majority
shareholder in the bank.
The ballot is being carried out at the request of the district court of
Luxembourg, which must approve the agreement before it can go ahead.
The liquidators are trying to contact about 50,000 depositors of BCCI SA,
the Luxembourg-registered bank that formed one of the two main banking arms
of BCCI. Most of BCCI's other banking operations were carried out in BCCI
Overseas, based in Grand Cayman.
The ballot paper, sent out yesterday, asks depositors whether they are in
favour both of the contribution agreement, under which Abu Dhabi is expected
to commit about Dollars 1.7bn, and the pooling agreement, which provides for
a pooling of assets of BCCI Holdings and the two main banks, including
branches in the UK and the Isle of Man.
The ballot paper is accompanied by a letter from the liquidators. Creditors
are 'strongly recommended' to accept the compensation deal. 'The rejection
of this agreement, so as to create the possibility of renegotiation, would
be a pure gamble,' says the letter.
The results of the ballot are not binding on the court, which hopes to make
a decision on the liquidation on October 1. The judge, however, wanted to
gauge the strength of objections to the proposed scheme among creditors.
Mr Ahmed Al Sayegh, a member of the majority shareholders' working group
which has been carrying out the negotiations with the liquidators, said last
night that the only alternative to the arrangement was 'hugely expensive'
court action around the world.
'The liquidators believe that the arrangements are the best option . . . ,'
he said. 'Without the arrangements the only people to gain will be lawyers.'

FT  13 AUG 92 / Pitfalls of putting a price on coal: Juliet Sychrava looks
at what may prove to be the most complex privatisation yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE government prepares to sell British Coal, it is becoming clear that
making money from the privatisation is not, for once, the main priority.
That is partly because British Coal is virtually impossible to value
accurately and partly because the approximate valuations look depressingly
low.
Analysts have suggested figures of less than Pounds 1bn.
British Coal has fixed assets - including 50 coal mines and plant and
machinery valued at Pounds 1.68bn - but it has Pounds 2.6bn of liabilities.
It made a profit of Pounds 170m in the year to March this year, but that
figure says virtually nothing about future profitability.
At the moment the corporation earns almost all its money by selling 65m
tonnes of coal a year to the electricity generators at special high prices
which are enshrined in the contracts put into place by the government before
the electricity industry was privatised two years ago.
Those contracts expire in March next year. The new contracts, which are
being negotiated now, are expected to be much tougher on British Coal.
The price it receives will fall from Pounds 1.85 a gigajoule - the unit of
energy from coal - to about Pounds 1.50 a gigajoule. According to estimates
from McCloskey Coal Information, the coal consultancy, had British Coal had
to sell at that price last year, it would have lost Pounds 456m.
The volume of coal in the contracts is expected to be 45m tonnes in the
first year, declining to 30m in the third year and possibly less thereafter.
British Coal has indicated that if that happens it will have to start
closing pits soon after the contracts are signed.
McCloskey estimates that might lead to nearly 30 pits closing immediately
unless the corporation can reduce its deep-mine costs further.
More pits may close to match the declining volumes in the contract.
According to one observer, only the 12 pits shortlisted last year by NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on the privatisation,
would be viable.
The new contracts will force British Coal to write down its assets, perhaps
to about Pounds 500m, because it will not be able to service them from
future income.
In addition to the difficulty of valuing British Coal while its asset and
cashflow value decline, the government faces pressing practical and
political headaches.
Closing mines is politically uncomfortable. Since the end of the 1984-85
miners' strike, 119 pits have closed and 130,000 miners have lost their
jobs.
Both the government and British Coal have said they would like to sell the
largest possible economic coal industry. If that is true, and the
corporation does not simply close all but 12 mines after the new contracts
are signed, it will have a hard time finding a trade buyer for the others.
Some mines may improve their performance given time, but a large chunk of
British Coal's deep-mine production will never be profitable. Even if
loss-making mines are sold bundled up with more profitable opencast or
surface mines, a private-sector purchaser would not carry them for long.
At the same time, the government does not want to fragment the industry too
much - British Coal needs critical mass to negotiate with the electricity
generators.
Although the present board would like British Coal to be sold intact, a
suitable, adequately large buyer would be hard to find. Picking an
international company may anger the many small British coal companies that
would like a slice of the business. Offering them, and the miners
themselves, parts of the corporation would smooth the privatisation.
There are more obscure issues that may make it hard to sell the corporation
safely. Resolving those issues is at least as important for the government
as maximising proceeds.
The first practical question is who will own the mines themselves. British
Coal owns the UK's coal reserves and leases some reserves to small mining
companies, which pay it a 'rent' or royalty.
If the government sells British Coal freehold, so that the purchaser owns
the land on which it mines coal, it will have to allow other coal companies
the option to buy their freehold. If it sells it leasehold, it will have to
decide on the value of the lease.
Then it may face the same arguments over what the royalty should be that
British Coal has faced for many years. The royalty is theoretically linked
to the value of the coal assets, and when the coal price falls, small mining
companies fight for a lower royalty.
If the government keeps the freehold, British Coal will lose the royalty of
about 40p a tonne from private deep mines and Pounds 4.50 to Pounds 5 a
tonne from opencast mines it collects today - a revenue of Pounds 14m. It
would have to pay a royalty itself, and the government would have to set up
a body to grant licences to other lessors.
The royalty question needs to be settled quickly. Small, private mining
companies are already finding it hard to plan, because they have no idea how
much future royalties will be.
Another issue is British Coal's pension funds, worth a total of about Pounds
13bn - Pounds 6.5bn each for the miners' fund and the staff fund. They have
surpluses of about Pounds 1.4bn each that would allow a future owner to take
a pension holiday worth about Pounds 100m a year.
The government will want to ensure that the funds are safe for existing
employees, which might mean closing them off or taking them over. Deciding
how to administer the funds may take time and negotiation with the miners'
unions.
British Coal's biggest liability is concessionary coal - its historical
obligation to supply miners, working or retired, with about 5 tonnes a year.
This costs it Pounds 1.62bn.
Like the pension funds, the liability could be taken on by the government
and managed separately - the corporation already gets a government grant to
cover the annual liability. But finding a body to administer the liability
might take even more time and money.
British Coal also has provisions for damage to hearing, amounting to Pounds
273m. Those could also be taken out of the company and managed, but the
question of a cut-off point arises. What happens to claims that arise after
the company is privatised, but possibly relate to earlier injuries?
The same question arises for the liability - Pounds 219m - relating to
subsidence and surface damage caused by mining. Managing that may mean
setting up another quango with an almost indefinite life.
Before the government can value or sell British Coal, it has to resolve all
those issues. All that, and the seemingly intractable matter of getting the
electricity industry to sign contracts with the company, must make it one of
the most complex privatisations ever.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Paris bourse suspends MMB shares
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MMB, the holding company which has been clouded by controversy over its
attempts to merge its Matra defence electronics and Hachette publishing
interests, yesterday saw its shares suspended on the Paris stock market.
The Societes des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which runs the Paris markets,
said that MMB's shares would be suspended until tomorrow because of
'disorderly movements' in the price over the past few days.
Shares were suspended at Tuesday's closing price of FFr92 (Dollars 18.43).
The suspension comes at a time when MMB is in the final stages of completing
the merger between Matra and Hachette.
It comes shortly after news that Northern Telecom, the Canadian
telecommunications group, is investing FFr1.36bn in Matra's
telecommunications division, and was negotiating to take a stake in the new
merged group.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of Matra and Hachette whose family
controls MMB, has come under fierce criticism for his plan to merge the two
companies because of the apparent incompatibility of their interests. The
merger will include combining some central administrative areas to cut
corporate costs.
Mr Lagardere's plan has been seen as particularly sensitive given Hachette's
recent financial problems following the collapse of La Cinq, the French TV
company.
Hachette recently secured shareholder approval for a FFr2.8bn
recapitalisation package to reduce its debt and restructure its finances
before the merger with Matra.
However, the suspension comes while Mr Lagardere is negotiating with
prospective shareholders over the scale and cost of their potential
investment in the merged group.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swissair searches for flight
plan to recovery - International airlines are struggling to secure their
futures, but the Swiss carrier appears unable to establish a convincing
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As of an aged movie queen, it might be said of Swissair these days that it
has a great past. Investors, suppliers and even ordinary Swiss are
questioning whether the distinguished airline has a future.
Swissair recently reported a record first-half loss of SFr116m (Dollars
87.8m), a reflection mainly of the cut-throat competition that has broken
out on the North Atlantic this summer, but also of more serious structural
problems.
The result was broadly in line with expectations, and Swissair bearer
shares, which have lost more than half their value since 1989, scarcely
moved from the SFr610 level.
But the big disappointment among investment analysts was that there was
still no sign the airline was coming to grips with the challenges of the
future.
At a time when even big airlines, such as British Airways and Air France,
are making large-scale alliances to secure market share, Swissair seems
unable to establish a convincing strategy.
'They have made a lot of little moves to keep up their quality, but nothing
to improve their strategic position,' Mr Dominique Bertrand, an analyst at
Swiss Bank Corporation, says. 'I would like to see them doing something that
shows dynamism.'
Swissair's dilemma is that its home country is too small to generate enough
passengers to fill the non-stop flights that customers demand of an
international airline. In addition, it is based in a country where wages are
very high, and wages represent 40 per cent of its operating costs.
In the past, it could overcome these disadvantages by offering a better
service than rivals and charging higher prices for it. Today, service on
other leading airlines at least equals that of Swissair, and critics say the
Swiss airline, which may be something of a paradigm of its country, has been
slow to respond to the tougher environment.
Swissair officials find this criticism unfair. They claim they were among
the first to see the necessity of strategic alliances, setting up one for
long-haul business with Delta Airlines of the US and Singapore Airlines in
late 1989 and another with Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines in
May, 1990, the so-called European Quality Alliance.
But Swissair looked to these alliances mainly for support in marketing and
cost control. It was unwilling to commit to substantial financial pacts, so
it could not force them to work.
And they have not worked out as well as the group hoped. Singapore Airlines
has preferred, for the most part, to continue to go its own way, and SAS and
Swissair have been unable to agree on combined aircraft purchase orders.
But the biggest setback was Delta's purchase last November of Pan American's
European routes. This enabled the big US carrier, for which Swissair hoped
to be a collector and distributor of European travellers, to compete head on
with its partner at its Zurich base. If the two had had a stronger alliance,
things might have turned out differently, analysts say.
There was a mild resurgence of confidence in the group in April when Mr
Hannes Goetz, an executive who is credited with transforming the foundries
group, George Fischer, was appointed chairman. The shares rose from around
SFr700 in early April to their peak for the year of SFr765 in late May.
But by then the severity of the North Atlantic fare war was becoming
apparent, and Swissair warned its earnings trend was 'unsatisfactory',
sending the shares plunging again. The North Atlantic accounts for about a
quarter of the airline's business, and its returns from there were being hit
both by lower ticket prices and by the weakening of the dollar against the
Swiss franc.
The airline was already in the midst of a four-year programme to slash
internal costs by SFr300m, but it suddenly accelerated the pace. It
rationalised its freight haulage business, announced 400 redundancies in its
6,000-strong administration staff and ordered its two charter subsidiaries,
Balair in Basle and CTA in Geneva, to combine as many of their activities as
possible.
Swissair executives remain defensive about their strategy. Mr Paul Muller, a
director, admitted recently there were weaknesses in the kind of
co-operation agreements the airline had established. But he saw no need to
rush out and do a big deal just because British Airways did one.
'Co-operation gives you independence but doesn't bring security. Mergers can
give security, but only the security that you will share the same fate. And
decision making will be in the hands of others.'
Mr Muller said Swissair still wanted to be independent and try to capitalise
on its reputation for quality. 'Our future lies in management - among other
things, management of airlines. We do not mean to gobble them up but to sell
them management services.'
Analysts remain unimpressed. 'I think things will get better in the next few
months, but I do not think Swissair will make enough money to attract
investors,' says Mr Urs Kunz, an analyst at Credit Suisse.
Mr Kunz says the airline has to seek a large partner if it is to thrive, but
neither the airline management nor the Swiss government bodies which hold 22
per cent of the shares, are ready to think about that seriously. 'When the
situation gets worse, people will think more about it,' he predicts.

Graseby, formerly Cambridge Electronics, yesterday announced a sale of
development land that will substantially reduce gearing for the
environmental monitoring and medical products group.
The company expects to use the Pounds 8.5m proceeds from the sale to J
Sainsbury and Schlumberger Industries to reduce group borrowings.
The proceeds should help almost halve net debt which is likely to have risen
to nearly Pounds 20m at the end of June.
The land being sold is at the Great Cambridge Road, Enfield, where Enfield
Borough recently granted planning permission for retail and industrial
development.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome price sees further fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellcome, the drugs group, fell 4p to 778p yesterday as Robert
Fleming, the merchant bank which handled the recent Pounds 2.16bn sale of
shares by the Wellcome Trust, again cut its bid price.
The bid was cut by 3p to 777p, after a 20p cut on Tuesday from 800p, the
price at which the Trust sold its shares.
Fleming's move is part of its programme of stabilising the share price
following the sale, using the so-called green-shoe option. This allows
Fleming to buy 40.5m shares which were over-allotted in the sale to mop up
loose shares. So far Fleming is thought to have bought about 23m shares.

FT  13 AUG 92 / US bond market takes time to heal: Speed of Salomon
Brothers' return to health in wake of scandal is unmatched by regulatory
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago this week investigators from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department were
crawling all over Wall Street to find out who had been involved in the
rigging of billion-dollar treasury auctions. At the same time, on Capitol
Hill, politicians were demanding a complete regulatory overhaul of the bond
market in the wake of what one congressman said was 'financial treason'.
One year on, Salomon Brothers, the principal culprit, is in remarkably good
health, even if the scars have not fully healed. The firm was forced into
radical change after its bond-trading desk was discovered to have faked
customer orders in treasury bond auctions. Much credit for weathering the
storm has been given to Mr Warren Buffett, who took over as interim chairman
of Salomon in the wake of the scandal and stepped down in June this year.
Last month the firm reported second quarter pre-tax operating profit of
Dollars 647m (Pounds 336m), the largest by a publicly quoted Wall Street
securities firm.
The bond market, however, looks much like it has for decades. The process by
which the treasury sells the government's securities - which a year ago
almost all agreed was antiquated and shoddily supervised - is virtually
unchanged. This week, for example, the treasury will sell Dollars 36bn in
new securities, in almost the same way it sold them before the scandal.
Some minor reforms have been introduced. For one, more institutions are
eligible to become primary dealers. Yet the number of primary dealers (39),
is the same as a year ago - the cost in committing to being a primary dealer
has kept newcomers away.
The auctions remain dominated by a handful of big primary dealers, and most
institutional buyers submit bids for bonds and notes through the dealers.
The dealers have to cope with stricter surveillance by regulators, new rules
about record-keeping, and random spot-checking of customer bids. The Salomon
affair taught many dealers a sharp lesson in supervision, says Mr Patrick
Rothstein, head of government securities at Merrill Lynch. He says: 'The
players (in the market) are now painfully aware of what can happen if you
take your eye off the ball for a few moments.'
The treasury says it will supply extra securities after auctions if it
detects prices are being forced up by a supply shortage resulting from
market manipulation. The new weapon has not been used, and the treasury
hopes the threat will deter price 'squeezes' of the kind Salomon created
last year.
Some important planned reforms - reallocation of regulatory responsibilities
among government agencies and the automation and redesign of the auction
process - are a long way from implementation, mostly because of in-fighting
on Capitol Hill.
A turf battle between different congressional committees has meant
legislators have been unable to agree on the transfer of powers.
The plan to give the SEC a regulatory role in the bond market has run into
opposition. Mr Junius Peake, a financial consultant who testified before
both congressional banking committees about market reform, says the
secretary of the treasury should have a free hand to manage bond market
operations: 'I'm a little nervous about him being second-guessed by the
SEC.'
Government officials admit testing of a new computerised auction process is
some way off, and that it might be years before a system is operating.
Ultimately, major market reform is unlikely because the government opposes
it. Mr Jerome Powell, under-secretary of the treasury for finance, said
recently: 'I don't think fundamental changes in the bond market or in the
way traders do business are called for, or will happen.'
The investigation into whether other firms colluded with Salomon to break
treasury market rules also seems to be progressing slowly. The authorities
are keeping silent, but the roles of several of Salomon's clients whose
names were linked to an auction the firm rigged last May have been
investigated, including the powerful money managers Mr George Soros and Mr
Michael Steinhardt.
The Salomon executives who resigned over the scandal will probably face
civil charges related to the fact that they waited three months before
reporting the bond desk's illegal activities to regulators.
The man at the centre of the whole affair, Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of
bond trading at Salomon, is negotiating a plea bargain agreement with
government prosecutors.
In a recent interview breaking his silence of a year, Mr Mozer said he was
responsible for only one 'spur-of-the-moment' infraction of the rules, and
maintained he was being made a scapegoat by the media, congress and the new
management of Salomon.
Salomon still has to fight more than 50 lawsuits related to the scandal, but
its management believes the worst is over.
Salomon is suffering from scores of staff departures and defections that
came in the first six months after the scandal, and it is only now regaining
its footing in the profitable securities underwriting business. It has also
had to set aside almost Dollars 500m from the past year's earnings to pay
government fines, settle SEC charges and cover the cost of future lawsuits.
Yet, restructuring of the firm's management in the past year,
rationalisation of Salomon's compensation system, and shifting of resources
to emphasise the firm's core strengths of bond sales and trading should all
pay dividends in the long term.
It may be too early to tell, but Salomon could emerge from its troubles a
better firm. Government officials argue that the same can be said about the
treasury bond market, which they claim is better run and more efficiently
regulated.
The lack of real progress on regulatory reform, however, and the likely long
wait for the automated auctions the treasury promised last year, means the
federal authorities have less to be pleased about than does Salomon.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commercial Union cuts losses to Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, one of the largest UK composite insurers, yesterday
announced an improved performance in the first six months of 1992 with
pre-tax losses falling to Pounds 18.1m compared with Pounds 26.3m at the
halfway stage last year.
CU posted a Pounds 2.3m profit in the second quarter, in spite of a Pounds
15m loss due to the IRA bombing its London headquarters in April.
First-half figures also indicated that CU, the most highly rated of the UK
composites, is continuing to increase premium income at a faster rate than
its rivals.
Overall underwriting losses fell to Pounds 205.2m from Pounds 228.3m, with
UK underwriting losses Pounds 95.4m against a loss of Pounds 104.3m.
Investment income (net of loan interest) declined to Pounds 129.4m from
Pounds 145.1m.
Life profits fell to Pounds 50.7m from Pounds 53.7m while associated
undertakings' earnings amounted to Pounds 7m, up from Pounds 3.2m. Post-tax
operating losses of Pounds 23.7m (up from Pounds 21.5m) were offset by
realised investment gains of Pounds 182.4m (against Pounds 36.4m). The
interim dividend was unchanged at 9.25p per share. There was a loss per
share of 5.4p, against 5p last time.
Mr Peter Ward, managing director UK, denied CU was 'pursuing an aggressive
policy' but accepted CU was 'writing new business when some of our
competitors are shedding business'.
Premium income from UK motor insurance rose 52.9 per cent to Pounds 102m,
reflecting rate increases and an 12 per cent increase in policyholders.
Overall UK premium income rose 19.2 per cent to Pounds 709.9m. Life premiums
grew 42 per cent to Pounds 272.2m, reflecting strong sales of a new single
premium bond. Mr Ward said CU was prioritising sales of motor policies to
drivers aged over 30 and preferred to limit cover to named drivers.
Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, said: 'The UK
account is going ahead at a hell of a rate.'
CU has benefited from its relatively low exposure to domestic mortgage
indemnity policies, which compensate lenders when they make losses on the
sale of repossessed homes.
The group has also been helped by its relatively low investment exposure in
the UK equity market. At Pounds 1.2bn, shareholders funds were only
marginally down on the year-end figure of Pounds 1.21bn although assets were
boosted by a Pounds 100m preference share issue in May. CU's solvency (net
assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was 42.5 per cent, compared
with 44 per cent on December 31.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Boots receives licence in UK for Manoplax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANOPLAX, the cardiovascular drug whose success is vital for the credibility
of Boots' pharmaceuticals drug research, received its first licence
yesterday. UK regulators said the medicine, developed by the British retail
and healthcare group, could be used to treat congestive heart failure.
The UK pharmaceutical market is only the fourth largest in Europe but the
announcement is significant because it demonstrates that Boots has overcome
regulators' fears about the drug's safety and effectiveness. Early clinical
studies suggested Manoplax was ineffective. Boots shares rose 7p to 429p.
'There is little else more important for the Boots' pharmaceuticals business
than Manoplax. This is its first new drug for a long time and the division
will depend on Manoplax to drive growth in the 1990s,' said Mr Paul
Krickler, pharmaceuticals analyst at Goldman Sachs.
Manoplax could generate revenues of between Dollars 100m (Pounds 52m) and
Dollars 150m by 1995, assuming swift US approval, said Mr Krickler. The
pharmaceuticals division's turnover last year was Pounds 699m, generating
operating profits of Pounds 120m, nearly a third of Boots' Pounds 374m
pre-tax earnings.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said: 'We confidently look forward to
receiving further registration approvals in most major markets in the coming
months.'
The company said it expected to have US approval by the end of its financial
year in March.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UN will send troops to guard food convoys in Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations yesterday signed a breakthrough agreement with warlords
in Somalia for 500 armed UN guards to be deployed within 21 days in the
war-shattered capital, Mogadishu.
The Blue Berets' mission will be to help protect food distribution to
millions of starving people in Somalia, where some 3,000 to 5,000 people are
dying each week, says Mr David Andrews, the visiting Irish foreign minister.
The agreement, signed after months of tense discussion with the factions in
Somalia's 20-month civil war, clears the final obstacle to a massive relief
effort in the famine-plagued nation.
Troops from Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Canada, already on standby, could
be sent to Somalia before the end of the month once the UN Security Council
gives the final go-ahead. The military force will ensure security for food
distribution, which has been hampered by banditry, looting and hijacking of
aid convoys by gunmen.
The agreement was signed yesterday at Bardere, 200 miles west of Mogadishu,
by Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's special representative in
Somalia, and General Mohamed Farrar Aideed, leader of the Somali National
Alliance, a loose coalition of four clan-based factions.
It provides for the 500 troops to secure Mogadishu airport and harbour and
to guard the transport of food to warehouses and distribution points within
the city. No agreement has yet been reached for the UN guards to escort food
convoys outside Mogadishu.
Mr Sahnoun said deployment of the troops 'should not take more than two to
three weeks maximum and I hope it will take less than that'. He stressed
that the UN mission would be purely humanitarian. 'We cannot, as the UN,
ensure law and order all over Somalia. To do that we would need thousands of
troops,' he said.
Gen Aideed has previously been nervous that the presence of foreign troops
in the country would undermine his military advantage over rival warlord, Mr
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, observers say.
Mr Sahnoun appealed yesterday for massively increased aid and said UN
agencies and non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross were so
far only sending a quarter of the minimum monthly food needs. 'Let us
organise a couple of airlift operations as we did for Ethiopia in the
1984-85 famine,' he said.
Mr Sahnoun and Mr Andrews praised the efforts of non-governmental
organisations and made veiled criticism of the World Food Programme and
other UN agencies for continuing to hide behind the danger factor and not
acting rapidly enough to deliver food.
Mr Andrews said the devastation and dying he saw in Somalia were appalling:
'It was as if somebody dropped an atom bomb, the end of the world, a land
that God has forgotten.'
He said he would urge on Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign minister, today the
need to double European Community food aid to the country.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Bonn backs health budget curbs: Doctors and dentists
threaten strikes over cost-cutting reforms
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN cabinet yesterday shrugged off widespread opposition to its
planned health reforms and approved measures which could save the
state-subsidised system more than DM11bn (Pounds 3.9bn) a year.
Coalition leaders approved the package put forward by Mr Horst Seehofer, the
health minister, in spite of strike threats by doctors and dentists, a
pledge from the Social Democrat opposition to use its blocking majority in
the Bundesrat, and fears of constitutional complications.
The plan, which caused protests when first aired in June, will be given its
first reading in the Bundestag on September 11.
It includes proposals for increased charges for patients totalling DM3.2bn a
year. Economies on drugs, doctors' and dentists' fees and hospital charges
are worth a further DM8.2bn.
Defending his scheme yesterday, Mr Seehofer said payments from health
insurance funds were increasing at double the rate of contributions.
Bonn, which is also committed to a freeze on public spending until 1995, is
expected to have to subsidise health care by more than DM10bn this year,
compared with DM5.5bn in 1991.
The federal government has shied away from increasing employee contributions
because reducing take-home pay would lead to union demands for higher wages
to compensate for the loss, increasing inflationary pressure.
The package was 'a bitter pill', Mr Seehofer said, but the alternative of
increased insurance contributions was 'politically wrong, economically
dangerous and socially unjust'.
An offer to use part of the savings to employ 13,000 more nurses cut no ice
with his political and professional opponents.
The Social Democrat opposition threatened to deploy its blocking majority in
the Bundesrat, or upper house, to bar increases in patient contributions and
structural changes proposed in the minister's package.
Mr Karsten Vilmar, president of the federal doctors' association, said he
could not exclude the possibility of strikes in protest at the changes.
Dentists have already threatened action.
The reforms may also run into constitutional objections. Some ministers
suggested that plans to limit the number of doctors operating within the
state-subsidised system might be interpreted as interference with a
citizen's right to practise his or her occupation.
The minister's plan, which includes an obligation for consultants to pay
half their private fees to the hospitals in which they work, and the
introduction of a 10 per cent contribution from patients to drug costs, is
mainly a holding operation. His aim is first to restrain current cost
increases, and follow up in 1995 with structural changes.
Meanwhile, hospitals will be forced to economise and drug companies will
have to freeze their prices for two years at a level 5 per cent below those
applying in May this year. The volume of drugs prescribed will be
controlled, with the aim of bringing it down to 1991 levels.

the first time last year - nearly double the annual figure of a decade ago -
a report published yesterday claims.
The report, by Mr Rowland Goodwin, a stress expert, is based on an annual
sample of doctors' certificates conducted by the Department of Social
Security.
Female absenteeism has risen especially fast, by 111 per cent, since 1982
when self-certification was introduced, compared with a rise of 55 per cent
for men.
Self-certification allows employees to stay off work for slightly longer
without a doctor's certificate. A sick note signed by a doctor is needed
only if the illness lasts over a week. Under the old system a doctor had to
be consulted after three days.
However, Mr Goodwin, of the Greater Manchester Industrial Mission, a
church-based organisation, said self-certification was not necessarily to
blame for the increase in absenteeism, and that the rate fell slightly after
self-certification was introduced.
There is no single explanation for the increase, according to Mr Goodwin,
but he points to the ageing workforce and increasing pressure at work. He
also claims that 35 per cent of the overall total of days lost is
stress-related.
His report concludes: 'At half a billion days per year, the cost to the
health service and the loss in terms of efficiency and productivity at the
workplace must now be taken seriously.'
The report's findings provoked some scepticism, with Ms Lucy Mason of the
Robens Institute for occupational health at Surrey University questioning Mr
Goodwin's categorisation of stress-related diseases.
The Confederation of British Industry said it worked out absenteeism only in
money terms. Its latest figure, calculated in 1987, puts the annual cost to
the economy at Pounds 5bn.

Are the Australians showing signs of Neighbourly remorse? Having inflicted
their soap opera on the Brits for more than five years now, they are
preparing to indoctrinate the younger generation with tales of the times
when Mr Plod ruled the pavements.
BBC Enterprises, which bought the rights to Noddy, the 40-year-old Enid
Blyton character, earlier this year, has just received an order for more
than half a million copies of the entire Noddy book series from Australia -
that's one Noddy for every three pre-school Australians.
The books about the flop-hatted garden gnome will fill four 40 ft
containers. 'It's a most significant sale,' said a very pleased spokesman
from BBC Enterprises.
Meanwhile, South Africa is also showing an interest. The series, stripped of
all Blyton's racist innuendos (the controversial Golly has been supplanted
by a Goblin), has been specially translated into Afrikaans.

Smart money is on Andrew Foster to replace Howard Davies as controller of
the Audit Commission.
The commission is expected to announce later today that the 47-year-old
ex-social worker who has worked for two formerly loony-left London councils
is to head up the local government watchdog.
The appointment will be seen as a further attempt by the commission to mend
its bridges with local government. Under Howard Davies, the commission
appeared increasingly critical of government policy, especially on the
introduction of the poll tax.
A recent report on housing was delayed until after the election, so
unfavourable were its conclusions for Whitehall.
Foster is clearly from the local government world; he was assistant director
of social services for Haringey, north London, and director of social
services for Greenwich, south London, and the county of North Yorkshire.
Equally important for the commission, which is responsible for NHS
efficiency, Foster has health service experience as general manager of the
Yorkshire regional health authority. He has been deputy chief executive of
the NHS Management Executive since last year, working under Duncan Nichol to
see through the government's health service reforms.
Perhaps his chief attraction for the headhunters Spencer Stuart and
Associates was that he has never worked for McKinsey, the management
consultants. (Howard Davies and his predecessor Sir John Banham both came
from the McKinsey stable.)
Whether Foster will follow both of them to become director-general of the
CBI remains to be seen.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Observer: Pru's new man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Prudential, Britain's biggest institutional investor, is always
banging on about the need for strong non-executive directors, it is
interesting to see who it thinks fit to serve on its own board.
If its latest recruit, English China Clays' chief executive Andrew Teare, is
anything to go by, then the Pru seems to be changing from its old ways of
packing its board with old establishment figures.
Lord Hunt, the former Cabinet secretary, Lord Butterfield, a former
vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, and Julius Neave, an old
reinsurance hand, were all in their 70s when they retired from the Pru's
board after the annual meeting in May.
The 49-year-old Teare is the first of a clutch of new non-executives
expected to take their place around the Pru's boardroom table.
In many ways he is a classic example of what the Pru is looking for when it
chivvies companies it invests in to strengthen their own boards. He has
rejuvenated English China Clays and is one of a new generation of younger
business leaders worth watching.
Even so, his judgment can sometimes be suspect. He backed Michael Heseltine
in the Tory leadership contest following Lady Thatcher's resignation in
1990.
That said, he hasn't yet put a foot wrong in his business affairs.

Scottish bankers like to think of themselves as pioneers. The first
Institute of Bankers was founded in Scotland as was the first savings bank
and investment trust.
Talk to many of the top managers in overseas banks like the Hongkong and
Shanghai and Standard Chartered and you find that they got their training
behind a Scottish bank till.
But when it comes to playing with paper money, the Scots are way behind. The
Royal Bank of Scotland is making much of yesterday's decision to stop
burning its old bank notes after 264 years. Next week, an environmentally
friendly granulator will take over.
Lord Younger was on hand to help chief stoker Joe Kelly torch the last
Pounds 1m in front of an invited media cast. The bank has even issued a tie
to commemorate the event.
For once, the Royal Bank seems to be one step ahead of its Scottish rivals.
The Bank of Scotland and the Clydesdale still burn their notes, although the
Clydesdale plans to stop soon.
However, the Bank of England has not burnt its notes for several years now
and the last English bank to stop issuing its own bank notes was Fox Fowler
&amp; Co, over 70 years ago. How much longer are the Scots going to be allowed
to carry on this unpatriotic practice?

FT  13 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Risks facing Russian reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THINGS ARE rotten in the state of Russian reform. Worse, the west's tardy
assistance makes it appear as much a part of the problem as of the solution.
If things continue to slide as they have in recent weeks, the question will
soon be asked: who lost Russia? The answer would be that western
small-mindedness played a substantial part.
The fundamental error of the west has been to view reform in the former
Soviet Union, particularly in Russia, as just another of those problems of
impoverishment that beset it. This attitude explains why assistance was
offered too late and was probably too little. That is also why the
inward-looking and overstretched Bretton Woods institutions have carried so
much of the burden.
The west's stand-point shows a weak grasp of strategic imperatives. It is
wrong because the collapse of a heavily armed superpower creates risks and
opportunities on a much greater scale than, for example, Brazil. Reforming
Russia is the most important economic challenge since the reconstruction of
postwar western Europe.
The west's stand-point also shows a weak grasp of the economic requirements.
Russia needs more moral support, more material aid and vastly more technical
assistance than most other economies in difficulty. Without such support
this round of reform will collapse in hyperinflation, possibly quite soon.
The growing influence of industrialists whose skill lies in producing goods
that nobody wants and the return of a central banker whose skill lies in
printing money may not be surprising. But the consequences are predictable.
Optimists may argue that a Weimar-style collapse could be the harbinger of
real reform. But it could also mark the return of something far darker.
Grudgingly approved
It is already clear that the Russians are unlikely to receive further
balance of payments or budgetary support this year on top of the paltry
Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' credit that the IMF has grudgingly approved. In
addition, the absence of a medium-term debt service reduction agreement is
hampering the Russian ability to plan reform at all. Meanwhile, western
technical assistance is largely of the 'fly in, lecture and fly out'
variety. Yet Russia needs access to a wide range of western competence to
solve the huge technical problems it faces; and it needs it on tap.
The west - probably under the purposive US leadership that has been so
signally lacking - should have reached the following conclusions: first,
macroeconomic stabilisation cannot be made a condition for assistance, but
should be viewed as its hoped-for consequence; second, givers of technical
assistance must work alongside the Russian government; and third, structural
reform - the introduction of a market economy - is as important as
stabilisation, quite possibly more so.
Required assistance
Moreover, it is far from clear that the IMF and the World Bank are the right
institutions to deliver the required assistance. They were not thought the
right institutions for postwar Europe.
It may already be too late to reverse the loss of momentum. But the effort
should be made. Given the depreciation of the rouble, quite modest sums - as
little as Dollars 5bn-Dollars 8bn - should enable Russia to balance its
budget. The fiction that a few months from now Russia will service its debts
must also be abandoned. It will not. A few years from now might be another
matter. Furthermore, the group of seven industrial countries should ensure
an adequate flow of technical assistance.
Assistance should not be given without conditions. But an austere target for
this year's budget deficit is a misconceived precondition. The purpose of
the assistance is to help close the deficit.
Above all, assistance should not be delayed until there is little risk of
failure. Any assistance to Russia involves risk. But rarely can what is
being risked have been so small - just a few billions of dollars - against
the potential gain.
By waiting until the Russian government demonstrates it is likely to
succeed, the west greatly increases the likelihood of its failure. Western
governments must act decisively and involve themselves more fully, before it
is too late.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Quality of water is not cheap: The industry could have to
spend up to Pounds 60bn to meet EC rules. But who should foot the bill?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cleaner water means much higher water bills. That is the unpalatable logic
which Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry watchdog,
wants to drive home with his report The Cost of Quality, published today.
Mr Byatt, who has won a reputation as a confrontational regulator, will give
the the first formal estimates of how much it will cost the 39 water
companies of England and Wales to meet new European Community environmental
rules. He will also say how much customers' bills might rise between 1995
and 2000 as a result.
The report, known as the Strategic Assessment, is expected to give a range
of figures for capital spending, from the minimum needed to meet regulations
up to the 'pure green' standards favoured by environmental groups. Its
projections are likely to be controversial on several fronts.
First, it will show that new environmental rules have pushed the industry's
capital spending obligations far above the Pounds 28bn estimated in December
1989, when the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales
were privatised.
Second, the increase will reopen the question of who should foot the bill -
shareholder or customer. Customers' bills, already set to rise by 60 per
cent above the level of inflation during the 1990s, could rise even more
steeply. That will add to the row about whether the Scottish water industry
should be privatised, already set to be one of this autumn's political
battlegrounds.
Third, Ofwat wants water companies to spend the next six months asking
customers how much they are prepared to pay for higher water quality. But
users may find the choice between quality and price perplexing and worrying,
although most customer complaints to Ofwat are now about high bills. In the
words of one water company's finance director: 'If you suggest lower water
standards to most people they back away as if you are handing them a glass
of filthy poison.'
The degree to which Ofwat's report stirs up debate will depend on the
figures it gives for water companies' investment obligations because of new
EC environmental rules.
The government's original estimate of Pounds 28bn struck three years ago was
made up of the cost of meeting EC directives on drinking water and beaches,
plus some 'catching-up' after a decade of under-investment. The 29 small
water supply companies which remain in state hands had to pick up Pounds 4bn
of the burden, but the other Pounds 24bn was to be borne by the 10 public
water and sewerage companies, which planned to spread it evenly throughout
the 1990s.
However, several large water companies now estimate that the total
investment programme, if all directives are interpreted as stringently as
possible, could total some Pounds 60bn, double the original figure.
The most expensive new obligation since privatisation is the EC directive on
municipal waste water. Companies have to begin to treat more thoroughly the
water and sewage they discharge into rivers and the sea. But the
alternatives to present methods - such as building incinerators - are
expensive.
The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 public companies,
suggests that complying with the directive could cost Pounds 10bn.
Individually, the companies put the cost to the industry at anything from
Pounds 8bn to Pounds 15bn.
One reason for the wide range is that the exact interpretation of the
directive by UK regulators is not yet clear, and companies hope the Ofwat
report will help clarify the choices. Since privatisation, the Department of
the Environment has also accelerated the clean-up of beaches, following the
European Commission's threat of court action. Several water companies
estimate this could add several billion pounds of spending.
They also estimate that it could cost Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn more than
originally expected to meet the existing EC directive on removal of
pesticides from drinking water. This month's report by the Drinking Water
Inspectorate of England and Wales showed an apparent slight increase in the
level of pesticides, but was unable to determine whether the increase was
real or was due to a change in sampling techniques.
A World Health Organisation report later this year on acceptable levels of
lead could also add Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn pounds to spending, the
companies say. Almost all lead present in drinking water comes from the
pipes connecting the customer's house to the mains, not from mains water
itself. But replacing those supply pipes would be an expensive and lengthy
process.
The cost of fitting water meters to households is a further unknown;
estimates range from Pounds 500m to Pounds 3bn if most of the country was
covered. Both Mr Byatt and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary,
have thrown their support behind some metering as one of several measures to
help curb the growth in demand for water.
But even with meters, the south-eastern water companies still foresee a
water shortage, which could force them to build reservoirs. The cost could
be Pounds 2bn to Pounds 5bn, City observers estimate.
Ofwat will do both the water industry and customers a great service by
turning its spotlight on these costs, which have been the subject of intense
debate in the UK since privatisation.
Of particular importance will be the regulator's views on the minimum
investment needed to meet quality standards. Several water companies have
argued that little of the total is discretionary. However, City observers,
who suggest that it is in the water companies' interest to warn of the high
cost, argue that the inescapable new investment is probably as low as Pounds
10bn to Pounds 15bn. They point out that much of the spending can be
postponed until the next century, beyond the five-year window of Ofwat's
projections.
What do the new investment burdens mean for customers' bills? This is the
section of Ofwat's report that will provoke the most intense debate. Share
prices of the water companies have been sliding in the past week on City
fears that Mr Byatt may suggest that profits and dividends take some of the
burden off water bills.
On the crudest calculations, if all the impact were passed through to
customers, then the rise in bills would be steep. Consumer groups fear that
bills could rise even more than the estimate made at the time of
privatisation - 60 per cent above the rate of inflation.
However, the water companies emphasise that the relationship between capital
spending and customers' bills is complex. The eventual rise in bills depends
acutely on the rate of return on investment, the choice of debt or equity
for funding, and the assumptions made about possible gains in efficiency.
The most sensitive of those issues, from the companies' point of view, is
whether Ofwat allows them to earn as high a rate of return on their new
investment as they have on past projects. They are worried that Mr Byatt
would want to see a lower figure for future investment.
The water companies will also want to establish quickly whether the
investment can be funded by debt, or whether they will have to raise new
equity on the stock market. A precise estimate of the extra spending between
1995 and 2000 is critical, as this is the period when the public companies
will be under greatest financial strain. On present plans, City stockbrokers
predict that the companies will have debt-to-equity ratios of about 50 per
cent at the worst point, and that interest charges will eat up about a
quarter of operating profits. Shareholders are unlikely to welcome a
worsening of those ratios.
Mr Byatt's comments on these points will give a clue to his current thinking
on the thorny issue of how profitable the water companies should be.
The Strategic Assessment is one of the few formal statements that Ofwat will
make before the Periodic Review in 1994, when it will review the companies'
pricing structure.
At privatisation it was agreed that water prices would rise each year by the
retail price index plus a factor K, where each company was alloted a
different K. Ofwat and the water companies tangled last year year over the
issue of future levels of K, when Ofwat questioned in a consultation paper
whether profitability was too high.
The issue has resurfaced in the past month with the failure of British Gas
and its regulator Ofgas to agree acceptable levels of return.
Questions of profitability and the level of water bills will also come under
intense scrutiny this autumn when the Scottish Office is due to announce
whether the Scottish water industry should be privatised. Mr Tom Clarke,
shadow Scottish secretary, says that in his view 'there is no doubt bills
will soar' under privatisation, and the Scottish TUC has pledged to fight
the proposals 'tooth and nail'.
Equipped with today's report, the water companies will have a further chance
to debate these points with Ofwat. However, Mr Byatt also wants them to
spend the next six months turning Ofwat's national projections into local
figures, and asking their customers what level of service they want.
That is admirable in principle, but could prove tricky in practice. The
water companies have long argued that many of the present standards are far
higher than those needed to protect health. They have some basis for their
claim that parts of the 1980 EC drinking water directive were passed in a
wave of environmental enthusiasm with little regard to the costs.
But as the directive is already in force and much of the investment has been
made, the scope for customer choice on that and many other topics may be
limited. Mr Colin Skellett, group managing director of Wessex Water, said:
'There needs to be a debate, but customer choice is only at the margin.'
The real choice may lie not with customers but with the Department of the
Environment, the National Rivers Authority and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Farms and Fisheries when they decide how stringently to interpret the small
print of the EC waste-water directive.
In bringing the full cost of environmental rules into the open, Mr Byatt's
report may also discourage new regulations from being set without
considering the impact on the customer.
If it does that, it will have performed a public service. It will also be
welcomed by the City if it removes some of the uncertainty hanging over the
companies.
But if its conclusion is that bills are set to rise even more steeply, it is
likely to inflame the wider debate about the water companies' profitability
and about the benefits of privatisation - a debate that is a long way from
being settled.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Leading Article: From Yukon to Yucatan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT GEORGE Bush gave vent to some uncharacteristically ringing phrases
when he announced yesterday the completion of 14 months of negotiations for
a North American Free Trade Agreement. It was, he said, 'a good day for
America, a good day for North America'. It was also, he might have added,
not a bad day for his own re-election campaign. At next week's Republican
party convention in Houston, he will be able to boast an achievement in two
areas - foreign and economic policy - where he has lately been found
wanting. And for the rest of the campaign, while the US debate on whether to
ratify the accord gets underway, he has a trade policy stick with which he
hopes to beat his Democratic opponents.
But was yesterday really a good day for the three signatory states - the US,
Canada and Mexico - and, more particularly, for those other countries and
companies that invest in and export to them? The answer in both cases can
only be a qualified yes.
The agreement will undoubtedly achieve some important political and economic
aims: it should stimulate trade between the parties, help Mexico's President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari lock in his liberal economic reforms, and assist
his country on the road to prosperity - all objectives understandably close
to Washington's heart. In time, if other Latin American countries are
allowed to join, the accord could help to spread market-oriented policies
throughout the American hemisphere.
Restrictive rules
Yet in some areas, it is questionable to what extent the agreement
encourages free, as opposed to managed, trade. Highly restrictive rules of
origin on car parts and textiles could tie the hands of foreign investors in
Mexico and place other exporters at a significant disadvantage. Its
protectionist arrangements for agriculture extend the iniquitous US sugar
regime and may worsen the position of impoverished Caribbean sugar
exporters. Within the free trade area, it sets high environmental standards
that may erode some aspects of Mexico's comparative advantage.
These concerns are not large enough to render the overall agreement
objectionable - at least, not as it stands. Indeed, the proposed Nafta
probably sets up fewer impediments to external investment and trade than
have been imposed by the European Community.
Congressional pressure
What is worrying is that the accord unveiled yesterday may not stand - that
Congressional Democrats will overturn the 'fast-track' authority that was
granted to the Bush administration for approval (or rejection) of the
package as a whole, and then seek to inject more protectionist regulations
on the environment and on the labour market. That is certainly what Mr
Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, threatened to do last month. If
he finds himself being forced to accede to Congressional pressure to subvert
Nafta's liberal intentions, President Bush would be well-advised to call the
whole exercise off.
That would be a pity. A genuine free trade agreement would bring great
benefit both to North America and the rest of the world - provided, that is,
it does not come to be seen as an alternative, rather than a complement, to
multilateral free trade.
While the deal may not be inherently incompatible either with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or with the sagging Uruguay round, there is a
danger that it will become a political substitute for the latter - and thus
postpone further the chances of completing it.
A Uruguay round agreement is still the most important trade prize which
President Bush could offer his electorate. For the US, trade with other
regions of the world is still more important than trade within North
America. Little more than a quarter of US exports go to Mexico and Canada -
a proportion that is likely to change only slowly once the agreement comes
into force in 1994. This means that the US still has a real incentive to
complete a multilateral accord bringing services and farm trade under the
Gatt - more, perhaps, than the EC, whose member states do 74 per cent of
their trade with one another. Will the US and Europe respond, or will they
find themselves seduced by the siren voices of inward-looking, managed
trade?

A LAW firm working on the insolvency of Maxwell Communication Corporation
had its fees questioned yesterday in a US bankruptcy court, Andrew Jack
writes.
The judge also extended the deadline for the completion of a reorganisation
plan for MCC. Judge Tina Brosman granted administrators a 60-day extension
to October 13 to file the plan for the company - and said she was pleased
with the progress made so far.
Sitting in the South District of New York Court, the judge refused to
approve a Dollars 677,000 bill from Milbank Tweed Hadley and McCloy for work
in the three months to June 30.
She also queried payments to Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and JP
Morgan, the merchant bank, but authorised their settlement.
Milbank Tweed said its bill covered 85 per cent of lawyers' hours over the
period, tax advice and clerical costs.
The judge queried fees of between Dollars 35 and Dollars 50 an hour for
paralegals faxing documents, photocopying papers and stuffing envelopes. The
firm defended the fees as comparable with those demanded by temporary
workers.
MCC is protected from creditors under Chapter 11 in the US, and through
administration under UK insolvency law.

FT  13 AUG 92 / TUC calls for Pounds 600m for training and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was urged by trade unions yesterday to spend Pounds 600m on
measures to tackle unemployment, ahead of official figures today that are
expected to show that the number of jobless has risen for the 28th
consecutive month.
The Trades Union Congress drew attention to a recent analysis by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), showing that
Britain lagged behind most European Community nations in developing labour
market measures to tackle joblessness.
The TUC wants the government to restore the budgets of Training and
Enterprise Councils, which administer training in England and Wales, and
also to develop temporary employment programmes.
Separately, Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union, called on the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry to seek a
meeting with the prime minister to urge measures to halt economic decline.
The TUC said Britain was ranked ninth out of 12 EC countries in the OECD
analysis in terms of the percentage of national income spent on training,
temporary work programmes and job subsidies. Spending an estimated 0.56 per
cent of national income last year, Britain ranked only just above Portugal
and Greece. Five EC countries spent nearly twice as much as Britain.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said Britain's job record was a
'cause for national shame'. He added: 'At a time when the government should
be taking action to cut the dole queues, all it appears to be doing is
stoking up rumours about reducing the benefit of the growing number of
long-term unemployed.'
Today's figures are expected to show that the unemployment figure for June
of 2.72m rose by a further 25,000 in July.
Mr John Major has held the first meeting of a UK prime minister with Civil
Service union leaders since 1984, it emerged yesterday.
The discussion at 10 Downing Street, which came after the government
restricted pay rises for high-salaried public servants, is seen by unions as
evidence that Mr Major is taking a less hostile approach to them than his
predecessor.
The last meeting between a prime minister and Civil Service unions came when
the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher defended the union ban at the Government
Communications Headquarters, Cheltenham.
According to the monthly journal of the FDA civil servants association, Mr
Major told general secretaries of the FDA, IPMS and NUCPS unions on July 29
that he regretted the decision to cut rises of up to 24 per cent, as
recommended by the top salaries review body, to 4 per cent. However, he said
many individuals had had pay rises of below 4 per cent and others had
received pay cuts.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Schools chief to resign over opt-out scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF of England's largest metropolitan education authority has
announced his resignation in a protest against the government's policy of
breaking local-authority control over state schools.
Mr David Hammond, chief education officer at Birmingham City Council for the
past 10 years, will not renew his contract when it expires in March. 'I
don't want to be part of a system which will have local government taken out
of education,' he said yesterday.
The government's education white paper, published last month, encourages
schools to opt out of local-authority control and receive their funding
directly from Whitehall.
'I don't believe that I want to be part of this process,' said Mr Hammond,
after reflecting on his position for the past two weeks. His move adds to
the controversy over education in general and the arguments about the state
of the Birmingham education system in particular.
When Mr John Patten, the education secretary, introduced his white paper, he
alleged that Birmingham was 'one of the worst education authorities' in the
country and accused it of 'kidnapping' Pounds 55m from its education budget.
The city council rejected the charges, arguing that many education services
are not run out of the education budget.
This financial year, Birmingham City Council's gross spending on education
will be Pounds 571m, or Pounds 54m more than in 1991-92. So far only three
state schools have opted for grant-maintained status outside local-authority
control, in spite of three years of oppor-tunity.
In the six remaining months of his appointment, Mr Hammond will conduct a
review of the city's education service, looking at, inter alia,
cost-effectiveness and quality. He said that his departure would mean that
'in offering a vision of the future to the city council I am as impartial as
I can be'.
Although Mr Hammond sees some merit in the white paper's suggestions on, for
example, the provision of education to children with special needs, he is
worried about the future of specialist services in the education system
under Mr Patten's planned regime.
Mr Hammond also predicts five years of chaos in the system, noting that
there might be three authorities working in Birmingham. They would be the
city council itself; the funding agency that serves those schools no longer
under local-authority control; and the educational associations planned by
the government for problem schools.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Home computer market 'stagnant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK market for personal computers is stagnant and plummeting prices
appear to have done little to stimulate sales, according to a survey by
Context, a London-based consultancy.
The volume of indirect sales - sales through dealers or high street shops -
increased in the 12 months to June by only 0.5 per cent over the same period
last year, the survey says. In earlier years, sales have grown by more than
20 per cent annually.
The total number of machines sold in the period was just under 800,000.
Indirect sales account for some 75 per cent of all UK sales of personal
computers.
Fierce price cutting has had a powerful effect on revenues. In the same
period, the total value of sales fell 16 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Jeremy Davies, senior partner at Context, said buyers were confused over
technology and prepared to delay purchases to see if prices fell further.
'PC sales have stalled and it is not only the effect of the recession,' he
said.
'At the beginning of the year, buyers were saying 'Why should I buy now? If
I wait six months, I can get more PC for less money.' Six months later, the
same thing is happening again.'
Context's figures do not take into account machines sold directly - by mail
order, for example - but Mr Davies said he estimated the whole market had
grown at most by only a few per cent over the year.

FT  13 AUG 92 / BAA passenger traffic at record 75m in year to July
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, THE airports operator, has had its busiest year on record, with more
than 75m passengers passing through its airports in the 12 months to July, a
rise of 8.2 per cent.
Traffic in July was 11 per cent higher than in July last year, when travel
was depressed after the Gulf war. The gain on July 1990 was 3 per cent.
Mr Mike Hodgkinson, BAA's group airports director, said: 'The figures bear
out our expectations on traffic growth for this financial year of 5 per cent
to 8 per cent. The drop in domestic traffic seems to have bottomed out and
the airport traffic appears to have benefited from price discounting in
holiday markets.' Over the year, the strongest growth in destinations was to
North America and Ireland, both partly deregulated routes.
London's Heathrow remained easily BAA's biggest airport, handling more than
4m people in July, a gain of 10 per cent from a year earlier.
Stansted, London's third airport, where a Pounds 400m terminal was opened
last year, saw a 27.5 per cent rise in the number of passengers to 270,000.
It remained well behind Gatwick, south of London, which handled 2.2m
passengers in July, 7.4 per cent more than a year before. Gatwick saw the
sharpest decline in passengers of BAA's airports after the Gulf war. Traffic
at south-eastern airports grew overall by 10.1 per cent, more slowly than
the company's Scottish airports - Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen - which
saw an improvement of 17.9 per cent. BAA said that the British Open golf
tournament at Muirfield added to traffic at Edinburgh in July.
Freight traffic across the company showed sharper growth of 14.3 per cent
overall to more than 89,000 tonnes. At Stansted, freight of 5,000 tonnes was
more than double the July 1991 figure.
Heathrow continued to dominate cargo, with almost 68,000 tonnes shipped in
July.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Bingham made Master of Rolls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE Bingham, the Appeal Court judge who has just completed an
11-month inquiry into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, was yesterday appointed Master of the Rolls in succession to
Lord Donaldson.
Lord Donaldson retires at the end of next month after 10 years as the most
senior civil court judge in England and Wales.
The BCCI report is expected to be published before Sir Thomas takes up his
new office on September 30.
Sir Thomas, 58, is widely regarded by the legal profession as having one of
the best intellects on the bench and as a radical who is willing to speak
his mind.
In 1989 he was the first judge to speak out strongly in favour of Lord
Mackay's proposed reforms of the legal profession. To the surprise of many
barristers and judges, Sir Thomas said the greatest threat to barristers was
not the reforms but the profession's negative reaction to them.
The rules preventing solicitors from appearing as advocates in the higher
courts were illogical, indefensible and could not be justified, he said.
In marked contrast to the attitude of Lord Donaldson, who warned the Lord
Chancellor to 'get your tanks off my lawn', Sir Thomas dismissed the
suggestions of his fellow judges that Lord Mackay's reforms threatened
judicial independence and were not wanted by the public.
He said: 'We delude ourselves if we suppose there is not a large body of
responsible, middle-of-the-road opinion that regards the legal profession as
riddled with anachronistic conventions and privileges.'
Sir Thomas, the only son of two doctors, was educated at Sedbergh and
Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first in modern history. He was
called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1959 after coming top in the Bar exams
and rapidly earned recognition as one of the brightest commercial lawyers of
his generation and a brilliant advocate.
He took silk at the age of 38 in 1972 and was appointed to the High Court
bench in 1980. In 1986 he was promoted to the Court of Appeal.
He is no stranger to controversy. In 1977 he was appointed by Dr David Owen,
then foreign secretary, to head the inquiry into Rhodesia sanctions-busting
by the big UK oil companies. His report concluded that they had knowingly
violated United Nations sanctions, and that government officials were aware
of that.
In 1982 he conducted an inquiry for the Lord Chancellor into the issues
raised by the contempt-of-court action brought against the government by Ms
Harriet Harman, now Labour MP for Peckham in south London, over
non-disclosure of documents.
During the 1991 Gulf war he was one of the 'three wise men' who reviewed
cases of Arabs facing deportation as security risks.
Lord Justice Bingham is known to share the concerns of the present Master of
the Rolls about the delays and costs of the civil justice system.
Mr Mark Sheldon, president of the Law Society, the solicitors' governing
body, welcomed the appointment, and praised Sir Thomas as 'a lawyer of great
intellect with a reputation for innovation and an open-minded approach to
reform'.
The society hopes that as one of the four designated judges who must decide
on wider rights of audience for solicitors, Sir Thomas will prove a
formidable ally.
The Bar Council, the barristers' ruling body, also welcomed the appointment.
Mr John Rowe QC, vice-chairman, said Sir Thomas was 'forward-looking' and
'likely to bring innovation to civil justice'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAJORITY of res-pondents to the Cadbury committee report on corporate
governance have been 'generally supportive' of the initiative but have
detailed reservations about some of its suggestions.
Staff serving the committee said yesterday that 64 per cent of those who
expressed a view about its recommendations were in that category. Among them
were the Confederation of British Industry which, while supporting the
report in principle, objected to the enforcement mechanisms suggested by the
committee.
An analysis of the 70 responses to the report, prepared by committee staff,
showed that only 16 per cent of respondents opposed its recommendations,
against 20 per cent who were were 'very supportive'.
The committee, known informally by the name of its chairman, Sir Adrian
Cadbury, issued a draft report in May recommending a code of best practice
to be followed by corporate boards of directors.
The code, which is voluntary, is intended to improve the performance and
financial reporting of companies.
Aspects of the report have been criticised by those who will be most
affected by them. Some leading industrialists say that the report has gone
too far, while some institutional shareholders have objected that it does
not go far enough.
Staff serving the Cadbury committee said that a significant minority of
respondents - 25 out of 70 - expressed no general view about the proposals
as a whole, but simply offered comments about aspects of the report.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Watchdog warns on loan loss provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES have been asked by the Building Societies Commission, the
industry watchdog, to consider ways of tightening up their provisions
against loan losses.
The move is likely to squeeze building society profits further by forcing
societies to put more money aside at a time when they are already suffering
from the decline in house sales.
Mr Harry Walsh, deputy chairman of the Building Societies Commission, has
written to the Building Societies Association asking for its views on new
guidelines on provisions after consulting its members.
This is the second year in succession in which the commission has tried to
introduce guidelines for loan loss provisions as a result of the deepening
troubles of the mortgage market. Before 1990, loan losses were usually so
small that the definition of building society provisions was not an issue.
Last year societies were forced to put aside a total of Pounds 1.23bn
against bad loans, and the figure for the coming year is expected to be
higher. About half a dozen societies, including Town &amp; Country and
Leamington Spa, have been driven into pre-tax losses and been forced to give
up their independence after having to make heavy provisions against bad
loans.
Last year the commission's guidelines encouraged societies to make specific
provisions for losses on residential mortgages for all cases where payments
are more than three months in arrears and it is virtually certain that the
lender will make a loss.
Most societies also make general provisions against likely losses on their
mortgage book as a whole. They also 'suspend' interest on loans with a low
chance of recovery, thus reducing the value of the interest receivable on
their accounts. Methods for doing so vary greatly between so-cieties.
The commission says it wants a standard method of recognising the interest
due on non-performing loans and the formal adoption of a three-month cut-off
point for specific provision and of a standard definition of arrears. It
also wants societies to consider methods of security valuation.
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest building society, said it was
cutting rates for its 3.2m savers by an average 0.3 per cent from Saturday.
The move follows similar cuts by Nationwide and Bradford &amp; Bingley and
suggests that large societies are determined to stave off any increase in
mortgage interest rates for as long as possible.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Societies braced for poor figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES are bracing themselves for what may be the worst month's
figures for their savings business for six years.
Although the figures on the flow of funds in and out of societies during
July are not due to be published until August 26, the industry now accepts
that they will be the worst monthly figures so far this year and will show a
heavy outflow of funds.
Mr Adrian Coles, economist at the Building Societies Association, said: 'The
outflow is going to be pretty large. I think it will be at least as large as
the one we had in June, which was Pounds 314m, and may well be larger,
though it may not be quite as high as Pounds 500m.'
The July outflow is virtually certain to drive building societies into a
loss for their retail funding during the first seven months of the year.
There were net inflows of only Pounds 260m in the first quarter and Pounds
77m in the second quarter.
Severe competition from National Savings and gilts is blamed by the
societies for attracting savers away from them. Large deposits held by
sophisticated savers with smaller societies that pay high rates of interest
have proved particularly volatile, as their savers have been quick to move
them into National Savings products.
The government has already cut rates paid on National Savings products in
response to protests from societies that they would otherwise have no option
but to raise both their saving and lending rates.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the Cheshire-based trade finance house owned by Mr Muhammad Naviede which
collapsed a year ago - was arrested yesterday at his Manchester home by City
of London police, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
He was charged at Bishopsgate police station with obtaining property by
deception and dishonestly obtaining services. Mr Smithson's arrest follows a
year-long investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into Arrows. Mr Naviede
was charged last August with obtaining Pounds 10m by deception from ABN Bank
of the Netherlands. The money was lent to Arrows for stock-financing
operations for its corporate customers, but is alleged to have found its way
into property investments that then suffered in the recession.
Total debts of more than 80 companies and single-purpose trusts connected
with Arrows have been put at about Pounds 220m by Mr Scott Martin and Mr
Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young, the group's liquidator. There is a
shortfall of about Pounds 100m and Arrows' own debts are understood to total
Pounds 113m. Creditors include 35 banks or building societies.
Mr Smithson was remanded on bail until October 21 on condition he live at
home, surrender his passport and pilot's licence and enter an aircraft only
as a fare-paying passenger on an internal UK flight. Mr Naviede is already
on Pounds 400,000 bail and has had to surrender his passport and pilot's
licence.

</HEADLINE>

   CAIRO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US AGREEMENT on Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees for Israel
brought warnings yesterday that it could endanger the Middle East peace
process and an indication that the administration might be willing to
proceed with a Saudi Arabian request for a Dollars 5bn military aircraft
order.
In Washington, efforts began in Congress almost immediately to extract
concessions from President George Bush on other issues, in order to
facilitate speedy passage of the loan agreement. Senator Christopher Bond
urged the administration to proceed with the sale of additional F-15 fighter
aircraft to Saudi Arabia and warned that 40,000 jobs, the majority of them
in his home state of Missouri, could be at stake if Riyadh's request was not
approved.
A US official said later that the president was seriously considering the
sale, which had been requested last year. He denied that further
consideration of the sale was linked to the loans guarantee agreement with
Israel.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was quick to fire a warning shot
across the bows of any scheme to sell additional F-15s to Saudi Arabia. 'No
official or responsible politician in Israel can but oppose the sale of arms
to an Arab country that continues to stress that it is in a state of war
with Israel,' he told a lunch at the press club in Washington.
He said that although people argued that Saudi Arabia was an ally of the US,
Israel remembered that positive views had been expressed about the
intentions of President Saddam Hussein only a few months before Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
Mr Rabin was also worried by reports that it would be the F-15E that might
be sold to Saudi Arabia, an aircraft more advanced that those supplied to
Israel.
Saudi Arabia has asked for up to 62 F-15 aircraft as part of its military
expansion programme following the defeat of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Saudi
officials have warned privately that if the US was unable to meet the order
it might have to turn to Britain for additional Tornado aircraft.
Meanwhile, Palestinians have charged the administration with bias for
providing the loan guarantees needed by Israel in its attempts to absorb a
flood of Soviet immigrants.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, said that 'if the loan
guarantees are given while settlement activities are continuing, then this
invalidates the role of the US as a peace broker'.
Negative Arab reaction can be seen partly as posturing ahead of the
resumption of peace talks with Israel in Washington later this month. Arab
officials have indicated greater understanding in private of domestic
pressures on both Mr Rabin and Mr Bush.
Congressional leaders have told Mr Bush there is no prospect of the loan
guarantees being approved before September, and there are still doubts over
whether Mr Bush and Mr Rabin agreed that the cost of completing houses
already under construction in the occupied territories should be deducted
from the total amount the US will guar-antee.
Israel sought yesterday to reinforce its claims that it was doing all it
could to rein in settlements by announcing a freeze on house purchases in
Arab East Jerusalem. It also announced that apartments acquired by the
Housing Ministry under the previous pro-settlement Likud government would
not be renovated.
Israel's cabinet strongly condemned earlier this week a move by about 15
Jewish families into seven houses purchased in the Moslem quarter of the
walled city.
The Bush administration had refused to provide the loan guarantees - needed
by Israel to borrow at preferential rates internationally - to the outgoing
government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir because of its refusal to stop building
settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war.
Full details of the agreement reached by Mr Rabin and Mr Bush at the
president's Kennebunkport holiday retreat have not been divulged but the
Israeli leader intimated they had reached private understanding after some
difficult discussions.

REPORTS from an Iraqi opposition group that President Saddam Hussein was
again massing troops on the border with Kuwait were denied yesterday by the
US.
The Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued a statement
from its Damascus office claiming that tank, artillery and infantry
battalions of the Republican Guard had been deployed in the Safwan area of
the border.
'Our position is that the story is untrue,' a spokesman for the Defence
Department said in Washington.
Up to 5,000 US marines and other troops this week began manoeuvres with
Kuwaiti forces expected to last for up to two months, with some of the war
games taking place just to the south of Safwan.
If the reports from Damascus had been correct the opposing forces would be
almost within sight of each other.
Earlier, Maj Gen Robert Frix, the commander of the US forces in Kuwait, said
the military strength available to him was more than enough to deal with any
threat from Iraq.
President Saddam Hussein promised great efforts yesterday to improve Iraq's
sanctions-ravaged economy and warned that corrupt officials would be dealt
with harshly, apparently meaning they could be executed, AP reports from
Nicosia.
In a speech broadcast on radio and television, he criticised the performance
of his ministers in dealing with Iraq's plight under the two-year UN
embargo.

THE TRANSFER of Mr James Baker from the US State Department to effective
control of President George Bush's re-election campaign may be announced
within the next 24 hours.
Mr Bush refused to confirm or deny what he called 'press speculation' about
his secretary of state and long-time confidant in a television interview on
Tuesday night. But several officials said yesterday the announcement could
come today or tomorrow.
It is not clear whether Mr Baker will resign as secretary of state formally,
or merely step aside for the duration of the campaign.
In either event, it is likely that his deputy, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, will
take over the formal reins of foreign policy. No confirmation hearings by
Congress would be required for this move until after the election.
It is increasingly assumed that Mr Baker will operate from the
administration, probably as a special counsellor, rather than the campaign
organisation. This would get round a provision of the 1989 Ethics Act that
restricts communications between past and present members of the government.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, a prominent Washington lawyer and political insider, noted
in a column in the Washington Post this week that the provision could have
prevented Mr Baker from talking to other cabinet members about policy
issues.

recovery in the economy, Terry Hall writes from Wellington. The country
recorded a deficit of NZDollars 329m (Pounds 93m) in the year to March. This
compared with a deficit of NZDollars 2bn for the previous year. While
imports rose during the March quarter, exports continued to soar and the
trade surplus for the year to March rose to a record NZDollars 3.55bn.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Bush interview underlines rift over abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Republican party's divisions over abortion were underlined on Tuesday
night when President George Bush expressed much less hard-line opposition to
it than does his party's platform committee.
In a television interview, Mr Bush was asked a similar question to that put
to Vice-President Dan Quayle last month: What advice would he give his
grand-daughter, should she become pregnant and want an abortion?
Like Mr Quayle, who was subsequently 'corrected' by his wife, Mr Bush
responded that, although he was offended by the very idea of abortion and
would try to talk his grand-daughter out of it, the decision ultimately was
hers and he would stand by her.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate and a believer in
freedom of reproductive choice, said he understood Mr Bush's position 'as a
grand-father'.
Other Democrats criticised it, charging that Mr Bush and Mr Quayle seemed to
want rights for their own families that would be denied to others by a ban
on abortion.
The president's comments, although repeatedly qualified by his campaign
aides after the interview was broadcast, is in sharp contrast with both the
sentiments and actions expressed by the party committee, preparing the
platform for the Republican party's convention next week in Houston, and
with many of Mr Bush's public pronouncements on the issue.
The committee overwhelmingly voted that the platform should again contain,
as it has since 1980, a demand for a constitutional amendment banning
abortion. It did so after an emotional debate in which many delegates
recounted personal experiences with the consequences of abortion.
Many demanded there should be no exemptions to an outright ban, even in
cases where pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.
Republican pro-choice advocates, increasingly vocal but outnumbered on the
committee by the pro-life movement, conceded there was little chance of
forcing a floor debate at the convention. This can now only be achieved if a
majority of the delegates from six states sign a motion to this effect.
However, a Washington Post poll of Republican delegates found 55 per cent
opposing a constitutional ban and only 28 per cent in favour.
Elsewhere, the debate over 'family values' continued to rage. In California,
the American Bar Association convention abandoned its previous neutrality
and passed a motion pledging to fight any laws restricting the
constitutional right to an abortion.
Mr Quayle attacked the ABA, charging that the country's trial lawyers were
'in the pocket' of Mr Clinton.
The convention earlier had given an award to Professor Anita Hill, whose
charges of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas, now in the
Supreme Court, gripped the nation last year.
Mr Quayle asserted that most Americans believed Judge Thomas, not Professor
Hill.

FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Mexican needs create a
job-making pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEEDS of yesterday's Nafta agreement were sown at the end of 1989 as
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari travelled from Europe
empty-handed after a disappointing tour aimed at raising foreign investment.
He had won praise for economic reforms he had initiated, but won few pledges
of investment. His first overtures to US President George Bush on a Nafta
came just days after flying back to Mexico City.
Nafta's origins are important to recall, as European and Asian trading
partners wring their hands over whether the agreement will create a
'Fortress America' in a world increasingly divided by trade blocs. While
there are worrying protectionist elements to the agreement - most
conspicuously in cars, textiles and sugar - it would be wrong to conclude
yet that it pushes the US down a slippery slope towards protectionism.
President Salinas's aims could not have been further from those of
protectionism. He aimed to use the agreement to lock in the Mexican economic
reforms of the past seven years. More important, he wanted the agreement to
act as a magnet for urgently-needed foreign investment - not just from the
US, but also from Europe and Asia.
Already, these aims have borne fruit. In the first half of 1992, foreign
investors brought Dollars 5.52bn into Mexico - an increase of 3.8 per cent
over the first half of 1991.
For all of 1991, Dollars 10bn flowed into Mexico, double the 1990 level,
according to the Mexican trade ministry. The US is the leading foreign
investor, accounting for over 60 per cent. Britain ranks second, with a 6.5
per cent share, and Germany follows with 5.8 per cent. Canada ranks ninth.
When Mr Salinas took office in December 1988, he set a goal of Dollars 24bn
in foreign investment for his six-year administration. By late June, just
over halfway through his term, Dollars 23.31bn or 97 per cent of the target
had been met.
President Bush's agenda has always been more complex. He sought security in
Central and South America; he sought to enhance US business competitiveness
in the face of increasing Japanese success in the US; he sought to boost US
exports.
Nafta could be seen as a first step to a wider trading region encompassing
all the Americas.
Business leaders in the US - particularly those in the politically important
western and southern states, such as California and Texas, which border
Mexico - have been enthusiastic supporters of a deal: 'The North American
Free Trade Agreement is a match made in heaven,' said Arizona's Republican
Congressman Jim Kolbe.
But the northern car-making states of Michigan and Ohio, and the
textile-producing states, have had strong reservations. Both fear jobs will
be lost to Mexico as companies relocate south of the border. They fear
Mexico will be used as a springboard for cheap Asian imports to the US. Mr
Bush's advisers have told him the deal will generate more jobs than it will
lose, and that there will be significant gains in exports to Mexico. A study
by the Institute for International Economics in Washington predicted a net
gain of 130,000 jobs for the US by 1995, and of more than 600,000 for
Mexico. Exports would be boosted by Dollars 16.7bn.
These figures, plus polls indicating the agreement will be a vote-winner in
the US presidential election in November, underpinned the intensive spurt of
negotiations during the past two weeks. They give Mrs Carla Hills, US Trade
Representative, an important role in Mr Bush's re-election campaign.
US domestic political forces have driven the timetable to a Nafta agreement,
but it would be wrong to conclude that its aims are over-ridingly
protectionist - even though it panders to powerful domestic industrial
lobbies. Only 42 per cent of total US, Canadian and Mexican exports stay
within the proposed Nafta, and only 28 per cent of US exports went to Mexico
and Canada in 1991 - proportions likely to change only slowly once the
agreement comes into force in 1994.
US officials have argued consistently that successful completion of a Nafta
could not be seen as a substitute for the wider objective that still eludes
Mr Bush - successful completion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation. Indeed, they have argued that a Uruguay Round agreement will
underpin the Nafta.

political agenda
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL trade, above all Nafta, is an issue which has never quite
taken off in this year's long primary and presidential campaigns.
Yesterday's signing of the agreement threatens to change that, for the
moment at least.
President George Bush will be able to proclaim Nafta as another example of
his international statesmanship, conveniently obscuring the fact that his
administration has been unable to bring to pass a successful conclusion of
the broader Uruguay round of trade negotiations.
Coming on top of recent summits with the Russian and Israeli leaders and
with Middle East peace talks about to resume here, the image of a president
on top of foreign affairs can be presented to offset the lack of solutions
to what is happening in the Balkans and with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Yet the
biggest plus for Mr Bush may be in the extent to which Mr Bill Clinton, his
Democratic opponent for the presidency, is caught on a political hook on
which he can only wriggle.
Yesterday Mr Clinton issued statements almost identical to his last
pronouncement on Nafta two weeks ago. He reserved judgment on the treaty
itself, pending study of its details and whatever emerges from Congressional
hearings. But he repeated that he would support it 'so long as it provides
adequate protection for workers, farmers and the environment on both sides
of the border.' He added that 'we must have strong transition strategies
that ensure workers benefit from a more open world trading system.'
Mr Clinton has been trying to reduce the Democratic Party's dependence on
those of its constituent parts, such as organised labour, which have long
been associated with outright protectionism. To this end, he began his quest
for the White House by supporting the Nafta goals and the 'fast track'
approach to it, whereby Congress can only vote on the agreement, not amend
it.
The failure of Mr Clinton's Democratic opponents, and of Mr Patrick Buchanan
on the Republican side and Ross Perot, the defunct independent, proved
protectionism had only limited political appeal in the primaries. But as the
Nafta negotiations have moved to a climax, opposition to it, concentrated in
the Democratic Party, has become more focused and vocal.
In particular it has brought back to the fore Congressman Richard Gephardt
of Missouri, who ran for the Democratic nomination four years ago on a
blatantly protectionist platform. Some of Mr Gephardt's criticisms of Nafta
have reportedly been run past Mr Clinton.
Mr Clinton still felt free two weeks ago to condemn 'the outdated rhetoric
of both the free traders who are oblivious to workers and the environment
and the protectionists who ignore the benefits of expanded world trade.' He
associated Mr Gephardt with the same sentiments.
This is a fine line to walk and further qualification of his earlier stand
invites not only Republican attack. In a recent editorial entitled 'a test
of Mr Clinton's backbone,' the New York Times wrote that he 'will have to
choose between the protectionist policies of old and his own campaign
promises.'
In theory Mr Clinton can wait, since Congress will not vote on Nafta until
next year. He may try to confine himself to promising to change what he does
not like if he becomes president. His opposition and the media are unlikely
to allow him that luxury.

FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Sector's political
sensitivity dictates protection levels - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE is perhaps the most politically sensitive sector in all three
North American countries, with each seeking to maintain protection levels
for key areas, write Damian Fraser and Bernard Simon.
The Americans have successfully gained 15-year transition periods for what
powerful US farm lobbyists consider their most vulnerable crops, including
sugar, citrus and other fruits and vegetables.
The Mexicans have agreed to eliminate import licences, which covered 25 per
cent of US agricultural exports last year. However, they have acquired a
15-year grace period for corn, beans and powdered milk.
Under the treaty Mexico has been promised free sugar exports to the US after
15 years - a significant concession given the current level of protection
for the US sugar industry.
In the first six years Mexico will be granted either its current quota of
7,258 metric tonnes, or the difference between Mexico's production and
consumption, up to a maximum of 25,000 tonnes.
After year seven this limit will be increased to 150,000 tonnes, increasing
by 10 per cent a year for the next eight years.
All export limits will be eliminated if Mexico is a net exporter for two
consecutive years. Mexico is now a net importer.
In corn (maize) Mexico has achieved a similar deal. It will let in,
duty-free, a quota of 2.5m tonnes in the first year, growing by 3 per cent a
year over the next 15 years. At the same time tariffs on non-quota corn will
start at more than 200 per cent and gradually fall over the 15 years.
Similar arrangements govern Mexico's imports of milk and beans.
The corn sector employs more than 2m Mexicans, most of whom are desperately
poor. Nevertheless, the government has long maintained that the current
method of protection - through import restrictions and artificially high
prices - is inefficient, since it benefits the few rich farmers more than
the poorer ones.
The Mexican government is likely to announce soon a targeted subsidy
programme, where money will be directed almost exclusively at the poorest
corn farmers.
Under Nafta Canada will be allowed to retain the non-tariff protection
enjoyed by its dairy, poultry and egg producers. This consists of production
quotas and subsidies, together with import quotas.
The 'supply-management' system is coming under increasing pressure, however,
as local food processors and Canada's trading partners push for the import
barriers to be lowered.

<TEXT>
A GROUP of arch-conservative managers of large Russian enterprises are
expected to call today for a reversal of government economic policies at a
time when opponents of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, are
setting a date for his removal.
The Industrial Union, a parliamentary faction headed by Mr Yuri Gekht, who
has long opposed the government's radical reforms, has invited 2,000 plant
managers to Moscow to endorse an alternative reform agenda and demand a new
government.
Claiming the present cabinet's policies will bankrupt 'most enterprises',
they want more support for heavy industry and state farming, more credits
from the central bank, wage increases, price controls and the maintenance of
a 10-year ban on the resale of farm land.
Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the bigger Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, who also has political ambitions, may speak at the meeting
even though he considers his organisation to be more progressive than Mr
Gekht's.
Significantly, a spokesman for President Boris Yeltsin went out of his way
yesterday to stress that the Russian leader would not attend - as if to
distance his boss from this particular industrial lobby.
Mr Yeltsin, on holiday, has given no hint he plans further cabinet changes,
but he is under increasing pressure to abandon radical reforms. He also
feels let down by the west which has so far delivered less assistance for
his reforms than he had expected when he launched them.
An assistant to Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, who believes a new
government is needed, predicted yesterday there would be a change of cabinet
on September 20, when Mr Yeltsin returns from a trip to Japan and parliament
reconvenes.
The Civic Union, a centrist grouping of three opposition parties headed
respectively by Mr Rutskoi, Mr Volsky, and Mr Nikolai Travkin, a worker
turned politician, also plans to present the government with an ultimatum in
mid-September to either resign or change course.
The Russian government has drawn up contingency plans for electric power
cuts for the 12 months beginning October 1, Itar-Tass news agency said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Tass said the plan envisaged possible
cuts of up to 25 per cent of overall daily consumption. Cuts could also
reach 20 per cent during peak demand. 'This has been done to ensure the
stable work of power systems if critical shortages of electricity arise,' it
said, quoting the deputy chairman of the electric power committee.
The report gave no explanation of why power cuts may be needed. But general
chaos in the Russian economy, shortfalls in energy production and cutbacks
in nuclear power development have all taken their toll.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, leader of Georgia and former Soviet foreign
minister, yesterday signalledhis intention to use force againstrebels
holding his interior minister hostage, reports John Lloyd from Moscow.
The move comes after the collapse of an offer of reconciliation - rejected
on Tuesday - and is prompted by the increasing impatience of the Georgian
military and security forces with Mr Shevardnadze's previous efforts to
avoid using violence against the supporters of former President Zviad
Gamsakhurdia.
Mr Roman Zventsadze, the interior minister, was captured in the city of
Zugdidi - a stronghold of the Gamsakhurdia supporters - together with an
aide of Mr Shevardnadze and other officials.
In a midnight address to the nation, Mr Shevardnadze, known for his emotive
language when foreign minister, said 'I think that right now the question of
'to be or not to be', whether good or evil will win out, will be resolved. I
will work with you (the people) and fight to overcome the forces of evil.'
He claimed to have 'failed' in underestimating the capacity for malice of
the rebels - and disclosed that he had offered to resign as head of the
ruling State Council - an offer refused by his colleagues.
A botched coup attempt by therebels involving the capture of the main TV
station was put down last month when troops stormed the building.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Row over refugees places UK presidency under fire

A ROW over Britain's deportation of some refugees fleeing from the former
Yugoslavia seems likely to add to irritation in other European capitals
about UK policies during its EC presidency.
Britain's Foreign Office yesterday admitted embarrassment over action by the
Home Office, which handles immigration policy, to send back to other
European countries this year 36 Yugoslavs seeking asylum in the UK.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees called on Britain yesterday
to stop the deportations.
British diplomats are worried that apparent insensitivity over Yugoslav
refugees may hamper the UK's ability to give a lead in other EC policy
areas.
There is particular concern about adding to resentment in Germany - which is
playing host to 200,000 refugees - about unequal sharing of burdens caused
by the Yugoslav war.
Baroness Chalker, UK overseas development minister, yesterday met Mr Charles
Wardle, Home Office minister, to point out the diplomatic repercussions of
the deportations. One UK official said there had been 'a fairly brisk
exchange of words with the Home Office.'
Mr Wardle did his best to play down the affair, pointing out that 2,000
Yugoslav applications for refugee status were under consideration. Only
applicants who had spent considerable time in another country before coming
to Britain would be removed, he said.
Mr Wardle said the Dublin Convention required refugees to seek refuge in the
first safe country they reach. 'We are interpreting that sympathetically,'
he said.
The Home Office added that, of the 36 deportations this year, only eight had
taken place in July, instead of the 36 first reported.
Austria and Hungary, the two countries most affected by refugees, yesterday
intensified their calls for European solidarity. 'We want an equitable share
of this problem. Hungary is already overstretched,' the foreign ministry in
Budapest said.
'All European countries must take their share of the refugees,' an Austrian
foreign ministry official said, expressing surprise at Britain's treatment
of refugees.
Signs of general vexation over Britain's handling of the EC presidency have
appeared above all in the German press. Recent articles have complained
about UK determination to give priority to British interests.
Bonn, however, has distanced itself from the criticisms. France, which has
also come under fire from Germany for its relative inactivity over Yugoslav
refugees, has not joined in any noticable anti-British sniping.
Members of the European parliament were fiercely critical of the British
presidency at their meeting on the Yugoslav crisis on Monday, asking if the
British government was up to the task it had been set.
But British diplomats point out that the EC presidency will always have
difficulty in reconciling the conflicting demands of presidential
impartiality and national interest.
One senior British diplomat pointed out yesterday that the presidency's
ability to change the course of Community affairs was limited: 'A presidency
can move the boat within the stream, and in that case it has some influence
over the direction of the boat. But if it goes out of the mainstream, as the
Dutch did this time last year (with unpopular proposals on political union),
then it runs aground. I don't think we've run aground.'
The EC is stepping up efforts to make sure that the embargo on trade with
Serbia and Montenegro is tightly enforced, Andrew Hills reports from
Brussels.
The Commission yesterday tabled a plan to ensure that EC exports to other
former Yugoslav republics reach their destinations and are not diverted to
the two republics under embargo.
Under the plan EC exports to ex-Yugoslav republics will be subject to a
triple control. Exporters will not receive the usual export licence, unless
they have an import licence and a commitment from the local authorities to
check that the goods are delivered. If they cannot provide proof of delivery
then new export licences will not be granted. It is hoped the rules will
come into force on Monday.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Manufacturers report falls in output and export orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC and overseas demand for manufactured goods failed to live up to
post-election expectations in all but one region of the UK.
Manufacturers in almost every region also reported a fall in output over the
past four months and all reported continuing job losses in a survey which
showed that southern England and the West Midlands remain the areas worst
affected by the recession.
According to the latest survey of regional trends from the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) and Business Strategies Limited (BSL), the decline in
orders since April was due to worse-than-expected export orders and a sharp
decline in demand for intermediate goods.
Northern Ireland was the only region to experience an increase in demand for
manufactured goods. It was also one of only three regions - the others being
the East Midlands and East Anglia - to report a slight rise in output,
against eight that expected an improvement when last surveyed in April.
The outlook for employment remained grim, with manufacturing job losses
reported in every region. The fastest falls were in the West Midlands, the
north-west, south-west and south-east, but the rate of job shedding eased in
Wales, East Anglia and the East Midlands.
Official figures out today are expected to show there was another big rise
in unemployment in July. Yesterday, the Alfred Marks Bureau, an employment
agency, said vacancies for full-time jobs fell by 8 per cent in July
compared with a year ago.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the survey showed
that British business was losing hope. 'There is no point ranking each
region to see which is doing worst. The key point of this survey is that all
regions are in trouble,' he said.
The CBI and BSL pointed out that earlier expectations of rising orders of
intermediate goods proved misplaced. A recovery in such goods, which are
used as inputs by other industries, is a frequent development at the
beginning of an upturn. In fact, regions with a high concentration of
companies manufacturing intermediate goods, such as chemicals and metals,
suffered the most disappointing falls in output. These included the north
and Yorkshire and Humberside.
Scotland, the region with the smallest proportion of intermediate goods
manufacturers, fared better than other regions, while Wales, due to its good
export performance, was also less badly affected.

FT  13 AUG 92 / N American free trade deal opens up 'new era': US, Canada
and Mexico agree on pact after 14 months of negotiations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORTH AMERICAN leaders yesterday hailed the completion of negotiations to
bring together the US, Canada and Mexico as one of the world's two largest
free trade areas.
President George Bush said a 'new era' opened up with the historic
agreement, creating a powerful trading zone of 360m consumers and annual
economic output worth about Dollars 6,000bn.
Its formation has been spurred on by plans to widen free trade in western
Europe, with the eventual setting up of a 19-nation European Economic Area
of 380m consumers. It reflects North American worries about the deadlock in
the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation and concern about
the possible emergence of an inward-looking 'Fortress Europe'.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was stitched together in 14
months of talks, ending with 10 days of intense parlaying in a Washington
hotel. The US pressed for completion in time for the Republican party
convention which will re-nominate Mr Bush for president next week.
Appearing in the White House rose garden with Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade
representative, Mr Bush said Nafta was 'part of my long-term economic growth
plan'. He said booming trade with Mexico had already created 600,000 US jobs
and more would be created.
Nafta will phase out tariffs and other trade barriers between the US, Canada
and Mexico over 15 years and is expected to lead to restructuring of whole
industries.
It is an unprecedented 'mixed marriage' linking two industrialised powers
with a third world nation. It joins the capital, technology and creativity
of the US and Canada with the cheap labour and resources of Mexico.
But Nafta still has to be approved by the legislatures of all three
countries and it faces some strong opposition, especially in Canada and
among US congressmen who fear loss of jobs to Mexico and lower environmental
standards.
Mr Bush said Nafta broke new ground for trade pacts by including 'stringent
provisions' on the environment. But he gave no promise of retraining or
assistance programmes for the thousands of US workers - mostly high-wage
factory workers - likely to lose their jobs as companies are drawn south to
the Mexico-US border area.
Under Nafta, Mexico for the first time will open its market to US cars,
light trucks and motor vehicle parts. After 15 years, the agreement will
guarantee total market access in agriculture.
It is the first trade agreement to eliminate quotas on textiles among its
parties. It is also the first to create free trade in services, opening
Mexico's telecoms and insurance markets.
In a vigorous defence of Nafta, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of
Mexico said it would generate more jobs and better pay for Mexicans. But the
benefits would not come immediately, he warned. Nafta was not a 'magic
formula to resolve all our problems', he said.
Nafta reflects a radical change in Mexico's economic and foreign policy in
the past five years. Once deeply suspicious of both the US and free trade,
Mexico is now embracing both.
Mr Salinas said the treaty would make Mexico one of the centres of the world
economy.
Mr Michael Wilson, Canadian trade minister, called the Nafta deal a 'very
good agreement' for his country. But many Canadians blame the three-year-old
US-Canada free trade agreement for job losses and other economic ills and
fear a further shake-up from the wider pact with Mexico.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Croats and Serbs want Bosnia made UN protectorate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CROAT and Serb leaders yesterday called for Bosnia-Hercegovina to be made a
United Nations protectorate, challenging the republic's right to exist as an
independent state.
The proposal, made by Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, and supported by Mr
Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, confirms persistent reports that
Croat and Serb leaders, despite their own mutual hostility, are conspiring
to carve up Bosnia.
'Croatia and Serbia want to take away all power from the legitimate
government of Bosnia so as to divide the republic among each other,' a
western diplomat said.
Bosnia's Serbs, backed by the former Yugoslav federal army, control more
than 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, while Croatia now controls a swathe
of territory in Hercegovina, in the west of the former Yugoslav republic.
A resolution authorising 'all measures necessary' to deliver humanitarian
aid to Sarajevo and 'other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina' - UN shorthand for
potential use of force - is expected to be passed today by a big majority in
the Security Council. Last night Russia joined the US, Britain, France and
Belgium in sponsoring the resolution. China is likely to abstain.
A second resolution, under the same sponsorship, would have the Security
Council strongly condemning the practice of 'ethnic cleansing', in which
tens of thousands of Moslems have been forced out of the republic.
UN diplomats in New York said they would continue to oppose attempts by
Croatia and Serbia to divide Bosnia - populated by Moslems, Serbs and Croats
 -into ethnically-based cantons.
But they conceded that the Serb policy of 'ethnic cleansing' would make it
easier for Croatia and Serbia to annex parts of Bosnia 'over time'.
'We are talking about the breaking up of a state,' a UN diplomat said. 'We
cannot endorse it. The question is if we can stop it.'
UN protectorate status might not necessarily facilitate the restoration of
Bosnia's original ethnic make-up or the return of the refugees.
The diplomat said Croatia was doing 'exactly what Serbia is doing'. Both
republics had 'grabbed land. Both are accusing Moslems of setting up an
Islamic fundamentalist state in Bosnia. Both are blaming the Moslems for
obstructing any so-called peace talks'. This is because Croatia and Serbia
have nearly achieved what they wanted from the war in Bosnia and are now in
a position to sue for peace, he said.
Mr Tudjman, who yesterday was sworn in as president after his Croatian
Democratic Union was swept into power in last month's elections, said: 'In
Bosnia-Hercegovina, there are tendencies to create an Islamic state in
Europe . . . this is a world problem, and both Europe and the UN will have
to deal with it.'
Mr Tudjman added that he was 'not personally disinclined' to make Bosnia a
UN protectorate 'in order to reach an end to the war'.
Yesterday, Mr Karadzic asked the UN to place the northern city of Bihac  -
which Serbs have been attacking - under a protectorate. He had suggested
last month that the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, besieged by Serbian forces
since April, also be placed under a UN protectorate.
In an announcement possibly aimed at thwarting international military action
against Serbian forces, Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister of Yugoslavia -
comprising Serbia and Montenegro - said in Ankara that Bosnia would be
granted recognition. But he did not give a date.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the London stock market fell again yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index of the
UK's most highly-valued companies notched up a depressing statistic, having
fallen for seven consecutive trading days, the longest consecutive fall
since it was established at the start of 1984. Yesterday, the index dropped
6.5 points to 2,303.1, making a slide of 117 points since the close of
trading on August 3 and taking it to its lowest level since February, 15,
1991. On foreign exchanges, the dollar fell further against the D-Mark
despite Tuesday's intervention, dragging sterling lower. The pound was also
unsettled by rumours that the chancellor, Norman Lamont, was resigning.

FT  13 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Manoplax boost for Boots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that its heart drug Manoplax has received UK approval lifted Boots,
taking the shares up 7 to 429p. Although Manoplax has been in tests for
three years, a setback at the beginning of the trial period had left
analysts somewhat cynical.
However, yesterday's announcement raised hopes that other approving
authorities could soon follow suit, with the lucrative US market high on the
agenda.
Estimates vary as to how much Manoplax might be worth to Boots. While the UK
market is likely to bring in around Pounds 10m a year from next year, US
approval could mean Pounds 100m a year by 1997. Mr Nick Hawkins at Kleinwort
Benson said that the news, together with firm retail sales and recent
selling pressure, meant that the shares were good value.
Queens Moat falls
Improved profits and an increased dividend failed to halt a slide in the
shares of Queens Moat Houses as the hotel group surprised the market by
disclosing an unexpected jump in debt levels. The company undermined
sentiment further by stating it intended to pursue opportunities in the
German hotel market, which may involve additional capital expenditure.
'The borrowing position has caused giant disappointment,' said Mr Bruce
Jones at Smith New Court. 'The figures were fine and the depreciation policy
positive. But they have created a credibility and sentiment problem and won
few friends.'
Mr Mark Finnie at County NatWest argued that Queens Moat may need a cash
call within the next two years if it fails to contain debt levels.
'Expansion is something the market does not want to hear about at the
moment,' he said.
However, Kleinwort Benson painted a more positive view. Analyst Mr Paul
Slattery said worries over the debt position had been overdone and pointed
to the 'dramatic growth' in trading profits. Kleinwort has pulled its
full-year forecast back Pounds 7m to Pounds 93m, with County on Pounds
94.5m, Paribas on Pounds 94m and Smith on Pounds 95m. Queens Moat shares
tumbled 8 to 57p with 6.2m traded.
CU pleases
Insurer Commercial Union (CU) was a strong performer after a set of interim
results that surprised the market. The shares rose 8 to 443p.
The company was still in deficit over the first half, but its loss narrowed
to Pounds 18.1m from Pounds 26.3m. The forecast was for a loss of between
Pounds 19m and Pounds 35m. There was some disappointment that the dividend
was merely maintained at 9.25p but Mr Steven Bird, insurance analyst with
Smith New Court, raised his current-year forecast to break-even from a
Pounds 20m loss, and improved his 1993 estimate by Pounds 14m to Pounds
130m, arguing that the stock 'remains the prime buy in the sector'.
Burmah firm
Oil group Burmah Castrol was one of the stronger performers in the market,
receiving encouragement from a couple of positive pieces of research.
Securities house Smith New Court put the stock on its buy list ahead of
interim results on September 3. Analyst Mr Nick Clayton said the stock was
at a 16 per cent P/E discount to the market and that the shares were
attractive up to 600p. Also, Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken put out an internal buy
note, saying that Burmah was: 'A good solid company that is now back to a
reasonable rating.' The shares closed 18 higher at 543p.
Saatchi wanted
Advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi rose sharply as investment houses in the
US and UK turned positive on the stock following an encouraging set of
results. The shares jumped 14 to 150p.
In London, SG Warburg Securities upgraded its short-term recommendation to
buy from hold and increased its full-year profit forecast to Pounds 21.5m
from Pounds 17.5m. Meanwhile, in New York, Smith Barney published a buy
recommendation after hosting a meeting between potential investors and
Saatchi executives in the US.
Drug group Wellcome fell 4 to 778p as Robert Fleming, the merchant bank
which handled the recent Pounds 2.16bn sale of shares by the Wellcome Trust,
again cut its bid price. The bid was trimmed by 3p to 777p.
Smith &amp; Nephew was slightly easier at 136p despite its defensive qualities.
Nomura reduced its 1992 forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 145m, principally to
reflect a weaker dollar. The shares eased  3/4 to 136p.
ICI returned to the level it had reached before announcing a demerger. One
analyst said investors were realising that it would be a long time before
the impact of the planned demerger was felt. The shares fell 10 to 1094p.
BP held steady at 189p on turnover of 11m receiving some support from a Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken buy recommendation.
Shares in Eurotunnel edged up a penny to 324p after the company said talks
on additional costs with tunnel constructer TML were making progress and
could be over 'within week'.
Airports operator BAA continued its recent advance, this time boosted by the
release of slightly better than forecast July passenger traffic figures, up
11 per cent on the same month last year. The shares gained 4 to 633p, with
talk of some dealers switching out of BAA and into British Airways. The
airliner's shares closed 8 down at 245p.
Hotel group Forte suffered from Queens Moat's figures. The stock closed at
130p, off 7. A big seller of Rank Organisation unhinged the shares, off 9 at
the close at 534p.
Shares in manufacturer Northern Foods made a technical bounce after the
recent battering which followed a bout of downgrades. They jumped 17 to 249p
in heavy volume of 3.1m.
Talk that Dutch conglemerate SHV had raised its stake in retailer Nurdin and
Peacock helped the shares 3 to 151p.
In engineers and metals, Siebe rebounded 9 to 598p in thin trade. A broker's
recommendation earlier in the week continued to benefit TI Group, with the
shares 4 better at 270p. Shares in Williams Holdings fell 13 to 241p, with
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to have been the day's main sellers. Turnover
reached 2.2m.

FT  13 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Losses extended in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to break the longest-running streak of bearish sessions in the UK
stock market for at least eight years failed yesterday when the FT-SE Index
suffered its seventh consecutive daily fall. The Footsie 2,300 level was
challenged again in nervous trading although share prices rallied after
turning down sharply when a director of Commercial Union, the UK insurance
group, said that UK equities are still not good value despite the recent
setback.
Equities opened higher on a widely expected technical bounce which, at
first, enabled London to brush aside the further losses in New York and
Tokyo. Confidence was at first sustained by a firm opening in the stock
index futures sector. But the early gain of 17 points on the Footsie was
whittled away later and then the market began to fall away sharply.
At the day's low, the Footsie was down to 2,299.3 but by the close of
trading the loss had been cut to 6.5 for a final reading of 2,303.1.
There appeared to be no new factors in the market yesterday. Worries over
upward pressures on mortgage lending rates eased when Alliance &amp; Leicester,
a leading UK building society, reduced deposit rates, rather than increased
loan rates.
But, in the second half of the session, confidence was jolted by rumours -
quickly denied - that Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, had
resigned, and also by reports, later discounted, that Iraq had moved troops
to the Kuwait border.
Traders regarded the market's reaction to these fleeting and unsubstantiated
rumours as an indication of its underlying lack of confidence. Even the
bearish views on equities from Commercial Union were not considered, in
retrospect, very different from comments made earlier in the day when the
board announced satisfactory interim results.
On the domestic front, investors awaited today's economic data on UK
employment, wages and unit costs, which will be followed tomorrow by the
July Retail Price Index.
'There really is no reason to rush to buy the UK market,' commented the head
trader of a leading international house. Fears that the Footsie index
remains vulnerable all the way down to 2,150 continued to haunt a now
somewhat demoralised stock market.
On the international front, attention is focused on the Nikkei Average
which, having lost the 15,000 mark, is now believed by some analysts to be
heading towards 12,500. In Europe, investors await the outcome of the
referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty on September 20.
Trading volume appeared to be lighter than on the previous day, although the
bout of nervous selling in the afternoon lifted the Seaq total to 406.2m
shares.
Tuesday's Seaq volume of 564m shares reflected retail, or direct customer
interest, worth Pounds 1.1bn. This figure, a return to more satisfactory
levels of business from the point of view of the London-based securities
houses, was clearly boosted by the two trading programmes identified in the
market on Tuesday, when the institutions were selling stock.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED nervousness and uncertainty about the outlook once again dominated
trading in the derivatives, sending stock index futures falling as dealers
focused on unsubstantiated rumours, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened strongly with the first bargain
struck at 2,326, 9 points above Tuesday's close. The contract moved gently
forward and reached the session's high point of 2,340 by mid-morning, when a
period of sideways trading ensued.
Speculation about events in the Middle East and later about the UK
chancellor's tenure caused the sharp retreat of September. A poor Wall
Street combined with sell orders from two securities houses led to a
continued slide and by 4pm it had fallen to 2,294, at which point it was
trading at a discount to the cash market.
Bargain hunting just before the close helped the contract end above the
day's low point and September closed at 2,301, down 16 on it previous close
and around 10 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about
12. Turnover was 7,407.
Total volume in the traded options was poor reaching 22,556 contracts, of
which 13,631 was in the FT-SE 100.

FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: European tyre makers face a flat future
 -The sector may be heading for a period of underperformance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in European tyre companies could soon come off the boil if worsening
conditions in the UK tyre replacement market spread to other markets,
potentially endangering the sector's anticipated earnings recovery.
Shares in Kwik-Fit, the UK tyre and exhaust fitter, have more than halved to
98p since the start of June; brokers cut their 1992 earnings forecasts
following news from the company that tyre replacement sales had fallen in
May, June and July, even although it had maintained its market share.
Analysts were also told that customers were opting for cheaper tyre brands.
The best performance since the start of the year has been produced by
Michelin of France, which has the largest slice of the global tyre market.
Its shares had outperformed the CAC-40 index by 74 per cent by July 31.
Continental of Germany had outpaced the DAX index by 23.4 per cent by the
same date; and Pirelli Tyre NV, the Dutch tyre subsidiary of Pirelli SpA of
Italy, had outperformed the CBS General index by 37 per cent by June 3,
although the gain was subsequently eroded to 28 per cent. The outperformance
of Pirelli SpA against the Comit index fell, similarly, from 47 per cent on
May 20 to 37 per cent.
Mr Bob Barber at James Capel says that the rush to buy European tyre stocks
was prompted by two separate price increases, the first last August and the
second in April. 'Profits in the tyre industry are rising because of the
better pricing and some improvement in the US, but share prices are well up
with events,' he says.
He expresses concern, however, that the recent news from Kwik Fit is not
consistent with the news coming out of the tyre companies themselves. 'Any
doubt about the pace of earnings coming through will have an impact on the
share price,' he warns. Another worry is that the recent tyre price
increases may not stick if worsening conditions in the tyre replacement
market prompt increased competitiveness.
There are two other reasons why the European tyre sector could be heading
for a period of underperformance: the speculative fizz has evaporated, for
the near future at least, following the a setback in Pirelli SpA's attempt
to take over Continental; secondly, Michelin and Continental have made it
known that they intend to have big rights issues, as and when their share
prices permit.
The failure of Pirelli SpA, for the second time, to remove shareholder
voting restrictions at Continental's annual meeting in early July has left
it with virtually no control over its investment. The Italian company has 5
per cent of its German target and options on a further 33.4 per cent.
Furthermore, Continental's decision to pass the dividend on 1991 results
means that Pirelli SpA will not be getting any return from its investment.
'Unless Pirelli finds the cash it will be difficult to achieve control of
Conti,' says Mr Robert Willis at Hoare Govett. Even if the Italian company
does succeed in finding enough money, it will be obliged to pay a big
premium which, in his view, Continental's shares do not justify.
Mr Willis says there have been vague notions that Pirelli might sell its
stake in Continental to its Japanese rivals - both Yokohama Rubber and Toyo
Tire already have links with the German company. But there is little
evidence that this is about to happen.
Mr Barber agrees that the takeover prospects have dimmed for now, but he is
confident that eventually, 'something will be done'. He notes that, for
instance, Pirelli succeeded in blocking Continental's application to
shareholders for permission to increase its nominal share capital, as a
prelude to a rights issue.
Both Continental and Michelin need rights issues to strengthen their balance
sheets, Pirelli SpA having tapped the market already earlier this year.
Continental now has to consider other measure to raise funds, such as
listing its Contitech subsidiary on the German stock market. But Michelin
has no obstructions, and analysts believe that it will have a relatively
heavy 1-for-5 rights issue with the new shares priced around FFr200.
Michelin's primary need is to reduce its gearing which is currently running
at about 260 per cent and a rights issue would cut that to around 150 per
cent. Michelin also needs funds for its decision to introduce a new
automated process which, it is claimed, could cut most production space to
just 10 per cent of its present level.

FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Index-related buying
fails to stem Nikkei's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE index-related buying by investment trusts failed to support share
prices, and the Nikkei average registered another new 1992 low, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 48.77 to 14,773.79, its fifth consecutive decline after
fluctuations on margin positions, short selling, and index-related buying,
hitting the day's high of 14,906.16 and low of 14,658.57 in the morning
session.
Volume rose to 240m shares from 199m. Declines led advances by 739 to 167,
with 84 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 12.78 to
1,114.02 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.28 to 928.91. A total
of 659 issues, 53 per cent of the first section, fell to new lows for the
year.
Most analysts see the fall continuing. 'If share prices discount corporate
earnings for the current fiscal year, the Nikkei could fall to 12,000 in the
next three to six months,' said Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips and Drew.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the market leader, fell Y7,000 to a new low
of Y458,000 on selling by individuals.
In spite of the overall weakness, most banks were firm on index buying, with
Industrial Bank of Japan up Y20 to Y1,740 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank gaining
Y40 to Y1,330. However, Nippon Credit Bank, the long-term credit bank, lost
Y100 to Y3,500 on continued worries over its problem loans.
High-technology blue chips were mixed. Hitachi fell Y1 to Y731, in spite of
small-lot buying by foreigners, and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y60
to Y1,120 on rumours of a downward revision of its earnings. However, Sony
advanced Y20 to Y3,780 and NEC gained Y10 to Y750.
Investors took profits on highly-priced stocks which had rallied on
prospects of firm earnings. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, lost
Y360 to Y7,590, Seven-Eleven Japan fell Y160 to Y5,100, and Secom, the
security company, declined Y300 to Y6,000.
Speculative theme stocks fell on another round of liquidation. Okamoto
Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y15 to Y810 along with
other Aids-related issues such as Mochida Pharmaceutical, down Y40 to
Y2,220.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 391.36 to 15,622.70 in volume of 22.5m
shares.
Roundup
FOR ONCE, the rest of the region seemed to have more serious immediate
concerns than Tokyo.
AUSTRALIA weakened on a four and a half year low for the Australian dollar
and uncertainty ahead of next week's federal budget. Speculation that the
government might sell more shares in its 70 per cent owned Commonwealth Bank
of Australia also had a depressing effect on the market.
The All-Ordinaries index fell 16.9, or 1.1 per cent to 1,570.7 after the
Australian treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, said on radio that the government did
not see the need for any further easing in monetary policy, and that the
government budget deficit would be 'something like' ADollars 14.5bn, the
latter raising speculation about the Commonwealth Bank stake.
Turnover rose from ADollars 146m to ADollars 205m. The investment bank, Bain
&amp; Co, said that the domestic dollar will rebound over the next week. Westpac
Banking fell 12 cents to ADollars 2.98, or 2 cents below the price of its
proposed rights issue. The diamond miner, Ashton Mining, fell 22 cents to
ADollars 1.56 after bad news at De Beers; the central selling organisation
said it will reduce Ashton's diamond sales 'by no more than' 5 per cent.
SINGAPORE dropped further on foreign blue chip selling, the Straits Times
Industrial index chips closing another 26.68, or 1.9 per cent lower at
1,366.23.
Turnover rose from SDollars 94.2m to SDollars 142.3m. Keppel's near 20 per
cent rise in interim group earnings left the shares 10 cents lower at
SDollars 5.65 while Sembawang Shipyard, Singapore Press Holdings foreign
shares and SIA foreign each lost 50 cents to SDollars 6.20, SDollars 12.40
and SDollars 16.20 respectively.
HONG KONG lost early gains in afternoon profit-taking,the Hang Seng index
slipping 7.56 to 5879.19 as a flurry of rumours surfaced on the trading halt
in 10 local companies controlled by the Malaysian-Chinese tycoon Lee Ming
Tee.
SEOUL hit a 56-month low, the composite index falling 9.79 to 492.66; NEW
ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index fell 18.12 to 1,496.56 as Fletcher Challenge and
Brierley slid again; and TAIWAN 's weighted index fell 56.67 to 3,901.61 as
margin calls forced investors to sell shares. MANILA, however, rebounded
smartly after Wednesday in improved trading, bolstered by the overnight US
gain in Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the composite index rising 25.58
to 1471.25 and PLDT closing 30 pesos higher Manila at 1,020.

FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Conflicting opinions on equity
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was some danger, yesterday, of a two-way market in investment opinion,
writes Our Markets Staff.
In Germany, there seemed serious concern that the 1,500 level on the DAX
index would not prove an effective support level; but Mr David Roche, now
global strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that current pessimism is now
priced into markets: 'My guess', he said in a report to be published this
week, 'is that the next move in global equities will be upwards and that the
current correction in world markets is no more than that.'
FRANKFURT slowed its decline, the DAX index closing 11.59 lower at 1,553.01
after a loss of 0.47 to 613.60 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from
DM6.1bn to DM5.1bn.
Germans are now pessimistic about the economy, in spite of the expiry last
month of the tax surcharge to finance German unity. Mr Matthias Welticke of
Merck, Finck in Dusseldorf said that he was also worried about the continued
slide in Tokyo, the vulnerability of Wall Street at its present level, the
disappointing interim results season and the analysts' earnings downgrades
which could follow this.
The result was that where results brought out a buy recommendation,
investors ignored it. Degussa fell DM1 to DM320 after a 15 per cent increase
in interim profits for 1991-92, and a forecast of further gains in 1992-93.
PARIS saw dull trading with oil stocks lifted by activity in the futures
market. The CAC-40 index lost 7.75 to 1,730.05 in low turnover of FFr1.06bn.
Rumours that Iraqi troops had massed at the Iraq-Kuwait border, denied by a
Kuwaiti official just as the market was closing, was partly responsible for
a stronger oil sector. Elf closed up FFr1.40 at FFr316.00 while Total put on
FFr1.00 at FFr225.70.
Elsewhere a negative note on banks by one broker left Suez and Paribas down
FFr2.50 and FFr4.50 respectively to FFr239.00 and FFr302.00.
Sanofi lost FFr8 to FFr987. Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs has downgraded
his 1992 EPS forecast for the stock and expects the pharmaceutical company

AMSTERDAM saw Daf fall to a historic low, down 30 cents to Fl 17.20 ahead of
interim results on August 27. The truck maker is still suffering from poor
UK sales, although it has forecast a second half profit.
The CBS Tendency index closed 0.8 lower at 112.2. KLM fell Fl 1.10, or 3.6
per cent to Fl 29.00 ahead of today's first quarter results. Some analysts

Europe is forecasting a month-on-month increase of 1.1 per cent, although
some other analysts are more pessimistic.
BRUSSELS lost 2 per cent to its lowest level of the year. The Bel-20 index
shed 22.29 to 1,092.47 in turnover of BFr1.14bn. Petrofina declined for the
fourth consecutive day, losing BFr430 or 4.3 per cent to BFr9,500.

Volvo B SKr9 lower at SKr311. The Affarsvarlden index shed 11.9 to 815.9 in
turnover of SKr394m.
James Capel in London rated Volvo a long-term buy yesterday although the
broker revised its 1992 EPS forecast to SKr15 from SKr28 to reflect higher
interest rates, the decline in the value of the dollar and the delayed
economic recovery in the US and Europe.
VIENNA closed slightly higher in nervous trading. The ATX index put on 3.47
to 686.92. Leykam, the paper manufacturer, improved Sch17 to Sch290.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Costs to be slashed' at new
copper mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COPPER mines scheduled to come on stream in the next three years are
expected both to boost production and to slash operating costs, according to
a report from the Commodities Research Unit. The growth follows a decade
bereft of new capacity and marked by rising costs as producers concentrated
on maximising output at a time of high prices.
Eight projects - including La Candelaria in Chile and Louvicourt in Canada -
are due to come on stream by the end of 1995 and have a combined annual
capacity of 277,000 tonnes a year. Average operating costs of these mines
and Chile's Escondida, which opened at the end of 1990, are expected to be
less than 45 cents a lb.
This compares with average operating costs of more than 60 cents a lb in
1990. Cash copper is selling at 114 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange.
A further 10 projects - including Windy Craggy in Canada and Codelco's
Chuqui Norte and El Abra in Chile - are due to come on stream between 1996
and 2005, producing an additional 720,000 tonnes a year at an average 43
cents a lb.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices are staying fairly steady in terms of Australian
cents. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator drifted
fractionally down 5 cents to 530 during the first two selling days this
week. The Australian dollar has however registered a sharp change from its
normal close alignment with the US dollar, at about 75 cents, the rate moved
this week to 71 cents. The US dollar is itself weak, and buyers almost
everywhere find wool definitely cheaper for currency reasons. Holidays
remain an important factor keeping the market dull, apart from price
softness connected with currency volatility.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia takes top place in
tin production league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA CAPTURED from Brazil last year top place among the world's tin
producers, according to an analysis in the latest Metals and Minerals annual
review.
It suggests that in south-east Asia 'Indonesia was alone in staging an
attempt to ensure the longer-term survival of domestic tin mining'.
The author, Mr Andrew Shaw of Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services, adds:
'The evidence so far suggests that this attempt has been partly successful'.
He points out that local producer PT Tambang Timah's cost-cutting programme
and a productivity drive at Koba, owned by Renison Goldfields Consolidated
of Australia, restricted Indonesia's output decline while putting the
country among the lowest-cost producers. In contrast, Brazil's output
suffered because activity at the rich Bom Futuro operation in Rondonia was
severely curtailed.
Tin mine output outside the former eastern bloc last year was at its lowest
since 1959 at 137,100 tonnes, down from 158,100 tonnes in 1990. But
Indonesia held production at 30,100 tonnes compared with 31,700 tonnes in
1990. Meanwhile, Brazil's output fell from 39,100 tonnes to 29,300 tonnes.

London cocoa prices at one stage dropped by up to Pounds 30 a tonne as New
York continued to move lower, but traders were still struggling to find any
fresh fundamental reason for the fall. 'At first I thought there had to be
some origin selling but not at these prices. It really just looks like tired
long liquidation,' one dealer said. By London's close, New York had also
recovered from its lows. But should the downside move be resumed, next
support was plotted at Pounds 610 for the December contract. 'It's not cocoa
that is weighing on the market, but speculators. The problem is there's been
no decent buying around. A lot of bulls are happy to see the market come
down so they can buy on the dips," another dealer said. London's robusta
COFFEE prices also dropped back after New York scored new life-of-contract
lows, weighed down by the abundance of supply. Trading remained dull on the
LME as the summer slowdown in physical interest and an absence of fresh news
continued to restrict activity, dealers said. Prices closed mixed, although
COPPER and ZINC slipped through the floors of their current trading ranges,
while ALUMINIUM was near its downside support, they said.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Corporate borrowers tap into dollar
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO corporate borrowers yesterday took advantage of the latest decline in US
bond yields to lock in cheaper fixed-rate funding in the dollar sector of
the Eurobond market.
Allied Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, launched a Dollars 150m
five-year deal via Credit Suisse First Boston, while Philip Morris, the US
cigarette, food and beer manufacturer, brought a Dollars 200m seven-year
offering via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Growing confidence that the dollar is likely to bounce soon has boosted
European demand for Eurodollar bonds. As a result, costs for borrowers in
the Eurobond market are becoming increasingly competitive with the US
market.
Very little corporate paper has been issued in the Eurobond market recently,
but the fall in rates is likely to encourage more companies to raise funds.
In addition, dealers said there are signs that some institutional investors
are relaxing restrictions on bonds rated less than double-A, partly in an
effort to pick up extra yield as US interest rates fall to historic lows.
The Philip Morris deal, aggressively priced at 62 basis points above the
comparable US Treasury yield, was targetted at Swiss retail investors,
traditionally enthusiastic buyers of the name.
Dealers, however, said the issue appeared very expensive next to the Allied
Lyons offering, which carries the same debt rating of A2 by Moody's and A by
Standard &amp; Poor's.
The Allied Lyons deal, priced at 95 basis points above the five-year US
Treasury yield, was aimed at a broader investor base, including continental
European fund managers and retail investors.
'Good single-A-rated UK companies sell well at spreads of 90-100 basis
points over Treasuries,' said one syndicate manager. The deal was bid at
99.77, slightly above its fixed reoffer level of 99.72.
Two more offerings of subordinated floating-rate notes (FRNs) by banks, with
minimum and maximum coupon levels, were launched yesterday, although dealers
said that demand is starting to ebb. Internationale Nederlanden Bank,
formerly NMB Postbank, launched a Dollars 100m offering and Germany's DG
Bank a Dollars 75m issue of 10-year subordinated floating-rate notes.
Also in the FRN market, the World Bank launched a Dollars 400m issue of
10-year notes, paying interest of 80 basis points below the three-month
London interbank offered rate, via Goldman Sachs.
The deal was targetted sole-ly at Italian investors, who do not pay
withholding tax on World Bank paper. However, without the Italian angle, the
World Bank would have had to pay about 20 basis points under Libor, dealers
said.
Some underwriters said the paper was proving quite difficult to place, but
lead manager Goldman Sachs said most of the deal had been sold by the end of
the day.
In the Euroyen market, the Central Japan Railway Company launched a Y20bn
10-year deal via Nomura International, placed in the Far East.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors face a glut of
global bond indices - A growth industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international fixed income markets face a glut of global bond indices.
Widely used as tools to measure the performance of fund managers, indices
have been standard products in the US fixed income markets since the early
1970s. It was not until 1986, though, that Salomon Brothers produced the
first global bond index.
The number of indices is growing rapidly. The JP Morgan index, launched in
1990, has won a strong following, and other banks are now revamping or
creating their own versions, among them Merrill Lynch, UBS (which published
its own last week) and Lehman Brothers (which expects to go public early
this autumn). Salomon also dusted down its own product last month.
The European bond commission has also been working to produce an index with
Bloomberg, the electronic information company.
Indices have become an important part of the banks' fight to win business
from fund managers - at considerable expense. Salomon, for instance,
estimates it has 20 people working full-time on its global index.
'It seems surprising that people should want to spend money coming into a
business which doesn't at first sight offer much return,' says Mr John
Gillies of Frank Russell, the US-based performance measurement company.
The returns can be considerable. If a fund manager is following a particular
bank's index, it creates an instant relationship between the two. The
investor needs regular information on the performance of the index, and is
likely to want to talk over its composition.
This often goes one step further, as investors open their international bond
portfolios to the bank concerned to discuss how they can change their
holdings to better match particular aspects of the index. That way, the bank
gets the chance to bring the full weight of its technical analysis to bear
on the portfolio - and the chance to recommend and carry out particular
trades.
Investment banks need bond indices for other reasons. They are used to price
over-the-counter derivatives. Without its own, a bank would have to price
derivatives based on a market against some other house's index, putting it
at a disadvantage.
Another reason for the proliferation of indices is simply that they have
become cheaper to produce. 'Technology has made it easier to compute index
returns,' says Mr Richard Pagan of Salomon.
Not all indices are likely to be successful. The different make-up of the
indices is one factor that will determine which gain the biggest following.
WM, another performance measurement company, decided 18 months ago to
recommend the JP Morgan index over the Salomon one, a preference which seems
also to have been followed by Frank Russell. They were swayed by factors
such as Morgan's decision to calculate its index daily, rather than monthly,
and to use foreign exchange rates taken from the close of business in
London, rather than New York.
The difference in foreign exchange rates, for instance, amounted to a
variation of as much as 50-100 basis points a year in the returns shown by
different indices, says WM.
Salomon has now changed its index to match these and other expressed
preferences for the Morgan index. It has also extended the number of
countries it covers - as has Morgan - to reflect the growing spread of
markets covered by international bond fund managers.
Substantial variations remain, though. The prices used to calculate indices
are particular to each house, and there are big differences in the policy on
which bonds to include and exclude.
The proliferation of indices also looks set to extend to more specialised
areas. JP Morgan yesterday announced a new Emerging Markets Bond Index,
tracking the performance of bonds issued as a result of debt restructuring
agreements by lesser developed countries. A similar index was launched by
Salomon two years ago, but the likelihood of Argentina and Brazil reaching
agreement with their foreign bank creditors in the coming months will double
the amount of bonds in issue and could attract new investors to the
high-yield markets.

KEPPEL Corp, which runs Singapore's largest shiprepair yard plus banking,
engineering and property activities, has announced pre-tax profits of
SDollars 131.2m (USDollars 81.8m) for the six months to the end of June, a
6.8 per cent rise over the same period last year. Group turnover was down
slightly to SDollars 746.6m.
Keppel said performance had improved in shiprepairing, banking, financial
services and engineering.
The group's property sector had also benefited from continued growth in the
Singapore property market.
Analysts say Singapore's shiprepair yards are now among the world's most
competitive, with charges up to 15 per cent lower than in South Korea. In
recent months Keppel and other Singapore yards have increased shiprepair
work on US navy vessels.
Keppel is one of a number of groups involved in discussions with the
Philippine authorities about leasing Subic Bay base, the former US naval
base north of Manila. Keppel wants to convert Subic Bay into a commercial
shiprepair yard and will soon put a formal proposal to the Philippines. The
US is due to complete its move out of Subic Bay by the end of the year.

USX, the US steel and energy group, has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer 7.5m shares in a new class of USX common
stock to be called USX-Delhi Group common stock.
The initial public offering price will be between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18
a share, according to the company's registration statement.
USX said in April it might sell shares in its Delhi Group, including the
Delhi gas pipe line and other related companies, as part of its efforts to
realise shareholder value. The Delhi Group recorded sales of over Dollars
423m in 1991, with operating income of about Dollars 31m and assets of
Dollars 598m.
USX had also considered selling assets or creating a limited partnership.
USX said the proceeds from the offering would be used for general business
purposes at its Marathon gas group of which the Delhi group had been part.
The effort to realise additional value for Marathon follows the company's
stock split last year, when USX agreed to issue a new class of stock after
coming under pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippon Housing Loan
restructuring stalls
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE restructuring of Nippon Housing Loan, Japan's largest home-loan company
which faces mounting problem loans, has been stalled by squabbles among its
main creditors.
Japanese commercial banks have yet to accept restructuring proposals
presented by Nippon Housing Loan in June.
The country's non-bank fin-ancial institutions, burdened by increasing
non-performing loans on property, are turning to the leading banks for help.
However, the banks not only face similar problems but are reluctant to
assist because they would incur substantial losses on measures such as
cutting interest rates on loans.
The home-loan companies' problems have shocked creditors. Set up by
reputable financial institutions under the direct guidance of the finance
ministry, they were seen as non-risk companies. In June, Nippon Housing Loan
asked nine commercial banks to cut the rate on loans to 3.25 per cent, equal
to the of-ficial discount rate - to maintain outstanding loans at current
levels - and to send personnel to aid the restructuring.
The company, listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has
about an estimated Y1,200bn (Dollars 9.45bn) in non-performing loans.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March fell by 87 per cent, while unrealised
losses on securities holdings at the year end were Y23.4bn. It is also under
investigation for alleged tax evasion on income from stock trading.
Japan's eight housing-loan companies increased their exposure to high-risk
property-related loans in the years of loose credit in the late-1980s.
Nippon Housing Loan was set up in 1971 by nine commercial banks. Sanwa Bank
and Sakura Bank, the leading commercial banks, both hold a 4.9 per cent
stake. The banks are at odds over which one has the principle responsibility
for Nippon Housing Loan.
Commercial banks have extended about 23 per cent of its debt totalling some
Y2,600bn at the end of March. Sakura had about Y226bn in loans outstanding
and Sanwa Y199bn. While some commercial banks may accept Nippon Housing
Loans requests, several are opposing unilateral decisions. The commercial
banks claim the co-operation of other creditors is essential in the
restructuring. Sakura Bank said: 'The problems are so large, it is
impossible for just the city banks to carry out the restructuring.'
Norinchukin Bank and other agricultural co-operative related financial
institutions have Y910bn in loans outstanding, the three long-term credit
banks - Industrial Bank of Japan, Long Term Credit Bank, and Nippon Credit
Bank - a total of Y280bn, and six trust banks, about Y210bn.
Financial institutions aff-iliated with agricultural co-operatives have been
large lenders to home-loan companies. Although their loans account for 40
per cent of Nippon Housing Loan's total debt, they are refusing to
co-operate with the restructuring plan, claiming that responsibility belongs
to banks with direct shareholdings.
Nippon Housing Loan reckons it will take more than three years to rebuild
itself, providing it receives aid from its creditors. 'Once the real estate
market recovers, things will start looking better,' it said.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASED exports higher rand prices and improved productivity helped
Trans-Natal, the coal arm of Gencor, the South African industrial group, to
lift attributable profits by 4 per cent for the year to June.
The improved export climate helped boost sales to R1.56bn (Dollars 563m)
from R1.43bn a year earlier, while the cost of sales rose by only 7 per cent
to R1.34bn from R1.25bn. Operating income was therefore 25 per cent higher
at R226.2m compared with R180.4m. Attributable profits rose by only 4 per
cent to R143.6m from R138.1m after the tax charge rose 125 per cent. The
dividend is being lifted to 80 cents a share from 75 cents.
Mr Mike Salamon, managing director, cautioned that the downturn in the world
economy and severely depressed spot prices, because of large amounts of low
cost coal from Russia and Indonesia, meant that earnings would not be
maintained in the current year.
Increased demand and market share in Spain, Germany and Japan lifted exports
sales to 11.3m tonnes from 10.6m tonnes in 1991.
Sales to the inland market were 5.3 per cent lower, at 5.4m tonnes due to
lower demand for metallurgical coal.
Sun International Bophutatswana (Sunbop), the South African casino resort
group, overcame a proliferation of unregulated gaming operations and
difficult operating conditions to increase earnings by 13 per cent for the
year to June.
Turnover rose 30 per cent to reach R1bn from R772.5m, Margins were lower so
operating profits rose by 17 per cent to R269.2m from R229.5m.
Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said the opening of the rival Carousel resort in
November hit revenues of his group's Marula Sun and Sun City.
Interest income also fell to R1m from R27m following the use of cash to
develop Carousel and the R750m Lost City project at Sun City, a
Disneyland-type scheme scheduled to open in December.
Attributable earnings rose 13 per cent to R216m from R191.8m, but earnings
per share were only 8 per cent higher at 191 cents, against 177 cents,
following a rights issue and two scrip dividends.
The dividend is being maintained at 132 cents a share.
Mr Kerzner predicted earnings for the current financial year would 'at least
approximate those of the past year.'

<TEXT>
FEDERATED Department Stores, the large US department store group which
recently emerged from bankruptcy, made a reduced Dollars 29.4m loss after
tax in the second quarter to August 1 and an operating profit of Dollars
27.3m.
In the same period a year earlier, the net loss was Dollars 143.8m, while
operating profit totalled just Dollars 8.5m.
Sales fell year-on-year to Dollars 1.46bn, compared with Dollars 1.49bn, but
this partly reflects the reduction in stores operated. Federated said that
same-store sales increased by 1.7 per cent.
The results take the first half loss after tax to Dollars 17.6m, compared
with Dollars 208m a year earlier.
Yesterday, Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman, said the figures were
better than anticipated, and he expected a 'modest improvement' for the rest
of the year, with business strengthening the key fourth quarter.
The group takes in over 220 department stores, including the Bloomingdale's
outlets, The Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh and Abraham &amp; Straus. Federated shares
were unchanged at Dollars 13 7/8 yesterday.

DKr5.38bn and a 42 per cent rise in net profits from DKr458m to DKr649m.
The results were better than expected and reflect a growth in sales volume,
as exchange rates remained unchanged and prices stable, said the group.
Pre-tax income increased by 36 per cent from DKr693m to DKr941m, including a
turn round in net financial items from a DKr24m loss last year to a DKr54m
profit this year.
The group cautioned that stock building by important customers may mean
slower growth in the second half.
The interim statement maintained an earlier forecast that pre-tax profits
for the year will increase by 'at least 15 per cent'.
Group investments this year will increase to DKr2bn from DKr1.3bn last year.
Shareholders' equity increased during the half year by DKr631m to
DKr10.11bn, some 63 per cent of total assets. Earnings per share were up by
21 per cent from DKr14.39 to DKr17.42.

NORGESKREDITT, the Norwegian private sector mortgage company, yesterday
reported an advance in first-half operating profit to NKr66.6m (Dollars
11.6m) from NKr54.9m in the last reporting period.
The company previously published interim figures every four months and this
year's first half-year statement has been compared with the result at
end-August, 1991 converted into half-yearly figures.
Norgeskreditt was listed on the Oslo bourse on July 6 and has expanded its
share capital to NKr1.53bn through two share issues. Its equity ratio in
relation to risk-weighted balance sheet items is 14.4 per cent.
Net interest income dipped to NKr105.3m from NKr106.9m but credit losses
decreased to NKr22.1m from NKr28m.
Operating expenses rose slightly to NKr26.7m, representing 0.25 per cent per
annum of average total assets, from NKr25.8m.
Nevertheless, Norgeskreditt said that expenses had developed according to
expectations.
Group loans fell to NKr18.79bn at June 30 from NKr19.46bn at the beginning
of the year.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Capital injection of FM 1.7bn
for Finnish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's largest commercial bank, announced
yesterday that it would take a FM 1.7bn (Dollars 422m) financial injection
from the Finnish government to strengthen its capital base and improve its
capital requirement ratio.
The capital provision will bring an estimated immediate increase of about
FM20bn in the bank's lending capacity. The group's half-year results, due to
be released at the end of next month, are expected to show a continuing
loss.
The capital injection comes from a FM8bn provision made by the Finnish
government in June to strengthen the capital base of Finnish banks. This
follows the creation earlier in the year of a FM20bn government deposit
guarantee fund established in response to a serious deterioration in the
country's banking sector caused by mounting loan losses.
The financial injection to KOP takes the form of a preferred capital
certificate and carries a coupon of 0.50 per cent a year over one-year
Finnish government Treasury bills until the end of 1997.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, chairman and chief executive, said that the bank had
been looking at ways of strengthening its capital base to ensure capital
adequacy requirements would 'under no circumstances' constrain its
operations. 'The capital investment offered by the state has turned out to
be the most attractive alternative,' he added.
As a result of the capital injection, KOP said its capital ratio will rise
by nearly 1.5 per cent under both Bank of International Settlement and local
regulations. At the end of April the ratio stood at 8.9 per cent.
Since he became head of KOP last February, Mr Voutilainen has been carrying
out a comprehensive programme of rationalisation of its organisation which
has included halving the size of its executive committee, a cut of 10 per
cent in the bank's payroll by the end of the year and a shift in the focus
of KOP's activities to basic banking services through a reallocation of its
capital from real estate.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Mr Lee Ming Tee's sprawling property-based empire was in doubt
yesterday when the Hong Kong government appointed an inspector to
investigate his flagship Allied Group and four other companies associated
with him.
The government acted on advice from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC), the colony's corporate watchdog which, for the past nine
months, has been investigating Allied's intra-group share dealings.
The inspector, likely to be named within a week, will investigate Allied
Group, Allied Properties, Crusader Holdings, Paragon Holdings and Wai Yick.
In addition the SFC has gained suspension in share trading of five other
companies connected with, or believed to be connected with, Mr Lee.
Last year Mr Lee acquired control of Asia Securities - one of the companies
whose shares were suspended yesterday - from Mr Bill Wyllie, a local asset
trader, who joined the Allied board in June.
Allied directors said they would co-operate fully with the inspector. They
had not been warned that the group's shares would be suspended, and would
seek an early resumption of trading after talks with the SFC and the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange.
The appointment of an inspector follows an SFC investigation into certain
share dealings connected with an ambitious plan, announced by Mr Lee in
November, to merge three listed associate companies with Allied.
Under pressure from shareholders he was forced to improve the terms of share
swaps he proposed on two occasions.
But in February Allied said it had abandoned the proposed mergers because of
a review by the SFC into share dealings.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ghost buster dispels shadows of the past -
Bunzl and the man brought in to restore the group's flagging fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GHOSTS still walk at Bunzl, but less often, says Mr Tony Habgood, the
chief executive brought in to exorcise the paper and packaging company's
chequered past.
'They don't parade around every night any more, perhaps just once a year,'
he says.
Dispelling the shadows of the past has been the first and most difficult
task since Mr Habgood, a former management consultant and briefly chief
executive of textile group Tootal, arrived a year ago.
'The degree of internal mistrust was very high. Many were hostile to the
centre,' he says, with some business managers maintaining only minimal
communication with the Slough-based headquarters.
The hostility felt by managers of the more successful parts of the group was
the result of a frantic Pounds 600m acquisition spree spanning some 10
years. At one stage, between 1985 and 1989, Bunzl made an acquisition on
average every two weeks.
Many of the new companies proved less than successful and even included
'some outright disasters', says Mr Habgood. For example, Bunzl built Italy's
fifth-largest fine paper merchanting business by buying 15 family-run
companies in rapid succession.
'In retrospect, Bunzl did not appear to have done adequate due diligence on
some of the companies,' says Mr Habgood. Italian losses soon began to bleed
the parent dry. After a year of closures and rationalisation, the Italian
business is now breaking even.
Meanwhile, the City grew increasingly disillusioned with Bunzl's record of
declining profits. Between 1988 and 1991, pre-tax profits plunged from
Pounds 93.3m to Pounds 32m.
The share price followed a similar pattern, declining from a peak 186p to
82p in the same period.
Some of the mistrust within the company has been eliminated by the disposal
programme, which was initiated by Bunzl's former management. About 20
different operations have been sold or closed down in the past year, leaving
five divisions: the main plastic and paper disposables business, which
accounts for 50 per cent of profits, cigarette filters, fine paper, building
materials and plastic product manufacturing.
However, exorcising mistrust is a more difficult task in the City, where
many analysts still nurse scepticism.
Mr Tim Rothwell, of BZW, gives Mr Habgood credit for his management changes
and 'clean slate approach'. Gross provisions of Pounds 27m were taken last
year to cover the costs of restructuring. Yet Mr Rothwell raises questions
about the fundamental value of the businesses which Bunzl retains.
'The problem with Bunzl is that it has a lot of cash cows, some dogs, and
one or two problem children. I do not see that it has any stars,' he says.
Mr Rothwell questions whether Bunzl's main paper and plastics distribution
business would qualify for a star rating these days. Distribution grew
rapidly in the 1980s through the efficiencies achieved by combining a series
of small companies. Yet Mr Rothwell claims the market is now mature.
Furthermore, he says, Bunzl faces increasing challenges from bigger
distribution players such as Kraft and the rapid growth of warehouse
discount clubs in the US.
Warehouse clubs, which according to recent statistics will grow in the US at
the rate of 25 per cent per annum for the next five years, are increasingly
'taking business away from catering and paper products distributors,' says
Mr Rothwell. 'This business is going nowhere easily.'
Others in the City are more inclined to give Mr Habgood the benefit of the
doubt.
According to many in the pro-Bunzl lobby, the 1980s acquisition frenzy meant
financial and operational controls in many businesses were neglected.
Now, they say, there are opportunities for these businesses to rebuild
margins even without economic recovery.
For example, it is estimated that restructuring of the US building materials
business will result in a 66 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 3m
this year, barring sharp dollar movements.
Plastics, likewise, should regain some of last year's 28 per cent profits
decline following the closure of three factories, two warehouses and a 10
per cent reduction in the workforce. Filters, although linked to a mature
cigarette market, will benefit from Bunzl's forte in speciality products, ie
charcoal filters.
Ms Francesca Raleigh, of Credit Lyonnais Laing, predicts that the past year
of cost-cutting, disposals and closures could easily leave Bunzl with
pre-tax profits of Pounds 46m for the 12 months to December 31, compared
with Pounds 32m last time. Forecast earnings of 6.6p give a prospective p/e
of 13.3 times on last night's closing price of 87p.
Since the shares have begun to rally from a six-month low in recent days,
there could be more to come in advance of the interims in September, say
analysts.
Meanwhile, Mr Jonathan Helliwell, of James Capel, says Mr Habgood has
successfully taken the company through the crucial first stage of recovery.
'They have done the fire-fighting,' he says, ' . . . but it is not enough.'
Investors are now calling for an indication on the strategy for Bunzl's
future: which businesses are likely to continue under the 'core operations'
banner and which will provide the real growth? Until those questions are
answered, he suggests, longer-term investors are unlikely to find much
excitement in Bunzl's shares.
Mr Habgood, for his part, says he is just beginning to lift his eyes from
the road three feet in front of him. The strategic question will have to
wait until individual businesses, such as builders' merchanting, are
performing to expectations.
That is unlikely to happen if 'the company spends its entire time
speculating on which part is going to be up for sale next,' Mr Habgood says.
Meanwhile, Bunzl will shore up its existing operations with small
opportunistic purchases, such as the two announced earlier this year in
paper distribution.
But, being by nature a quiet man, Mr Habgood intends to keep the noise down.
He has no intention of waking ghosts which he has worked hard to put to
rest.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ford injects Pounds 135m into Jaguar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD MOTOR of the US has injected Pounds 135m in new equity capital into
Jaguar as part of a financial restructuring of its troubled UK luxury car
subsidiary.
The recapitalisation, disclosed in Jaguar's annual report, has been forced
by the size of the losses suffered by Jaguar in the last three years.
In addition to injecting fresh equity Ford has also made substantial loans
to Jaguar including Pounds 125.8m of long-term debt.
Some of the loan facility was made as part of the process of Ford replacing
commercial banks as Jaguar's banker as well as to provide additional working
capital.
The report shows, however, that loans from Ford have provided a net increase
in funds of Pounds 88.5m in addition to the Pounds 135m of new equity.
Ford paid Pounds 1.56bn for Jaguar in late 1989 and the capital
restructuring has added significantly to that cost.
Jaguar's pre-tax losses have accelerated since the takeover and totalled
Pounds 226.1m in 1991 compared with a loss of Pounds 66.2m in 1990 and
Pounds 58.3m in 1989.
Ford disclosed recently that Jaguar suffered a continuing loss of about
Dollars 70m (Pounds 36.6m) in the second quarter of 1992, virtually
unchanged from a year ago. Its first quarter loss was reduced from Dollars
130m to Dollars 90m.
Jaguar maintained virtually unchanged research and development expenditure
last year of Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 54.9m), but the financial squeeze caused
its capital spending to be cut sharply from Pounds 70m in 1990 to only
Pounds 44.2m.
The annual report discloses for the first time the financial impact of last
year's heavy redundancy programme with an exceptional charge of Pounds
42.5m. The workforce was cut from 12,100 in 1990 to 8,015 at the end of last
year and is now just under 8,000.
Sales in the US and the UK, its two most important markets, plunged last
year, causing production to be reduced to only 23,018 vehicles - the lowest
level since 1982 - from 41,883 in 1990. Wholesale deliveries to dealers fell
by 41 per cent to 24,597.
In the first half Jaguar sales worldwide fell further, from 12,900 to
11,900. Production declined by 26 per cent to 10,259.
There was some recovery in the US in the six months with sales rising by
10.8 per cent to 4,809 from last year's depressed level of 4,342 - although
US sales in July fell sharply. Demand in the UK remained weak with a 15.2
per cent fall to 2,679.
While sales and output have continued to fall, Jaguar has achieved a
significant improvement in quality. In the recently published JD Power
report in the US, one of the most authoritative studies of customer
satisfaction in the world car industry, the company jumped to 10th place
compared with 25th a year earlier.

The outcome excluded the cost of aborting the flotation, estimated to be
about Dollars 20m, which would be charged in the accounts for the year.

Brandon Hire, the USM-quoted tool, catering and furniture hire group, blamed
the recession as it lapsed into the red in the 12 months to April 30 and
passed its final dividend.

Turnover fell some 18 per cent to Pounds 3.98m.
Interest charges declined to Pounds 230,000 (Pounds 259,000). Gearing was
reduced from 45 per cent to 35 per cent.
Losses per share emerged at 1.72p (earnings of 0.87p). The interim dividend
of 0.1p stands for the year against the previous single distribution of
3.33p.

Ward Holdings, the housebuilding, commercial development and plant hire

interim dividend.
At the pre-tax level losses for the half year to April 30 jumped from Pounds
397,000 to Pounds 1.8m. The shares fell 5p to 20p.
Turnover totalled Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 14.3m), of which house sales
accounted for Pounds 9.18m (Pounds 10m), plant hire for Pounds 830,000
(Pounds 797,000) and gross rental income and property sales for Pounds 1.08m
(Pounds 2.99m).
A tax credit of Pounds 583,000 (Pounds 135,000) left attributable losses at
Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 262,000), equal to losses per share of 2.3p (0.5p).
Shareholders received an interim dividend of 0.5p, but no final, last time.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheafbank Property Trust, the property investment and financial services
group, turned round from pre-tax losses of Pounds 831,090 to profits of
Pounds 19,261 in the half year to September 30.
The result was achieved despite a fall in net income from Pounds 344,616 to
Pounds 284,003.
Losses per share were cut to 0.04p (5.34p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 0.1p.
Although yesterday's results were delayed, they follow just 4 1/2 months
after the figures for the year to March 1991. Both delays were caused by
board changes and the inclusion of audited information on substantial
investments.
Mr Frank Ridehalgh, company secretary, said Sheafbank was now 'catching up
with itself'. It has changed its accounting period and he hoped results for
the 15 months to June 30 would be published by October. The Stock Exchange
had been kept informed, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CMW GROUP, the USM-traded architect and interior designer, yesterday tried
to bolster its share price and said it continued to cut costs and was
seeking a renegotiation of its head office lease.
The shares, which collapsed from 80p earlier this year following pre-tax
losses and the departure of two senior directors, were unchanged at 8p.
CMW rents its London head office from the BWJD pension scheme, which was set
up as a private pension fund for five people, three of which are directors
of CMW. The lease on the office is BWJD's sole asset.
The company is now 'in discussions' about reducing the rent of Pounds
305,000 a year, or Pounds 37 per sq ft.
Mr Peter Denner, chairman and a beneficiary of the pension scheme, said the
trustees had agreed in principle to a 'significant' rent reduction, the
write off of part of the balance due and the conversion of some debt into
equity.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Boots takes heart from licence agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANOPLAX, Boots' congestive heart failure treatment that received its first
licence yesterday, probably represents the British group's last chance of a
meaningful presence in the lucrative pharmaceuticals industry.
While Boots' turnover is dominated by retailing, the pharmaceuticals
division generated an operating profit of Pounds 120m last year, 32 per cent
of the group total.
The success of Manoplax is vital to the division because most of its
existing products are off-patent and therefore vulnerable to cheap generic
competition. Meanwhile, its pipeline of new medicines - other than Manoplax
 -appears unpromising.
Boots' pharmaceuticals business is a minnow compared with the industry's
giants. It risks not having the critical mass to develop and successfully
market new medicines on a regular basis.
'We are betting heavily on Manoplax. It is a very important drug capable of
reshaping the whole business,' said Mr Terry Richardson, international and
marketing managing director. The drug could eventually generate sales of
between Pounds 100m and Pounds 300m a year.
Yesterday's licence is a relief for Boots after repeated delays led to
analysts describing the drug as 'Mananaplax'. However, some are less
confident than Boots about Manoplax's potential sales and ability to
transform its drugs business.
Doubts exist about European demand for the product. Worldwide sales of
Ace-inhibitors, the main class of competitor to Manoplax, are about Dollars
500m (Pounds 262m) a year.
But although Merck, the US drug giant, has thrown vast resources at
marketing Vasotec, its best-selling Ace-inhibitor, in Europe, only 5 per
cent of European patients are prescribed such medicines.
'If Merck with all its marketing muscle finds it difficult to overcome
European doctors' conservatism, what hope has Boots?' asked one analyst.
To overcome its marketing weakness in Europe, Boots has signed co-marketing
agreements for Germany with Astra, the Swedish group, and plans to sign a
similar agreement with an Italian group. It aims to market the drug directly
to hospital specialists in France, the UK and Spain and plans to invest
Pounds 20m in additional marketing infrastructure this year.
Manoplax's ultimate success will be decided in the US, the world's largest
single market. About 25 per cent of the 3m congestive heart disease patients
are prescribed Ace-inhibitors there.
However, analysts fear Manoplax will only be used in the US as a
second-choice treatment when Ace-inhibitors fail. Last October the FDA's
cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee recommended the drug for
approval, but only in patients who still had symptoms after using
Ace-inhibitors or were intolerant to alternative therapies.
Mr Richardson hoped that data from recent clinical trials would enable wider
approval to be gained, possibly making it a first-line treatment.
Analysts believe that a successful launch for Manoplax could offer an ideal
opportunity for Boots to withdraw from prescription pharmaceuticals. It
could sell at a moment of maximum potential, while avoiding the full brunt
of marketing costs.
The group could then concentrate on its strengths in retailing and
over-the-counter medicines.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: US and Europe provide some relief as
Heywood falls 37%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEYWOOD Williams Group, the glass distributor, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits down 37 per cent at Pounds 5.1m for the six months to June 30.
The fall from Pounds 8.1m was forecast on June 29 prompting a share price
fall of 41p to 288p. A month before that the shares had peaked at 388p.
Yesterday they eased 1p to 177p.
Glass saw operating profits halved to Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 6.1m), while
aluminium and plastics fell by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 730,000.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said the companies supplying the construction
industry - 25 per cent of Heywood's UK business - had suffered the most and
were likely to take the longest to recover. About 60 per cent of the UK
business was in replacement doors and windows, which he said was 'likely to
recover more quickly'.
The automotive side was more recession-proof, Mr Hinchliffe said, as it
operated mainly in the replacement window and windscreen market.
However, profits in Europe and the US provided some relief. On the Continent
they advanced from Pounds 672,000 to Pounds 1.07m, led by acquisitions, and
across the Atlantic organic growth saw them treble to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds
421,000).
In February Heywood bought Door Panels, which makes exterior and
conservatory doors, for Pounds 7.8m and in July it spent a combined Pounds
4m on BMV and a controlling stake in Pels &amp; Joosten, French and Dutch glass
companies respectively.
Group turnover grew to Pounds 190.4m (Pounds 160.5m) and the interim
dividend is held at 4.5p, uncovered by earnings of 3.4p (7.7p) per share.
COMMENT
Though its glass processing side has in the last two years afforded some
protection by boosting its buying power, Heywood is now reeling from both a
decline in demand and weak prices. But the balance sheet remains strong and
gross margins have not fallen too much. A small movement in volumes would
result in a jump in profits. But with no such movement and with the variable
overhead pared to the bone, the company is looking at some Pounds 8m-Pounds
10m reduction in the fixed overhead to remain in the black. Assuming the
housing market receives no external help, full-year profits are expected to
be about Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 19.2m), allowing for Pounds 2m of redundancy
costs in the second half. This gives earnings of 8.6p and a prospective p/e
of 21, which looks high even taking cyclicality into account. However, sound
management and the scope for profit improvement through cuts make it worth
holding.

Rank Organisation has found a buyer for two of the 22 hotels it put up for
sale last April.
The two, both in Scotland, are among the cheapest of the hotels being
offered for sale.
Morton Properties of Dundee is to buy the Golf View Hotel in Nairn and the
Royal Golf Hotel in Dornoch. The selling price of the hotels was not
disclosed.
Last May, however, Rank asked for offers in excess of Pounds 950,000 for the
Nairn hotel and Pounds 700,000 for the Dornoch property.

<TEXT>
HS WEAVERS (Underwriting) Agencies, the insurance agency which is part of
London United Investments in administration, was yesterday wound up on the
instructions of Mr Roger Borley, the remaining director.
Mr Ray Hocking, a partner with Stoy Hayward, has been appointed to manage a
creditors' voluntary liquidation on behalf of the company.
The decision was taken after Walbrook, another subsidiary of LUI, entered
provisional liquidation earlier this month.
Walbrook was a significant creditor of Weavers, and provided it with limited
financial support. Its winding up made it impossible for Weavers to continue
operating.
Mr Hocking said he expected to present a full report on the history of the
company and its financial position to a meeting of creditors on August 24.
He said it was inevitable that litigation would ensue between Weavers and
Walbrook, other LUI subsidiaries and third parties, including other
creditors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATELY-owned Turkish construction group has approached the
administrators of Polly Peck International to buy the Sheraton Voyager hotel
in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.
Dogus Holding, a large Turkish construction group with interests in banking
and leisure, confirmed yesterday that it had made an all-cash bid for the
409-room hotel. The company declined to disclose the price. The hotel is
believed to have cost about Pounds 65m to build.
The Antalya Sheraton Voyager is one of Turkey's largest hotels and was
opened more than a year behind schedule in September 1990, just weeks before
Polly Peck was forced into administration. Occupancy rates have been good
throughout this year.
The book value of PPI's leisure operations is Pounds 235m, including four
smaller hotels in north Cyprus.
The Dogus bid follows this week's sale of PPI Del Monte, PPI's fresh fruit
operation, to a consortium of Mexican investors for Dollars 499m (Pounds
261m).
Dogus said it was waiting for the administrators' valuation of the company
and that its bid would be for the shares of the hotel company and not the
hotel itself. However, Dogus is also talking with Sheraton International
about taking over its 15-year management contract and running the hotel
directly. Dogus already owns and manages the largest hotel in the
neighbouring resort of Alanya.
Polly Peck also owns a number of fruit trading and packaging companies in
Cyprus, but legal disputes have so far blocked the administrators' efforts
to gain control of these.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Queens Moat advances to Pounds 38m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEENS MOAT Houses' continental European hotels helped the company lift
half-year pre-tax profits by 5.4 per cent to Pounds 38.1m despite continuing
gloom in the UK.
Mr John Bairstow, chairman, said the company would continue its programme of
'vigorous expansion' on the Continent, avoiding large-scale capital
investment by seeking leases, management contracts and franchising
agreements.
Mr Bairstow said the UK had become less important to the group's overall
performance. 'With more than half our room capacity, a large proportion of
profit and the emphasis on expansion being outside of Britain, it follows
that the UK will progressively become one of our major areas of operation,
rather than the mainstay of the business.'
The company has 86 hotels on the Continent, compared with 103 in the UK.
However, because the continental hotels tend to be larger, of its total of
22,291 rooms 11,667 are on the Continent against 10,624 in the UK.
Operating profits in the UK were Pounds 38.7m for the period ended July 12.
This was an increase of 6.6 per cent over last year, when hotel occupancies
were badly affected by the Gulf war. By contrast, operating profits in
Germany increased 37 per cent to Pounds 23.1m and in the Benelux countries
by 22 per cent to Pounds 12.9m. Profits in France were up 26 per cent to
Pounds 2.9m.
Mr Bairstow said he saw little sign that business confidence had been dented
in any of the continental European countries in which Queens Moat operated.
UK hotel bookings increased in the three to five weeks following the
Conservative victory in April's general election, but this improvement was
not sustained. He said there was little prospect that UK hotel performance
would improve in the second half.
Profit before rent and interest increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 81m. Rent
charges more than doubled, however, to Pounds 9.6m, restricting growth at
the pre-tax level. Mr Bairstow said increased rent was the result of the
company's policy of seeking leases and management contracts rather than
outright purchases. He said that as the company expanded, rent payments
would increase further. Interest payments rose to Pounds 33.2m compared with
Pounds 28.8m last time.
Turnover was Pounds 291.9m, compared with Pounds 213.4m. Fully-diluted
earnings per share were 2.92p (3.29p). The interim dividend is 1.395p
(1.342p).

dives into the red

<TEXT>
BRITONS consumed a record 9.6m litres of Vimto, the favourite elixir of
Northern non-drinkers, helping JN Nichols, its manufacturer, report a 12 per
cent rise to Pounds 3.53m in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30.
The fruit and herb drink, invented in 1909 as a healthy alternative to the
evils of alcohol, was the main impetus to a 4 per cent increase in sales to
Pounds 23.6m.
Mr Simon Nichols, finance director and ardent Vimto fan, said warm weather
and better exposure in outlets throughout Britain had boosted profits in the
UK.
He gave no credit for Vimto's growing popularity to the fad for healthy
drinks. 'It has not got enough of anything that is brilliant for you,' he
said.
In Saudi Arabia, where Vimto and a date is the traditional way to break the
Ramadan fast, sales were slightly lower. Overall, export sales fell by
Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.75m. Earnings per share rose from 13.2p to 14.8p. The
interim dividend is raised from 4.6p to 5.1p.
In contrast, Bensons Crisps suffered adversely from a surge in demand for
multi-pack products.
The USM-quoted snack food group fell into the red with losses of Pounds
191,000 pre-tax for the half-year to May 30, against profits of Pounds
312,000 last time.
Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said trading conditions throughout the period
had been as 'difficult as any I have ever experienced in my 14 years in the
snacks industry'. He said consumers were increasingly buying multi-packs of
crisps from supermarkets, rather than independent retailers.
About 60 per cent of Bensons' manufacturing output is sold to independents.
First-half turnover improved to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 11.5m) Interest charges
rose by Pounds 110,000 to Pounds 143,000. Losses per share emerged at 1.7p
(earnings 2.8p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Nestle hits snag over Perrier deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEAL struck last month between Nestle and the European Commission
permitting the Swiss food group to acquire Perrier has been shaken by the
discovery that the French mineral water company does not own at least one of
the eight springs that Nestle has agreed to sell as part of the agreement.
And the real owner of the Thonon spring, the city of Thonon-les-Bains on the
south shore of the Lake of Geneva, says it will not automatically approve
the transfer of the concession that it had ceded to Perrier.
Mr Paul Neuraz, the mayor of Thonon, wrote a letter to Sir Leon Brittan, the
EC competition commissioner, on July 30 explaining the city's position, but
he has not yet received a reply.
The situation is potentially troublesome. The commission's ruling on the
Perrier acquisition obliged Nestle to sell the eight minor brands with a
view to creating a third force in the French mineral water business. It
stipulated further that the purchaser had to be approved by the commission.
Now the purchaser will also have to be approved, at least in respect of the
Thonon spring, by the city of Thonon-les-Bains.
An EC official conceded yesterday that there was a problem.
Nestle said it was unaware of the town's ownership until a few days ago.
'From the time we made our bid for Perrier in January until the commission
approved it on July 22, we were not allowed to look inside Perrier,' a
spokesman said. He added that it was possible, but not yet clear, that
another of the eight springs to be sold, Vichy, was also held under a
concession.
'I think we can find a solution that will satisfy Brussels and the legal
requirements of Thonon,' the Nestle official said.
Thonon authorities worry that they will be the losers.
Their interest is that their spring be exploited to the maximum.
The Perrier concession is due to expire in 1994, and the town has just
negotiated a boost in annual output, now about 35m litres, to 300m litres,
as a condition of renewal.
It faces the prospect that the eventual purchaser of the other minor Perrier
brands might not be as enthusiastic as Perrier about boosting output from
the spring.

FT  13 AUG 92 / UBS P&amp;D suspends analyst for refusing to halt book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the leading securities firm, has suspended the head of
its UK research department because he refused to cancel publication of a
book which is critical of the accounting techniques used by many of the UK's
biggest companies.
Mr Terry Smith was given a deadline of yesterday afternoon to tell his
publishers to abandon publication, which was scheduled for mid-September. He
refused and P&amp;D suspended him on full pay.
P&amp;D is considering taking out an injunction to try to prevent publication of
the book, called 'Accounting for Growth'.
The broking firm, which is owned by Union Bank of Switzerland, the biggest
Swiss bank, is alleging that Mr Smith breached his contract and internal
regulations. Mr Smith is contesting the allegations.
Mr Smith took on the commission for the book, from publishers Random
Century, after discussing the project with senior executives of the firm,
including Mr Hector Sants, vice-chairman. Initially, UBS had been supportive
of the project.
The firm ordered several hundred copies of the book for distribution to
clients. Mr Smith had also been asked to speak on UK accounting techniques
at a seminar for foreign investment institutions in early September.
The book is an expanded version of award-winning research published by P&amp;D
in January 1991, which highlighted a number of accounting techniques used by
UK companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the
level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets.
In the book, Mr Smith examined the accounts of the UK's 200 biggest quoted
companies to see which were using the techniques. The book stresses that
there is no implication of impropriety if a company uses the techniques.
P&amp;D became embarrassed about the book after newspaper articles highlighted
Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, as the company which used
more of these techniques than any other. Grand Met, which has a banking
relationship with UBS, complained about the articles to Mr Rudi Mueller,
head of UBS UK operations.
P&amp;D alleges that Mr Smith was in breach of regulations for not showing the
book to the 200 companies mentioned in it before the book received any
publicity.

Rumours that the Japanese Ministry of Finance would allow banks to avoid
disclosing losses on stocks were quickly denied yesterday, but the markets
believe there is something to the story. Remarkably, bank shares were marked
up despite the fall in the stock market, although the rise was small. Even
in Europe, deferring the day of reckoning by six or 12 months might occasion
a little rejoicing. Nor are UK investors immune from swallowing tall
accounting tales. That said, Japanese investors must know that no amount of
balance sheet magic can alter the awful stock and property losses facing the
banks. The pain of asset deflation will not be soothed by jiggery-pokery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queens Moat's interim figures do little to correct the reputation for
profligate expansion which caused it to turn repeatedly to its shareholders
for rights issues during the 1980s. In contrast to Rank, which has imposed
firm discipline on its capital spending during the recession, net debt rose
by Pounds 65m to around Pounds 790m during the first half. This added 15 per
cent to Queens Moat's interest bill, in turn marring a 16 per cent rise in
operating profit.
In theory, the company should now be able to contain its borrowing. It has a
sufficient presence in Europe to allow further expansion to be achieved in
ways which generate rather than consume cash, such as leasing, management
contracts and franchising. Gearing is only 60 per cent, even on the
conservative basis with which Queens Moat values its assets. So there is no
immediate need for more capital. Just the same, the market needs convincing
of the company's self-discipline before putting the shares on a rating that
reflects its ability to rise out the recession.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given previous hiccups, the UK authorities' decision to license Manoplax
must be a great relief to Boots. Now the hope is for full approval in the
US, so that Manoplax can be sold to treat heart failure either alone or in
tandem with other drugs. Unfortunately, even this success serves only to buy
Boots a little time. Its pharmaceuticals division has little in the pipeline
and Boots is a tiddler in a market increasingly dominated by leviathans.
The company could hang on and reap good margins and cash flow from
pharmaceuticals, accepting that it does not have the resources to become a
major force. But selling out to a larger company has a strategic logic. With
economies of scale in research and development, and the large sales forces
needed to make drugs into market leaders, a bigger firm might squeeze more
from Boots' existing products. A buyer might also improve Manoplax's
marketability by combining it with other heart treatments.
For Boots the trick is to choose the right moment to sell. Estimates of a
drug's earnings potential prior to launch are pretty speculative. A couple
of years from now Manoplax's prospects will be clearer, more clinical trials
will be completed and the drug will have started to acquire a track record.
If that proves the right time, it still leaves the question of what Boots
would do with the money. Shareholders must hope that the Ward White
acquisition is no guide.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Interim figures from Commercial Union suggest that the upswing in the UK
insurance cycle is arriving earlier and more strongly than the market had
dared hope. Like General Accident, CU nudged into profit in the second
quarter and sees underwriting conditions improving from here on.
Unlike the competition, however, CU has been building UK market share.
Premium income from non-life business grew at an annual rate of 19 per cent
in the first half. The natural suspicion is that this inevitably involves
sacrificing quality, but there is scant evidence of underwriting weakness in
the figures released yesterday. Indeed, CU is already making an underwriting
profit on private and commercial motor business, domestic household lines
and - were it not for the loss on bomb damage to its own headquarters -
industrial fire insurance as well. The only trouble with such success in the
present climate is the implication that CU could be less well geared for
recovery than some weaker rivals.
The investment portfolio also has a defensive aspect. Only a quarter of
assets is held in equities, with UK equities accounting for perhaps 20 per
cent of this modest total. However, CU remains bearish and sees no reason to
position itself for a recovery in UK corporate earnings. If this judgment
proves correct, its own shares could still outperform both the market and
the sector. They already offer one of the safer 7 per cent yields in the
market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market has long since given up assuming the government would live
up to its commitment to a balanced budget over the economic cycle.
Accordingly, it is unlikely to be perturbed to learn that the government
itself is now having second thoughts. Thanks partly to the weak equity
market, there has so far been little difficulty financing a PSBR which this
year will be well over Pounds 30bn. Nonetheless, the Treasury faces a
delicate task in communicating the change of heart to the outside world.
One danger is that spending ministers will conclude that the purse strings
are about to be loosened, making the autumn spending round all the harder.
Another is that financial markets will interpret the dropped target as a
sign of flagging resolve. Sterling as well as the gilts market could then
suffer at a time when the dwindling prospects for economic growth mean the
PSBR is rising as a proportion of GDP. The budget forecast was for a deficit
of 4.5 per cent this year and 4.75 per cent next. The figures now look more
likely to be around 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.
This is well below the double-digit deficits of the 1970s, but the PSBR
still requires careful handling. The government would be greatly helped by a
'yes' vote in next month's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. If
ERM stability is threatened by a 'no' vote, the fiscal screws may have to be
tightened further, whatever long-term fiscal target is by then in place.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Personal View: Models for Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LARRY SIEDENTOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British prime minister's dismissal of worries about bureaucratic rule
from Brussels as childish fantasy really will not do.
Two symptoms of the rapidly growing power of Brussels spring to mind. The
main departments of state are spending increasing amounts of their time in
dealing with Brussels regulations, either real or anticipated. Second,
leading companies are spending increasing amounts of money to maintain a
presence in Brussels, both of observers and legal representatives. The
reason is clear: they perceive that in ever wider areas of public policy
Brussels is prevailing.
What is disturbing for many people who are basically pro-European is that,
since the Danish referendum, a British government allegedly concerned about
'subsidiarity' has seemed to be playing the game of Mr Jacques Delors,
president of the European Commission, and the French government, out of a
spurious need to convince itself that our partners, especially the French
and Germans, are convinced of Britain's commitment to Europe.
In light of that, fears have been expressed about Mr John Major's
stubbornness, about the danger of inflexible commitment to the Maastricht
treaty simply because he helped to negotiate it.
But the real danger lies elsewhere. What is taking place in Europe at the
moment is a competition - one between three different models of the state to
become the model for the European Community as a whole. These models are the
French, the German and the British.
The French model is essentially a bureaucratic one, despite moves towards
decentralisation in France in the last decade. The power of the French
presidency has no real counterpart in other European countries, so that it
has often been said under the Fifth Republic that the Elysee governs through
the upper echelons of the civil service, sometimes virtually ignoring the
prime minister and cabinet.
In such a system there is inevitably a large arbitrary element in
decision-making, an element that encourages a scramble to shape decisions at
the top by interests and groups that are well-placed. The crucial thing
about the French model of the state is that it can easily be exported - for
it amounts to little more than a formalisation of a centralised
decision-making process, with a minimum of constraints. Power is the name of
the game.
The German model of the state is at the other pole from the French. Partly
inspired by American federalism as well as by the diversity of Germany
before its unification under Prussia in 1870, the German constitution takes
enormous trouble to create different spheres of authority and to protect
each from the others - minimising the risk of encroachments from the central
or federal government, not least by means of a powerful constitutional
court.
For the Germans, therefore, talk of a 'federal' future means a future with
strict constraints on the growth of central power and adherence to the goal
of a Rechstaat, the rule of law. Authority is the name of the game.
The British model of the state differs from both of these. Apart from not
being federal, and vesting sovereignty in 'the monarch in parliament', its
hallmark is its informality, its reliance on precedent and customs - its
common law character, so to speak.
In effect, the British model relies upon the existence of a distinct
political class which agrees about the methods, if not the goals, of
government. Until recent decades, it was also associated with considerable
decentralisation of political power - although that was always de facto
rather than de jure, and proved vulnerable to extreme centralising pressures
during the Thatcher years. But what has survived even the dangerous
centralisation of recent years, the virtual demise of local autonomy, is a
model of government which is essentially consensual - putting a premium on
mutual agreement governed not so much by formal principles (as in the
Rechstaat) but by 'common sense' - that term so used and abused in British
political discourse.
In spite of its absurdities, that appeal to common sense does reveal
something about the consensual character of this idiosyncratic political
system, a form of the state in which custom is the name of the game.
However, today the idiosyncratic form of the British state is the rub. For
it is a form of the state that cannot be exported. It is too embedded in a
particular social context to make export possible. It relies on instincts,
intimations and even social pressures which cannot be created ex nihilo.
Yet the British government and the political class have not really faced up
to this problem. They go on relying on that British model as if it could be
exported - and in doing so they are creating a danger that the least morally
acceptable form of the state is the form that will prevail in the European
Community.
The model that the British government has been holding up to Europe suffers
from a serious lack of clarity. But that is a key to the fact that it is a
model inspired by the British state in its traditional form, a form which
does not inspire clear constitutional ideas. The appeal to 'subsidiarity'
resembles nothing so much as the de facto decentralisation which long
accompanied parliamentary sovereignty - an alliance of central authority and
local autonomy which was in a sense devoid of principle and dependent on
manners or habits for the allocation of responsibilities between the centre
and the periphery.
But 'consent' in that traditional British form cannot now provide any
adequate guidance for the construction of the EC. All that can be said about
it is that as a model it requires more than mere economic association but
less than federalism. Apart from that, it remains guesswork.
But to offer guesswork at this stage is extremely dangerous, for it is
accompanied by strong attacks on the goal of a federal Europe - the goal
which has long inspired democrats in Germany and smaller countries such as
the Netherlands. In that sense, the reliance on the radically unclear
British model of the state has been joined to rejection of the German model
of the state for European construction.
What, then, remains? It is the French model, with its inbuilt predilection
for power rather than authority. And that, of course, is precisely what lies
behind the Maastricht agreement and pressures to move ahead rapidly along
its lines. It amounts to an attempt to impose the French state on the rest
of Europe.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Save us all from the credentialist fad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one unquestioned business belief of our time it is the need for
more vocational training in the UK. This has replaced socialism as the theme
song of John Smith's Labour party. As shadow chancellor, his answer to every
problem was to call for more training - or sometimes more 'training and
investment'.
He was, of course, knocking against an open door. One of the few academic
books defending the Thatcher decade, by Geoffrey Maynard*, made an exception
of inadequate training effort. Nor was the Conservative government
behindhand in following its critics.
Despite very recent fluctuations, central government spending on training
trebled between 1978 and 1990. Total training expenditure, including
individual loss of earnings to learn on the job, and expenditure by
business, amounted in 1986-87 - the last year for which such a comprehensive
estimate is available - to Pounds 33bn, or some 10 per cent of GDP. This was
over and above education as such.
A small dent in the contemporary orthodoxy is made in a new study by J R
Shackleton for the Institute of Economic Affairs.** It is not quite the neat
surgical demolition for which I had hoped. But it does cast some very
necessary doubts on the whole fad.
The idea that training is the main factor behind differences in national
economic performance goes back to some pioneering studies made by an
American economist, Edward Denison, in the 1960s. Denison tried to identify
the contributions to growth from factors such as the expansion of the labour
force and capital stock. His characteristic finding was that such
statistical explanations left an unexplained residual, usually accounting
for about half the growth rate in the better performing economies.
Differences in training are simply one guess out of many attempts to explain
the growth residual. But it is more difficult to establish a direct
connection. The former Central Policy Review Staff - or cabinet think-tank -
which was hardly a force against high-minded centralist thinking, failed to
do so in a report over a decade ago.
Training can be divided into transferable skills useful in a wide variety of
workplaces, and specific training of little use outside the company
providing it. Most kinds of training have an element of both, but the
distinction is clear. There is a theoretical danger of inadequate training
in transferable skills. This is because employers will lose the value of the
training they have provided to those who walk across the road to rival
companies. In that case the benefits to the economy are 'external' to the
company itself: hence the jargon word 'externality'.
But this theoretical deficiency does not mean that the more the government
spends on training, the better. Shackleton, unable to find any rate of
return estimates for vocational training, cites a Department of Education
paper for university degrees. This shows personal returns to the graduate
from higher education more than three times as high as the social return.
Both rates of return are based on differences between graduate and
non-graduate earnings. But the private costs exclude government grants and
contributions to fees and other university expenditure. Hence the much
higher return. (The almost unbelievably high return to social science
studies may be due to the inclusion of subjects such as law and business
studies.)
Estimates of both rates of return may, however, be swollen to the extent
that qualifications are used by employers as a filter to sort candidates. As
Shackleton says: 'Jobs which you could have obtained 20 years ago with
O-levels now require A-levels or even degrees if you are to have a chance of
getting them - even though the skills required have actually changed very
little. This is what American educationalists call credentialism.'
The UK has a similar proportion of the workforce with degrees and higher
educational qualifications - about 17 per cent - as its main European
competitors. Where it lags is in intermediate vocational qualifications. But
training on the job is not always worse than paper qualifications, many of
which have a remote connection with performance.
The IEA study has a useful warning about the much-praised German system
based on formal apprenticeship and compulsory instruction in vocational
schools. It is a highly corporatist system. Chambers of commerce, Land
governments and unions together lay down tight specifications for about 400
recognised occupations. The laws prevent people setting up handicraft
workshops and other enterprises without having a meister qualification: a
system gently mocked by Richard Wagner in his opera more than a hundred
years ago.
German apprenticeships last three or more years - often much too long in
modern conditions. A tell-tale sign of the real purpose of the system - to
prevent low wage competition - is that unions are pressing for yet longer
apprenticeships. Many skilled workers do not in practice use the skills for
which they are trained and subsequently work in a different occupation. One
study by an Anglo-German foundation found that samples of British young
people were more enterprising in learning new skills and in reported
experience of information technology.
In Britain, most of the government's training effort is being transferred to
the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs), which are largely under the
control of employers. But is it really such a good idea to place such
responsibilities on part-time top executives? And is not the Conservative
government's emphasis on businessmen doing its work for it indicative of a
profound confusion about how an open market economy is supposed to work? In
practice, chief executives drawn from the government Training Agency will be
in control.
Another not-so-innocent body on the horizon is the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications. By the end of 1992 it is hoped that 80 per cent
of the workforce will be subject to NVQ, which has its own ambitions. All
other certifying bodies must accept the NVQ philosophy. For government
training funds are tied to NVQ recognition. In Shackleton's words:
'Economists would not, as a general rule, accept that monopoly status of
this sort is likely to encourage independent innovation and
experimentation.'
Indeed, one of the new system's severest critics has been Sigmund Prais, who
was a pioneer of the movement to improve training and education, but now
observes: 'Too much emphasis has perhaps been placed on employers' needs for
personnel capable of doing their immediate jobs, and too little on the
longer-term needs of the economy and of individuals.'
There are some better ideas, such as the government's Training Credit, which
young people can use to select their own courses from approved lists. So
far, the take-up has been limited, where it has been tried. One problem is
that it is aimed at 16 and 17-year-olds, many more of whom are staying on at
school. An extension to 18-plus might help.
Meanwhile, a tell-tale symptom is the high ratio of people talking about
training, administering it or generally pushing it around, compared with the
numbers actually helping young people to learn. The training industry is
becoming a vast vested interest, dependent on government patronage, no worse
but no better than other such interest groups.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: UN cannot respond to crisis in Somalia if it is
starved of funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof H W SINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There are many good proposals in the article by Julian Ozanne (Personal
View: 'Hard lessons of Somalia's suffering', August 10) and one can only
hope that it will be carefully read by those in a position to help. There
are, however, two weaknesses in his proposals.
In the first place, while he blames the United Nations - which in his view
'has failed to respond adequately to the crisis' - he himself later on
points to a major reason for this, ie lack of resources. When talking of the
need for a 'massive and costly airlift' he says that 'so far the funding for
it has not been pledged'. There's the rub. Major industrial countries have
for a long time systematically marginalised the UN for any economic and
social activities. The US in particular is not even paying its current
contribution for the UN's normal work, let alone such costly new challenges.
In the second place, he gives sound advice for governments to be selective
in donations of food and to avoid high-value commodities, such as rice and
vegetable oil, which often attract violence and looting. The trouble is that
even the low-cost food which he wants sent  - ie wheat, maize and sorghum -
also invites violence and looting in the desperate situation where
everything is scarce and any kind of food becomes a weapon of war. The only
alternative would be to saturate the country with the simple foods so that
it is not worth fighting about any more.
But this raises the question of resources for such saturation and does not
deal with the problem of looting the food to starve your enemy. Mr Ozanne
says, addressing Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, one of the warlords, that 'this
type of obstruction must stop'. Does Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed read the FT?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADAM HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article on personal computers of July 17
(Management: 'Customers form queue for chips in newspapers') I would like to
clarify what is obviously a misunderstanding about Opus Technology.
The article indicates that Opus is a 'tiny company' with British Rail as its
largest customer. I would just like to point out that Opus has a turnover of
Pounds 55m, only some Pounds 5m short of Elonex, employs some 170 people and
has an installed computer base of some 300,000 systems. We were also rated
by the consultants Romtec and Dataquest to be equal No 1 in direct sales,
only a few points behind Elonex in the total PC market and ahead of Dell,
Tandon, etc.
Also, British Rail is not Opus's largest customer, as stated in your
article, and, although being a major user of Opus systems, makes up less
than 12 per cent of our total business. Opus has a corporate base which
includes some very large names and accounts for 45 per cent of Opus
business.
Finally, I would mention that Opus is one of the few (if not the only)
companies which manufacture and fully meet BS7002/IEC950 Health &amp; Safety
approval.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: A different impression of the situation in Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOANNA, RACHEL and CAROLINE LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having ourselves just returned from Cuba as independent travellers, we
find it hard to agree with James Henderson's rather naive conclusion that
the Cuban people '. . . certainly did not seem rebellious' ('Cuba: coping
with inscrutable powers', August 9). This portrays an impression of ordinary
Cubans impassive to what appeared to us to be an obviously deteriorating
situation in their country. Our experience was very different.
As Spanish speakers, we had little difficulty in striking up conversations
with Cubans who expressed a feeling of hopelessness and desperation;
imprisoned on an island and trapped in a political regime they fear and
despise.
Shops contain a bare minimum of rationed food - delivery of which is often
haphazard. People are going hungry and admit only with embarrassment and
shame that they have been reduced to supplementing their diet with cats.
Daily, people attempt in desperation to escape on inflated tyres to Florida.
The risks of death are tremendous. We met the father of one such young man
who had heard nothing from his son in weeks. He had no way of knowing
whether he was alive or dead.
Too often, travel articles go by the unwritten rule that they be 'jaunty'
and 'amusing' accounts of an unfamiliar system. Too often, this produces a
superficial and inaccurate description of a country, its people and views.
The people of Cuba certainly deserve better than this.

   From Mr CHRIS ROWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's article on trade union membership and recruitment
(Management: 'Stewards shop for new members', August 6), missed three
important points:
many of the term trends seen as working against unionisation were also
operating during earlier periods of union growth;
some unions have gained members in the 1980s;
it is not simply a question of union recruitment of members that is
critical, but their retention once they have joined.

MEETING THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE: Establishing a successful European industrial
policy
By Martin Bangemann
Kogan Page Pounds 14.95. 155 pages
The trouble with the concept of industrial policy is that it means different
things to the same people. Most of us would agree, if asked, that industry
is likely to be better run by industrialists than by civil servants. Many of
us would also confess to a nagging sense that when it comes to the national
interest, reason ought to work better than blind market forces. These
positions are basically incompatible. That does not stop us holding both at
once.
When it comes to European as opposed to national policy, it gets more
tangled again. Most informed opinion in the EC would doubtless think it a
good thing for Europe to have a competitor in, say, electronics or aerospace
big enough to take on the giants of Japan or the US. But the British or
German public might feel differently if the company in question turned out
to be Italian or French. They might also take a different view on whether
the aforesaid competitor deserved to be supported by EC funds.
Martin Bangemann, the EC commissioner for industry, has written a book which
positively bristles with suppressed contradictions. He would probably not
mind it being so described. He argues, as a politician, for compromise and
dialogue. In politics, he remarks, this kind of thing passes as normal,
since politics is considered a dirty business. Talk between government and
industry, on the other hand, is regarded as a sin against free trade. This
needs to change.
This does not necessarily make Bangemann an old-style interventionist, or
indeed a dogmatist of any identifiable kind. Backing industrial sectors on
strategic grounds, he says, only works if governments act like the private
investor and think in terms of risk and reward. Anything else leads
ultimately to subsidy. Subsidies are not a bad thing by definition, he adds
cautiously. But propping up unprofitable companies by subsidy is 'the most
expensive and detestable form of social policy: pointless work is almost
worse than no work at all'.
If the book has a unifying thesis, it is that the best hope for European
industry lies in the competitive discipline imposed by the single market.
Companies which can hold their own in the single market are ready to take on
the world. This need not mean giant European corporations: 'Small is not
always weak, and unprofitable and big is not always strong.'
On examination, this last bit looks like a tactical disclaimer. In
discussing industries as diverse as electronics, shipbuilding and aerospace,
Bangemann works round to the conclusion that what is needed is size and
agglomeration. European companies are generally not very big by comparison
with their Japanese or American competitors. Size, he says, does not
automatically mean monopoly. The European Commission needs to accept the
single market as the yardstick in applying competition policy.
All this, of course, brings Bangemann into direct conflict with his opposite
number Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner. Sir Leon has provided
a foreword to the book which is a model of the diplomatic put-down. 'A
thought-provoking book . . . An important contribution . . . Few readers, I
suspect, will accept everything in this book . . . there is much, indeed,
that I would dispute myself.'
All the same, Bangemann makes a powerful case against the idea that
industrial policy can consist of leaving industry alone: what one might term
in a UK context the Lilley doctrine. The fact is that governments are deeply
involved whether they like it or not. They are, for a start, very important
industrial customers. How they exercise their purchasing power - buying the
cheapest possible rather than the technologically advanced, or giving orders
to domestic companies to keep them in business - has a profound effect on
how competitive those companies become in a wider world. When it comes to
government orders, as Bangemann says, supply is only as good as demand.
It is also hard to disagree that the worst possible type of industrial
policy is 'that which is conducted half-heartedly and with a bad
conscience'. Indeed, the lack of a visible industrial policy can be
dangerous. The likely result, as Bangemann says, is a concealed industrial
policy, disguised as social, research or regional policy.
In the final analysis, the Bangemann approach is pragmatic. This leads to
different answers for different industries. Shipbuilding needs active EC
intervention and funding. The car industry needs the gradual introduction of
Japanese competition as a means of forcing European carmakers to address
world markets. The electronics industry needs the competition authorities to
get out of the way so that it can get on with its own amalgamation.
In each case, the approach is only as good as the analysis. In some cases
there is, as Sir Leon would say, much to dispute. It follows that one does
not come away from this short and readable book with a sense of a
master-planner at work. And, some might say, a very good thing too.

<TEXT>
Oh dear. The heart sinks to find that even BBC2, last stronghold of
non-mindless television, is succumbing. Today it begins a game show called
Ps And Qs (8.30) in which teams containing people such as sitcom actresses
and Rabbi Lionel Blue answer questions about etiquette. It is all very well
for the BBC to argue it must serve up trivia to remain competitive, but if
it fails to offer at the same time a refuge for the more demanding viewer,
it may as well fold its tents and leave the world to Rupert Murdoch.
Of course BBC2 still has some promising programmes. Business Matters (7.30)
looks at the work of behavioural psychologist Peter Honey, a specialist in
the way that people learn at work, asking whether learning is 'just common
sense' or a skill which can be improved.
In The Climbers (8.00), first of a series on the history of mountaineering,
Chris Bonington re-creates the first ascent of the Grepon by Alfred Mummery.
Talking Heads (9.35) is a repeat of Alan Bennett's play about an Equity
extra, with Julie Walters as the actress. Early Travellers In North America
(10.10) quotes Kipling on Chicago and Trollope on Washington.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Music in Tuscany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT exactly a festival, the Incontri in terra di Siena (encounters in the
Siena territory) nevertheless constitute one of the most enjoyable, musical
enterprises of the Tuscan summer. Focused largely in the little-known Val
d'Orcia, this series of chamber music recitals offers varied fare to the
inhabitants of southern Tuscany (including many Anglo-American residents)
and to visitors from other parts of Italy.
After each concert, a fixed price supper - and the price is not excessive,
considering the sumptuous and varied menus - is provided by the Fattoria
dell'Amorosa, an elegant inn-restaurant, whose owner is one of the founders
of the Incontri. These excellent meals in cool gardens have the atmosphere
of a splendid, friendly party. And so, after an encounter with some fine
music, the visitor can often encounter old friends or, in the relaxed
cordiality, make new ones.
The musical director is the cellist Antonio Lysy, grandson of the writer
Iris Origo, who - with her husband Antonio - settled in this area some 70
years ago and then made it familiar to readers everywhere with her
beautifully-told account of The War in Val d'Orcia and, later, her serene
and moving memoirs, Images and Shadows.
Lysy, who teaches at McGill University in Montreal for most of the year,
assembles for these concerts an interesting, gifted and also homogeneous
group of artists. Some - such as Jeffrey Swann and Jeremy Menuhin - are
already internationally known. Others, perhaps less familiar to an Italian
audience, are already well-launched on their careers.
The opening concert, in the gently sloping, tranquil courtyard of l'Amorosa,
was to have featured the European Community Chamber Orchestra, but they had
to cancel their Italian tour on very short notice. Fortunately, the Soloists
of Zagreb - who arrived from their war-torn country under difficult
circumstances - were able to replace the defectors and performed with
unruffled, admirable grace and precision. Particularly effective were
Janacek's youthful Suite for strings and the Haydn C-major cello concerto
no. 1 with Lysy as the stylish, understated soloist.
Last year, the Incontri invited a contemporary composer - the
Italian-Canadian John Rea - to spend a part of the summer in the Val d'Orcia
and write a piece to be given its premiere in the course of this summer's
concerts. And so, at La Chiarentana, in what was once the little square of a
rustic hamlet, Rea's Canto di Beatrice for two sopranos and two cellos was
heard for the first time.
Based on Canto XXXI of Dante's Purgatorio, the work makes ingenious use of
voices and instruments, sometimes blending them, sometimes setting them one
against the other, contrasting long held notes for one of the sopranos with
intricate vocalises for the other. Constance Novis and Isa Maria Turri were
the sensitive sopranos (not always sufficiently audible in the dispersive
open air). Lysy was joined by Eduardo Vassallo for the not-easy but
intriguing instrumental part of the piece, which lasted about a
quarter-hour.
The seventh and last concert of the series was held in the medieval keep of
the Castelluccio, whose once-stern walls enhanced spirited performances of
the Mendelssohn octet and Tchaikovsky's string sextet Souvenirs de Florence.
The loyal guests, after a final supper, left the broad green terrace above
La Foce with warm souvenirs of a musically enriched summer.

Lehal Weapon 3 is a variety show masquerading as a movie. Let us define our
terms. A movie is something that moves, both in its individual images and
its governing plot momentum. A variety show is a menu of entertainment items
composed of colourful but unrelated turns.
So here for their latest encore is that popular police double-act Riggs and
Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover), their comic rapport built as ever on
the tension between psychotic unpredictability (Riggs) and sciatic
middle-aged alarmism (Murtaugh).
Here, in an I-say-I-say cameo role, is Joe Pesci's Leo Getz, the comical
accountant from Lethal Weapon 2. Here, bounding in from the wings, is the
latest version of that silver-screen crowd-pleaser, the villain played by an
English actor (Stuart Wilson, following on the cloven heels of Rickman and
Hopkins).
And here is the plethora of stunt set-pieces - the freeway chase against the
traffic flow, the blown-up office block - that have no more strict narrative
relevance than 'Bring on the acrobats' at the Palladium.
This is not a criticism, it is a genial, realistic acceptance. What, after
all, does one do with a collection of familiar multicoloured balls except
find different ways to juggle with them? Mozart did this in The Marriage Of
Figaro, taking over from Rossini to give us The Barber Of Seville 2.
Shakespeare did it with Falstaff in The Merry Wives Of Windsor, alias Fatman
Returns.
What matters is the wit deployed, and Lethal Weapon 3 should send the
charabancs away happy. The plot about a homicidal drug-dealer (Wilson) and
his attention-catching outrages is no more than an excuse for another
action-and-comedy gala. And top of the bill are back-chat stars Gibson and
Glover.
Glover is the one gasping in disbelief or groaning in dismay while Gibson -
show him a blue touch-paper and he will light it - is the one going his
berserk way to demotion and back.
Wild of mane, jittery of smile and baby-blue of eyes, Gibson is the triumph
of the whole Lethal Weapon show. He is to law enforcement what Caligula was
to civil administration. Show him an unexploded bomb (scene one) and he will
tease it lovingly until it explodes. Serve him up a nice juicy suspect
(scene 22) and he will clatter him about the head first and ask questions,
if at all, later. This is the vigilante cop taken to its supra-mythic
extreme: beyond iconisation to the finer stratospheres of camp.
The film is in large part nonsense - have we tried to hide that from you?
But as a recent series of beer advertisements unlidding the dustbins of the
stars suggests, we are all fascinated by rubbish, especially when it comes
with a VIP stamp of ownership. This rubbish was directed by Richard Donner,
of The Omen, Superman and the earlier Lethal Weapons, and it was written by
Jeffrey Boam of LW 2 and Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Enjoy]
* * * 'Let your body rest on the clouds, let your breasts fly off into the
cosmos. . .' Thus the holistic birth adviser to her ante-natal class in
Jackie McKimmie's Waiting.
This comedy of pricked pretensions from Australia is a delight. With its
hang-loose script, home-made camerawork and cast of endearing losers - a
pregnant painter (Noni Hazlehurst) and the four women friends, plus dazed
menfolk, who crowd her battered farmhouse to await the birth - it could be a
Robert Altman film re-planted in the Antipodes.
Yet McKimmie's solidarity with her characters makes the movie more than a
multitarget satire. The bullseyes may be regularly struck: the mystic
deliriums of natural birth advisers; the hypocrisy of agitprop hobbyists
like the baby's father (Frank Whitten), fasting for freedom until his first
sight of a McDonalds; the fanaticism of career feminists, incarnated in
Fiona Press as a plump frump hoping to film the birth for a documentary
attacking the patriarchal medical profession.
But the central dilemma of surrogate motherhood - Hazlehurst is carrying the
baby for a friend who cannot have one - is explored in all its sacrificial
agony. As each character in turn is toppled from his or her high moral
perch, shaken by the tremors of the cunningly chaotic plot, our heroine is
the last to choose between dogmatic posture and truth to self.
At this point, the film swaps its raggedy colours and camera movements for a
brief spell of Australian School gilded lens-work. Is it mocking its own
cinematic ancestry? Probably. For we are soon back to chaos, visual and
comedic, as the baby is delivered into a world where l'age d'or idealism has
been finally scuppered by the human frailties we know, love and could hardly
live without.
If Waiting is a feminist's satire on Feminism - a lower-case idealist's
onslaught on Upper-case Ideologues - Without You I'm Nothing is a shot from
the same locker. Sandra Bernhard, rubber-faced US comedienne, stands and
delivers her one-woman show for the camera much as she did for six
successful months (we are told) in an off-Broadway theatre.
Targets: pretension, pop culture, white-Anglo-Saxon-protestant America and,
yes, Feminism. Method of attack: lateral lampoonery. Bernhard favours
impersonations of the famous (Cher, Streisand, Diana Ross, even Prince) to
deliver her airy, idiotic, precision-timed monologues followed by songs.
With her voice like a mosquito-whine and her face like a rubber duck pressed
against a window, this performer is an acquired taste. I did not acquire it
in her only previous major film, The King Of Comedy, where she played the
demented groupie who helps kidnap Jerry Lewis. I acquired it in five minutes
here. Bernhard's main trick is to look straight at the camera with a
withering Michigan-Jewish girl's honesty and then lie or tease like hell.
Cultural groupies are her favourite spoof victims - 'Andy (Warhol) really
understood the concept of potlatch' - closely followed by philosophising pop
singers. Musing on the decline of Western civilisation, she says 'Perhaps
Cher said it best ..': then she launches into a Cher-wigged ballad of cosmic
melancholy. Catch this dry, funny treat on screen; and then catch Miss
Bernhard live, if you will, on her late-August British tour.
* * * Finally, your choice for the kiddywinks. Would you prefer a Disney
musical about New York newsboys or a cartoon about a frog working for MI5?
Since both plumb depths of inconsequentiality unsurpassed even this summer,
you may prefer to take the children to Alton Towers or a day with Auntie
Madge.
The News Boys is like some nightmare interbreeding of Oliver] with Annie.
The screen fills with running, jumping and singing street urchins as a plot
unfolds about the Brooklyn newsboys' strike of the 1890s. 'It's a fine fine
life]' they yodel (even the lyrics are borrowed from Lionel Bart) as they
cartwheel through back-lot streets, led by Britain's Christian Bale (Empire
Of The Sun) flexing a dese-dem-dose accent as the young strike-leader.
Robert Duvall (Joseph Pulitzer) and Ann-Margret (cabaret singer) raise their
heads briefly above the parapet before retiring in shock. And Teddy
Roosevelt, or an actor-lookalike, rolls in at the close to fold up the plot.
It is as tuneless and witless an experience as I have had since the school
production I appeared in of Fings Ain't Wot The Used To Be. ('A disaster':
school magazine). Kenny Ortega directed.
As for Jon Acevski's Freddie As FRO7., a cartoon feature in which a
secret-service frog saves Britain from a wicked Snake Queen who is stealing
the national monuments (Big Ben, the Tower of London, Buckingham Palace), we
quail at thoughts of your children's revenge if you subject them to it. They
will probably arrange a return treat by taking you to the Tower of London
and leaving you there. Dotty plot, drab characterisations, tuneless tunes:
back, British animation, to the drawing board.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Richard III - Theatre/Stratford-upon-Avon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE longest-lived version of Richard III stayed unchallenged from 1700 until
the 1820s; it was written by Colley Cibber, who acted it from 1700 to 1739.
His Richard was a man of moral depravity and excellent wit, like the
Restoration fops (Lord Foppington, Sir Novelty Fashion) Cibber habitually
played.
Now another actor has followed Cibber's example in Sam Mendes' excellent
touring production of Richard III at The Other Place.
Simon Russell Beale, an accomplished foppiste, has fashioned a strange,
dangerous Richard: all irony and spite, redeemed by a scarifying wit. It is
a wonderful portrayal and a fine, intelligent performance.
Beale hobbles noisily on to a dark silent stage; a bare lightbulb glows.
Already controlling the audience, Beale begins to speak the familiar
opening; he hates the words, the verse is barbed, impatient with civility,
sneering. Careless of others' welfare and intent on his own, Beale's Richard
has edge and depth.
Overall, the performance matches Beale's standards. The set (by Tim Hatley)
combines simplicity and versatility, as befits a touring production. A bare
dais fronts a grey wall punctuated by doors. Through the openings, livid
hangings of red and blue appear. The lighting (Paul Pyant) is monochrome and
the costumes plain black and white.
This is a lesson in economy and style, even if the props (strawberries,
place markers for Council meetings, bowler hats for the Mayor and Londoners)
threaten the clean lines.
A floor map of Britain unrolls for the plotting scenes before battle, a
reminder that Richard and Richmond fought over the country's future.
Everywhere the production shows Mendes' acuity in finding a dramatic reason
for each line. Margaret's cursing of the court, intoned from a chalk circle,
makes an awkward scene powerful; it also provides a central motif, for she
repeats her curse at the demise of Rivers, Grey, Hastings and Buckingham.
Richard dies as he sees her walking across Bosworth Field.
At Bosworth, the ghosts of Richard's victims join him at table before the
battle. His awakening after this dream - a waking which made David Garrick
famous in the part (1741-76) - is beautifully controlled: quiet and honest.
Shaw rightly called Richmond's address to his army 'pious twaddle' compared
to Richard's gutsy 'To't pell mell, If not to heaven, then hand in hand to
hell.' Here, Mendes intercuts the two, making an exciting, pacy scene of the
original staid oratory.
The cast has strength enough to allow Beale's occasional indulgences:
barking dogs, pace Shakespeare, herald his entrances.
Queen Elizabeth (Kate Duchene) and the deep revolving witty Buckingham
(Stephen Boxer) are the foils to Richard, the one careful and resigned, the
other bold then scared. Mark Benton and Christopher Hunter make fine
unwilling murderers of Clarence.
The production tours England before arriving for the new year in London, 400
years after Shakespeare wrote it.
Richard III, The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon.
Then on tour, September-December: Burton-on-Trent, Macclesfield, Doncaster,
Milton Keynes, Truro, Barnstable, Middlesbrough, Carlisle, Belfast, Kendal,
Gillingham, Braintree. January-March: London, Tokyo, Rotterdam.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Arts: Mahler - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOTHAR Zagrosek conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra for Tuesday's Prom, a
mainstream collation of Weber, Schumann and Mahler. Zagrosek's work with the
BBCSO when he was a principal guest conductor was largely devoted to
contemporary repertory; here, stretching himself back into the heart of the
19th century, he revealed a finely-tuned if rather cool sense of romantic
style.
The orchestra played alertly and securely enough for him, without ever
suggesting that the performances were on the point of spontaneous ignition.
Zagrosek began with the overture to Weber's Oberon and moved on to
Schumann's First Symphony. With a little contrivance, such a programme could
have been made profoundly thematic, for during his career as a conductor
Mahler worked at performing versions of both Weber and Schumann, preparing
scores of Weber's operas (a vocal one of Oberon) and 'improved'
orchestrations of all the Schumann symphonies.
Here the versions were the usual ones: never quite fleet-footed enough in
the overture, a little under-powered in the outer movements of the symphony.
The songs for Mahler's Des Knaben Wunderhorn settings which made up the
second half were shared between Yvonne Kenny and Wolfgang Schone - who had
been drafted as a late replacement for Thomas Hampson.
Ms Kenny was in sumptuous, resplendent voice; beautifully focused in all her
contributions, never over-stressed or under-characterised. Schone was less
convincing; his approach was brazenly operatic, and his dark baritone lent
an unexpected shade to some of the songs. * * * On Sunday, the annual visit
to the Proms of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain had also
focused on Mahler, adding the deeply Mahlerian Three Orchestral Pieces of
Berg as preface.
Conducted by Tadaaki Otaka and complemented by the Bach Choir and the BBC
Welsh Chorus, the NYO took on the Second Symphony. The match was a very fair
one; the orchestra routinely brings forces of well over a 100 to its
concerts and here there were 160 players to make the sonic splendour of the
occasion never in doubt. The standard of playing too was remarkably high,
with woodwind and brass solos in particular outstanding.
But the symphony lost some of its intensity under Otaka's brittle command,
which cut rhythms down to the bare bone, and rarely gave phrases the
opportunity to expand. Despite the weight of tone, the first movement seemed
neutral and underpowered, and the numinous sense was never to be recaptured.
Jean Rigby was a compelling mezzo-soloist, Lesley Garrett a vivid, slightly
pressured soprano one. In the end, the sheer commitment of the NYO rescued
the occasion; it could, though, all have added up to much more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alex 'Pete' Hart, the President of MasterCard International, has been
elected vice-chairman of Maestro International, the company set up as an
international debit and point of sale system with its own branding.
It is an open secret that Hart has been the driving force behind the moves
to set up Maestro, which MasterCard, long the underdog in the credit card
market, believes steals a march on Visa's efforts so far in the debit card
market.
The new company's chairman will be Bernard Van Eldjik, the chairman of
Eurocard and eurocheque International, the two powerful European affiliates
of MasterCard which recently combined to set up Europay, the new
pan-European debit card scheme.
The other directors of Maestro International are Stan Paur, chairman of
Maestro USA, and chief executive officer of PULSE EFT Association, the US
cash machine network; Hans Jurgen Sengera, main board director of West
Deutsche Landesbank; John O Smith, executive vice-president of MasterCard
International; Ron Williams, director of Business Operations at National
Westminster and chief executive-designate of Europay.
Licences for Maestro have already been granted to leading banks in the CIS,
Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the UK, which
together co-ordinate about 60m debit cards.

Philip Clein and Charles Humphry have been appointed the directors of Sector
Management, a new lease and asset finance broker specialising in the local
authority market. Clein and Humphry, old Mercantile House hands before it
was bought by the ill-fated British &amp; Commonwealth in 1987, then led a
management buy-out in the same year of a vehicle called Saturn Leasing. This
was bought by Baltic shortly afterwards, where Clein and Humphrey stayed
until the end of 1990 and May 1991 respectively. While the market has been
tricky for principals such as Baltic, Humphry says it is a good time for a
broker, with low overheads, 'to poke its head above the parapet. For one
thing, people almost give you office space'.

Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim and others
(FT, July 23)
The Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) alleged that a former director general, Dr
Hashim, had defrauded it of more than Dollars 50m and that he had been
assisted by his wife and son. In the present proceedings, Mr Justice
Hoffmann refused an application by the AMF for an interlocutory injunction
to restrain the defendants, Dr Hashim, and his wife and son Jafar, from
prosecuting an action in California against Mr Salah al Hafidh, a former
employee and accountant of the AMF who had found alleged irregularities
involving Dr Hashim. The judge stated that it was well established in the
UK, as in the US, that an injunction to restrain proceedings in a foreign
jurisdiction (an 'anti-suit' injunction) should be granted only in very
narrowly restricted circumstances. The question was whether the injunction
was necessary to enable justice to be done here or to safeguard the general
jurisdiction of the court. In the instant case, there had been no
determination of the merits in the UK or the US and the court was not
satisfied that the case fell within the exceptional class of cases in which
an anti-suit injunction was needed to protect the jurisdiction of the
English court.
The Prinsengracht
(FT, July 24)
A writ in rem was addressed to the owners and/or demise charterers of
Prinsengracht by the plaintiff cargo-owners but was not served because the
vessel did not come within the jurisdiction. When it was anticipated that it
would enter an English port, the solicitors for the cargo-owners wrote to
the shipowners' solicitors requesting security for their claim so as to
avoid detaining the vessel. A bail bond was provided by an Owners' Mutual
Insurance Association, which submitted to the jurisdiction of the court.
Without waiting for the writ to be served on the ship, the shipowners
acknowledged issue so that they had taken the voluntary step of becoming
party to the action which, from that moment became in personam as well as in
rem. Their voluntary act in acknowledging issue of the writ, at a time when
no action by them was called for, was the clearest submission to the
jurisdiction, Mr Justice Sheen stated dismissing an application to set aside
the arrest of the ship. Further, the rule that bail represented the ship and
that she should be free from arrest on the same claim, was viewed in the
light of whether it was oppressive and vexatious to effect the arrest. In
the present case there had only been one arrest, which lasted less than a
day and, in looking after the cargo-owners' interests, it was natural for
their solicitors to make sure they did everything necessary to preserve
jurisdiction.
Regina v Lloyd's and others, ex parte Briggs and others
(FT, July 25)
In earlier proceeding by representatives of 800 Lloyd's Names against
members' agents, the judge had refused applications for interlocutory
injunctions to restrain the agents from drawing down on the applicants'
deposits on the ground that there was no legal basis for restraint.
Thereafter six Lloyd's Names obtained ex parte leave to apply for judicial
review from another judge against Lloyd's, its committee, chairman, deputy
chairman and a company called GW Run-Off Ltd. Granting application to set
aside that leave, the Divisional Court stated that inter alia there had been
duplication of identity of three plaintiffs in the earlier action and three
Names in the present proceedings, as well as an overlap of the issues.
Moreover, even though Lloyd's did perform public functions, the relation
ship between the Names and their agents were governed by contract. Lloyd's
powers were derived from a private Act which did not extend to any persons
in the insurance business other than those who wished to operate in the
section of the market and who committed themselves by contract.
Neither the evidence nor the submissions suggested that there was such a
public element about the relationship between Lloyd's and the Names as to
place it within the public domain and render it susceptible to judicial
review.
Total Oil Marine plc and another v Amerada Hess Ltd and others
(FT, July 30)
The Sullom Voe terminal was supplied with oil and gas by two pipelines from
the North Sea and significant capital expenditure had been incurred in the
construction of the terminal, which qualified for a grant under the Industry
Act 1972. The grant had been paid in four amounts over 1983-84 and the oil
was collected from wells owned by a number of companies. Membership of the
two groups which owned the pipelines and their shares varied from time to
time. At first instance it had been declared (a) as between the two pipeline
groups, the grant should be appropriated in proportion to their respective
participation at the time it was received; and (b) grant should be taken as
negative capital cost in the calculation of participation adjustment
payments when received. It was argued on behalf of the appellants that grant
should be allocated in the proportion prevailing when the capital
expenditure had been incurred. Dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal,
by a majority, stated that the whole tenor of the provisions was that there
should be a running account in each year and that expenditure and receipts
were to be debited or credited in the proportion as prevailing that year. In
agreement with the judge, therefore, it was held that the grant was to be
allocated to pipeline groups in the proportions prevailing when received.
Common sense suggested, moreover, that the grant was to be taken into
account as a deduction or negative capital expenditure since the apparent
aim of the provisions was to transfer the burden of past capital expenditure
to new entrants or to those whose participation had increased.
Clifford Chance v Silver
(FT, July 31)
Clifford Chance acted as solicitors in the sale of property in a transaction
which involved inter alia a sale and lease. The deposit payable under the
first agreement (ie the sale) was Pounds 100,000. The deposit cheque was
sent to the solicitors to hold it until contracts were exchanged but after
exchange of contracts, the cheque was dishonoured on presentation. Judgement
was given for Clifford Chance at first instance but on appeal, it was argued
inter alia that Clifford Chance were never 'holders in due course' of the
cheque, ie that they had not taken the cheque for value with no notice of
the defect in its title. Rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeal stated
a cheque might be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose
only under section 21 of 1882 Bills of Exchange Act. In the present case,
the delivery of the cheque had been conditional and the contract between
endorser and endorsee had been incomplete. However, once the contracts for
sale of the property were exchanged so that the conditions stipulated were
fulfilled, the cheque was then negotiated to Clifford Chance who then became
holders in due course. However, following the dishonour, a Pounds 50,000
banker's draft had been sent in part payment of the cheque to a firm acting
for the lessors and the court gave unconditional leave to defend in relation
as to the part payment.

FT  13 AUG 92 / People: Nelson moves to avoid conflict of interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Elizabeth Nelson, one of the leading lights of the market research industry,
has stepped down as chairman of Taylor Nelson AGB, Britain's biggest market
research company which she helped to found.
The 60-year-old Nelson indicated some time ago that she intended to retire
following her company's Pounds 15m acquisition of AGB, part of the late
Robert Maxwell's private business empire. In March she was appointed
chairman of the UK Ecolabelling Board, part of an EC initiative to identify
products which are less harmful to the environment than others.
It had been thought that she would wait until a permanent successor could be
found at Taylor Nelson, which more than doubled in size with the AGB
acquisition. However, it seems she was concerned about possible conflicts of
interest and was keen to sever her ties completely so that she could 'pursue
more freely' her new role. The Ecolabelling board is likely to need a
considerable amount of market research data.
John Treasure, 67, will take over the non-executive chairmanship of Taylor
Nelson for the time being, pending a long-term external appointment.
Treasure has been on the board for three years and is a well known figure in
the communications and market research industry; he is a former Dean of the
City University Business School.
Nelson says she is 'sure the ecolabelling scheme will be a great success'.
The UK has led the way in Europe in proposing criteria for the first award
of Ecolabels - for washing machines and dishwashers. Further studies for
criteria for light-bulbs and hairsprays are nearing completion and the first
European ecolabels could start appearing in the shops by the end of the
year.
At the end of July the government named Nelson's 14-strong board, which
includes a director of Tesco, a professor of environmental technology and a
vice-chairman of the Consumers Association.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Critical smoke obscures disciplinary
reforms - The tensions surrounding the policing of standards within the
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the disciplinary procedures of the professional accountancy bodies are
once more eased into the dock, any chance of their receiving a fair hearing
is likely to be rendered impossible by the clamouring of the lynch mob.
Criticism has been unleashed from both external observers and those within
the profession in the last few months. Only the most recent example was the
professional conduct hearing at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales against Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers
&amp; Lybrand over an alleged conflict of interest surrounding their appointment
as administrators to Polly Peck International.
Some pour scorn on why these hearings are taking so long, and why they have
now been postponed, apparently at least until mid-October. Others attack the
decision to keep the hearings secret, even from other council members who
sit on the disciplinary committee itself.
But the Polly Peck incident is not so exceptional. At a packed meeting in
November last year arranged by the London Society of Chartered Accountants,
small practitioners angrily accused the English institute of protecting the
larger firms.
Why, they demanded to know, was no action being taken to investigate the
accountants' role in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International? (The announcement of just such an investigation was not
ultimately made until this April.) Several disgruntled members said that if
they had been involved in such a scandal, they would have been summarily
dismissed from the institute.
The fact is that any disciplinary action - or the apparent lack of action in
a high-profile scandal - is always likely to generate grievance. Much may be
ungrounded, yet among the unfair vocal attacks, some faint legitimate voices
are being drowned out.
The professional bodies have done much to bring about reform. Mr Ian
Plaistowe, who became the new president of the English Institute in June,
has said that his vision of the disciplinary system is to be 'firm, fast and
fair'. He has dubbed attempts to mould the system to this vision as among
the highest priorities during his year in office.
A large number of the most significant reforms pre-date Mr Plaistowe's
appointment. Many reflect the influence of Mr Brian Harris, a lawyer who
heads the institute's professional conduct department.
Only last week, the most recent institute council approved a thick report
from a working party on its relationship with firms. This will open the way
to action being taken directly against firms rather than just the
individuals within them, currently only allowed in the regulated areas of
insolvency, audit and investment business.
Earlier this year, the institute appointed an 'ombudsman' to mediate on
behalf of people who had made complaints against professionals that the
disciplinary committee had decided not to pursue.
A change in the by-laws has meant that the institute can now be much more
open in disclosing when a major investigation has been launched. Another has
placed an obligation on accountants to report to the institute any serious
misconduct by members which they come across in the course of their work.
The disciplinary penalties meted out to accountants found guilty of
misconduct have been simplified, and the level of fines imposed has risen.
Professional fees charged by practitioners can be reduced by the committee,
and the institute has the power to intervene directly in the operation of a
practice.
The most extreme case of fines has come in the operation of the Joint
Disciplinary Scheme (JDS), the body that considers matters of significant
public interest and is operated in conjunction with the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants.
In its report on Milbury in the spring, Arthur Young became the first
accountancy firm to be fined by the JDS, for its failure as auditor to
highlight 'seriously misleading' figures in the 1984 accounts of the
collapsed house-building group. It was fined Pounds 100,000 plus Pounds
40,000 in costs.
Other proposed JDS changes - already reflected in the workings of the
disciplinary committee - allow simplified and more rapid processing of
complaints when the firm or individual under scrutiny admits responsibility.
JDS reports are already released in full. Now discussion is underway to
provide more detail on the results of the other, more minor disciplinary
hearings.
Many of the complaints about disciplinary procedures are related to the
delays between an allegation and its resolution. Mr Brian Harris says this
is partly the result of the rising workload of complaints, reflecting a
similar trend by many professional bodies.
The institute received about 3,500 complaints last year, up 20 per cent on
the previous year, 10 per cent on the year before that - and likely to rise
by another 20 per cent this year. But most of these cases are handled
without any formal proceedings, and the vast majority concern often trivial
difficulties in relation to very small practitioners.
Most criticism centres on the handful of high-profile cases taken on by the
JDS. Part of the delay is explained by the need to allow the cases to be
adequately prepared and to allow the chance for appeals. Part is
inextricably tied into the delays in the legal system, since the JDS cannot
take action while a court case is underway.
Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund management company, for example, was
closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988. Its JDS case was
only re-opened in February, after prosecutions in the courts had finished.
That leaves one vital concern unanswered, however: the openness of
proceedings. The JDS cases are at least reported in full on their
conclusion, giving outsiders the chance to see details of the evidence and
arguments presented. There is no such luxury for the hearings of the
disciplinary committee.
The tension within the institute is whether its apparently growing desire to
be seen to be fair will conflict with the effectiveness of its procedures.
A paper circulating internally stresses the risks of defamation, contempt,
restriction of free discussion, and the level of co-operation with other
regulatory bodies if sensitive information is discussed too openly.
It may well be that these barriers prove unsurmountable. If the institute is
determined to be seen to be objective, it must have to face up to an
unpleasant question which has been rather buried over the last few months:
whether there is an irreconcilable conflict over its roles as both a trade
association and a professional regulator for accountants.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Party invites in the
post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S leading political parties must be especially keen to recruit more
paid-up members, given the precarious state of their finances.
The Conservatives and Labour alike have been scrambling to get their costs
under control since last April's general election ended nearly 18 months of
virtually continuous campaigning.
Labour's national membership scheme was described as 'a fiasco if not a
disaster' by Mr David Hopper, the party's auditor, at last year's party
conference.
Though the number of individual Labour party members climbed by 45,000 to
311,152 between 1988 and 1990, the total has fallen by half since 1979.
Viewed in this light, the subject of the Direct Marketing Association's
proposed autumn conference season road-show seems shrewdly chosen.
The trade body proposes to focus on how to turn those who voted in April
into members and/or active supporters of the party that they voted for.
The thrust of their argument will be that targeted mail-shots are a more
effective way of achieving this than the traditional method: dispatching
party workers to trudge around housing estates knocking on doors.
The key to this approach lies in exploiting the detailed canvass returns
that will have been assembled by constituency parties during the course of
the general election campaign.
Rather than being locked away in a cupboard until the next election, these
should be used as the basis for compiling lists of sympathetic voters, the
association will argue.
Once these voters are identified, a carefully-drafted letter, addressing the
recipient individually and concentrating in particular on local issues, may
jolt them into becoming members or contributing more actively to the party's
support.
'What we are saying is your canvass returns are a very valuable database,'
says Ms Angela White, external relations director for the Royal Mail and one
of the road-show speakers. 'If you were in business, you wouldn't be
neglecting it for four years.'

FT  13 AUG 92 / Labour to oppose Scottish 'tap tax'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR PARTY yesterday promised to campaign vigorously against water
privatisation in Scotland.
It also challenged the government to explain why what it called the English
water 'disaster' should be extended northwards.
Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, called on Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, to explain why further water privatisation did not appear in the
Conservative party's manifesto for the general election.
Mr Clarke said water privatisation had led to a 50 per cent increase in
bills, cost the country Pounds 7bn, resulted in nearly 1m court summonses
from private water companies and landed thousands of consumers in debt.
Water in Scotland is supplied by regional councils, whose future is
uncertain under local-government reorganisation.
Last week the government appointed an Edinburgh merchant bank as consultant
on the future of the industry, a move believed to foreshadow some degree of
privatisation.
Opposition parties say the 'tap tax', as they call it, is a political issue
that may meet a hostile reaction among even government supporters.
Mr Clarke said: 'With no hint of privatisation plans in the Tory manifesto
at the last election, and no arguments to be made for privatisation in the
light of the disastrous experience of privatisation in England and Wales, we
will argue there can be no case for a sell-off in Scotland.'
The Labour campaign will include demands that the government should
concentrate on making Scottish water cleaner and safer, 'not private and
more expensive'.
The government accused Labour of 'crying foul' long before a decision had
been taken. Sir Hector Monro, Scottish office minister, said Labour was
'scraping around' for an issue to unite warring factions within the party,
rather than addressing the real needs of the water industry.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Building societies face new squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES have been asked by the Building Societies Commission, the
industry watchdog, to consider ways of tightening up their provisions
against loan losses.
The move is likely to squeeze building society profits further by forcing
societies to put more money aside at a time when they are already suffering
from the decline in house sales.
Mr Harry Walsh, deputy chairman of the Building Societies Commission, has
written to the Building Societies Association asking for its views on new
guidelines on provisions after consulting its members.
This is the second year in succession in which the BSC has tried to
introduce new guidelines for loan loss provisions as a result of the
deepening troubles of the mortgage market. Before 1990, loan losses were
usually so small that the definition of building society provisions was not
an issue.
Last year societies were forced to put aside a total of Pounds 1.23bn
against bad loans, and the figure for the coming year is expected to be
higher. About half a dozen societies, including Town &amp; Country and
Leamington Spa, have been driven into pre-tax losses and been forced to give
up their independence after having to make heavy provisions against bad
loans.
Last year the commission's guidelines encouraged societies to make specific
provisions for losses on residential mortgages for all cases where payments
are more than three months in arrears and it is virtually certain that the
lender will make a loss.
Most societies also make general provisions against likely losses on their
mortgage book as a whole. They also 'suspend' interest on loans with a low
chance of recovery, thus reducing the value of the interest receivable on
their accounts. Methods for doing so vary greatly between societies.
The commission says it wants a standard method of recognising the interest
due on non-performing loans and the formal adoption of a three months
cut-off point for specific provision and of a standard definition of
arrears. It also wants societies to consider methods of security valuation.
The commission says it is aware that tighter guidelines on provisions may
mean reduced profits for some societies. It says societies should see higher
provisions not as a sign of weakness but as part of the process of
addressing the difficulties of the market and creating a realistic financial
base for the future.
Societies have been asked to give their views by August 31 to enable the
commission to have its new guidelines in place well before the end of the
year when most societies prepare their next set of annual results.
Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth-largest building society, said it was
cutting rates for its 3.2m savers by an average 0.3 per cent from Saturday.
The move follows similar cuts by Nationwide and Bradford &amp; Bingley and
suggests that large societies are determined to stave off any increase in
mortgage interest rates as long as possible.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Boost for Cardiff docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NCM CREDIT Insurance, the Dutch company that paid Pounds 70m for the Export
Credits Guarantee Department's short-term business last December, is to
locate its headquarters in Cardiff's docklands development.
It will lease a 115,000 sq ft building being erected by Grosvenor Waterside,
property arm of Associated British Ports.
As a result of the sale, NCM has had to move out of Crown premises in
Cardiff that are open only to government or non-profit-making organisations.
NCM's decision means Grosvenor Waterside has attracted two large concerns to
its 160-acre development within Cardiff Bay. Last year, the Welsh Health
Common Services Authority, a public-sector body, announced that it would
take an office block nearby.
The NCM decision is a boost for the Cardiff Bay project, set up five years
ago to redevelop 2,700 acres of Cardiff's docklands.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Personal computer market 'stagnant'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK market for personal computers is stagnant and plummeting prices
appear to have done little to stimulate sales, according to a survey by
Context, a London-based consultancy.
The volume of indirect sales - sales through dealers or high street shops -
increased in the 12 months to June by only 0.5 per cent over the same period
last year, the survey says. In earlier years, sales have grown by more than
20 per cent annually.
The total number of machines sold in the period was just under 800,000.
Indirect sales account for some 75 per cent of all UK sales of personal
computers.
Fierce price cutting has had a powerful effect on revenues. In the same
period, the total value of sales fell 16 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Jeremy Davies, senior partner at Context, said buyers were confused over
technology and prepared to delay purchases to see if prices fell further.
'PC sales have stalled and it is not only the effect of the recession,' he
said.
'At the beginning of the year, buyers were saying 'Why should I buy now? If
I wait six months, I can get more PC for less money.' Six months later, the
same thing is happening again.'
Context's figures do not take into account machines sold directly - by mail
order, for example - but Mr Davies said he estimated the whole market had
grown at most by only a few per cent over the year.
Manufacturers have been cutting prices heavily - last year prices fell on
average 40 per cent. Components have become cheaper and competition has
intensified. IBM and Compaq, the market leaders, have both introduced new,
inexpensive computer lines to compete with Asian manufacturers.
Dealers believe prices may fall a further 20 per cent this year, adversely
affecting gross profit margins for manufacturers and distributors and
further confusing potential customers.
Context's figures show that IBM (21.2 per cent), Compaq (19.7 per cent) and
Apple (12.2 per cent) have consolidated their positions and now account for
more than 50 per cent of sales through the indirect channel in the UK.
The fastest-growing market sector is notebook personal computers, which
account for 17 per cent of sales, compared with 13 per cent a year ago.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Northern Ireland bucks downward trend in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND fell across all parts of the UK except Northern Ireland over the past
four months, according to the latest regional trends survey from the
Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies Limited.
The biggest falls in demand occurred in the south-west and the Yorkshire and
Humberside areas. Only the east Midlands, East Anglia and Northern Ireland
reported a small rise in output. The outlook is brightest in the north of
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where orders and output are expected to
stabilise in the months ahead.
The figures show the difference between those companies reporting an
increase in orders over the four months to July and those reporting a
decrease. The resulting percentage point balance gives a good indication of
the trend in orders.
North of England
New orders balance: - 1
Conditions are slightly more optimistic than elsewhere in the country.
Although home and export orders were flat over the past four months, both
are now expected to increase. The decline in output and employment slowed
while business confidence continued to increase. The proportion of firms
working below capacity was lower than elsewhere in the UK.
Yorkshire and Humberside:
New orders balance: - 29
A sharp decline in demand for intermediate products - particularly chemicals
and metals - affected the region badly. Yorkshire and Humberside was among
the regions most disappointed by the volume of orders received over the past
four months compared with expectations in April. Business confidence has
fallen sharply and demand and output are expected to remain flat over the
next four months.
East Midlands:
New orders balance: - 6
Fared better than other regions over the past four months, with a small
increase in output, resulting in a slowdown in the rate of job losses.
However, business optimism has fallen sharply and uncertainty over demand is
constraining many firms from investing more.
East Anglia:
New orders balance: - 7
One of the few regions to report a small rise in output over the past four
months, but that rise is now expected to be reversed. Although optimism
about exports has stabilised, general business confidence has fallen.
London and south-east:
New orders balance: - 19
Demand for domestic goods fell over the past four months, but held up for
exports. The decline in output accelerated and the proportion of companies
working below capacity was one of the highest in the country. Redundancies
have slowed slightly.
South-west:
New orders balance: - 33
Exports failed to live up to April's expectations with the result that
demand and business confidence fell sharply over the past four months. The
proportion of firms working below capacity is now higher than in any other
region, and that has led to heavy job losses. Investment intentions weakened
slightly.
West Midlands:
New orders balance: - 19
One of four regions where employment is falling the fastest. However, the
fall in output was no longer steeper than that elsewhere in the country.
Business confidence was unchanged and a small rise in production is
expected. Investment plans indicate a fall in spending on buildings, but
spending on plant and machinery should now stabilise.
North-west:
New orders balance: - 16
In spite of a fall in orders and optimism over the past four months, export
and total orders are expected to increase. Job losses are still heavy and
show little sign of easing off. Investment is expected to decline at a
faster rate.
Wales:
New orders balance: - 2
Export demand remained buoyant and the outlook is brighter than elsewhere.
Output levels have remained stable since the beginning of the year -
although sales fell slightly over the past four months. Overseas sales and
home orders are expected to rise, so total orders and output levels may
increase.
Scotland:
New orders balance: - 14
Along with the north of England, Scotland continues to be least badly
affected by the recession. Business optimism has been maintained in spite of
a continuing decline in orders and output. Both are expected to fall again
in the next four months. However, export orders - which showed a small
increase over the past four months - are expected to rise again. Capacity
utilisation remains low and the outlook for investment in buildings, plant
and machinery is poor.
Northern Ireland:
New orders balance: +31
The outlook in Northern Ireland is rosier than anywhere else in the UK.
Orders rose for the first time for two years because of stronger domestic
demand. Business confidence grew as companies increased production levels in
response to rising demand over the past four months. Investment intentions
have risen and firms now expect to spend more on plant and machinery in the
next 12 months.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Pounds 80m station plan for Channel tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL publicised fresh plans yesterday for an international railway
station at Ashford, Kent, to serve Continental trains passing through the
Channel tunnel.
If the government approves the scheme, the Pounds 80m station should provide
people in south-east England with a way of joining Channel tunnel expresses
without having to travel into central London.
Plans for the station have met a series of delays. Last October, Eurotunnel,
the company building the Channel tunnel, tried to embarrass the government
into hastening construction by devising a Pounds 4m temporary solution using
prefabricated huts. Two months later, the Department of Transport threw out
BR's plans for a Pounds 140m scheme on the grounds of expense.
BR's new and less ambitious scheme, presented to Kent County Council
yesterday, would expand the existing Network SouthEast station to
accommodate international and domestic trains, and give it an international
departure lounge and 2,000-space carpark.
If the government provides money for the station in this autumn's public
spending round, it should open in 1994. Given the delays to the construction
of Channel tunnel express trains, it may yet appear in time to serve the
first Continental services.
Services from the station would go to, among other places, Lille, Paris,
Brussels, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Cologne.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Gulf war echoes reverberate through Yemen's economy: Aid and
remittances from Arab neighbours have all but dried up, leaving only
austerity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC WATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEMEN continues to pay a high price for its stance on the Gulf war more than
a year after the end of hostilities. Before the war, as one local
businessman puts it, the country's economy relied largely on 'aid,
remittances, and some austerity'.
But the reaction of Yemen's main pre-war benefactors to its Gulf war stand
has deprived the country of much of the first two, leaving it with
larger-than-ever doses of the third.
Yemen remains isolated for failing to support the US-led coalition against
Iraq and has since suffered economic hardship with few signs of this easing.
Any improvement in Yemen's prospects depends on its developing better
relations with Saudi Arabia and northern neighbours in the Gulf, a view made
clear by Mr David Mack, the US assistant deputy secretary of state. 'US
relations with all the Arab Gulf states are exceptionally strong and close.
It is difficult to invigorate relations with Yemen unless it achieves a
minimum of rapprochement with the Gulf countries,' Mr Mack said.
But Saudi Arabia and Kuwait remain resentful over Yemen's stand during the
war. Although the Yemenis condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, they
failed to support restoration of the ruling Al-Sabah family and, worse in
terms of their relations with Gulf neighbours, they criticised Saudi Arabia
for allowing foreign troops into the region. Faced with hostility to their
own position in the war from their southern neighbour, the Saudis responded
in September 1990 by cutting aid to Yemen and by expelling around 1m
Yemenis.
The economic effects were immediate. The loss of remittances ended a main
source of hard currency for Yemen, and the sudden 10 per cent increase in
the country's population, added further burdens to the chronically
unbalanced economy.
Yemen is already the most populous, with 13m people, and least prosperous
state in the Arabian peninsula, relying on foreign aid estimated at Dollars
500m (Pounds 261.7m) annually and on remittances of up to Dollars 1.5bn a
year. Its oil income, from exports and sales of new concessions over the
past year, amounted to Dollars 1.15bn.
As a result Yemen was last year unable to meet some four-fifths of its
foreign debt commitments. Outstanding foreign debt is now put at Dollars
7.8bn, two-thirds of which is owed to eastern European countries. Moreover,
fast-rising inflation and unemployment have contributed to social tensions
which last October erupted in a rash of anti-government riots.
Though the government of General Ali Abdullah Saleh has been able to contain
such problems, dissatisfaction with the economy remains high. To try and
temper this discontent, the government has sought recourse largely to
promises of future prosperity from the country's promising oil reserves.
Officially referred to as 'transitional' the Saleh regime came to power with
the unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990 and is charged with
effecting democratic reform and multi-party elections by November this year.
The process of democratisation has faced difficulties. There have been
assassination attempts on members of the Yemen Socialist Party, including
the prime minister, but so far no one has been brought to trial. The
government has encountered opposition from fundamentalist groups, which
although few in number, may be linked with international Islamic
organisations bent on disrupting democratic movements throughout the Arab
world.
With such backing local groups have persistently opposed Yemen's democratic
reforms and the worsening economy has played into their hands. The spectre
of Algeria is on the minds of Yemen's rulers, who fear that fundamentalists
may have fertile campaigning ground while the economy remains so
beleaguered. There is therefore the sense of a urgency to exploit the
country's newly found oil reserves.
Few Yemenis doubt that Saudi Arabia is behind efforts to undermine their
emerging democracy. 'The Saudis', said one businessman, 'are using our
position on the Gulf war as a pretext. Their real aim is to weaken our
economy in order to destroy our unity and democracy'.
Armed with such suspicions, Yemen may indeed have difficulty in affecting
any rapprochment with its Gulf neighbours or with the west. Faced with
domestic recessions the US and UK are not likely to jeopardise their trade
relations with the Gulf by assisting Yemen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CALM returned yesterday to the streets of Shenzhen, the southern Chinese
city which earlier this week witnessed the worst civil unrest on the
mainland since the June 1989 democracy protests in Beijing.
An estimated 1m people went to the city on the Hong Kong border over the
weekend to apply for forms letting them participate in a lottery for new
shares to be issued on the local exchange. But allegations of official
corruption in the distribution of the forms sparked a riot.
Share trading resumed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, after Tuesday's
suspension, and is reported to have been orderly. The index of locally owned
'A' shares fell 17 points to 294 while the index of 'B' shares, owned by
foreigners, declined by a more subdued 2.98 to 178.51.
China's other stock exchange, in Shanghai, saw the index of 'A' shares fall
by 9.5 per cent, following an 11 per cent slide on Tuesday. Traders said the
movement was not connected with Shenzhen, but resulted from expanded market
listings.
Foreign investors were sanguine about prospects for China's stock markets.
One Hong Kong fund manager said yesterday the riot was 'an unfortunate event
but not one that was particularly worrying'.
It is too early to say what implications the riot holds for China's economic
reform movement, but Beijing's response has so far been controlled.
Hong Kong media reported that Lou Gan, secretary of the State Council, or
cabinet, had arrived in Shenzhen to conduct an inquiry into the riot and the
city's procedures for issuing new shares. It was also reported that Zou
Jiahua, a vice-premier, had taken overall charge of co-ordinating the
central government's response to the situation.
Zheng Liangyu, mayor of Shenzhen, said on Tuesday: 'We won't deny there is
imperfection in the current sales method, since we are in fact very
inexperienced.'
China plans to set up a nation-wide computer clearing network to link banks
in leading cities, and a computer trading and clearing system for stocks,
Reuter reports from Singapore.
Li Ye, general director of the financial science and technology division of
the People's Bank of China in Beijing, said the World Bank would provide a
loan under its technical assistance programme. Computerisation is seen as a
big step in China's financial reforms.

GOVERNMENT jet fighters yesterday bombed rebel positions east of the
battle-scarred capital Kabul, according to Afghan and western sources, AP
reports from Kabul.
For the past week, guerrillas loyal to Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his
hardline Hezb-e-Islami group have rained thousands of rockets on Kabul,
which is controlled by other factions. Government officials said more than
1,000 people were killed or wounded.
Since ousting a Communist regime in April after a 14-year civil war, rebel
factions have engaged in an internal power struggle and are divided along
religious, ethnic and tribal lines.
Defence ministry officials yesterday claimed they had forced Mr Hekmatyar's
rebels out of the city. Mr Hekmatyar has promised to continue his war with
Afghanistan's new Islamic government until a powerful Uzbek militia, which
controls Kabul's combined military and civilian airport, is evicted from the
capital.
Western diplomats said reinforcements for the Uzbek militia troops led by
Gen Rashid Dostam, arrived in Kabul yesterday from his headquarters in
northern Afghanistan.

MR Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the hardline Islamic Afghan leader is operating
training camps for anti-government forces in Tajikistan, bolstering the
already-powerful opposition, according to KGB and diplomatic sources. The
military aid is fueling the warfare that has plagued the Central Asian
nation of 5m people ever since the Soviet Union was dissolved in December.
Fighting has killed between 500 and 2,000 people in the last three months.
More than 100,000 non-combatants have fled, mostly Uzbeks and other
non-Tajiks who have been attacked by Tajik nationalists, officials say.
Tajik officials say President Rakhmon Nabiyev's control is effective in just
one of Tajikistan's five regions.
Three or four hundred men have already been armed in camps run by Mr
Hekmatyar near the northern Afghan town of Imam Sahib, and returned to
Tajikistan to fight, said Col Jurabek Aminov, Tajikistan's deputy KGB chief,
speaking in the capital of Dushanbe. He said 400 more were under training in
the camps.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Bush interview underlines rift over abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Republican party's divisions over abortion were underlined on Tuesday
night when President George Bush expressed much less hard-line opposition to
it than does his party's platform committee.
In a television interview, Mr Bush was asked a similar question to that put
to Vice-President Dan Quayle last month: What advice would he give his
grand-daughter, should she become pregnant and want an abortion?
Like Mr Quayle, who was subsequently 'corrected' by his wife, Mr Bush
responded that, although he was offended by the very idea of abortion and
would try to talk his grand-daughter out of it, the decision ultimately was
hers and he would stand by her.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate and a believer in
freedom of reproductive choice, said he understood Mr Bush's position 'as a
grand-father'. Other Democrats criticised it, charging that Mr Bush and Mr
Quayle seemed to want rights for their own families that would be denied to
others by a ban on abortion.
The president's comments, although repeatedly qualified by his campaign
aides after the interview was broadcast, is in sharp contrast with both the
sentiments and actions expressed by the party committee, preparing the
platform for the Republican convention next week in Houston, and with many
of Mr Bush's public pronouncements on the issue.
The committee overwhelmingly voted that the platform should again contain,
as it has since 1980, a demand for a constitutional amendment banning
abortion. It did so after an emotional debate in which many delegates
recounted personal experiences with the consequences of abortion.
Many demanded there should be no exemptions to an outright ban, even in
cases where pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.
Republican pro-choice advocates, increasingly vocal but outnumbered on the
committee by the pro-life movement, conceded there was little chance of
forcing a floor debate at the convention. This can now only be achieved if a
majority of the delegates from six states sign a motion to this effect.
However, a Washington Post poll of Republican delegates found 55 per cent
opposing a constitutional ban and only 28 per cent in favour.
Elsewhere, the debate over 'family values' continued to rage. In California,
the American Bar Association convention abandoned its previous neutrality
and passed a motion pledging to fight any laws restricting the
constitutional right to an abortion.
Mr Quayle attacked the ABA, charging that the country's trial lawyers were
'in the pocket' of Mr Clinton. The convention earlier had given an award to
Professor Anita Hill, whose charges of sexual harassment against Judge
Clarence Thomas, now in the Supreme Court, gripped the nation last year. Mr
Quayle asserted that most Americans believed Judge Thomas, not Professor
Hill.
In Washington, the Senate passed a family leave bill, providing up to 12
weeks of unpaid leave, but not for companies with fewer than 50 workers.
This controversial measure is likely to attract a presidential veto.
Congressman Ben Nighthorse Campbell won, on Tuesday, the Senate Democratic
primary in Colorado. If he beats the Republican Mr Terry Considine in
November, in what is predicted to be a close race, he will be the first
full-blooded American Indian in the Senate.

remain subdued, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
The figures were in line with forecasts in financial markets and followed a
0.2 per cent increase in producer prices in June.
Excluding prices of food and energy, which tend to be volatile, the 'core'
producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.5 per cent in the
past year. It has held steady at this level for several months.
The moderation of wholesale price inflation was interpreted in financial
markets as further evidence of an unusually lacklustre economic recovery.
Most analysts expect it to feed through into lower consumer price inflation,
which is running at an underlying rate of about 3.5 per cent.

A SOUTH African police sergeant yesterday described the operational error
that lead to the erasure of 13 hours of tape recorded radio calls on the
afternoon and night of the June 17 Boipatong massacre.
The Goldstone judicial commission investigating the massacre was told that
taping equipment used by the area's internal stability unit had been
operated incorrectly since its installation in March this year. Sergeant
Ilse O'Reilly, the officer in charge of the operations control room, told
the commission that this was discovered only after the massacre, in which 42
people were killed.
Sergeant O'Reilly said that the machine used ordinary commercial tapes, but
was able to record on only one side. Material was erased if the tape was
turned over.
The day after the massacre, she told the commission, she had turned the
tapes in the machine over. As a result, all conversations between about 2 pm
on June 17 and 3 am on June 18 had been erased.
Meanwhile the government has responded to criticism of police treatment of
people in their custody, announcing the appointment of six inspectors to
monitor an investigate conditions under which people were held.
The move follows allegations by a leading pathologist that police brutality
had accounted for the deaths of scores of prisoners. Since the claim was
made a fortnight ago, eight people have died in custody. A further meeting
between the government and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) is expected to
take place next week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S energy sector has emerged from the Nafta negotiations largely
unscathed. The Mexican government will not privatise Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), while US and Canadian oil companies will not be allowed to explore
for oil, operate refineries, nor open petrol stations, in Mexico, writes
Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
The US also appears to have been unable to compel Mexico to offer it a
guaranteed supply of oil.
Even so, Mexico has agreed to open 50 per cent of the procurement by Pemex
and the Federal Electricity Commission to US and Canadian companies in the
first year, increasing to 70 per cent over eight years and with no
reservation after 10 years.
Such companies will receive cash payments for their work, rather than a
percentage of the oil they find. However, the Mexican government has agreed
to allow 'performance' contracts, where contracted companies receive bonuses
if they strike oil.
Pemex plans to invest Dollars 20bn from 1990-95, most of it in exploration,
drilling and new refineries.
Mexico has agreed to open all but a handful of petrochemicals to foreign
investment, and will allow foreign gas companies to sell gas directly to
Mexican industrial companies, under the supervision of Pemex.
The accord abides by Mexico's nationalist constitution and so will be hailed
as a victory by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and his
negotiators. However, US and Canadian oil and gas companies will be able to
increase their business in Mexico if the treaty is implemented.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been Mexico, rather than the US or Canada, that has made the most
concessions in negotiations covering the financial sector, largely because
its banking system is the most protected of the three, and because the
Mexican government is keen to introduce more competition, writes Damian
Fraser in Mexico City.
Mexico will increase, over seven years, the maximum market share for US and
Canadian investors in banking from 8 to 15 per cent, and in securities from
10 to 20 per cent.
By the year 2000, both the US and Canada will be granted full treatment on
an equal footing with the local banks.
The share any individual US or Canadian bank can acquire will initially be
limited to 1.5 per cent of banking equity.
Mexico now limits foreign investment to 30 per cent in any individual bank,
and 49 per cent in an insurance company.
The concessions are unlikely to change Mexico's retail banking overnight.
The market - with 18 banks - is already highly competitive, and the required
investment substantial.
CS First Boston, in a report on Mexico's banking system, concluded: 'The
up-front costs which must be faced are huge and the risks of failure too
high. We believe that the US and Canadian banks will not repeat in Mexico
the mistakes some US banks made in Europe by pursuing a strategy of
world-wide retail banking.'
But CS First Boston reckons there could be a substantial increase in foreign
market share in the wholesale market.
Mexico's large companies already have access to US banks when borrowing
money, but the medium-size and smaller ones have to rely on Mexican banks,
which earn generous spreads on their corporate lending. Foreign banks,
perhaps in joint ventures with Mexican counterparts, could enter this
market, driving down interest rates.

FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: Disagreements subjected
to speedy conciliation - Disputes procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nafta agreement's mechanism for settling trade disputes builds on what
has become one of the most successful elements of the 1989 US-Canada free
trade agreement (FTA), writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
It also proposes several important changes, however. The binational panels
empowered to review anti-dumping and countervailing duty decisions will be
extended to cover complaints by Mexican companies.
This is a big concession by the Mexicans because the panels will replace
judicial review by the Mexican courts.
Another departure from the FTA is the creation a Nafta Trade Commission.
Prior to any panels being set up, disputes will have to be referred to the
commission, which is to use 'good offices, mediation, conciliation or other
means of alternative dispute resolution' to find a solution.
Only if the commission fails to hammer out an agreement will a binational
panel be set up.
Unlike FTA practice, where all panel members are either US or Canadian
officials, the Nafta provides for trade or legal experts from non-Nafta
countries to be on the roster of potential members.
In a further pursuit of impartiality, each side to a dispute will choose two
members from the roster supplied by the country of the other party. The
president of the panel will be chosen by mutual agreement or by drawing
lots.
One reason for the success of the FTA panels is that each stage of dispute
settlement is subject to strict time limits. Nafta proposes an even speedier
process.
A panel will be required to provide a confidential initial report within
three months of its selection.
Parties to the dispute will then have two weeks to submit their comments.
The panel will have to issue its final findings within 30 days of the
initial report.
The draft treaty allows for retaliation against a country which refuses to
implement a panel's recommendations or fails to reach some other agreement
within 30 days of the panel's report.
Complainants will be allowed to choose between Nafta and Gatt dispute
settlement procedures. Having chosen one, they may not use the other.
The draft Nafta agreement also provides for a committee to be set up to
consider arbitration procedures in disputes between private investors and
any of the three Nafta governments.

FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: More scope for
exporting from US to Mexico - Automobiles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE agreement in the car sector is intended to increase car companies'
ability to export from the US and Canada to the rapidly growing Mexican
market, while committing those companies to raise production in Mexico,
write Damian Fraser and Bernard Simon.
The agreement also makes it harder for non-Nafta car companies to operate in
the North American market. The regional content rule, which car makers will
have to meet to avoid tariffs or fines, has increased from 50 per cent in
the US-Canada agreement to 62.5 per cent for cars and 60 per cent for
components in the new accord.
The 62.5 per cent content rule will be phased in over eight years. If
manufacturers fail to meet the 62.5 per cent origin rule, they will have to
pay tariffs. Nissan, which has a large plant in Mexico, will find it harder
to meet this rule of origin; Volkswagen, also with a significant Mexican
plant, is aiming to meet this requirement within a few years.
Of some relief to foreign car makers, and an achievement for Canada in the
Nafta deal, appears to be a new set of rules for calculating local content
in the auto industry.
Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's international trade minister, said yesterday
that the Nafta rules would retroactively settle the high-profile dispute
over exports of Ontario-built Honda cars to the US. The US Customs Service
had alleged this year that, according to its method of calculating local
content, the Honda plant failed to meet the 50 per cent local content
required under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement for duty-free access.
According to an official of the Canadian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers'
Association, the Nafta rules will in general adopt the 'all or nothing'
approach by which, if individual parts of a car meet the 62.5 per cent
threshold, they will be counted as wholly manufactured in North America.
Mexico's decision to bow to US pressure for a higher local content rule was
made in return for being able to phase out, rather than abolish, its own
decree on the matter.
In return, the US has agreed to reduce the 'chicken tax' on vans imported
from Mexico, from 25 per cent to 10 per cent in the first year. After five
years, the tax will be eliminated.
Also, after three years, Mexico will be considered North American under the
Corporate Average Fuel Economy Act (Cafe), which now present discourages US
manufacturers from importing small cars from Mexico.
The result, within 10 years, will be free trade in cars in the Nafta region,
and discrimination against non-Nafta producers.

<TEXT>
THE worker retraining and environmental provisions of Nafta will receive the
closest scrutiny when the pact is sent to the US Congress, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
The US administration is stressing the pact's job-creation potential and
predicting that the total of 600,000 US workers who now owe their jobs to
Mexican exports will swell to 1m by 1995.
Mr Mark Anderson, US labour spokesman on Nafta, unsuccessfully urged that
the pact, which included intellectual property rights, could include health
and safety standards and labour rights.
The negotiators listed 'sustainable development' as one of Nafta's primary
goals. The complete text has not yet been released, but the administration
says it maintains health, safety and environmental standards. It permits
parties to impose stringent standards on new investments and to require
environmental impact statements. It allows dispute settlement panels to call
on scientific experts for advice but does not accede to the labour
movement's demands to play a stronger role in environmental dispute
settlement.
The environmentalists, and their powerful allies in Congress, will urge the
inclusion of a funding source to pay for clean-ups, worker retraining and
border infrastructure.
Mr John Adams, executive director of the US Natural Resources Defence
Council, said yesterday that, although the pact contains 'some positive
features', it lacks sufficient measures to protect the environment. The
US-Mexico border environmental plan, for example, prescribes helpful
bi-national co-operation but has 'no binding connection to the trade
agreement, few concrete initiatives to clean up and prevent pollution, and
incomplete strategy to fund environmental monitoring, enforcement and
infrastructure.'

FT  13 AUG 92 / North American Free Trade Agreement: World wary of Fortress
America syndrome - The view from overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MENTION Nafta, and it is likely that 'trade blocs' or 'Fortress America'
will be mentioned in the same breath.
Countries outside the region have been concerned - as they were with the
creation of Europe's single market - that it may foster protectionism. But
the Nafta text does not yet tell us whether these fears are justified.
In so far as the agreement aims to protect US car makers and textile
manufacturers, or carve out the Mexican market as the preserve of US
exporters, then exporters in Asia and Europe have genuine cause for concern.
If US corporations divert investment planned for the Pacific region into
Mexico, then that will be a loss which emergent Asian economies may wring
their hands over.
But if it simply makes US manufacturers more efficient and competitive, and
makes Mexico a more prosperous country, then the agreement may provide
important net gains to the world economy.
From Geneva, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) yesterday
hailed the accord as 'a major development within the world economy and
international trade.'
But in Tokyo, where industrialists see themselves as potential victims of a
Nafta agreement, yesterday's announcement was greeted with caution. The
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) view is that if the
accord is 'Gatt-consistent' and 'trade creating,' Japan will have no
problem. But government advisers fear Nafta will not be Gatt-consistent.
Specifically, the Japanese are concerned about local content restrictions in
the car industry, a concern heightened by the US-Canada dispute over the
local content of Hondas.
Asia's textile and garment exporters may also have cause for concern. The
'yarn forward' agreement in Nafta means garments made by non-north American
companies based in Mexico will have to source everything from north American
suppliers.
The Caribbean economies are without exception heavily dependent on the US
market, and fear Mexico's gains could be at their expense. Close behind is
Latin America. All are pressing the US hard for free trade agreements that
mirror that agreed with Mexico, and will be concerned that there is no
'docking clause' in the Nafta text which allows speedy accession to Nafta.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S long-term capital account deficit increased almost eight-fold in
June because of a surge in demand for foreign securities, the Bundesbank
said yesterday. The swing resulted in net capital exports during the month
of DM6.7bn (Pounds 2.37bn) compared with a net inflow of DM1.9bn in May.
Some observers suggested the rise in the long-term deficit - to DM7.43bn
from DM933m in May - was caused by investors shifting funds abroad to escape
a 30 per cent tax on investment income, to be introduced next January.
But others pointed out that the surge, of which DM4.2bn went into
D-Mark-denominated bonds issued by foreign banks, coincided with an increase
in such issues. They noted that the June deficit a year earlier was
DM10.29bn.
Total long-term capital outflows for the first six months of the year were
only DM27bn, compared with DM40bn in the comparable part of 1991.
Clearer indications of the impact of Germany's new withholding tax, which
was widely expected although only approved in July, should appear over the
next few months.
However, the government is clearly anxious about the possibility of
accelerating capital flight to countries with no or less rigorous taxes on
investment earnings. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, appealed recently to
the European Commission to prepare proposals for harmonisation.
Bonn introduced its new rules reluctantly after a ruling from the
constitutional court which demanded that all income should be taxed on the
same basis.
Provisional figures issued by the independent central bank yesterday showed
Germany's overall capital account surplus in June shrank to DM4.99bn from
DM8.75bn in May, and compared with a deficit of DM613m in June last year.
The May surplus was corrected from a provisional DM6.3bn because of a heavy
revision of the short-term balance.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday he was sure economic growth next year
would exceed 3 per cent after a 2 per cent increase in gross national
product in 1992.
Meanwhile, the federal statistics office confirmed the slow-down in west
German inflation. Consumer prices in July were 3.3 per cent higher than a
year earlier. The consumer price index stood at 115.2 (1985 = 100).
However, the cost of services, which have been hit by relatively high wage
awards, is still increasing above the average rate. Motor repairs were 8 per
cent dearer than a year ago. Bread, beer and rents were up by about 5 per
cent.

SWISS finance ministry officials remain optimistic about completing the
formation of a group within the next few days that would be large enough to
claim a seat on the board of the International Monetary Fund.
The ministry had hoped to complete negotiations with potential partners by
the end of last month, but was unsuccessful. The group must be formed before
the next meeting of the IMF rules committee, expected to take place during
the last week in August, if it is to have a chance of claiming a seat this
year.
Switzerland applied to join the IMF and World Bank last May after a national
referendum approved the move. The country's eagerness to gain a seat on the
board has irked some other members who fear being displaced. Also, the US
has strongly opposed increasing the number of seats to accommodate the
Swiss.
The Swiss finance ministry this week denied claims in the Swiss media that
it had offered to pay the SFr54.8m (Pounds 21.7m) IMF subscription fee of
Tajikistan in return for the former Soviet republic joining its group. It
said no secret payments would be offered.
The ministry confirmed that Switzerland was among a number of western
countries that had been asked to give or lend money to help former Soviet
republics pay their dues to the World Bank. Switzerland was currently
considering lending between SFr800,000 and SFr1.5m to those countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States which wished to be members of the Swiss
group.
Turkey and Poland are among other countries Switzerland is said to be
courting.

<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Serb forces are moving prisoners out of camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina
ahead of impending visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross,
in a bid to give the impression of better conditions, a senior US official
said yesterday.
Mr John Bolton, assistant Secretary of State for International Organisation
Affairs, said in Geneva that it was essential to ensure the ICRC had
immediate and unimpeded access to detention camps before transfers of
prisoners became more widespread.
Earlier this week, following an international outcry over conditions in the
camps, the Bosnian Serb leadership said it would open more detention centres
for ICRC inspection.
Mr Bolton said the US had 'indications', independent of press reports, that
'Bosnian Serb forces have been moving prisoners in an effort to decrease
crowding and improve the appearance of camps which may be visited by the
ICRC'. It was important that the ICRC saw the actual conditions in the
camps, including those held by other parties in the conflict.
Mr Bolton was in Geneva for an exceptional two-day session of the UN Human
Rights Commission on human rights abuses in ex-Yugoslavia, which begins
today.
A US-drafted resolution to be put to the Commission includes a demand for
the ICRC to be granted 'immediate, unimpeded and continued access to all
camps, prisons and other places of detention' in the former Yugoslavia.
The resolution also calls for appointment of a special rapporteur to
investigate human rights violations in the region and report back, with
recommendations, to the Human Rights Commission and the Security Council by
August 28. Mr Bolton said it was essential to have an objective, unbiased,
multilateral investigation to sift allegations made by all sides and to make
the facts public. The ICRC, by contrast, works behind the scenes to help
conflict victims and prevent human rights abuses where it can.
Based on the rapporteur's report, the US would be willing, in the Human
Rights Commission and elsewhere in the UN, 'to consider additional steps',
Mr Bolton said. This could include the stationing of human rights monitors
on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, as proposed by Mr Max van der
Stoel, the UN human rights investigator for Iraq.

<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's vigorous anti-inflation policy is in the best interests of
the German economy and will contribute directly to the hoped-for economic
upswing in the country's east, according to a member of the German central
bank's policy-making directorate.
Responding to criticisms from Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the IG Metall
trade union earlier this week, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said in Frankfurt
that the Bundesbank's stability-orientated monetary policy was far from
being hostile to jobs and employees.
On the contrary, he argued, stable prices could only help to promote a
'crisis-proof economic recovery' in the eastern part of Germany. If the
policy were relaxed, those on normal incomes or living on savings would
suffer most of all, Mr Gaddum said.
His comments follow Mr Steinkuhler's denunciation of the Bundesbank's
'unrestrained power' and 'extensive and excessive' attention to inflation.
Mr Steinkuhler said high interest rates, while aimed at reducing the growth
in money supply, often had the effect of hitting companies' solvency and
ability to invest and were retarding recovery in the eastern part of
Germany.

FRANCE'S dock dispute yesterday took a violent turn with a demonstration
outside a Dunkirk court where five dock workers were being tried for
criminal damage. Police accused militant dockers of intimidating fellow
employees.
Hundreds of dock workers gathered outside the court and clashed with police
when news broke of the five being charged with causing damage to port
property in connection with incidents at the weekend.
The demonstrators cheered when two dock workers were set free after being
questioned by the police.
Yesterday's demonstration came after months of unrest at Dunkirk and other
French ports where dockers have been protesting against new legislation
which cuts jobs and changes employment conditions radically. The laws are
intended to modernise the labour system by phasing out the union-run
practice of hiring dockers on a casual basis by making them salaried
employees.
French unemployment continued to rise during the second quarter with sharp
increases in lay-offs in the building and industrial sectors.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Industrial building orders fall in west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Bonn Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE west German construction industry this week reported its first fall in
new orders since March last year. A 13 per cent slump in contracts for
commercial and industrial building during May 'could indicate possible
economic weakening,' said Ms Irmgard Schwaetzer, construction minister.
An overall drop in construction orders of 0.4 per cent during the month
contrasted with a 4.7 per cent increase in the first five months of the
year.
While industrial orders nose-dived in May, house builders reported a more
comforting 4.3 per cent rise in demand and civil engineers claimed an 8 per
cent increase, according to a ministry review.
According to a separate study from the HDB industry association, total May
orders fell a real 0.9 per cent - the first year-on-year decline since March
1991.
The figures underline the loss of confidence throughout west German
industry, most of which is still waiting for the forecast upturn in foreign
demand. Unemployment among western construction workers is now around 9 per
cent, compared with 6 per cent overall.
Meanwhile, the building boom in the east continues. Total construction
orders were up 77 per cent in May compared with a year earlier. The increase
has slowed since the 89 per cent rise in March.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Government set to ditch balanced budget strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is close to abandoning its commitment to balance the national
budget over the economic cycle. Ministers are acknowledging that it will be
impossible to eliminate the large and rising public sector deficit before
the next general election.
Despite the public insistence by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that
there has been no shift in policy, his colleagues believe he will soon be
forced to 'repackage' his long-term budget strategy around the less
ambitious targets envisaged in the Maastricht accord on European monetary
union.
One suggestion is that a 'yes' vote for Maastricht in the French referendum
next month would be followed by a recasting of British fiscal policy in the
Treasury's autumn statement in November.
It is being pointed out in Whitehall that the balanced budget doctrine -
that deficits in times of recession should be matched by surpluses at the
other end of the economic cycle - was framed when sterling was outside the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The disciplines imposed by the ERM should allow for a more flexible approach
to fiscal deficits. This would be designed primarily to stabilise over the
medium term the ratio of public sector debt to national income.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is thought to share the view that while
the government must not relax its grip on fiscal policy, there is no
particular virtue in the present precise and unattainable medium-term
commitment.
The depth of the recession has led Whitehall officials to write off the
forecast in the March Budget that the budget deficit will fall below 1 per
cent of national income by 1996-97. They believe that, even on relatively
optimistic assumptions, the figure could be more than double that.
Last month's cabinet agreement to stick to next year's public spending
target and to trim the cash totals for subsequent years is unlikely to make
a significant dent in the underlying level of the deficit.
Ministers accept that only a return to the economic boom conditions of the
late 1980s would be sufficient to eliminate, and then replace with a large
surplus, a budget shortfall expected next year to be about Pounds 40bn - or
some 6 per cent of national income. Even if the government could engineer
such a boom it would undercut Mr Major's central ambition of permanently low
inflation.
Mr Lamont has been reluctant to admit to colleagues that a balanced budget
is out of reach. The chancellor is concerned that such an admission could
undermine confidence on financial markets where sterling remains under
pressure.
But a return of confidence in the ERM following the hoped-for endorsement of
Maastricht by the French electorate would provide the backdrop for a
recasting of the Treasury's budget guidelines.
The Maastricht accord envisages that deficits should not average more than 3
per cent of national income over the economic cycle, with larger shortfalls
in times of recession being matched by smaller gaps when economies are
growing.

FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Positive inflation data leave
Dow in doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
MORE good news on inflation failed to stir US stock markets yesterday, which
remained subdued by mid-August summer doldrums, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,320.83,
above its mid-afternoon low when the index had fallen almost 20 points on
computer sell programs.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
1.12 at 417.78, while the Amex composite slipped 1.62 to 386.46 and the
Nasdaq composite eased 0.75 to 570.85.
Turnover on the NYSE was 177m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 909 to
787.
The morning's inflation data was positive for market sentiment, but the 0.1
per cent increase in July producer prices was in line with analysts'
expectations and, therefore, had no significant impact on prices.
With calmer overseas markets, and little change in bond yields, equities
lacked a lead from external influences, and with many market participants
away for the summer break, prices traded in a narrow range in light
turnover.
McDonnell Douglas was a feature for the third consecutive day. After a
delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, shares in the
defence and aerospace group rose another Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 as
investors continued to react positively to last week's announcement of a
major restructuring, and the subsequent brokers' upgrades triggered by the
news. In the past three days McDonnell's stock has risen almost 20 per cent.
Federal Express dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 in active trading
after Morgan Stanley and Robinson Humphrey cut their first quarter earnings
forecasts.
Wells Fargo rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 on the news that Mr Warren
Buffett, the billionaire investor, had increased his stake in the bank from
9.7 per cent to 10.75 per cent.
Safety-Kleen fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 on speculation that the
Environmental Protection Agency, the government's pollution watchdog, would
reject a call for tougher rules for used oil disposal. The company was
expected to have benefited from the new rules.
In the same sector, Fluor Corporation climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 39
1/2 after a subsidiary of the company received a contract from the
Department of Energy to manage the clean-up of an uranium production plant
in Ohio, which could be worth up to Dollars 4bn.
On the Nasdaq market, Nordstrom rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 in
heavy turnover after Lazard Freres, the investment bank, initiated coverage
of the stock with a 'buy' recommendation and forecast that 1993 earnings
would come in at Dollars 1.65 a share.
Parametic Technology jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 42 1/4 in active trading
after the data processing technology company won a contract worth at least
Dollars 10m to provide engineering software to Caterpillar, the world's
largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment.
Canada
TORONTO share prices posted a sizable decline in active trading which was
boosted by heavy first-day trading in the common shares and instalment
receipts of Nova Scotia Power.
Based on preliminary figures, the 300 TSE index fell 26.92 points, or
0.79per cent, to close at 3,377.75. Declines led advances 292 to 243, volume
of 38.2m shares was above the previous 28.8m, and trading value was CDollars
404m against CDollars 302.9m. Included in the volume were about 5m shares
and 3.5m receipts of Nova Scotia Power, which closed at 10 1/2 .

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop report confirms big
harvest for US farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US FARMERS are harvesting a bountiful spring crop despite haphazard summer
weather, the US agriculture department reported yesterday.
All-wheat production is pegged at 2.34bn bushels for the 1992 season, up 5
per cent from the previous forecast, and 18 per cent higher than 1991. This
is mostly due to anticipated record high production of non-durum spring
wheat - 654m bushels, 12 per cent over the last projection - and partly to a
revised forecast for winter wheat, up 2 per cent to 1.60bn bushels.
These high wheat numbers should allay fears about depleting US wheat stocks,
which are at their lowest level in years.
Maize production is forecast at 8.76bn bushels, slightly below expections
but still 17 per cent above last year's crop of 7.474bn.
Soyabeans are expected to surge to 2.8bn bushels - up 5 per cent from last
year's 1.975bn bushel crop and well ahead of recent forecasts.
Less fecund were cotton producers with production expected to reach 16.5m
bales, 6 per cent less than last year. Southern cotton belt states had a
cold and wet spring which will lower yields by as much as two-thirds, as it
did in Texas. This is expected to lower cotton export estimates, but the
USDA kept the forecast unchanged at 6.7m bales.
Industry analysts welcome the bumper crop, which follows several dry years,
but warn that demand remains alarmingly stagnant. Over the past six weeks,
corn prices have roughly slipped by 20 per cent, soyabeans by 25 per cent
and, since the beginning of the year, wheat prices have dropped by 25 per
cent. 'There is still room to go lower,' said Mr Martyn Foreman, an analyst
at Illinois' Agreviser.
Wheat exports also pose problems for US farmers. In particular, Russian
demand has fallen - and the Russians are harvesting a good crop this year -
leading the USDA to reduce export estimates from 1.175bn to 1.125bn.
However, maize and soyabean exports are expected to rise. The maize forecast
for 1992-93 exports is up 50m to 1.60bn bushels. Meanwhile, large European
demand for soyabean has led the USDA to revise both the 1991-92 and the
1992-93 projections, from 680m bushels to 690m and 675m to 700m
respectively.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: No mention of women over 40
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH BALSOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is all very well for the Social Security Advisory Committee
('Retirement age of 65 proposed for men and women', August 4) and Howard
Davies ('The pragmatic option on pension equality', August 7) to trumpet the
virtues of raising the retirement age for women to 65, but they fail to
address the issue of how likely women of that age are to find employers who
want them.
I know many women in their 50s who have been coerced or cajoled into taking
early retirement, while a cursory glance at the jobs column in any 'quality'
newspaper, including your own, indicates that anyone older than 35 need not
waste time dusting off her (or indeed his) CV. If the old song is correct
and 'nobody loves a fairy when she's 40', what chance has she when she's
60-plus] It certainly seems unlikely that many UK employers will be lining
up to investigate her charms.
It may suit the Treasury to withhold the state retirement pension until
women reach 65, but does it suit Mr Davies's members to keep employing them?
This is an aspect of the debate he failed to mention. Perhaps you could
persuade him to pen another article on this very point. As for the
government, if ministers are intent on raising women's retirement age, they
should surely follow the lead of the United States and make it illegal to
discriminate on grounds of age. Americans of my acquaintance gawp in horror
at your appointments pages since, by their standards, the bulk of the
advertisements you carry in your New York edition are breaking the law.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Traders shrug off intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US DOLLAR slid towards DM1.4600 against the D-Mark yesterday, despite
Tuesday's extensive intervention by major central banks in support of the
currency, writes James Blitz.
In afternoon US trading, the dollar was at DM1.4630, only 20 points above
the level at which central banks had intervened on its behalf 30 hours
earlier. It closed at DM1.4632. The action looks increasingly as though it
was ill-timed. Some analysts also believe the fundamental factors
undermining the dollar are so great that intervention may be abandoned
altogether. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in
London, says: 'Given the sluggish nature of the recovery, the US authorities
may be tempted to forget intervention and let the market take the dollar
down itself.'
Indicators suggesting that the differential between US and German interest
rates will widen further, making it too expensive for dealers to be long of
dollars, dragged the US currency down. The prospect of another cut in US
interest rates was sharpened by poor housing completion figures, which
dropped 3.2 per cent in June, after rising 12.8 per cent the previous month.
July's US producer price figures showed the absence of any inflationary
pressures, rising only 0.1 per cent. Tuesday's comment from Mr Nicholas
Brady, the US Treasury secretary, that another interest rate cut cannot be
ruled out, hung over the market.
Conversely, the Bundesbank dangled the prospect of another Lombard rate rise
by draining a large amount of liquidity from the German money market. By
withdrawing DM2.4bn in its weekly security repurchase agreement, the
Bundesbank kept call money just below the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per
cent. Dealers still cannot rule out a German rate hike after France votes in
its referendum on Maastricht in September.
Dollar weakness dragged sterling down  1/2 a pfennig against the D-Mark to
finish at DM2.8225 at the London close. Rumours of Mr Norman Lamont's
resignation as Chancellor helped push the currency down, but they later
proved unfounded. The lira continued to make the recent cut in Italian
interest rates look ill-judged as it dropped to L758.0 against the D-Mark
from a previous close of L756.3.
The market's interest was otherwise focused on the Australian dollar, which
sank towards the USDollars 0.71 level against the US currency despite more
intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia. The RBA again bought the
'Aussie dollar' at USDollars 0.7180 yesterday, but the currency was quoted
at USDollars 0.7150 in London at 1215 GMT. Fears of a cut in Australian
interest rates are driving the currency down.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Affected by rumours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures dipped yesterday afternoon as the pound slid against the
D-Mark on the foreign exchanges and rumours swept financial markets that Mr
Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, had resigned.
The September short sterling contract dipped 7 basis points to a low of
89.64 as the pound lost over  1/2 a pfennig on the foreign exchanges in the
afternoon. UK officials said that the rumours of the Chancellor's
resignation were totally unfounded,and this helped to stabilise the price.
But sterling failed to recover and closed down  1/2 a pfennig from its
previous close at DM2.8225. The September contract therefore closed down 5
basis points from its previous finish, at 89.65, and the December contract
down was down 6 basis points at 89.74. Both prices assume that a cut in UK
base rates is still a long way off.
Trade in sterling cash was thin. The Bank of England forecast another small
shortage of Pounds 350m and, once again, the market found this difficult to
remove because each discount house waited for the next one to offer bills to
the Bank. The stickiness forced the overnight rate up to a peak of 11 per
cent but later dropped back to close at 9 7/8 per cent. Most period rates
closed unchanged. Three-month interbank again closed at 10 1/4 per cent on
the offered side, and 1-year money closed at 10 3/8 per cent.
After forecasting its shortage, the Bank did not operate in the morning. The
forecast was later revised down to Pounds 300m. In the afternoon, the Bank
purchased Pounds 10m in Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. It provided
late assistance of around Pounds 215m.
The Bundesbank's decision to drain a large amount of liquidity from the the
German money market added to the bearish sentiment. The Bundesbank withdrew
DM2.4bn from the money market in this week's round of security repurchase
agreements, and this kept call money rates pinned to the central bank's
emergency Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent.
Traders had expected the German central bank to replace the DM35.2bn
expiring this week in repos or perhaps add DM1bn to DM2bn because of the
tightness in the money market and upcoming tax deadlines. But this did not
happen.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price tumbles as NY
investors bail out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK platinum futures were tumbling in late trading yesterday as the
precious metals markets moved into reverse.
The active October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was almost
Dollars 20 down at Dollars 348.50 a troy ounce in late trading. 'They are
bailing out,' one New York floor analyst said as stop-loss sales by
commodity funds and others hit the market.
On the New York Commodity Exchange gold and silver futures followed platinum
down. In late trading the December gold contract was down more than Dollars
8 at Dollars 342.30 a troy ounce - well below key support levels.
'There is no reason to own any of these metals at recent levels - either
technically or fundamentally. Reality is catching up to these markets,' one
floor analyst told the Reuter news agency.
Earlier gold fell on the London bullion market below Dollars 348 a troy
ounce - widely regarded as a critical support level - as it continued to
retreat from the recent high of just over Dollars 360. It closed at Dollars
346.35 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.30 on the day.
London's platinum price also fell, shedding Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 367.75 a
troy ounce. The market has been keeping a close eye on the falls in the
Tokyo stock market, fearing that demand for platinum from Japan, the world's
biggest importer, could slacken.
Those fears sparked the hectic trading in New York, which was also
responding to a further fall to fresh six-year lows in the CRB index of 21
futures, a widely-watched inflation indicator.
The London gold market has retraced its steps by more than 50 per cent after
the rally early last month. Some analysts believe the market could now fall
back to this year's lows around Dollars 334, although others were suggesting
that strong support would emerge at Dollars 345.
The drift down over the last few days has been mainly due to professional
selling by the large commodity funds, disappointed at the market's failure
to push above Dollars 360, said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat
&amp; Aitken. On some days in the past week as much as 250,000 ounces has been
sold.
However, analysts could not point to any single reason for the decline. Mr
Jon Bergtheil of James Capel said there had been no developments in the
currency markets and no Central Bank activity which might have pushed prices
down. He suggested that De Beers' forecast of a dividend cut on Tuesday
could have sparked some jitters over jewellery sales this Christmas.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, part of the Banque
Bruxelles Lambert group, said that the weakening Australian dollar had led
producers there to sell forward at ADollars 480 a troy ounce.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bulgarian mines flounder in
market economy - Domestic shipments have fallen by 60% over the past two
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOVE to democracy and a market economy in Bulgaria has decimated the
traditional industries of the Balkan country, leaving its metals industry in
crisis.
Although the Union of Democratic Forces became the largest single political
party in the National Assembly elections in October last year, it failed to
win overall majority. This has led to the Bulgarian Socialist Party - the
repackaged communist party - blocking reforms in alliance with smaller
parties, generally making the transition to capitalism that much more
painful.
The impact of this on the country's primary metals companies and
manufacturers of semi-fabricating products has been dramatic. Domestic
shipments have fallen by 60 per cent over the past two years as the
construction, electronics and machine building industries of Bulgaria have
floundered in the new free market conditions. In many cases home market
sales now account for only 20 per cent of output.
Gone are the assured trading partners of Comecon Europe, led by the former
Soviet Union, and Bulgaria has been forced to join the rest of the world in
its bid to sell increasingly sophisticated products in highly competitive
international markets. But the most remarkable thing about the Bulgarian
metals industry is that it is surviving in the face of lack of investment; a
western world recession; and the enormous effort involved in trying to
capture new markets.
Like the lead and zinc smelters and copper semi-fabricating producers in
Bulgaria, the country's sole primary copper producer MDK at Pirdop, which
used to depend on state support to cover its regular losses, is operating at
a profit, according to Mr Dimitre Andreev Petrov, deputy director in charge
of production and development.
Previously known as Georgi Damanyov, after a former and now discredited
communist prime minister, the plant is forced to operate at less than half
the 170,000-tonnes-a-year potential of its Outokumpu flash furnace because
of lack of investment. About 25,000 tonnes of refined copper is produced
annually for the domestic market and a further 25,000 tonnes for export,
with some produced on a toll smelting contract basis, for, among others,
Marc Rich, the international trading company based in Zug, Switzerland.
However, as MDK has yet to obtain London Metal Exchange listing for its
copper cathodes it is finding it hard to meet the specifications of many
western consumers. Even the domestic semi-fabricator Energocabel in Sofia
restricts its intake from MDK to 25 per cent, preferring western cathode.
Mr Petrov, like many of his compatriots, is looking for foreign finance for
investment. He said: 'We are now making investigations to this effect.
Certain companies which have an interest in enlarging our copper production
are helping us with preliminary investigations. In three to four months we
hope to have a solution'.
Unfortunately the country's precarious political situation, coupled with
crippling corporate taxation - set at 52 per cent but rising to over 80 per
cent when hidden levies are included - provides little encouragement for
investors. And the government's ambitious privatisation programme is
unlikely to have any more success in attracting foreign finance. It will be
at least early 1993 before the first Bulgarian state companies come under
the hammer. 'The metals industry will see no incentives this year,' Mr Pirin
Tzenkov, general director of the Ministry of Trade, said. Answering
criticism levelled by the industry that sluggish reforms were hindering
investment, he admitted that they were moving too slowly. 'The crisis in the
metals industry is very strong,' he said, 'but the financial situation needs
to be sorted out before measures like reduced taxation can be implemented.'
Mr Tzenkov was also pessimistic about the privatisation of the metals
industry, whose expensive plants will need huge investment with little
promise of early returns. 'Our banks are a good example of this. Some
individual banks have issued shares and, though they operated at a profit,
no dividends were released,' he explained. 'The same could happen at these
large plants.'
But foreign investment is not ruled out altogether. There are ways round
Bulgarian law. For example, the Council of Ministers can remove taxes from
large companies for limited periods. At the same time, certain legislation
allows foreign companies to pay taxes in the country most favourable to them
 -ie, their own.
Meanwhile, without exception the metals companies of Bulgaria are following
LME prices and in some cases delivering metal on to the exchange. They are
selling direct to end users and using independent traders, thus reducing
their dependence on state import-export companies like Rudmetal.
Reducing staff levels has been a common policy throughout the Bulgarian
metals industry, unless sensitive social factors make this impractical. For
example, the KCM lead and zinc plant in the industrial heartland of Plovdiv
has kept on its 2,250 staff as many other companies in the area have closed
or face bankruptcy. The unemployment level is already at 25 per cent.
At the moment KCM is negotiating a one-year contract with two labour unions.
But with the average salary at L3,600 (Pounds 85) a month, more than twice
the national average, strike action is unlikely. Mr Tzenkov spoke of the
problems of balancing conflicting social issues in the area. 'First of all
there was a movement to close the Plovdiv plant due to ecological reasons
and then there was a movement to reopen it due to the unemployment problem,'
he said.
Green lobbyists, increasingly active in the country, were evidently
mollified by a compromise situation. The plant shut down its lead production
from January-March this year, during which it installed new purifying
equipment. According to Mr Nicola Dobrev, KCM's managing director, this has
brought the plant's emissions in line with Bulgaria's national standards.
Nevertheless, the company's lead output has been restricted to 32,000 tonnes
a year, compared with a potential 40,000-50,000 tonnes. Zinc production is
also expected to be lower than the 60,000 tonnes capacity this year, at
50,000 tonnes. This is largely due to reconstruction and repairs to the
plant.
The other lead and zinc producer in the country, the Lead - Zink complex in
Kardjali, planning to build a new 50,000-tonnes-a-year zinc smelter at its
existing site with unnamed US partners. Mr Russi Dafinov, the general
manager, said that Bulgarian government approval was expected and building
should start next year. It would be a further three years before the plant
was commissioned and it would replace the existing 27,000-tonnes-a-year
plant. Its lead output has also been reduced to 20,000 tonnes a year from
42,000 tonnes, because of environmental concerns.
Alongside the industry's emphasis on exports, with markets primarily in the
Far and Middle East and neighbouring countries, imports of raw materials are
taking on increasing importance.
Niproruda, the Bulgarian state-owned mining, research and technology
company, is currently assessing the future viability of the country's mining
and metals sector. According to deputy director Ivan Daskalov, some 50-60
per cent of the country's mines and concentrators are unprofitable. Ore
grades have fallen significantly after years of exploitation. So much so
that the Bulgarian Council of Ministers announced last month that 56 mines
would be closed in the next few years.
The announcement triggered an immediate strike threat by the country's two
main unions, who demanded the publication of the mine rehabilitation decree
in the State Gazette.
The government, already facing a crisis of confidence and possible collapse
by September, quickly acquiesced, publishing the decree on July 28. Included
are the Burgas Copper Mines, with six sites to be closed from 1992-94. Also
copper mines belonging to Asarel Medet, Eliseina and Ustrem are to go, as
well as 20 lead and zinc mines under the control of Gorubso and the
Madjarovo and Osogovo non-ferrous mines.
Whether the Bulgarian metals industry will be able to meet the overwhelming
challenges of finding new trading partners and sources of raw material,
coupled with the replacement of ageing plant and technology, remains to be
seen. The country has, as yet, the advantages of cheap labour and
fixed-price power, as well as a relatively good position logistically. But
as Mr Tzenkov said: 'It is difficult to envisage what the industry will look
like in ten years' time.'

<TEXT>
JAPANESE bank shares rallied on the Tokyo stock market yesterday, on hopes
that a change in accounting rules would allow the banks to hide their
evaluation losses on stock holdings.
Although a 48.77 point fall depressed the Nikkei stock average of 225
leading stocks to a new six-year low of 14,773.79, the banking index was one
of the few gainers, rising 7.74 points to 2,913.56.
For the fiscal year to last March, Japan's 11 commercial banks saw operating
profits rise 31.5 per cent to a total Y1,920bn (Dollars 15bn), thanks to
bigger profit margins on loans. But pre-tax profits fell 14 per cent due to
increases in loan loss write-offs and evaluation losses on stock
investments.
A ministry of finance official denied reports suggesting banks would be
allowed to switch accounting principles where stocks can be carried at cost,
but analysts pointed out that such measures were highly likely.

FT  13 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Australian sell-off after hopes of rate
cut dashed
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported heavy selling of Australian government bonds yesterday
after Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, dashed hopes of a cut in
interest rates.
The bond market had expected to see an easing in rates fairly soon, possibly
timed to follow the Budget on August 18. However, Mr Dawkins said in a radio
interview: 'As far as we are concerned, there have been very considerable
falls in interest rates already. And the consequences of those reductions
are flowing through into the economy now.'
He added that given the prevailing domestic and international circumstances
he saw no need for 'any further easings in monetary policy'. The yield on
the 10 1/2 per cent September 1995 bond rose from 6.60 per cent to 6.88 per
cent and dealers reported heavy selling of bonds in Australia and overseas.
Traders warned that Mr Dawkins' comments were probably aimed at supporting
the Australian dollar, which has weakened from USDollars 0.74 last week to
below USDollars 0.72, its lowest level since February 1988.
GOOD news on inflation and a reasonably successful afternoon auction of
10-year securities failed to give US Treasury prices a lift yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 107
27/32 , yielding 7.338 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down
3/32 at 100 5/32 to yield 4.149 per cent. Trading activity was extremely
quiet.
The day's main economic news was the release of the producer prices index
for July, which was up 0.1 per cent on the month.
Although the auction subsequently went off well - the notes were awarded at
an average yield of 6.49 per cent - the result was slightly below
expectations, and prices retreated further during the afternoon.
RUMOURS that Moody's, the international rating agency, is about to downgrade
Italy's credit rating, helped to push down Italian government bond prices
yesterday.
The May 2002 bond fell from 93.86 to a low of 93.50 before closing at 93.58,
and dealers reported determined selling by European investors.
Elsewhere in the European government bond markets, German government debt
drifted lower as the Bundesbank's decision to drain liquidity from the money
market yesterday sparked fears of a possible rise in German interest rates.
At its latest one-month securities repurchase allocation, the Bundesbank
drained DM2.4bn of liquidity from the money market, a larger-than-expected
withdrawal of funds. 'The market is sensing a hike in the Lombard rate,'
said one dealer.
The fall in the other European markets also helped to depress bund prices,
and the Liffe bund futures contract fell from 87.28 at the opening to end at
87.16.
STERLING's weakness in the foreign exchange markets helped to push UK
government bonds lower, with prices falling across the yield curve.
The 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 115 to 114 19/32 to yield 9.5
per cent while the 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 declined from 103 9/16 to
103 3/8 .
JAPANESE government bond prices ended firmer as the weak state of the Tokyo
stock market continued to kindle hopes of lower interest rates.
The Nikkei stock index ended down 48.77 points at 14,773.79 yesterday, still
below the psychologically important 15,000 level. The benchmark No 129 JGB
opened with a yield of 4.955 per cent and traded up to yield 4.915 per cent.
In the futures market, volumes in the December contract surpassed that in
the September contract, making it the new lead contract.

FT  13 AUG 92 / International Company News: Monsanto keeps juggling the
assets - The US group's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive of Monsanto, keeps on
juggling the company's assets. After two significant restructurings in the
1980s the process continued this month with the sale of the Fisher Controls
valve and systems subsidiary for Dollars 1.28bn to Emerson Electric of Saint
Louis, Missouri.
But the US chemicals group prefers to describe the Fisher sale and indeed
its overall strategy as a fine-tuning of its product portfolio that is very
much in line with the trend in the sector.
Yet there can be no doubt Monsanto is facing a difficult period. After
stripping out special restructuring charges in 1991, Its underlying net
income was down nearly 16 per cent in the first six months of 1992.
Mr Mahoney's stated target of ensuring a 20 per cent return on shareholders
capital seems increasingly difficult. The problem is the jewels in
Monsanto's crown are looking somewhat tarnished.
Take Roundup, the herbicide and world's best-selling agrochemical. Mr
Mahoney said there had never been an agrochemical like it. The product
represents 60 per cent of Monsanto's agrochemicals business, whose sales
have stagnated at Dollars 1.7bn over the past three years.
Roundup's US and European patents expired last year and by last October its
price had fallen by 45 per cent as the group faced competition from generic
producers of the same product.
New agrochemical products are in the pipeline and high hopes have been
expressed for Monsanto's new crabgrass herbicide, Dimension. It received US
approval last year and Mr Mahoney hopes it will generate Dollars 100m sales.
Monsanto, as the world's seventh largest agrochemical company with 6.3 per
cent of the world market, also faces upheavals caused by the reforms of the
European common agricultural policy. These threaten to cut demand in the
world's largest market by up to 15 per cent over the next three years.
The company, however, feels that while changes in the CAP could reduce
opportunities in the short term, there are still greater potential gains to
be had worldwide from a successful completion of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) negotiations.
The group's efforts to generate other new products have not always been
successful. It has invested more than Dollars 1bn since 1981 on
biotechnology to try to escape the traditional cycles of the chemicals
market. The results so far have been disappointing.
The largest investment, estimated by analysts at about Dollars 250m, was on
bovine somatotropin - commonly known as BST - which is a hormone product
designed to increase milk production in cows.
The company is still waiting for US and European regulatory approval and
argues that BST will lower the fixed costs of milk production. It is far
from clear whether the world's developed nations need more milk.
Meanwhile, other jewels look dull. Nutrasweet, described by Mr Mahoney as
the most successful new food ingredient of the past 20 years, comes off
patent in December. Last year Nutrasweet's sales growth was only 2 per cent.
Operating income was reduced by Dollars 10m in 1991 to Dollars 173m by a
one-time restructuring charge.
In the first six months of 1992, Nutrasweet's operating profits were Dollars
87m, down from Dollars 96m because of lower prices mandated by contracts
with customers well aware the patent is due to expire soon.
Mr Mahoney expected competition from generic competitors and new products. A
new Monsanto product, Sweetner 2000, will be sent to the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) soon. In addition, sales of Simplesse fat substitute
have been disappointing and the product is in loss.
Monsanto's Searle pharmaceuticals operations, with sales last year of
Dollars 1.53bn and operating profits of Dollars 170m, are tiny compared with
the industry's giants. The division is suffering from competition from
generic producers, but is hoping to launch new products to make up for this.
In the first half of 1992 Searle suffered a Dollars 16m operating loss.
Calan, a drug used in treating hypertension, accounted for one third of last
year's Dollars 1.53bn of sales. But the FDA has just given preliminary
approval to a generic version and this could slash sales of Calan by as much
as 50 per cent over the next couple of years.
The group's performance is not being helped by its chemicals businesses
which continue to suffer from recession. The division, which manufactures
plastics, fibres, resins and rubber chemicals, bore the brunt of last year's
restructuring. Sales fell 7 per cent last year from Dollars 4bn to Dollars
3.7bn and a Dollars 478m restructuring charge drove it into a Dollars 154m
loss.
Further restructuring cannot be ruled out. 'We need to be number one or two
in everything we do in chemicals and we need to be making money,' said Mr
Mahoney.
So far, the company has declined to explain how it will use the cash from
the sale to Emerson Electric, except to say excess cash might be used for
investment in existing businesses, acquisition or share repurchasing.
Wall Street is convinced, however, that Mr Mahoney will choose the share
buy-back option to boost his company's return on equity.
Mr Jeff Cianci, a chemicals analyst at Bear Stearns in New York, says he is
convinced the proceeds from the Fisher sale will be used to buy back shares.
He does not, however, believe the sale of Fisher is the last asset disposal.
"I think the Fisher move is not the last piece in the puzzle. The future of
this company is in the areas of agriculture, such as pest-resistant seeds
and other biotechnology products, plus food, health care and chemicals. In
chemicals I would expect more joint ventures and outright sales of some of
the lower-return businesses."
Mr Mahoney has said: 'The group's structure is mostly in place. We underwent
two major restructurings during the 1980s. If we haven't got it right by
now, then shame on us'.
The Monsanto chief must now make his businesses perform. Otherwise he could
be left with even fewer assets left to juggle.

NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependent on the B-2
Stealth bomber programme, warned yesterday it expects to make a Dollars 152m
provision related to its cruise missile programme in the third quarter.
The company said the charge reflected the estimated financial impact of its
proposal to extend the schedule to complete the flight test programme of the
Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile.
The provision will cut third-quarter earnings by around Dollars 100m or
Dollars 2.13 a share, and is being taken after discussion with the US Air
Force this month.
Northrop claims the provision should be sufficient to complete the
development programme.

TELEBRAS, the Brazilian state-owned telecommunications holding company, has
received government authorisation to make a foreign equities offering of up
to Dollars 500m.
It plans to ask the US Securities and Exchange Commission for approval of a
placement of American depository receipts (ADRs) this month and hopes to
make the issue by the end of the year.
To meet that deadline, Telebras is expected to make a private placement
under the SEC's 144A provision. It would be the first such offering by a
Brazilian company, said Mr Juarez Cordeiro Ribeiro, assistant finance
director.
In May, Aracruz Celulose, a leading pulp and paper exporter, became the
first Brazilian company to be traded on Wall Street by making a Dollars
132.5m ADR offering.
The 144A process is quicker than the level three, used by Aracruz, because
company books do not have to be adapted to meet SEC standards.
The offering will help to finance Dollars 3bn of investments for 1992 which
include 933,000 additional lines for the country's telephone system.
Mr Ribeiro said Telebras expected to make its fourth Eurobond issue of the
year shortly.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Feltrim Names may face greater losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 Lloyd's Names may face insurance losses of nearly Pounds
700m, well above the level of losses that had been feared, according to a
market report.
The Names, individuals whose personal assets back the insurance market's
capital, are members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847, which
specialised in catastrophe reinsurance before they ceased to trade at the
start of last year. Between 1987 and 1990 the syndicates were swamped by
claims from a series of hurricanes, explosions and other disasters. Their
losses had been expected to total Pounds 289.3m.
A report prepared by the present managers of syndicates 540/542 and 847  -
which include many hard-hit US and Canadian Names - says, however, losses
may be bet-ween Pounds 477.5m and Pounds 691.4m.
Losses for the 1989 year alone are now estimated at between Pounds 227.5m
and Pounds 298m, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 147.7m.
The Lloyd's of London insurance market announced a Pounds 2.06bn loss for
1989 in June.
Mr Tony Berry, involved in the administration of the syndicate since it
ceased trading, says he has uncovered evidence of lax management controls
and inadequate reinsurance arrangements.
He said: 'The state of the reinsurance system was indeed a sight to behold
and has been a major task to sort out.' Human errors seemed to have run at
an 'unacceptably high level' and controls 'were clearly inadequate'.
He added: 'I feel devastated at the results these syndicates are producing
and the manner in which they have arisen.'
The news is bound to fuel the anger of Names on the two syndicates, who are
awaiting the results of a separate investigation into Feltrim, led by Sir
Patrick Neill QC. Sir Patrick, asked to head the investigation last year,
has taken longer than expected to report.
The report might be presented to the Lloyd's council, the market's governing
body, next month. Names, who are delaying any legal action until the report
is completed, fear further delays.
The syndicates' accounts for the 1987 to 1990 years have still not been
closed because of continuing uncertainty about the pattern of future claims.
The present management took over administration of the syndicates on behalf
of Lloyd's when the Feltrim agency ceased trading. Names on the syndicates
are being sent copies of the report this week.
Other syndicates specialising in catastrophe reinsurance have also produced
heavy losses for their Names.
Even taking into account the revised estimates, the Feltrim syndicates have
still not performed as badly as a group of syndicates formerly managed by
the Gooda Walker agency. Gooda losses amounted to Pounds 491m in the 1989
year and are expected to produce further heavy losses in 1990.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Optimists and pessimists clash on wages: David Goodhart
presents opposing views in the debate on curbing income rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN may be on the way to breaking the back of long-standing wage
inflation. Many analysts remain sceptical, but evidence from the
Confederation of British Industry pay databank encourages that conclusion.
The CBI points to a third consecutive quarter with manufacturing settlements
steady at 4.3 per cent while manufacturing productivity is growing at 3.2
per cent and inflation is 3.9 per cent and falling.
It says: 'This is welcome evidence that pay behaviour is settling into a
non-inflationary pattern.'
Productivity in the service sector is scarcely improving at all, but pay
settlements - led by the troubled finance sector - have tumbled, averaging
4.3 per cent for the first half of the year.
The CBI's optimism is supported by some city analysts. Greenwell Montagu
predicts that pay settlements will continue falling to 2.5 per cent by the
end of next year and that growth in average earnings, which slipped below 7
per cent last month, will reach 4.6 per cent by then.
Optimists say present settlement figures look even better from the
perspective of company pay bills. Many companies, especially in
manufacturing, are continuing to shed staff, so an average 4.3 per cent pay
rise can mean a com-pany's pay bill is static or even falling.
There is a remarkable amount of 'bunching' around the 4 per cent to 4.5 per
cent level in the public and private sectors, but there is evidence to
support the CBI's view that, at least in variations around that norm, pay is
increasingly driven by business factors.
The two clearest examples are chemicals and construction. The construction
industry's difficulties are reflected in an average 2.5 per cent pay rise.
The chemical industry has been more buoyant, with several companies agreeing
6 per cent or more in the first six months of this year.
Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says pay freezes continue
to affect a small but significant number of companies and are at about the
same level as last year. Freezes have been concentrated in sectors such as
retailing and in the parts of larger companies that have met hard times,
such as British Steel's strip products division.
The CBI's statistics, with the exception of those on productivity, are
generally accepted by most other pay analysts. The organisation's
conclusions are more controversial.
Pay experts say the inflation rate remains central to pay bargaining. Ms
Angela Wright of IRS says: 'We may be breaking with the idea of
inflation-plus, but inflation remains a benchmark and we are still far off
an inflation-minus approach.'
Pessimists suggest that three consecutive quarters of rises at 4.3 per cent
looks suspiciously like a floor for settlements. If that is the case, then
the figure for national average earnings might not fall below 6 per cent for
a very long time.
The pessimists' most telling point is that the European exchange rate
mechanism makes any favourable comparison with pay trends in the recession
of the early 1980s irrelevant.
It is true that in the early 1980s, with inflation similar to today's, the
settlement floor was higher - about 5 per cent. But then the pound was about
to embark on a long period of devaluation which cancelled out much of the
effect of British wage inflation in international trade.
Devaluation is ruled out by ERM membership. Wage increases must now be as
low as or lower than those of Britain's main competitors.
Good, albeit cyclical, productivity figures are keeping down increases in
unit labour costs in UK manufacturing to a respectable level of just over 1
per cent.
But unless Britain can maintain faster productivity growth across the
economy than its European competitors, higher wage inflation will feed into
lower profits and lost competitiveness.
Thanks to the pressures created by German reunification, growth in German
average earnings may briefly rise to 6 per cent - but Germany's underlying
wages growth is far lower than the UK's, where average earnings are rising
at 6.5 per cent.
Average earnings growth in France is 4 per cent and in the US 2 per cent.
Britain still appears a long way off those figures.

Mr Michael Mann, sales manager at Titan Forge Ltd in east London, was not
surprised to hear that factory gate prices - the colloquial shorthand for
Britain's producer prices index - rose at the slowest rate since 1968 in the

The company, supplier of iron railings, balustrades and gates, has not been
able to raise the prices of its factory gates for more than three years.
'Prices have been cut to the bone. Sometimes the amount we charge for work
just covers the wages,' said Mr Mann.
Sentiment is the same at Cornwell &amp; O'Neil, an industrial and domestic gate
manufacturer in Greenwich, south-east London. Mr Roy Wilkinson, a partner,
said prices at his company had not moved for at least two years. 'Raising
prices? We're too frightened,' he said. 'The government needs to cut
interest rates and let inflation go - why not?'

FT  12 AUG 92 / Bugs and bytes bedevil those paying by plastic: David
Barchard, Andrew Jack and Alan Cane on the damage done to the credit card
industry by a software glitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD, ANDREW JACK and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN First Data Resources introduced new computer software systems on July
17, it could not have foreseen that a consequence would be to attract
unwelcome publicity to the credit card processing industry.
The company handles the payment card operations of National Westminster,
Midland and Lloyds banks, as well as Royal Bank of Scotland. The result is
that the change in software affected some 10m accounts. A glitch caused
mistakes in some card statements and yesterday the banks were having to
reassure customers that the bugs had been resolved with only a few accounts
affected.
Credit card processing is a low-profile industry, and until recently it was
not even a market in which participants competed for business.
The eyes of FDR and several other companies are now on the European card
market, which is expected to grow steadily as card usage increases and
transaction volumes approach levels in the mature US market.
FDR's computer system, introduced from its parent in the US, was intended to
enhance its card processing operations at Southend and Basildon in Essex.
The operations, bought from the Access banks last year, made FDR, a
subsidiary of the American Express group, the largest credit card processor
in Europe.
Mr John Elftmann, director of personnel and quality for FDR in the UK,
called the switch to FDR's own system 'the biggest accounts conversion in
history'. A day or two later, others in the credit card world knew the
operation had not gone smoothly. Barclays, the other large card processing
operation, found some long delays when processing its card transactions
through retailers that banked with Access banks, and whose service messages
were routed through FDR at Southend.
Barclays says the situation is now improving. It adds that this is the first
time, to its knowledge, that this sort of glitch has been experienced in the
card processing world.
The Access banks bore the brunt of the trouble. Three of them - Lloyds,
Midland, and Royal Bank of Scotland - say they detected hitches early, but
were only very marginally affected. The number of customers who had to be
notified ran to tens rather than hundreds.
Royal Bank of Scotland says: 'We had some problems with direct debits going
out on statements, but it was really only a few cases that needed ironing
out.'
The bank worst affected was NatWest, particularly its 250,000 Gold Card
customers.
'The Gold Card has its own system and many customers pay by direct debit
each month,' NatWest says. Some customers' statements showed incorrect
late-payment details, or charges for non-existent cash advances, or gave
incorrect dates for transactions.
NatWest refused to discuss the technology involved, saying it was a matter
between the bank and FDR. The troubles seem to lie, however, in the
accounting and reconciliation ('back office') software, which is used to
manage the card transactions and pass information to the banks' main
computers.
Mr Gary Tobin, a senior vice-president of First Data Corporation, the parent
of FDR, emphasised that errors unrelated to the company's equipment might be
responsible for some of the complaints over credit cards. He said only a few
hundred errors had been recorded, a small total when converting some 10m
customer records from one computer system to another.
He said the conversion was necessary because Signet, the card processing
company acquired by FDR last year, which had been responsible for card
processing in Southend, was using 20-year-old software that lacked
up-to-date facilities or security. The new software was developed in the US
and 'anglicised' for UK use. Preparation took a year and involved 100,000
programming hours.
The entire customer list was transferred to the new system over one weekend
in July, he said. It would not have been possible to run the old and new
systems in parallel because of the cost of providing duplicate computer
hardware.
Old computer systems are notoriously difficult to manage and maintain
because they will have been patched and modified over the years.
Mr Tobin, who is based in New York, said he flew to London during July for
three weeks to oversee the transition to the new system, and left only last
Friday when he was confident that the conversion had been successfully
completed.
TSB said yesterday that it did its own card processing and was not directly
affected by the FDR system.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Civil servants' pay offer withdrawn after row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has taken the unprecedented step of withdrawing a pay offer
to a group of civil servants after members of the National Union of Civil
and Public Servants rejected terms for the reform of pay determination.
The move by the Treasury demonstrates growing ministerial impatience with
the 114,000-strong union's opposition to Citizen's Charter proposals to
extend per-formance-related pay and devolve pay bargaining.
It raises the possibility that the government will freeze the pay of NUCPS
members at last year's levels. A more likely option would be to implement
rises lower than the 4.1 per cent initial offer and introduce a
performance-pay scheme that provides a smaller role for the union.
The NUCPS might be left without a long-term pay agreement. The previous
agreement ended in May and was due to be replaced by a package taking the
performance pay and pay bargaining changes into account.
If the Treasury was no longer bound by a long-term agreement, it would be
free to abandon a formula linking pay rises to previous increases in the
private sector. In recent years the formula has helped civil servants to win
rises above the rate of inflation.
Previously the Treasury has imposed pay agreements when it has been unable
to win union approval for them, but it has not withdrawn them.
Some union leaders believe the withdrawal of the NUCPS offer is intended by
ministers to serve as a warning to other civil servants.
Of the Civil Service unions, only the CPSA has so far accepted a deal
similar to that rejected by the NUCPS.
Leaders of the FDA, IPMS and IRSF unions are recommending similar deals.
Ballots have still to be held. At the IRSF, which represents tax staff, many
members are unenthusiastic about their offer because of dissatisfaction over
previous performance-related pay arrangements.
The NUCPS has in recent years adopted a more hostile stance on pay than
other unions. It rejected last year's pay proposals.
The Treasury decision to withdraw the pay offer followed a vote among NUCPS
members to accept the 4.1 per cent increase in pay rates but reject the
amended long-term pay agreement. The Treasury had refused to separate the
two issues.
Mr Leslie Christie, NUCPS general secretary, told members in the union's
journal that the union could not accept the break-up of national pay
bargaining.
The Treasury is unlikely to outline its intentions on pay for NUCPS grades
until other unions have voted on their pay proposals next month.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Ashdown papers man 'did not steal'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OLD Bailey jury yesterday cleared Mr Simon Berkowitz of stealing a
confidential document detailing a former relationship between Mr Paddy
Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and his one-time secretary. He was,
however, convicted on a majority verdict of handling the stolen document.
Mr Berkowitz, 45, a painter and decorator from Hove, East Sussex, had been
accused of breaking into the offices of Mr Ashdown's City solicitors -
Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite - and taking the papers, which he then tried to
sell.
After a seven-day trial, the jury cleared him of the burglary and of
stealing Pounds 223 cash. Mr Berkowitz was jailed for 2 1/2 years for
handling the document, to run consecutively to a three-year sentence for
burglary at another solicitor's office which he is already serving.
The court was told Mr Berkowitz had 230 previous convictions for burglary,
many for break-ins at solicitors' offices.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Rising costs undermine profitability of unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF of all unit trust companies earned marginal profits or made losses in
1991, mainly reflecting spiralling costs of sales and distribution,
according to a survey.
Mr Derek Ross, partner at Touche Ross Management Consultants, said the
firm's latest industry survey showed that there was still significant
over-capacity in the sector and that consolidation was likely. 'The main
point is rationalisation,' he said. 'There are too many unit trusts.'
Recent figures from the Unit Trust Association, the industry trade
association, show that last year the number of unit holder accounts, at
4.46m, was the lowest since 1987. The number of trusts, at 1,400, was also
marginally below the peak. There were 157 separate unit trust companies,
compared with 139 in 1987, the peak year for net new investment, according
to the UTA.
The study shows that most unit trust companies made losses on the sales side
of their businesses, but many were able to recoup through operating charges
on ongoing business. Larger companies showed little benefit from economies
of scale, because cost savings on sales were eaten up by the higher
commissions and fee discounting they were forced to offer to remain
competitive.
The study concludes: 'Despite the scale cost advantages that large companies
enjoy, they do not appear to have converted them into a significant lead in
staff efficiency when compared with their smaller rivals.'
Mr Ross said Touche Ross had reviewed the three main sales channels -
independent financial advisers, direct sales and group sales forces - and
found that none was profitable.
Of the three channels, independent financial advisers accounted for nearly
60 per cent of all sales. Group sales forces, which accounted for 19.3 per
cent of all sales, incurred the highest commission costs and paid the
highest rebates of fees to unit holders.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Tec issues ultimatum on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Central England Training and Enterprise Council (Centec) has given the
hundreds of companies who contract with it a tough training ultimatum.
It has given its suppliers until November 1993 to register as committed to
Investors in People (IIP) or forfeit grants for training and enterprise
initiatives. Centec's budget this year was about Pounds 10m.
Centec, based in the West Midlands, is the first Tec to adopt such a policy
of contract compliance. Others among the 82 Tecs in England and Wales may
follow.
Mr Edward Roberts, Centec chairman, also chairs G10, the group of 10 Tec
chairmen that liaises with the government on broad issues. IIP was
introduced last year as a means of evaluating the process of training.
Companies have to convince Tec assessors that they undertake a range of
quality assurance actions - for example, that they regularly review the
training and development of all their employees.
Government and Tecs, which are responsible for accrediting companies with a
kitemark for training quality, hope that IIP will be a driving force for the
improvement of training.
The scheme has taken off slowly, with only 68 companies accredited, although
more than 1,000 throughout the UK have registered as committed to it. The
Department of Employment yesterday published a report saying its Restart
programme, which provides unemployed people with advisory interviews every
six months, has proved highly successful.
The Policy Studies Institute report says Restart brought a number of
benefits, including getting more people into jobs.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Handshake on Nafta could come today -
Reports indicate core of North American trade accord has been agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the US, Canada and Mexico are expected to announce today that
they have reached agreement, after 14 months of negotiations, on an historic
free-trade pact for North America.
The office of Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, did not confirm the
reports, but diplomatic sources said plans were under way for a ceremonial
'handshake' at the White House in the morning, to be followed by press
conferences with the three trade ministers. The three have negotiated
continuously for 10 days in the capital.
They were still negotiating late yesterday, but reports indicated the core
of the pact was agreed; what remained was largely the job of translating it
into hundreds of pages of legal text.
However, other sources close to the talks described the ceremonial
arrangements as provisional. They said difficulties had arisen in the
writing of summaries to be presented when the pact was announced, and unless
agreement was reached the talks could continue for another day.
Reports have been circulating in Washington that the Bush administration is
anxious to conclude the treaty before the Republican convention in Houston
next week, where the pact could be touted as an achievement by a visionary
president.
Mr Timothy Bennett, a trade consultant, said yesterday: 'Whether or not Mrs
Hills has had a deadline, there is a perception on the part of her
negotiating partners that the US is in a hurry.'
The North American free-trade agreement is a ground-breaking pact - the
first between a developing country and its industrialised neighbours and the
first to address the environmental problems which accompany rapid industrial
growth. It will create the world's most populous free-trade market - 360m
consumers - with an output of Dollars 6,000bn (Pounds 3,100bn).
Mr William Riley, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency,
said yesterday it would be 'the greenest international trade treaty the
world has seen,' setting a model for trade pacts in the future.
It would give states and local governments the right to prohibit entry of
goods not meeting their own health standards, stress 'sustainable
development,' prevent the lowering of environmental standards, and contain
an ambitious plan to clean up waste dumped along the border by polluting
companies.
The pact would also roll back thousands of separate tariffs over the next 5
to 15 years, spur new capital investment in all three countries, and create
new jobs.
It could take weeks for the agreement to be sent to Congress for an official
90-day notification period. It will not be voted on until next year. By then
there could be a new president and certainly a new Congress; with
retirements and defeats the House could have 150 new members.
Congress is not likely to vote down the pact but it could make problems by
demanding changes in environmental sections and provision for labour
adjustment.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Clinton offers gain through pain: Democratic party's
economic plans are attacked by Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Rep-ublican party prepares for its convention in Houston next week, a
top priority is to find a way to regain the initiative on economic policy.
Republicans, like British Conservatives, have traditionally seen economic
management as one of their electoral strong suits.
This year nothing is going according to plan. Instead of recovering
strongly, the economy is wallowing in its third successive year of
quasi-recession. To add to this frustration, Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, has seized the initiative with a detailed
economic plan emphasising the need for more investment in education,
training and infrastructure.
After a few weeks of disarray the Bush administration is beginning to
formulate a response. The main line of attack - reminiscent of that used by
the Tories against Labour in the British election - is to depict Mr Clinton
as an irresponsible proponent of higher taxes, spending and government
regulation.
The strategy is to cast doubt both on Mr Clinton's record as governor of
Arkansas and his plans for the nation. Vice-President Dan Quayle has accused
Mr Clinton of raising taxes and fees in Arkansas 128 times in 11 years. The
Clinton campaign argues the true figure is about 55, and points out that Mr
Quayle has overlooked the 48 tax cuts passed by Mr Clinton.
There is perhaps more mileage in attacking Mr Clinton's economic plan. Mr
Dick Armey, the top Republican on Congress's joint economic committee, this
week bitterly attacked his proposals, claiming that higher taxes and a
sweeping array of new regulations would lead to 1.8m job losses next year
and more than 3m over a Clinton presidency.
Mr Clayton Yeutter, a top White House aide, said the Democratic package
would result in a Dollars 300bn (Pounds 157bn) budget deficit in 1996, about
50 per cent higher than projected on current Republican plans.
Democrats immediately claimed the charges misrepresented Mr Clinton's
proposals.
The Democrats, however, are vulnerable in one respect. Like Mr Neil Kinnock,
the former leader of the UK Labour party, Mr Clinton has committed himself
to raising taxes on the wealthy. He hopes to raise Dollars 92bn over four
years by increasing taxes on the top 2 per cent of earners and by imposing a
special millionaire's surtax. This is to be balanced by minor tax cuts for
many middle-income families.
Republicans argue that higher taxes on the wealthy will depress growth next
year and directly cost about 440,000 jobs. They are also trying to undermine
confidence in Mr Clinton's health care, training and environmental
proposals.
On health care, for example, Mr Clinton supports a version of the 'play or
pay' reform advocated by congressional Democrats under which companies would
be required to insure all employees or to contribute towards the cost of an
expanded federal scheme for the low paid. To improve workforce skills, Mr
Clinton argues that all employers should be required to spend 1.5 per cent
of payroll on training.
The Republicans say both policies amount to the imposition of new taxes on
employers and thus will lead to more unemployment.
This is not necessarily true: given the flexibility of US labour markets,
the burden could be borne in lower wages. But it is hard for Democrats to
deny that policies intended to improve long-term competitiveness could
impose extra short-run costs on some businesses.
How the Republican critique will play with voters remains uncertain. At
present President George Bush is labouring under two big disadvantages.
His record is poor. He has presided over the slowest economic growth and the
biggest federal deficits of any administration since the second world war.
Federal domestic spending has grown at an annual rate of more than 8 per
cent in real terms, the fastest since the Kennedy administration of the
early 1960s. Mr Bush can hardly attack Democrats as big spenders.
Even worse, he still has no clear economic strategy. Conservatives are
urging him to promise swingeing cuts in income and capital taxes in a second
term. But a revival of the 1980s supply-side nostrums would make a nonsense
of Mr Bush's recent support for a controversial constitutional amendment to
balance the budget. After 12 years in which the federal debt has quadrupled
to Dollars 4,000bn, nobody would believe he could both slash taxes and
eliminate the deficit.
Against this backdrop Mr Clinton has the advantage of offering something
genuinely new. The heart of his cure for a debilitating slowdown in US
productivity growth is a shift of spending from consumption to investment,
with special attention to workforce skills and infrastructure.
Given the economic disillusionment of recent years, Democrats hope that
voters may find such a strategy more plausible than the quick fixes of the
last decade, even if it involves some sacrifices.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Angry Bush denies allegations of affair: Claims likely to
sour presidential campaign
</HEADLINE>

   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday angrily denied he had an extra-marital
affair with a personal assistant eight years ago in Switzerland.
Asked at a press conference with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime
minister, for his reaction to a New York tabloid newspaper report, he
snapped: 'I'm not going to take any sleazy questions like that from CNN. I
am very disappointed you would ask such a question of me.'
He went on: 'I will not respond to it. I haven't responded in the past. I am
outraged but nevertheless in this kind of screwy climate we're in I expect
it. But I don't like it and I'm not going to respond other than to say it is
a lie.'
Mrs Barbara Bush, who was at the press conference, said that 'fortunately'
she had not seen a copy of the newspaper in question.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, whose campaign was
nearly derailed earlier in the year by allegations of marital infidelity,
expressed sympathy for the president.
'I didn't like it (the newspaper story). I don't think it has any place in
this campaign,' he said in Miami. 'I feel for him. I like him on a personal
level, I like his wife.'
Earlier Ms Mary Matalin, the Bush campaign's combative political director,
as good as accused the Democratic party of being responsible for publication
of the story in the New York Post. 'They've been peddling this trash book to
reputable newspapers for years,' she said.
The newspaper account, spread over front and inside pages, was lifted from a
footnote in the 14th chapter of a new book about power broking in
Washington. In it the husband of the author, Ms Susan B. Trento, reports a
1986 conversation with Mr Louis Fields, who was a former US ambassador to
Geneva arms control negotiations but who died in 1988. This purportedly
described Mr Fields arranging a tryst for the then vice-president with Ms
Jennifer Fitzgerald.
Rumours of Mr Bush's liaison have been the stuff of cocktail party gossip in
Washington all year, but US news organisations have failed to unearth any
evidence. English-born Ms Fitzgerald, now a protocol officer at the state
department, was said yesterday to be out of the country.
The most obvious impact on the presidential campaign is to make it dirtier,
as had been predicted and as Ms Matalin's initial reaction demonstrated.
Much will depend on how the US media treats the latest developments.

<TEXT>
MR Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, and his cabinet are expected to
decide today whether to call a full-scale constitutional conference, in the
hope of concluding negotiations on the country's political future.
The conference, which would probably take place next week and be attended by
leaders of all 10 provinces, two territories and aboriginal groups, would be
a last-ditch effort to bridge differences remaining between Quebec and the
rest of the country.
Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, has indicated he would attend, after
boycotting national-unity negotiations for the past two years. He said after
an informal meeting with Mr Mulroney and the other premiers on Monday that
there were 'some attitudes (and) proposals which clearly have a purpose to
take into account the priorities of Quebec'.
Mr Bourassa is committed to holding a national-unity referendum in Quebec by
the end of October. He would like to have a deal in place by then which
could be presented to Quebecois as the best way for the Francophone province
to gain extra powers while remaining part of the federation.
The latest initiative comes barely a month after the nine English-speaking
provinces cobbled together a package of constitutional proposals which they
hoped would find favour in Quebec. But Mr Bourassa has indicated he cannot
accept some key elements.

Canute James looks at internal differences about an external tariff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENTS of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) have decided to review the
common external tariff amid indications that the controversial rates will be
lowered.
At their recent annual summit in Trinidad, the leaders were faced with the
prospect that their increasingly frustrated efforts to create a regional
common market in two years could be made more difficult unless a customs
union is established.
Despite several deadlines for its implementation, four Caricom members have
refused to impose the tariff, saying it would be inflationary and damage
fledgling light industries in need of protection.
The ground-level difficulties have been exacerbated by criticism of
Caricom's tariff levels from the US, the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. This, coupled with unfavourable comparisons of tariffs being
used or proposed by other regional groupings, has left governments concerned
that the Caribbean Community could become uncompetitive in exports and
investments if no changes were made to the common tariff.
Caricom, which has a market of 5.5m people, comprises 13 English-speaking
countries of the region, including Belize in Central America, the Bahamas,
and Guyana in South America.
It was established in 1973 with the aim of strengthening the economies of
its members through increased regional trade and a common approach in trade
negotiations with third countries.
All members except the Bahamas, which is not a signatory of the trading
agreements, have said they would implement the common tariff.
The common external tariff imposes low rates of duty on imports which do not
compete with goods produced within the community, but it sets high rates on
any imports which are likely to injure domestic industry.
The highest rate of duty within the community is 45 per cent and the lowest
5 per cent, replacing a structure in which tariffs ranged from 5 per cent to
70 per cent.
Rates differ according to whether the imports are raw materials or finished
products. Imported agricultural products attract the highest rate of tax in
order to protect local agriculture, while inputs for agriculture, such as
fertilisers and seeds, are subject to very low tariffs.
The Jamaican government has proposed that the highest level be reduced to 20
per cent but some Caricom members consider this too drastic, claiming there
is still need for protection in some sectors.
The review ordered by the heads of government will be completed in time for
an extraordinary summit at the end of October. It is widely expected that
the highest tariff will be cut to 30 per cent, with an agreed timetable for
further reduction.
'Caricom cannot have a common tariff implemented by some members and not by
all,' said Mr P J Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'High tariffs are out
of step with global trends and inconsistent with the mood of the
international marketplace.'
This opinion is shared by his St Lucian counterpart, Mr John Compton, who
argued: 'Industry cannot develop as a hot-house flower, artificially
protected by high tariffs and quantitative restrictions. Industry must
become efficient and not only compete in the domestic market, but seek to
penetrate the export markets which are now available.'
There are still doubts about the wisdom of changing the tariff. Mr Charles
Maynard, the trade minister of Dominica, opposes any rethink of the
structure and remains committed to the common external tariff as an
instrument of protection for regional agriculture and manufacturing.
There is agreement, however, that the community's agriculture sector must be
protected. 'There will still be a need to safeguard the agriculture sector
in the community because it will not be able to compete with subsidised
imports,' said Mr Patterson.
A senior official in Trinidad and Tobago's trade ministry said Caricom could
not afford to become a 'dumping ground for subsidised agricultural products
from countries such as the US where the annual subsidy on a farm cow is
higher than the per capita income in some Caricom states.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Dumping appeal by Norsk Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, said yesterday it
would appeal against a US International Trade Commission (ITC) decision to
levy tariffs on magnesium exports from its Canadian plant to the US.
The ITC ruled that unfairly low-priced pure and alloy magnesium exported to
the US from Norsk Hydro's Becancour plant was damaging the US magnesium
industry, with production subsidised through cheap energy prices from Hydro
Quebec, the Canadian electricity producer. Hydro Quebec is not part of the
Norsk Hydro group.
In July, the US Commerce Department cleared Norsk Hydro of allegations of
dumping magnesium from Norway in the US. The new ITC ruling seeks a 21.61
per cent countervailing duty on Norsk Hydro's Canadian pure and alloy
magnesium exports to the US, with a 32.33 per cent dumping duty on pure
magnesium. The company will appeal against the ITC decisions at a panel
under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and believed it would prevail.
Norsk Hydro wanted a review of the countervailing duty rate, taking into
account an amendment to an electricity deal signed this week with Hydro
Quebec. The new contract met all criteria spelled out in a July decision for
risk and profit-sharing electricity contracts not to be subject to
countervailing duties.
'This should allow elimination of the 14 per cent part of the countervailing
duty erroneously attributed to the electricity contract,' Norsk Hydro said;
the review should be completed before the year ended. In July, the company
said the Commerce Department had accepted its offer to renegotiate
power-supply contracts with Hydro Quebec and repay some CDollars 20m of
provincial investment funds from Canada and Quebec to establish its
Becancour plant. Since the charges were made last September, Norsk Hydro has
cut output to half the Canadian plant's 45,000-tonne-a-year capacity.

THE California legislature, agonising over the largest US state's desperate
finances, has failed to pass a compromise budget, Reuter reports from
Sacramento. California has been without a budget since June 30, when
Governor Pete Wilson and members of the legislature could not agree on a
solution to bridge a Dollars 10.7bn (Pounds 5.6bn) spending gap.
The legislature held a rare Sunday evening session to debate a Dollars
57.6bn compromise budget, seeking deep cuts in state spending and education.
But the measure was not backed by Republicans on Monday.
'I think the situation may be irreconcilable,' Mr John Vasconcellos, a
Democratic member of the assembly, said.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: CBI warns US against harming British trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry (CBI) yesterday warned of damage to UK
trade links with the US if Washington adopts laws aiming to raise more taxes
from foreign companies operating in the US.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, has told Mr Nicholas Brady, US
treasury secretary, and key Congressmen that proposed tax changes 'strike at
the heart of long-standing international tax principles underpinning
successful free trade and investment around the world'. The proposals were
'conceptually flawed, unworkable in practice, and discriminatory'.
Britain is the biggest foreign investor in the US, with holdings of Pounds
56bn. Mr Davies said the proposed new taxes would have 'disturbing
implications for British investment in the US, and US investment in the UK'.
Retaliation could not be ruled out.
The proposed US measures, some in a draft bill put to Congress in May and
endorsed by Mr Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate, are prompted
by suspicions that foreign companies artificially lower their US profits by
manipulating transfer prices with their US-based subsidiaries, in an
apparent bid to cheat the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
They are intended to raise new revenues without taxing US voters more
heavily. Mr Clinton wants to raise Dollars 45bn in the next four years by
'cracking down on foreign companies that prosper here and manipulate tax
laws to their advantage'. International anxiety over unilateral US action
where international agreement is seen as essential has led to the OECD
studying the issue.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary-general, has told Mr Brady the bill
'could have a damaging effect on the future development of world trade and
the long-run interests of the US'. The issue has grown as foreign direct
investment flows have surged. Foreign direct investment flows in 1990
amounted to Dollars 225bn (Pounds 117bn), the UN's World Investment Report
says, increasing 34 per cent a year between 1985 and 1990.
Trade between parent companies and foreign-based offshoots accounts for 40
per cent of total world exports, which amounted to Dollars 3,485bn in 1990.
The transfer pricing proposal would tax foreign companies as if their gross
profit margin were three-quarters of the US industry average, whether or not
they actually made a profit. Critics say such an assumption cannot be made.
Another proposal would put an arbitrary minimum tax level on foreign-owned
companies, discriminating between them and US companies. It would impose
capital gains tax on foreign shareholders with over 10 per cent of stock of
a US company, imposing a tax on insurance premiums.
