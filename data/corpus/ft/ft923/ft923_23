FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: China prepares to launch Australian
satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHINA will try again to launch an Australian satellite on Friday, five
months after a fire halted the last attempt and threatened its efforts to
offer such commercial services, Daniel Green writes.
Also hoping for success are BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the
UK and the Mayne Nickless group of Australia, members of the Optus
consortium owning the satellite. The consortium has paid Dollars A200m
(Pounds 77m) to buy, launch and insure the satellite, to provide pay TV for
Australia and New Zealand.
The satellite, Optus B1, was built by Hughes Aircraft, part of General
Motors. The rocket vehicle is the Long March 2E, a converted ballistic
missile. Success for China would give it a lead over the other likely new
entrant, Russia. Commercial launches by Japan and India are several years
away.

BRITAIN called on the Iraqi government last night to end its blockade of
Kurdish enclaves in the north, halt repression of Shia Moslems in the south
and allow the United Nations to operate freely throughout the country.
At a special meeting of the UN Security Council, Sir David Hannay, the UK
delegate, termed 'horrific' reports of attacks on Shia villages in the
southern marshes, including for the first time bombing by the Iraqi air
force.
Mr Max van der Stoel, former Dutch foreign minister now serving as a special
UN human rights investigator, told the Council that the only way to avoid a
'new human tragedy' was through a massive international aid programme.
At present, Baghdad's policy made it virtually impossible for relief
organisations to operate. This was in violation of UN resolutions, and
thousands of lives were at stake.
Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate, scoffed at the charges, calling
them 'half-truths'.
The Council adjourned without taking formal action, but members agreed to
keep the problem under review.
Diplomatic sources said the meeting was in part an effort to impress on
Baghdad the need to renew a 'memorandum of understanding' for continuing UN
operations, including a presence of some 500 UN guards.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Kuwait may be ready for Arab deterrent force
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HASTILY ARRANGED visits this week to Egypt and to Syria by Sheikh Salem
al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister, have prompted speculation that the
Gulf emirate may be ready to accept the presence of an Arab deterrent force
on its soil to counter renewed Iraqi threats.
Sheikh Salem said on his arrival in Damascus yesterday that his talks with
his Syrian counterpart and with President Hafez al-Assad would focus on
Iraq's 'false claims' and also its challenge to security council ceasefire
resolutions.
In defiance of UN resolutions, Baghdad used the August 2 anniversary of
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait to renew its claim to the tiny emirate,
thereby raising fresh tensions throughout the Gulf.
Egypt and Syria have been pressing for the implementation of the Damascus
declaration of March 1991, which laid out a programme of economic and
security co-operation between the two powerful Arab states and the six
members of the Gulf Co-operation Council - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
Under the accord, signed in the aftermath of the war, Egypt and Syria would
supply troops to the Gulf to deter further aggression in return for
financial assistance, including investment in their lagging economies.
However, after the declaration was signed the Iraqi threat receded and the
Gulf states were unable to agree on deployment of a deterrent force. Several
GCC members expressed reservations out of concern for a semi-permanent
presence of Arab troops on their soil.
Egypt and Syria were part of the US-led multinational force which expelled
Iraq from Kuwait in February 1990. Both expressed irritation over the Gulf
states' apparent reluctance to implement the accord.
Sheikh Salem said implementation of the accord would be discussed at a
meeting of Gulf foreign ministers in Qatar on September 9. Defending delays
in the implementation of the Damascus declaration, Sheikh Salem said: 'If
there was a postponement it was due to special circumstances and not to
disbelief in the principle of the declaration. We all have full agreement on
the declaration with all its security, economic and political sides.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / Tokyo share values drop to six-year low: Stock market fall
puts pressure on Japanese government to buoy sentiment
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOKYO stock market yesterday fell below the 15,000 level of the Nikkei
index, sending share values to their lowest since March 1986 and prompting
renewed government efforts to buoy sentiment.
At morning ministerial press conferences - after reportedly heated cabinet
discussions - it was announced that measures to provide indirect support to
the market were under consideration. However, this was not enough to draw
buyers back into the market. The Nikkei average of 225 leading companies, on
the decline for four sessions in a row, ended 243.78 points lower at
14,822.56.
Shortly after opening this morning the index had gained about 50 points.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, finance minister, held out the prospect of help to
financial institutions in unwinding problem loans. Land held by them as
collateral could be included in government purchases of sites for public
works projects, he suggested.
Mr Hata has been under fire from within the ruling Liberal Democratic party
over his ministry's allegedly tardy response to weakness in the economy and
property and equity markets. This prompted calls by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, for ministries to put aside sectional interests in
formulating autumn measures to stimulate growth.
News on the economy yesterday remained negative. The Economic Planning
Agency (EPA) said private sector machinery orders for June, excluding those
placed by the shipping and electric power industries, were down 19.2 per
cent from a year earlier and 3.2 per cent below the May figure. The EPA
forecast that machinery orders would be up 9 per cent in the current quarter
compared to the April-June period, which had shown a 17.9 per cent fall
against the previous three months. This would, however, still leave order
levels 14.3 per cent below the third quarter of last year.
In another measure of a sluggish manufacturing sector, June use of
electricity by Japanese industry, according to preliminary figures from the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), was down 2.3 per cent
from June last year, the fourth month in a row demand had fallen.
Mr Kozo Watanabe, Miti minister, said the structure of Japanese industry had
to be strengthened and went as far as disclosing his staff had given up
their summer holiday to prepare such measures. Mr Robert Feldman, economist
at Salomon Bros in Tokyo, said: 'The government has begun some serious work
on fiscal support, but it's a few months too late.'
Stock market turnover moderated to 190m shares from Monday's 200m, and some
comfort was drawn from a slowing in the slide by market leader Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone.
NTT shares closed at Y465,000 (Pounds 1,914), another record low, but the
fall of Y2,000 was modest compared with a Y42,000 fall the day before. Mr
Hideo Watanabe, posts and telecommunications minister, hinted that the
utility might be allowed to diversify. He added the ministry was also
considering using income from its postal savings and life assurance services
to invest in equities.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Japanese stock buyers continue to stay away: Emiko Terazono
looks at reasons for the disillusionment of the country's retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES CLERKS at the Nomura Securities branch in Ginza, the central shopping
and business centre of Tokyo, sit around idly behind empty counters. They
fail to react to the flashing price board, indicating another fall of the
Nikkei stock index.
Other than an occasional pedestrian peering into check share prices, the
branch is quiet, and the second floor of the branch, designated for
'individual investment consulting', is also deserted. With the Nikkei's
weakness well into its third consecutive year, Japan's individual investors
have reacted coolly to the recent plunge on the Tokyo stock market.
'I don't want to have anything to do with stocks,' says Mrs Kyoko Aoyama, a
housewife living in Tokyo, who purchased a total Y7m (Pounds 28,800) worth
of stocks in the late 1980s. 'I bought about seven issues, and wanted to use
the profits for my son's university tuition, but now I've lost about a third
of it. Looking at share prices just irritates me.'
Mrs Aoyama is only one of Japan's disillusioned retail investors who have
turned away from the stock market. Earlier this year, brokers tried to woo
individuals back into the stock market again with advertising campaigns and
investment seminars.
Other brokers have also tried to restore the fashionable image of stock
investments by using comic characters in television adverts. Brokers believe
that with institutional and foreign investors discouraged from buying, the
return of the private investor is essential for a stock market recovery. 'In
the past, active buying by individuals has signaled a rebound in share
prices,' says Daiwa Securities. But individuals have been unmoved by
Japanese securities houses' efforts to rebuild investor confidence, which
was shattered by last year's spate of stock scandals.
Risk-wary Japanese individual investors have shunned stocks for fixed-income
investments. Last month, stock investment funds saw Y326.4bn in
cancellations and redemptions, which exceeded new fund establishments in the
17th consecutive monthly net outflow.
In contrast, the money management fund - a new bond and money market fund
offered to the private investor - has attracted Y3,173bn since its debut
last May, and postal savings, which offer higher rates than normal bank
deposits, rose 16 per cent from last March, to Y158,000bn at the end of
June.
The low dividend yield of the market has also discouraged investors.
Japanese investors have generally focused on share price rather than
dividend yield, but with the stock market off 60 per cent from its peak, the
present yield on the Tokyo stock market, around 1 per cent, fails to be
attractive.
Financial authorities have become increasingly worried over the lack of
individual response. Mr Tadashi Ogawa, the newly appointed director of the
Finance Ministry's securities bureau, called for changes in the securities
industry to benefit the retail investor. The Tokyo Stock Exchange wants to
increase availability of shares to individuals, and is recommending a
reduction in the minimum investment unit from 1,000 shares to 100.
However, such measures are unlikely to convince individuals carrying heavy
losses on their stock portfolios. Mr Hideo Ichikawa, a 36-year-old Tokyo
office worker who borrowed Y5m to purchase stocks for the first time in
1989, says he is repaying the interest on his loans by borrowing more money
with his credit card. 'I've had enough. Working hard for a salary is the
best way to make money.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / Egypt struggles to overhaul its crumbling public sector:
Tony Walker examines a reluctance to sell off state industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president, visited Egypt last month to
review economic reforms he urged quicker progress in making structural
change and warned against falling behind in commitments.
'A great deal has been achieved, but a great deal remains to be done,' he
said. 'Time is of the essence. It is crucial that the momentum of economic
reform be maintained to realise sustainable growth as soon as possible.'
Behind Mr Preston's words lie fears among IMF and World Bank officials that
Egypt, having made an exemplary start in fiscal and monetary reform, will
falter when it comes to overhauling its crumbling, but politically
sensitive, public sector which accounts for some 70 per cent of industrial
activity.
Officials say Egypt is too cautious in determining state-owned enterprises
for rationalisation and divestiture and in initiating sell-offs to private
investors.
They blame entrenched bureaucratic interests, such as those represented by
the General Authority for Investment (GAFI), for the laggardly approach to
structural reform. One official observed that 'perhaps the most constructive
thing we could do would be to dynamite GAFI.'
While Egypt has attracted much favourable attention recently for its
successful implementation of a fairly rigorous IMF programme, and for new
legislation aimed at liberalising various aspects of its economy, grave
misgivings continue to be expressed about its commitment to
politically-risky reforms of public-sector dinosaurs.
'The reality is that they have to create 600,000 jobs a year. Their export
of labour is getting to the point of saturation. They need growth and that
requires new private-sector investment,' said a western economist.
'What is required is for the private sector to reach a critical mass of
confidence and start investing in employment-generating activities, and that
clearly is not happening.'
An IMF official says lack of progress on liberalising the public sector
should not be judged too harshly, since Egypt had embraced one of the 'more
courageous' austerity programmes put forward by the Fund for less-developed
countries.
It has curbed growth in the money supply; brought the deficit under control,
reaching an IMF target of 7 per cent of GDP in 1991/92; reduced subsidies on
a wide range of items; markedly improved its balance of payments; stabilised
its currency; and built up a healthy central bank reserve of about USDollars
7bn.
The World Bank, which set aside some Dollars 300m of a Structural Adjustment
Loan and an additional Dollars 100m to help cushion redundancies, is worried
that once momentum slows it will be difficult to regenerate. Hence Mr
Preston's warnings.
An increase in Islamic extremist agitation has made the ultra-cautious
Egyptian authorities even more nervous about structural reforms which may
cause redundancies and risk unrest in the streets.
The government, through its newly-created Public Enterprise Office (PEO),
has identified 20 enterprises, either wholly state-owned or joint ventures,
for privatisation. These small to medium-sized enterprises in areas such as
cement, food processing, textiles and chemicals are being evaluated some
under a scheme funded by the US Agency for International Development.
A representative of the PEO, defines the privatisation criteria for Egyptian
enterprises: 'They must be profitable, medium-sized, not governed by too
many regulations. They must have minimal labour problems, be non-strategic,
attractive to investors and pose no environmental hazards.'
This would seem to rule out, for the time being, the state-dominated
financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, the national
carrier EgyptAir, and heavy manufacturing industries.
Potential investors and aid donors remain sceptical of a new public-sector
law designed to facilitate privatisation. Concerns persist that the law,
which groups Egypt's industrial enterprises in 27 holding companies, adds
another layer of bureaucratic control, making divestiture and
rationalisation even more difficult.
Likewise, bankers and local businessmen warn that while new capital markets
and banking regulations will improve the regulatory environment,
bureaucratic attitudes are impeding progress towards a more liberal economy.
A prime example is a proposed paper mill in upper Egypt, using the cane
residue from local sugar refineries. The project, vital to an Egypt almost
totally dependent on imported paper, has been caught up in unaccountable
bureaucratic delays since the mid-1980s, defying central efforts to impose a
solution.
The episode stands as an extremely bad advertisement for Egypt's claims that
it craves foreign investment in employment and wealth-generating local
industries.
Both the IMF and World Bank, in their combined efforts to keep Egypt on the
straight and narrow path of reform, will be engaged in further consultations
throughout the rest of the year. The IMF, whose 18 month stand-by agreement
with Egypt expires in November, will begin talks next month on new
arrangements.
A Fund official said one option was to conclude an enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF), under which concessional finance would be
available for structural change to complement the World Bank programme.
Egypt's May 1991 standby agreement was restricted to balance of payments
support.
There would seem to be few serious impediments to Egypt reaching agreement
with the Fund so it can continue debt rescheduling in line with last year's
agreement with the Paris Club of creditor nations. A 50 per cent reduction
in Egypt's Dollars 20bn debt to its Paris Club creditors is being achieved
mainly through phased interest rate cuts. Total foreign debt stands at
Dollars 40bn.
The World Bank, which has disbursed half of a Dollars 300m structural
adjustment loan, is seeking further trade liberalisation, including tariff
cuts, and accelerated public-sector reforms before releasing the second
tranche. It says there is no timetable for the release but hopes Egypt will
warrant a further reward by the middle of next year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday joined the call for an urgent United
Nations military intervention in Somalia as UN officials in Mogadishu said
they were nearing agreement with the battling warlords on the arrival of
armed UN guards to protect relief operations.
The Commission said the EC's 12 member states should immediately put
pressure on the UN to ensure food and medical supplies were 'protected by a
greater number of blue berets. Without protection,' the Commission went on,
'international organisations and non-governmental organisations face strict
limits on their activities.'
According to the Commission, UN intervention is now 'extremely urgent'. The
Commission also said it could unblock funds to assist with greater
humanitarian action.
Aid workers say the security situation and massive looting and banditry make
it impossible to distribute food to the most malnourished.
Gen Mohammed Farrar Aideed, a warlord who controls the south of Mogadishu,
has consistently blocked intervention of foreign troops, saying it threatens
Somalia's sovereignty. However, a UN official in Mogadishu said yesterday
that Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's representative
in Somalia, was close to getting Gen Aideed's agreement for limited military
intervention to secure the port and international airport and perhaps to
establish safe food corridors. 'It's looking much better and we could have
an agreement within 48 hours,' he said.
In Nairobi Mr Abdul Mohammed, an expert on relief in the Horn of Africa,
criticised the lack of action. 'It is absolutely immoral for the UN and the
world to listen to warlords who talk of sovereignty while they fail to feed
their people or provide basic law and order,' he said.
A UN mission is now in Somalia considering how to improve delivery of
massive food aid. They will report to the secretary-general by the weekend.
Their report will form the basis of further action by the Security Council.
In Mogadishu Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, told Irish radio
the catastrophe in Somalia was a 'worse obscenity' than Bosnia and called
for the European Commission to double its aid. Another African organisation
added its voice yesterday to criticism of the poor efforts of the
international community to alleviate the horrendous plight of millions of
starving Somalis.
Ms Rakiya Omar, the executive director of Africa Watch, said: 'The world is
only acting now on Somalia because of intense media and public pressure.
They have known about the tragedy for months and their record is a
disgrace.'

The meeting comes shortly before the UN Security Council is scheduled to

Since the sanctions took effect on April 15, Egypt has been mediating

prime minister in 1971 and 1984, Mr Lamrani replaces Mr Azeddine Laraki, 63,
whose centrist government was dismissed by the king on Monday after being in
office for seven years.
The king told the outgoing government Morocco was on the eve of important
political developments including a referendum on a new constitution,
followed by rural, municipal and legislative elections.

The threat of a summer of discontent looms in France with dockers calling a
nation-wide dock strike today and disgruntled farmers renewing protests
against EC agricultural reforms, Alice Rawsthorn reports from Paris.
The dock strike will be the second national stoppage at France's ports this
week.
Farmers yesterday occupied the Agriculture Ministry's office at Auch in the
Gers region seeking the right to put their case to Mr Pierre Beregovoy,

Living standards and production throughout the Commonwealth of Independent
States are plunging sharply, according to figures produced by the CIS
statistical committee, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The figures show national income for CIS states down more than 18 per cent
for the first six months, compared to the same period in 1991. In Armenia,
fighting neighbouring Azerbaijan, national income was down to 53.4 per cent
of the previous year. In Moldova, where a civil war raged for much of the
early part of 1992, it was down to 72.1 per cent. Production declines of 12
and 20 per cent were recorded in most states.

MILITANT supporters of ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia took Georgia's
interior minister hostage yesterday along with a group that included a top
adviser to Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, AP reports from Tbilisi.
Mr Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who now heads the ruling
state council, told of the kidnapping in the western city of Zugdidi on
Georgian television.
The area has been a strong base of support for Mr Gamsakhurdia, ousted from
power in January.
Mr Shevardnadze warned he was prepared to take 'extreme measures,' including
the use of force, to win the release of Interior Minister Roman Gventsadze
and the other hostages, including his adviser on national security.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Serbs scent victory in war-torn Bosnia: 'We should all sit
down and make peace .. We control 70%. But we only claim 64%'
</HEADLINE>

   BANJA LUKA, NORTH-WESTERN BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU see what a big country we have. It took nine hours for me to get to
Banja Luka by car,' says Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the
self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia.
'We have a functioning government. We have everything. All we need now is a
negotiated settlement,' he says, sitting on a dark balcony of the Hotel
Bosna in Banja Luka, seat of the republic.
Mr Karadzic rejects an offer from a Serb official to order the city hospital
to switch off its generator so that the hotel can get power.
Candles, and the blue flash of light from a passing armoured personnel
carrier, cast shadows on the Serb leaders and soldiers in camouflage
uniforms. There is an air of celebration in the hot night. The Serb leaders
are noisily swapping stories, after arriving from towns where communications
have been knocked out by the war. They appear oblivious to the bursts of
automatic weapons fire.
A confident Mr Karadzic says he is ready to have an 'all-for-all' prisoner
exchange. He blames the delay on Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of
Bosnia, who he says refuses to accept the offer. Mr Karadzic does not
mention that the Moslem Slav prisoners have no home to return to. They have
been destroyed.
Mr Karadzic, who politically describes himself as 'a leader of the centre',
says he is ready for a peaceful solution in Bosnia.
'One day we should all sit down and make peace in the Balkans, even give up
some territory,' he says, adding: 'We now control 70 per cent. But we only
claim 64 per cent as ours.'
Mr Karadzic says he is ready to make peace because he knows that Serbs, who
make up less than one-third of the 4.35m population, have succeeded in
carving out their own republic in Bosnia.
The political reality is that Bosnia-Hercegovina no longer exists. Mr
Karadzic appears unconcerned about western military intervention. 'It would
be a bloody big mess - with no clear political goals,' he says.
Banja Luka, a 195,000-strong city in north-western Bosnia, is surrounded by
villages, some of which have been devastated. Houses have been razed to the
ground. Serb forces and local government officials have driven out Moslems
and Croats. Houses which have been dynamited, the walls standing, but the
roof blown off, bear witness to the process of 'ethnic cleansing'.
To reach Banja Luka from Pale, Mr Karadzic's mountain stronghold just east
of Sarajevo, drivers travel through corn fields and along dirt roads. Along
the way, Serbian army soldiers check identity documents.
Crowds of women refugees stand on the roadside under the blazing sun waiting
for a passing car to take them to an unknown destination.
Many villages have no electricity or telephone lines with the outside world.
Soldiers ' all Serb men and many women have been mobilised - sit and drink
beer, waiting for the war to end.
Battles between Serbs, on one side, and Croats and Moslems on the other, are
still taking place around Brcko, once a town of 87,000 people, north of
Sarajevo, near the border with Croatia. Amid a barrage of gunfire, a
19-year-old blond soldier says: 'The Ustashe (Croat militia) are just over
the bridge.'
Brcko's centre has been looted, the houses burnt out. Walls of standing
buildings are riddled with bullet holes. A road sign bearing arrows to
Sarajevo, Zagreb and Belgrade has been crossed out and shot at. In their
place, are signs, hand-printed in large black Cyrillic letters. As if to
erase the past, they point to Banja Luka and Belgrade, Serbian capitals.
Mr Karadzic proudly points out that the Serbian Republic of Bosnia has its
own currency. The notes bear the Serbian symbol of the two-headed white
eagle. 'We dropped the communist symbols, and adopted a real Serbian symbol,
not like Belgrade,' he boasts.
The charm of this bushy-haired Serb leader, a psychiatrist and poet, stands
in stark contrast to the senseless destruction and deaths of some 10,000
people in the four-month war in Bosnia.
Indeed, local Serbs are outraged at allegations that they are operating
concentration camps. A soldier tells how Serbs would never open death camps
because hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gipsies during the second
world war were killed in an Ustashe concentration camp, operated by pro-Nazi
Croats.
But prisoners in the Serb-run Manjaca detention camp, about 20km from Banja
Luka, appeared cowed. Some are very thin and dressed in old and ragged
clothes.
On a visit to the camp, Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of Britain's opposition
Liberal Democratic party, said: 'This is not a death camp. This is not a
concentration camp. It is a prisoner of war camp.' But he described
conditions in the camp as vile and said they must be improved.
Manjaca is surrounded by barbed wire. Signposts warn that the area has been
mined. Col Bozidar Popovic, the camp commander, blames UN sanctions for
food, medical and other shortages which the prisoners have to endure. A
soldier says: 'It is war. What do you expect. But the prisoners have better
conditions than many of our boys at the front.'
Col Popovic says: 'I can personally guarantee that the conditions here are
90 per cent better than Izetbegovic's camps for Serbs.' But a prisoner, who
identified himself as Havazic, said he had been transferred three days
previously from Omarska, where televised scenes of painfully thin prisoners
last week shocked the world.
'It was cruel. They broke our ribs,' said Havazic. He is from Kozarac, a
village near Prijedor where the camps are centred.
Mr Karadzic says it costs Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,570) a day to feed the
3,500 prisoners in Manjaca. He adds that this is a burden on the republic
which must now start improving its economy. He offers to pay the bill for
visiting foreign journalists. Hotel workers shrugged sceptically.
One weary woman shakes her head and says in a cynical voice: 'Sure Karadzic
will pay.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / US demands action on human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has called for all those violating international humanitarian law in
the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere to be named and brought to justice.
In a strongly-worded speech to the United Nations Human Rights Commission,
Mr Morris Abram, US ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said yesterday many such
crimes fell within the jurisdiction of domestic courts or military
courts-martial. 'Trial before an international tribunal is another
possibility,' he said.
Mr Abram, a veteran civil rights campaigner who was on the team at the
Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal, said countries were reluctant to take
effective action against those abusing human rights.
'The standards and laws are out there, all that is required is action - in
particular, action against those who commit acts of genocide and torture.'
Mr Abram was speaking ahead of a two-day session of the Human Rights
Commission, starting tomorrow on human rights violations in the Yugoslav
republics.
A US-drafted resolution to be put to the 53-member Commission, which has
support from other, so far mostly western, countries, condemns 'widespread,
massive and grave violations' of fundamental human rights and the practice
of 'ethnic cleansing'.
It calls for appointment of a special rapporteur to investigate abuses, the
immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained and immediate access for
the International Committee of the Red Cross to all detention camps and
prisons.
The resolution also reminds countries of their obligations under
international humanitarian law, in particular that individuals are
responsible for their actions and that states are accountable for rights
violations committed by their agents on another state's territory.
This would pave the way for possible action against Serbia for atrocities
perpetrated by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Some 36 Yugoslavs were deported from Britain last month, the Home Office
confirmed last night.
They had come via other countries where they had already claimed asylum and
were being returned to those states in accordance with the international
convention on the treatment of refugees, an official said.
About 4,000 Yugoslavs a month were being allowed to enter Britain as
visitors.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Serbia opens up Bosnian camps: Women and children allowed to
leave Sarajevo Aid convoys given better access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIA yesterday bowed to international pressure by opening up some
detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina and by allowing greater access to some
towns and cities in the former Yugoslav republic for humanitarian relief
supplies.
The Serbs also agreed to let mothers and children begin leaving the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, which Serb irregular forces have been besieging for
four months. The first convoy of buses with 300 women and children is due to
leave today with an escort of United Nations peacekeepers.
Ms Sylvana Foa, an official with the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR), said aid convoys for Bosnia were now getting through more
quickly and easily. 'Once these people have realised how outraged the world
community would be by the sight of people starving to death, that had a
major impact, probably more than even the threat of the use of force,' she
added.
But the Serb move to lessen their grip on some areas is also aimed at
pre-empting any international military intervention, threatened in a UN
draft resolution expected to be put to the Security Council today.
It also indicates a growing confidence on the part of Serb leaders that
their forces have achieved most of their aims in Bosnia. Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, said yesterday his forces had already
achieved their aims, implying that he was now in a position to co-operate
fully with the UN.
'We have everything. We now control 70 per cent (of the territory of Bosnia)
but we only claim 64 per cent. All we need now is a negotiated settlement,'
he said in an interview.
A spokesman for the UNHCR warned that Serbs were still expelling Bosnia's
Moslems, who make up 43 per cent of the 4.3m-strong population. The official
said that about 20,000 Moslems would be forcibly deported from the region
around Bihac, north-western Bosnia, to neighbouring Croatia as part of Mr
Karadzic's plan for 'ethnic cleansing' of those parts of Bosnia under Serb
control.
The agreement to evacuate mothers and children from Sarajevo was reached by
Serb forces and a children's aid organisation. Some of the first evacuees
will go to Austria and others to Croatia.
The UN draft resolution calls on all states to take 'all measures necessary
to facilitate, in co-ordination with the UN, the delivery of humanitarian
assistance to Sarajevo, and wherever needed in other parts of
Bosnia-Hercegovina'. The resolution also demands unimpeded and continuous
access to all camps, prisons and detention centres.
UN diplomats said they expected support from most Security Council members,
although Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, showed signs of distancing
itself from supporting UN sanctions imposed on Belgrade last May. It also
refrained from condemning the existence of detention camps.
In London, Mr Thomas Niles, US assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian affairs, said he hoped the adoption of the resolution 'will make it
possible to (deliver aid) peacefully and without any use of military force'.
But he said 'military measures would be contemplated . . . as a last
resort'.
Nato is likely to discuss this issue on Friday when all 16 member states
meet to consider contingency plans for the possible use of force in Bosnia.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Building societies hold rates despite increase by Skipton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE building societies yester-day moved to head off a general increase in
mortgage interest rates after Skipton, the 14th largest society, raised its
rates for investors and borrowers.
Skipton, which has assets of Pounds 2.7bn, triggered fears of a general rise
in mortgages when it announced that the rate it charges existing borrowers
would rise by 0.5 of a percentage point to 11.25 per cent from today. New
customers will be charged 10.99 per cent.
Alliance &amp; Leicester and National &amp; Provincial, the two large building
societies which were thought most likely to follow Skipton, made it clear
that they would not do so, reducing the immediate likelihood of a general
rise.
Alliance, the fourth largest society, said it did not wish to do anything
that might depress the housing market still further and so would be very
reluctant to raise its mortgage rate.
Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, the sixth
largest, said: 'We believe building societies should continue to encourage
confidence in house-buying through attractive mortgages.'
The forbearance may be only temporary, according to Mr John Wriglesworth,
building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker. 'I think
because of the pressures on societies, mortgage rates may rise gradually
over the remainder of 1992, but they will do so in a ragged fashion as
lenders withdraw special offers and discounts,' he said.
Instead of raising their mortgage rates immediately, the large societies may
cut their rates for savers, after two similar moves earlier this month by
National Savings, which trimmed its rates to relieve pressure on the
societies.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest society, yesterday said it was
cutting its rates to savers by 0.45 of a percentage point from August 15.
Nationwide, the second largest, made a similar move last week.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, Bradford &amp; Bingley's chief executive, said the society
had decided to reduce its rates because of the fall in the inflation rate
rather than widen its margins by increasing its mortgage rates.
These moves will pose difficulties for smaller societies, which are thought
to have been especially hard hit recently by savers' reluctance to place
their money with building societies.
The larger societies, however, may find it difficult to hold down their
savings rates for the rest of the year. Several are already close to the
ceiling on the amount they are allowed to raise in the wholesale money
market.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Late recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED intervention by the world's central banks in support of the dollar
triggered a recovery in both the sterling cash and futures markets yesterday
after a rather bearish start to trading.
Sterling futures contracts had dipped in early trading, after the pound
opened about 20 points lower against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges.
Shortly before the central bank's intervened at lunchtime in London, the
September sterling contract was off by about 4 basis points from its opening
level, at 89.65, and the December contract was off 6 basis points, at 89.73.
Intervention then boosted both the dollar and sterling, with the pound
peaking at DM2.8304, nearly  1/2 a pfennig up from its opening level.
Futures followed the currency upwards, with the September contract closing
up 2 basis points on the day at 89.71. The December contract closed down
unchanged on the day at 89.79. Both closing prices continue to reflect the
market's belief that a base rate cut is a far off prospect.
Rates in the sterling cash market firmed upwards in the morning even though
the Bank of England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 550m. The market
often finds the smaller shortages harder to remove, because the Bank invites
no offers of bills in the early round and each discount house waits for the
next one to take the shortage out. This was the pattern of yesterday's
trading, and the overnight rate firmed up to 10 1/2 per cent by lunchtime.
Following the central bank intervention, short-dated rates softened again.
One week money again closed below the base rate figure at 9 3/4 per cent
from a previous close of 9 7/8 per cent on the offered side. Three month
money closed  1/16 per cent down on the offered side at 10 1/4 per cent.
Rates were also softer at the long end, with 1 year money ending down  1/8
per cent at 10 5/16 per cent on the offered side.
In its money market operations, the Bank of England again dealt at 9 7/8 per
cent in Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent in the repurchase agreement
(repo). In the morning, the Bank only bought Pounds 6m in Band 1 and Pounds
6m in Band 2. The forecast was revised to Pounds 600m, and in the afternoon
the Bank bought Pounds 67m in Band 1 and Pounds 10m in Band 2. There was
late assistance of Pounds 325m.

US TREASURY prices rose sharply at the long end of the maturity range
yesterday after a successful three-year auction and the latest economic news
buoyed investor sentiment.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year bond was up  15/32 at 108, yielding
7.326 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, however, at 100 1/4 , to
carry a yield of 4.099 per cent.
The long end received a modest boost early on from overseas buyers, but
there was a conspicuous lack of strong domestic demand. Most investors were
waiting for the afternoon sale of Dollars 15bn in three-year notes, which is
the first leg of the Treasury's latest Dollars 36bn refunding programme.
Despite investor caution, most analysts predicted that the auction would be
completed successfully. Those predictions subsequently proved accurate. The
issue was awarded a yield of 4.65 per cent, as expected, and demand for the
new securities was solid.
THE combination of sterling weakness and fears of higher interest rates
pushed UK government bond prices lower yesterday morning, but gilts recouped
some of their losses later, following the release of producer prices data.
News that the Skipton Building Society was raising interest rates on
mortgages by half a percentage point depressed gilt prices, leading to fears
of a base rate hike.
Gilt prices later recovered some of their early losses after the release of
the producer prices figures for July showing output prices rose by 3.4 per
cent in the year to July, against 3.5 per cent in the year to June.
Sterling started on a weak note, but later strengthened slightly against the
D-Mark as central bank intervention to support the dollar helped ease
tensions in the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system.
The Liffe gilt future contract opened at 96.30 - down from Monday's close of
97.04 - and fell to a low of 96.22 before trading at 97.01 by late
afternoon. In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 fell
from its opening of 115 7/32 to 115, yielding 9.45 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as yesterday's drop in the Nikkei stock
index to below 15,000 sparked hopes of a further easing in interest rates.
The Nikkei stock index dropped 243.78 points to close at 14,822.56, its
lowest level since March 1986.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.00 per cent and moved to 4.96
per cent in Tokyo trading before closing at 4.99 per cent and trading in
London at around 4.965 per cent.

public offering price will be between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a share,
according to the company's registration statement.
USX said in April it might sell shares in its Delhi Group, including the
Delhi gas pipe line and other related companies, as part of its efforts to
realise shareholder value. The Delhi Group had sales of over Dollars 423m in
1991, with operating income of about Dollars 31m and assets of Dollars 598m.
USX had also considered selling assets or creating a limited partnership.
USX said yesterday the proceeds from the offering would be used for the
business purposes of its Marathon gas group. The Delhi group had been part
of the Marathon group.
The effort to realise additional value for Marathon follows the company's
stock split last year, when USX agreed to issue a new class of stock after
pressure from Mr Carl Icahn, the New York financier.

MR STEPHEN Mulholland, chief executive of South African Times Media (TML),
has been appointed chief executive of John Fairfax, Australia's
second-largest newspaper group.
Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December, when it was
acquired for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.03bn) by a consortium led by the
Daily Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black.
Mr Mulholland's success in his new appointment will depend on the extent to
which he replicates in Australia the methods he used to turn round TML.
He was appointed to the company in 1986 to rescue the ailing TML, then known
as South African Associated Newspapers (Saan), by Mr Gordon Waddell, then
chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI), the South African
mining house which controlled Saan.
Mr Mulholland had been editor of the weekly Financial Mail magazine, but
with no previous management experience. However, his appointment is widely
seen as a success. He turned the company round from heavy losses to steadily
increasing profits.
Fairfax publishes the Sydney Morning Herald.

THE battle over ownership of LTV's aircraft and missiles businesses
continued to escalate yesterday, when LTV announced it had a new offer of
Dollars 475m from the Loral/Carlyle/Northrop team.
Only a week ago, LTV announced a preliminary agreement to sell its entire
aircraft and missiles operations to defence group Martin Marietta for
Dollars 440m. This came only days after defence group Loral offered Dollars
240m for LTV's missiles business, in a joint bid with the Carlyle Group, a
Washington investment firm, and defence company Northrop, which together
offered Dollars 190m for LTV's aircraft side.
The latest offer consists of Dollars 450m in cash and Dollars 25m in
referred stock. The bidding partners said it exceeded the Martin Marietta
offer by Dollars 35m, and by Dollars 54m in cash. They also said that
Carlyle and Northrop had already received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, and
that Loral's closing was not conditional on Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance.
The deal still needs approval of the bankruptcy court, which oversees LTV's
assets.

per cent second-quarter profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WAL-MART Stores, the largest US retailer in terms of sales, yesterday
unveiled a 21.5 per cent increase in second-quarter profits after tax, to
Dollars 420.4m. The advance came on the back of a 26 per cent sales rise, to
Dollars 13bn, writes Nikki Tait.
The second-quarter results take Wal-Mart's profits for the first six months,
to end-July, to Dollars 807.4m, up from Dollars 652.8m a year earlier. Sales
increased from Dollars 19.6bn to Dollars 24.7bn.
Earnings per share were up from 30 cents to 37 cents in the second quarter,
and from 57 cents to 70 cents in the first half. The group's shares rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 57 1/2 on the news.
Part of the advance comes from Wal-Mart's highly aggressive expansion
programme. In the second quarter alone, the discount retailer opened 20 new
Wal-Mart stores and 18 Sam's Clubs - wholesale clubs which sell at
rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base.
By the end of July, the company was operating 1,755 Wal-Mart stores and 233
Sam's Clubs. It covers 44 states, having recently added Idaho.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIXED fortunes in the US retail sector were apparent yesterday when JC
Penney, the large department store group, and The Limited, the specialty
retailer, reported second-quarter earnings.
Penney, based in Dallas, fared better, posting after-tax profits of Dollars
80m in the 13 weeks to July 25. This compares with Dollars 31m in the same
period a year ago, and is scored on sales of Dollars 3.79bn, up by 9.6 per
cent on the same period a year earlier.
This takes Penney's sales in the first half to Dollars 7.58bn, a 10.1 per
cent advance on the first six months of 1991, and net profits to Dollars
216m from Dollars 111m. The figures were helped by a Dollars 15m drop in
interest charges to Dollars 61m, thanks to a debt restructuring programme.
Mr William Howell, Penney's chairman, said sales of autumn merchandise were
'particularly encouraging' in the latter part of the quarter. He added that
Penney still expected 'favourable results' during the second half.
By contrast, The Limited, the fashion retailer which takes in Victoria's
Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, had a 'disappointing' second quarter.
After-tax profits were flat at Dollars 80.1m compared with Dollars 79.2m,
while sales stood at Dollars 1.49bn against Dollars 1.35bn.
This takes the group's profits for the first six months to Dollars 131.6m,
little changed from the previous year's Dollars 130.1m, with sales totalling
Dollars 2.9bn up from Dollars 2.66bn.
Mr Leslie Wexner, The Limited chairman, admitted that consumer uncertainty
had persisted, but blamed the figures on 'below standard merchandising
decisions'.
He added that he was encouraged by early customer acceptance of the fall
fashions. 'While we will be able to develop a better understanding of fall
when we analyse the last half of August and early September sales. I am
guardedly optimistic.'
Later, Nordstrom, the west coast-based fashion retailer, released the
sector's worst figures for the day. It revealed that second-quarter profits
after tax fell from Dollars 49.9m to Dollars 41.7m, on sales of Dollars
951.6m (Dollars 904.1m). This takes profits for the six months to end-July
to Dollars 63.2m, down from Dollars 75.5m in the same period of 1991.
The company said existing stores were keeping pace, in sales terms, with the
previous year, but there was no sign of 'any marked increase in consumer
spending'.
Nordstrom shares tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 . Penney shares,
which have risen strongly, dipped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 , while
The Limited lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 , close to their 52-week
low.

<TEXT>
DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits up 15 per cent to DM164m (Dollars 112m) in the nine
months to June. This was achieved on turnover down 5 per cent to DM9.4bn.
The company said it expected the benefits of a restructuring and
cost-cutting plan to produce better profits for the final quarter, compared
with the same period last year. In 1990-1991, total pre-tax profits dropped
by 44 per cent to DM179m, reflecting difficult conditions in many markets.
Degussa said yesterday it had cut losses in the metals sector
'significantly'. This sector, accounting for nearly half of group turnover,
suffered through losses at the Leybold machinery subsidiary and because of a
30 per cent drop in turnover in precious metals trading, where trading
volumes were significantly lower than the previous year.
Excluding the drop in precious metals trading, group turnover rose by 5 per
cent, Degussa said. But it added that 3 percentage points of this were due
to the inclusion of the recently acquired Arzneimittelwerk Dresden - an east
German pharmaceutical group.
Degussa also announced it will be issuing 1.08m new shares in September at
DM225 per share, raising DM243m.

A RESTRUCTURED Dominion Textile is showing continuing recovery at the
operating level, but special charges brought a final net loss of CDollars
57.8m (USDollars 48.8m) or CDollars 1.71 a share in the fourth-quarter ended
June 30.
This compared with a loss of CDollars 70.3m or CDollars 2.14 a share a year
earlier.
Operating profit before the special items was CDollars 33.7m against
CDollars 7.5m a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 383m, up 7 per cent. For
all fiscal 1992, operating profit was CDollars 86m against a loss of
CDollars 15m a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.4bn, up 8 per cent.
After the special items net loss was CDollars 75m or CDollars 2.31 a share
against a loss of CDollars 129m or CDollars 4.07 a share in fiscal 1991.
Mr Charles Hantho, president, said deteriorating conditions in some
non-strategic businesses required the special provisions. 'Now we are
looking forward to return to profitability on an annual basis.' For the
latest year denim sales rose 33 per cent and yarn 19 per cent, while prices
improved and raw material costs declined.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A market dogged by overcapacity -
Christopher Price on the perennial problems faced by the travel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S falls in the share prices of Owners Abroad and Airtours has once
again focused worries over the impact of price discounting on the holiday
groups' revenues as the summer season enters its final leg.
Dismissing the speculation, Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director of Owners
Abroad, said that 'discounting in the high season is never heavy' and that
reports of overcapacity had been overdone.
But in spite of such denials, rumours of large-scale discounting have
refused to go away, undermining the performance of the shares in recent
months and fuelling stories of a return to the price-war days of the
mid-1980s.
The problem for tour operators and industry analysts alike is that they must
make their forecasts some 18 months prior to a particular season.
Consequently, demand and supply figures for the 1992 summer season will have
been calculated in April last year. Forecasting the right number of holidays
to offer will result in less price discounting and higher revenues.
While everyone agrees that this year's holiday market has grown, there seems
little doubt that the tour operators' forecasts from last year were
optimistic, not surprising given the accepted wisdom of a consumer-led
recovery.
But most analysts reckon that while many in the industry were forecasting up
to 30 per cent passenger growth this year, the actual figure has been about
5 per cent. This in a market where Owners admits to increasing its holidays
by 16 per cent, Airtours by 30 per cent and Thomson by an estimated 6 per
cent. Between them, these three supply 75 per cent of the package tour
market.
The result has been a flurry of weighty discounting, particularly in May and
June, although a marked improvement has been reported in the the past four
weeks.
One problem for analysts is the difficulty in obtaining hard information on
the state of the market - some have been forced to visit travel agents to
gauge levels of demand and discounting. Their fears were partly confirmed
last week when Lunn Poly, the travel agency chain, said that oversupply
would mean bargain holidays for late bookers.
Thomson, the market leader, has been the most vociferous in declaring its
intent to defend its market share, even at the risk of sparking another
price war. It fired the opening salvo in January, slashing Pounds 15m from
300,000 holidays. Its rivals have been forced to retaliate in order to fill
their excess capacity.
While some degree of discounting is catered for in company budgets and
market forecasts, it is this vicious circle of overcapacity and sliding
prices that the City fears. Analysts have responded by revising forecasts
and the shares have traded on low price-earnings ratios compared with the
market.
Owners Abroad, whose shares crumbled from 121p on March 2 to stand at just
66p yesterday, is currently at a discount to the market of about 50 per
cent. Airtours' discount is about 36 per cent, reflecting its lower
operational costs and higher profits growth. Even so, its shares have
tumbled from 334p at the end of April, to 215p yesterday.
'The City is unlikely to ever give holiday companies a premium rating
because of their ability to increase capacity so quickly and the low
barriers to entry to the industry,' says Mr Hamish Dickson at broker Hoare
Govett. 'It all makes for a very volatile profit line.'
It also undermines the credibility of an industry trying to build confidence
after the collapse last year of International Leisure Group, the UK's second
biggest tour operator. But a succession of smaller highly-publicised
insolvencies - such as Monday's appointment of receivers at Manchester
Flight Centre - and a swirl of summer rumours that a medium-sized operator
may follow suit, have not helped the industry's image, although it has to be
said that those companies at risk are usually either niche players or
operating outside of the mainstream of the industry.
The large established companies, such as Airtours and Owners Abroad, are
cash-strong and able to withstand most of what the volatile industry brings
their way.
Mr Peter Hilliar, at BZW, says: 'It has always been a very cyclical industry
with profit dependent on its peak periods. When discounting is low and
booking high the share prices are still kept at a 15-20 per cent discount.
Now their ratings have slipped back on all the old fears. The market needs
to be convinced that the profits are going to be delivered.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / De Beers predicts cut in dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African controlled diamond group, yesterday predicted a
'significant reduction' in the final dividend - only the second time in the
group's history that the dividend will have been cut.
De Beers also said it would take the very unusual step of introducing quotas
on diamond producers from September. The two moves together suggest that the
world diamond market is in a weaker state than many observers had believed.
The group's share price fell in Johannesburg yesterday, closing 6 per cent
lower at R68.50 (R73). The share has fallen 24 per cent in the last two
months.
Under the quotas, contractual obligations of the Central Selling
Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers organisation which markets about 80 per
cent of the world's rough diamond production - to take delivery of diamonds
will be cut by 25 per cent.
De Beers has followed a policy of not cutting its dividend, so predicting a
large reduction is a course it would rather have avoided.
De Beers said it had revised the diamond market's outlook because of lower
CSO sales. This partly resulted from weaker than expected economic
performances in its three main markets - the US, Japan and Europe - leading
to lower retail jewellery sales and lower rough diamond sales.
The market weakness was exacerbated by a 'dramatic increase' in the supply
of illicit diamonds from Angola, some of which were sold on to the market
outside of the CSO.
The group's interim figures for the six months to June were weak but in line
with market expectations. Combined attributable earnings of De Beers and
Centenary, its offshore arm, fell 26 per cent to Dollars 330m (Pounds 172m)
from Dollars 446m in 1991.
Although De Beers had predicted the second half would be better than in
1991, the board said yesterday that it might be worse. The group forecasts a
'greater percentage reduction' in the full year's profits than for the first
half.
Equity accounted earnings dropped to Dollars 460m from Dollars 586m in 1991.
The interim dividend remains at 25.1 US cents per linked De Beers/Centenary
unit.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Shake-up for the big sell-off: Haig Simonian on changes to
Italy's public sector companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milan's merchant bankers have been using words such as 'revolution' and
'earthquake' to describe the government's plans, announced last Friday, to
shake up Italy's four biggest public sector companies.
The plans, announced by the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, include
cutting the boards of the four, recently transformed into joint stock
companies, to three members, and handing over decision-making to the
government.
The bankers' comments contrast with the cautious optimism with which they
earlier greeted the programme to privatise the four groups: IRI, the
industrial holding company; Eni, the energy and chemicals group; ENEL the
electricity generating authority; and INA, the insurance concern.
The latest changes involve the abolition of the committees and boards
composed of up to 15 political placemen, chosen to reflect the balance of
power between the governing parties. Instead, the new slimline boards
comprise the existing, politically appointed, chairmen, with reduced
executive power, a new post of managing director (to be filled internally)
and a senior civil servant.
Future acquisitions, disposals or flotations will be decided by
shareholders' meetings. This means the treasury, now the four groups' single
shareholder, will have the ultimate say.
The groups now have the legal and management frameworks to prepare for
flotation. Mr Amato said he wanted to create a 'big Italian national
industry' open to foreign participation. Once floated, the companies would
close the gap between a few big public-sector groups and a handful of quoted
private-sector counterparts. However, it could be some time before the
government starts to dispose of the assets over which it now has control.
This month the treasury appointed a committee of six economists and bankers
to report on the scale and timing of sell-offs. Their findings are not due
before the end of next month.
Mr Amato has already said the move towards the market will affect the four
groups differently. IRI and Eni face the biggest changes. Unlike ENEL and
INA, which are single product companies, they comprise huge conglomerates.
An imminent reorganisation is planned leaving 'some parts stronger and
disposing of others', said Mr Amato.
IRI, which accounts for about 5 per cent of Italy's gross national product
and employs almost 410,000, is set for major surgery. It controls offshoots
such as the Ilva steel group or Alitalia, the state airline, while
subsidiaries such as STET in telecoms and SME in foods are substantial
sub-holdings in their own right.
Some IRI subsidiaries, for example Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and
Credito Italiano, two leading banks, are already quoted, as are its
telecommunications interests. IRI planned to dispose of assets and cut its
stake in others prior to last week's announcement. With consolidated debts
of around L60,000bn, (Pounds 28bn) it has been facing a growing financial
crisis.
Direct grants from the treasury, IRI's traditional source of funds, have
dried up under the government's attempts to cut the huge budget deficit and
tighter European Commission supervision. Meanwhile, interest charges have
surged, while IRI has been reluctant to axe subsidiaries' investment
programmes.
Earlier this year, the group raised L480bn by selling its 52 per cent stake
in its Cementir cement unit. Funds have been raised by reducing stakes in
its bank and telecommunications units. And in November, Finmeccanica, the
sub-holding controlling IRI's engineering and aerospace interests, will make
its stock market debut.
IRI's most obvious disposals under accelerated privatisation are likely to
be jewels such as BCI, Credito Italiano and parts of SME, with further
reductions in telecoms and the disposal of Finsiel, its big software arm.
A big placement, notably of IRI's shares in either bank, would send a
powerful signal to the markets of the government's determination to
privatise.
Eni is in better financial shape than IRI. Agip, its oil and gas exploration
business, and Snam, its gas pipeline subsidiaries, are profitable and
destined for flotation early next year. Other parts of Eni could also be
sold relatively fast. First to go could be its remaining stake in Italgas,
its retail gas distribution operation, which is already quoted and followed
abroad.
Floating Eni is less appealing. Not all its empire is in the black. The
EniChem chemicals operation lost L742bn after minority interests last year
and is still suffering from the sectoral downtrend. Among Eni's activities
are a loss-making Milan newspaper and a big property portfolio.
Merchant bankers see ENEL as an obvious privatisation candidate, although
not for a few years. A key to ENEL's appeal will be government willingness
to liberalise tariffs, which will determine profitability.
Liberalisation could also be important for INA, which may be the easiest to
privatise. The company, one of Italy's biggest insurers, also controls the
quoted Assitalia insurance group and owns stakes in state-sector companies
including Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano.
With the government winding down this week for a brief holiday and the
treasury awaiting the privatisation committee's report, bankers are not
expecting any action in a hurry.
Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, has delayed meeting merchant bankers
until the report is ready.
The group may be looking at more innovative solutions than straight
disposals, including issuing bonds, convertible into the shares of
state-owned companies due for privatisation. That would boost receipts from
the start without forcing the government to rush sales or overwhelm the
relatively limited domestic equity market.
Some bankers are betting on a cautious programme, based on deals in the
pipeline, perhaps with one spectacular placing, like the full-privatisation
of BCI or Credito Italiano.
'We want to make sure we create the right atmosphere for future sales,' says
a senior official.

FT  12 AUG 92 / GA seeks Pounds 300m in share capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Accident, the third largest composite (general and life) insurer,
yesterday announced that it aimed to raise capital to finance possible
expansion after posting a significant improvement in the first six months of
1992.
Pre-tax losses fell to Pounds 21.2m compared with Pounds 105.2m at the
halfway stage last year. Perth-based GA recorded a profit of Pounds 9.5m in
the second quarter and maintained its dividend at 9.7p per share.
The company is to seek shareholders' approval to issue up to Pounds 300m
preference shares. This is designed to reduce debt and increase GA's leeway
to augment its premium income at a time when insurance rates are rising in
most of its main markets.
Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general manager, ruled out any sudden expansion
but added that the company did not want 'to feel unduly restricted' as
profits came through.
An issue of Pounds 100m would allow GA to boost solvency (net assets as a
percentage of non-life premium income) to 40 per cent from 37 per cent and
to reduce its debt, which stands at Pounds 610m. Debt of Pounds 250m is due
for rescheduling next spring.
The announcement, which follows a Pounds 100m issue by Commercial Union in
May, is a further indication of an improvement in trading conditions for UK
insurers.
Companies such as GA, CU and Guardian Royal Exchange, which lack large
exposure to mortgage indemnity business - where analysts forecast an upward
revision of losses in view of the continuing slump in the housing market -
are particularly well placed.
At GA, a sharp reduction in underwriting losses to Pounds 216.3m, compared
with a Pounds 288.9m loss in the same half last year, underpinned the
improvement. Long-term profits fell to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 15.5m profit).
Estate agency losses rose to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 8.4m loss) and net
investment income to Pounds 190.4m (Pounds 176.1m).
UK underwriting losses were substantially reduced to Pounds 104.8m (Pounds
178.4m loss), following cost-cutting measures and a more selective approach
towards underwriting.
Staff numbers in the UK have fallen from 8,000 to about 6,500. The number of
policyholders in the loss-making motor sector has fallen by about 20 per
cent.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Producer price rises slow to 1968 rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose in the
year to July at the lowest annual rate since 1968.
A 0.1 per cent rise in the producer prices index last month brought the
year-on-year increase to 3.4 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in June.
The index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, has fallen from a
peak of 6.2 per cent in April 1991 to July's 3.4 per cent, responding to
government attempts to squeeze the upward pressure on prices and reflecting
weak domestic demand.
Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the economy comes from
the rise in the index once volatile food, drink and tobacco prices are
excluded. This increased by 0.1 per cent on the month, bringing the
year-on-year rise to 2.8 per cent compared with 2.9 per cent in the year to
June.
The seasonally-adjusted prices of raw materials and fuels used by
manufacturing industry were flat in July compared with the previous month,
but remained 1.5 per cent down on a year ago.
Input prices unadjusted for seasonal factors fell by 0.7 per cent last month
compared with June, reflecting depressed commodity prices. The Treasury said
falling input prices with stable unit-labour costs would ensure further
reductions in the annual rate of producer price inflation over the coming
months.
On Friday, the retail prices index for July is expected to show a small rise
from June's 3.9 per cent before resuming a downward path later this year.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Demerger of ICI and long-term planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr SIMON DOUGHTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a former employee of ICI, and having worked in both Britain and
Germany, I was not altogether shocked to learn of ICI's demerger plans. Such
things were discussed frequently in 1982-1984, when I was an ICI-supported
PhD student at the old corporate research laboratories.
The question of whether the demerger argument is spurious in the eyes of the
German 'Big Three' (Letters, August 10) must also be looked at from (yet)
another angle. The acknowledged industrial advantage held by BASF, Bayer and
Hoechst is that a high percentage of their respective businesses is
generated from just one major chemical plant, with the associated economies
of scale in basic utilities, as well as human and financial capital.
ICI has from the start been a collection of separate plants, which served to
reinforce the divisional differences. The future ICI Bio businesses have
done most to break down these old barriers.
This problem of geographically dispersed plants is not exclusive to ICI.
The French chemical industry is similarly structured. In this respect the
management of human capital is made more complex by questions of mobility.
One can only hope for the employees of the future ICIs that the new
structures will allow the management to plan more long term, and remove the
pressure on the cyclical businesses to produce 'pharmaceutical' profits, a
pressure which is, as stated by Dr Sally, purely external.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: The means to pay restraint end need to be stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS TRINDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader, 'Pay restraint and the ERM' (August 6), the aim is
admirable, but the means suggested to achieve it need strengthening.
You recommend that 'the government should state categorically that it will
not accept settlements in excess of 2 per cent next year . . .', but
progress could be made on settlements still outstanding this year. The wage
rise for 40,000 firefighters falls due in November and should be based on
upper quartile male earnings increases 1991-1992, expected to be at least 6
per cent. A 6.5 per cent rise for 120,000 police from September 1 has not
yet been ratified. And 10,000 National Health Service managers have their
pay decided by a secretary of state decision which has yet to be finalised.
You say 'now is not the best time to cut public employment', but settlements
for the 1.5m local authority workers cannot be controlled until July 1993
(white collar) and September 1993 (manuals). Manpower reductions are the
only way to make immediate savings.
Finally, settlement norms which apply equally across the board are
inefficient. Increases only where extra revenue generated exceeds the
additional expenditure, or where the adverse consequences of persisting with
existing rates outweigh the benefits of increasing them, may be a better way
to get the desired result.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Impasse or impetus on the road to reform: Riots in southern
China pose a dilemma for the leadership's programme of liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The violent events of Monday night in Shenzhen, south China's showcase of
market economics, will mark either a brief detour along the road of reform
or another impasse to the country's 13-year experiment with economic
modernisation.
The decisions taken by China's leaders over the next few weeks in response
to the rioting will show whether Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior
leader, can hold the ring, or be forced to stage a tactical retreat ahead of
this autumn's 14th congress of the Communist party - one of the most
important in its history.
Thousands of small investors, possibly goaded by local gangs, rampaged
through the city, burning vehicles and assaulting police. Twenty arrests
have been made so far. China has not seen such civil strife since the spring
and summer of 1989 when students occupied Tiananmen Square in Beijing in
their demonstration for more democracy.
The riot in Shenzhen had a less abstract, though no less potent, cause.
Small investors were angry at having been allegedly cheated by corrupt
officials out of the chance to participate in the local stock exchange's
latest round of share issues.
The government responded by sending in the police, rather than the army  - a
relatively lenient approach which shows the city's importance as a symbol of
economic liberalisation. Shenzhen is one of the original four special areas
set aside for capitalist development. A little more than a decade ago
Shenzhen was a flat track of poor agricultural land on the northern side of
China's border with Hong Kong. Today, it is the brightest city on China's
'gold coast', and gold - in the form of company shares - is what lured 1m
people from as far away as Beijing in the north and Sichuan in the
south-west over the weekend.
China's first stock market opened in Shenzhen in December 1990. Eighteen
companies - embracing bicycle and television manufacturers, petrochemical
and glass companies - are now listed on the exchange, eight of which permit
foreign ownership through 'B' shares. These rank equally with 'A' shares
which are reserved for Chinese nationals.
The market is capitalised at about Yuan44.5bn (Pounds 4.29bn). Since the end
of April, the market index has risen threefold and its constituent companies
now trade on an aggregate historic price to earnings ratio of about 85. This
compares with an average ratio of 24 in Taiwan and about 13 in Hong Kong,
and indicates the high demand for equities in China.
The rating in Shenzhen and, to a lesser extent in Shanghai where China's
second and smaller stock market is located, reflects less the quality of the
companies listed, however, and more the scarcity of available stock. For
local Chinese investors, there are few assets to buy. Housing is
state-owned; private car ownership virtually non-existent.
Total 'official' household savings in China are estimated at Yuan1,000bn, a
figure which does not take into account the savings stashed in people's
homes. In Guangdong province, where Shenzhen is located, foreign currency
held in private hands is estimated to be in excess of USDollars 3bn.
But with negative real interest rates on savings, the Chinese are in thrall
to the nation's fledgling stock markets. The potential for large gains, so
far, has been large. In a similar share offering in Shenzhen last year a
domestic investor who paid Yuan7,000 for 2,000 shares would today own shares
worth up to Yuan50,000.
'No wonder all the trains and flights are squeezed with people from
different corners of the country, with ID cards and money from the whole
village in their pockets,' one Shenzhen official, referring to the latest
offering, was quoted as saying in the Chinese press.
It is ironic that Deng Xiaoping launched his latest drive for economic
reform after his much-publicised tour of southern China in January this
year. Shenzhen was the tour's focal point and has since become the model of
economic liberalisation.
The tour was probably Mr Deng's last attempt to steer the reform course, an
effort that will culminate in the 14th congress. Mr Deng, who is 88, wants
the party to 'elect' pro-economic reformers to prominent party positions and
embrace his concept of a 'socialist market economy'.
It is still unclear what a socialist market economy means in detail, but the
broad outlines appear clear. The congress is expected to stamp its approval
on the creeping deregulation of the economy that has gathered pace over the
past six months. Already China has declared main cities along the Yangtze
river and the Yangtze river delta open to foreign investment and external
trade.
The congress seems likely to accept that market forces may determine the
fate of the bloated state industries. Beijing's recent decision to let 15
companies go out of business suggests that it is prepared to tolerate the
social costs - principally rising unemployment - of company failures, though
the move only goes a little way towards addressing the extent of the
problem.
More price reform is expected to be endorsed by the congress, as well as a
change in working conditions to allow easier hiring and firing, and possibly
further steps towards allowing people to buy their own homes.
This was the direction in which China was heading on Monday when rioting hit
Shenzhen. While it is possible that the violence could derail reform, this
is not considered likely by observers, who feel the congress will endorse
the broad thrust of Deng's plans.
Nevertheless, risks exist. Deng may be China's most important leader but his
power is not unlimited; rule in China is a subtle mix of consensus building
and coercion.
The Shenzhen riot comes at a critical time during the process of consensus
building. It provides fresh ammunition for the conservatives in Beijing who
are already concerned by the rapid acceleration in the country's growth rate
to an annual rate of more than 15 per cent, and the inflation which is
likely to increase in its wake.
So far, Beijing's reaction appears measured. Mr Lau Gan, the cabinet
secretary, is reported to have been dispatched to assess and report on the
causes of the riot and the allegations of corruption. Serious as it was, the
riot did not develop into an open challenge to the Communist party's right
to rule, in the way that the Tiananmen demonstration did. The object of the
crowd's anger was corrupt officials who allegedly gave preferential access
to share application forms to family members and friends.
It was Mr Deng who said: 'It is a glorious thing to get rich.' The people
who travelled to Shenzhen were taking him at his word. China's leaders may
conclude that the road to ruin for the Communist party now lies in
preventing, rather than allowing, the Chinese people to give full vent to
their material aspirations.

Three enormous Jiffy bags were delivered by express courier to FT
journalists yesterday. What was inside? A T-shirt? An annual report? No. All
that each contained was a large manila envelope. And inside that envelope -
a single sheet of paper. Still, hope springs eternal. Perhaps the piece of
paper would reveal vital news. Not a bit of it. It was Standard Life's
investment view, which contained such gems as 'housing market remains
depressed'. It would seem that such 1990s concepts as cost-cutting and
saving the environment have yet to reach one of Britain's largest life
insurers.

Staff at the World Health Organisation's Geneva headquarters have an
unsolved murder on their hands - the decapitation of a Japanese carp,
long-time resident of the restaurant's ornamental pool. Could this be the
work of disaffected officials who want Hiroshi Nakajima, the Japanese
director-general, out of the UN agency's top job?
He is being challenged by Mohammed Abdelmoumene of Algeria, who was removed
last month from his post as deputy director-general. Nevertheless,
Abdelmoumene's campaign to take over from Nakajima when his present term
expires in July 1993, seems to be gaining momentum. France and the US have
declared their support and other European Community members look likely to
follow suit.
Nakajima has been criticised for lack of clear leadership at a time when the
WHO has a key role to play, for instance in the worldwide battle against
Aids, and for his authoritarian management style.

An unusual example of munificence from the tight-fisted people at the
Treasury. Three years ago, Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
suffered a humiliating rejection when it tried to join Iosco, the
international grouping of securities regulators. It was eventually fobbed
off with 'affiliate' status. But now the Treasury - which has since taken
over financial regulation from the DTI - is planning to stump up Pounds
100,000 of the Pounds 600,000 cost of Iosco's annual bash, which this autumn
takes place in London.
Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will also be hosting a
jolly at the Royal Academy for the 700 regulators, spouses and other
hangers-on.
Presumably it's all meant to reinforce the City's standing as an
international financial centre, though goodness knows why the City couldn't
have put up the cash itself.

Spare a thought for Japan's prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Less than a
fortnight ago he was trying to set his workaholic countrymen an example by
announcing that he was taking 20 days off this summer.
According to the latest Labour Ministry figures, the average worker in Japan
took just 8.2 days holiday in 1990. When Miyazawa took office last November
he vowed to change this and help dent foreign complaints that Japanese work
too hard. He set in train a five-year plan to cut Japan's current 2,016-hour
average working year to 1,800, the present European average. A typical
German put in slightly fewer than 1,500 hours last year.
It all sounded jolly sensible. However, some of the barons in Miyazawa's
ruling Liberal Democratic Party are not so sure. LDP policy chairman Yoshiro
Mori, concerned by the slowdown in the economy, is reported as saying that
the prime minister should cancel his holiday and get back to work.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: Heard on a grouse moor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It will be interesting to see whether Scottish landowner Christopher Moran,
the first broker to be expelled from the Lloyd's insurance market, is going
to make it back into the list of Britain's seriously rich people.
Moran, who used to be reckoned to be as wealthy as GEC's Lord Weinstock, was
upset when The Sunday Times left him off its recent list of the 300 richest
people in Britain.
Moran, who owns Scotland's Glenfiddich estate and is spending Pounds 25m on
Crosby Hall, his new Cheyne Walk home, told the paper that his property
assets were worth some Pounds 200m and he had little or no borrowing. Ivan
Fallon, The Sunday Times' deputy editor, has promised to reinstate him.
However, it sounds as if Moran might soon be a little less wealthy than he
was. A US federal judge has just ordered him to pay Dollars 2m to settle an
alleged insider-trading lawsuit linked to his sale of shares in Zondervan, a
publisher of Christian books and Bibles.
When Observer contacted Moran yesterday on his Scottish grouse moor, he
sounded remarkably unperturbed by what might seem to some a legal setback.
His view is that the judgement is unenforceable in the UK and the case
should be tried in the English courts, where it would be defended. And no,
it would not prevent him going to America.
He promises me that his finances are in good shape. He degeared before the
1987 stock market crash, and his ownership of Chelsea Cloisters and half a
dozen other buildings which are fully let, assures him of a healthy income.
He intends to become more active again when the market is right but 'for the
moment we are free-wheeling and shooting some grouse'.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Personal View: Why dividend cuts are a last resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dividends and dividend cuts are back in the headlines after last week's
announcement by BP. This prompts the question: how much do dividends matter?
Over the long haul, they matter a great deal. Ignoring dealing costs, a
tax-exempt investor who put Pounds 1,000 into a broad portfolio of UK
equities in January 1955 would today have a portfolio worth Pounds 157,000.
If the dividend cheques had instead been torn up, the portfolio would be
worth only Pounds 25,000. The difference is attributable to dividends and
dividend growth. This explains why long-term investors care about dividend
growth, and hence about dividend prospects and announcements.
Dividend announcements provide important information about the future. This
follows from the ground rules companies use to set dividends. First,
companies 'smooth' dividends, with changes tending to follow shifts in
long-run sustainable earnings. Transitory changes are seldom allowed to
affect dividends. Second, companies take future prospects into account, and
since managers generally have better information than investors, dividends
provide an important communications channel. And third, companies try to
avoid dividend cuts at (almost) all costs.
These ground rules help ensure that dividends provide a simple, highly
visible signal about future prospects. This signal has built-in credibility
because it is backed up by hard cash.
Evidence confirming the importance of dividend announcements is provided by
a recent London Business School research study. This examined nearly 6,000
dividend announcements by UK companies from January 1989 to April 1992.
Announcements were divided into five groups: larger increases (more than 25
per cent), modest increases, maintained, cuts and omissions.
The left-hand graph shows the cumulative abnormal returns for each of these
sub-groups from 20 days before the announcement to 20 days afterwards.
Abnormal returns are defined simply as actual returns (capital gains plus
dividends) less the returns on a control group of companies of similar size.
The share-price reaction to the announcement is consistent with both the
direction and magnitude of the dividend change. There are also significant
abnormal returns over the 20 days beforehand, and these too are consistent
with the subsequently announced dividend. But in the 20 days afterwards
there is, on average, little further reaction.
The same chart also shows that there is a marked asymmetry between dividend
increases and reductions, with reductions conveying the most (and worst)
news. In the month leading up to and including the announcement date, the
abnormal returns for larger increases, modest increases and held dividends
were +3, +1 1/2 , and -  1/2 per cent respectively. Dividend cuts and
omissions experienced price falls of 7 and 12 per cent.
The study also examined longer-term returns from a year before until a year
after the announcement. The most striking finding was the pattern of returns
during the year beforehand. For companies which subsequently announced
larger increases, modest increases and maintained dividends, the prior-year
abnormal returns were +19, +9 and - 5 per cent respectively. In contrast,
companies which cut or omitted their dividends showed prior-year abnormal
returns of - 26 and - 37 per cent. Once again, however, post-announcement
performance is broadly neutral.
The second graph focuses on dividend cuts, extending the time frame to a
four-year window centred on the announcement. It provides the strongest
evidence yet that companies which reduce their dividends have been
performing very poorly, and that much of the bad news has been discounted
prior to the announcement. Thus over the two-year pre-announcement period,
companies which reduced their dividends showed an abnormal return of - 39
per cent ( - 33 per cent for cuts and - 46 per cent for omissions). The
larger companies in the sample showed an even greater abnormal return of -
46 per cent, ie: in relative terms they had lost nearly half their value.
The right-hand chart also shows that the market's reaction to dividend cuts
is not a short-term emotional over-reaction, since, on average, there is no
subsequent 'price correction'. For dividend reductions, the two-year
post-announcement abnormal return was - 5 per cent, while for larger
companies it was -  1/2 per cent. This approximately neutral performance
suggests that, on average, the market's assessment was broadly correct when
the dividend was announced.
Although dividend reductions became far more prevalent in the second half of
the period covered, particularly in 1992, research indicates that the
share-price reaction to cuts has in no sense mellowed.
Companies contemplating dividend cuts can draw a simple lesson from these
findings, namely that the market interprets cuts as a powerful signal of bad
news. Investors know the ground rules companies follow, and they reason that
companies will not cut dividends unless they have to. They also recognise
that cutting the dividend has, until now, placed companies in a fairly
dubious club of poor performers, with many notorious corporate casualties as
fellow members.
Many argue that companies should change their ground rules, and make
dividend cuts more frequently. One suggestion is that they should maintain a
constant pay-out ratio, automatically lowering dividends when earnings fall.
This, however, would result in volatile dividends, and would impose costs on
investors who have chosen particular stocks for their income requirements.
It would also mean that companies could no longer use dividends as signals.
Even more importantly, it could let management off the hook. For as long as
dividends are viewed as a quasi-commitment, this maintains the pressure on
management to find ways of cutting operating costs and improving efficiency.
Companies concerned with their shareholders' interests would therefore be
well advised to adhere to the conventional ground rules, and adopt a
consistent, long-term dividend policy which is appropriate for their
clientele of investors, and compatible with the cash needs of their
business.
But what if the policy ceases to be consistent with the company's cash
needs? The worst action companies could take would be to cut back on
profitable investment projects, or otherwise to jeopardise the future of the
business. This would be short-termist indeed.
The choice such companies face, however, is not one of dividends versus
investment; potentially they can do both by seeking external financing. Such
companies should view this not as a dividend problem per se but as a
financing problem. A dividend cut would be one possible solution but, in
general, it should be embarked upon only if the situation is truly bleak.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Critical months in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN MAY not yet be suffering a western-style recession, but the
probability that it will do so rises by the day. The official government
line remains sanguine. But the stock market knows better; and its continued
downward path suggests further troubles to come. Little wonder that, behind
the scenes, Japanese officials are becoming increasingly edgy.
Japan is midway through an Anglo-Saxon style debt deflation, a fact that is
finally dawning in Tokyo. Japan's debts are concentrated in the financial
sector, while household debt levels remain low. And the Bank of Japan has
been able to cut interest rates five times in the last 13 months to ease the
pressure, albeit in a tardy fashion compared with the US Federal Reserve.
Japan's disadvantage is that bank balance sheets are closely tied to the
value of the stock market through the banks' holdings of unrealised equity
capital gains. Share values have fallen by 62 per cent since their 1989 peak
and yesterday's fall in the Nikkei average to 14,822.56 was the first time
it has closed below 15,000 since March 1986. Only a few months ago, analysts
quoted 16,000 as the floor beyond which bank capital adequacy ratios would
be violated.
The pressure on banks to re-build their capital is spilling over into the
wider economy. Only the most creditworthy customers now receive a warm
welcome. Bank lending in July was unchanged from June, the eighth successive
month in which the growth of bank lending hit a record low. Broad money
growth has slowed almost to a standstill.
Depressed confidence
Not surprisingly, the economy looks sicker by the day, despite government
claims that the slide is coming to an end. Japanese companies continue to
cut investment, and private sector machinery orders, excluding shipbuilding
and electric power companies, fell by 19.2 per cent in June compared with a
year ago.
Even Japan's consumers, normally sheltered from the turbulence of the
economic cycle, are feeling the pinch. The ratio of job offers to applicants
is at its lowest level in four years, and some smaller companies are
shedding staff. Consumer confidence is depressed and department store sales
are falling.
Official government forecasts for 3 1/2 per cent growth this year now look
absurd, as even the Ministry of Finance concedes. But the Tokyo market
consensus of 2 1/2 per cent growth, a better reflection of current MoF
thinking, still looks too optimistic. Economists at the London subsidiary of
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, released from Tokyo's conformity, plan to halve their
current 1.2 per cent forecast for 1992. Nor does next year look much better,
even if a world recovery can fuel Japan's already impressive export
performance and the risk of a large bank failure is avoided. Rebuilding
balance sheets is a long process which will take years not months.
Sorely needed
At least the Bank of Japan appears finally to have realised the gravity of
situation. The best way to ease the pressure on the banks is to keep cutting
interest rates. The Bank should do so at once. But the US experience
demonstrates the limited effect that monetary policy can have when private
sector confidence is depressed. Only a revival in spending and investment
will provide the fillip that is sorely needed to shore up the market. And
only the public sector has the means to do so.
Yet the Ministry of Finance remains unwilling to act on anything like the
scale and speed required. It provided no more than a cosmetic fiscal boost
last spring which, if anything, reduced market confidence. Once again,
despite government claims that an aggressive economy-boosting package of
public infrastructure spending is imminent, the ministry is prevaricating.
The much heralded supplementary budget will not arrive before October, if
the MoF prevails, and the stimulus is unlikely to exceed 1-2 per cent of
gross domestic product.
The government cannot afford to be seen to dither in this way. If market
nerves are to be soothed, a more substantial package of tax cuts and
spending increases is needed before the end of the summer. The further the
market falls, the larger the gap between the Ministry of Finance's
complacent optimism and hard reality will become.

FT  12 AUG 92 / A hiatus for the high-tech dream: The revolution promised by
IT may be running out of steam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The information technology revolution seems to be losing momentum, less than
two decades after bitter competition in microchip development in the 1970s
between US and Japanese electronics companies held out the promise of a new
economic era.
The developing technology was expected to usher in a period during which
information would succeed labour and capital as the dynamo of growth.
Today, electronics manufacturers, on whose products the revolution is based,
are reporting declining revenues and profits and are finding it difficult to
fund further developments. One-time competitors are being forced to form
alliances, to pool knowledge and resources in order to create the next
generation of high technology products.
Development costs have become so great that no single semiconductor company
is prepared to risk the investment.
ng on capital equipment and R&amp;D alone for a large semiconductor company such
as Intel of the US is nearly Dollars 2bn. The consequences are becoming
painfully obvious. Fujitsu of Japan, for example, one of the leading
companies in chip technology, warned last week that it would make its first
interim loss for more than a decade.
The plight of the chip makers is a watershed in the turbulent development of
the 'information technology' sector. The expression was coined to describe
collectively semiconductors, computing, consumer electronics and
telecommunications. These industries, through their potential to influence
every aspect of life, would drive the engines of the third industrial
revolution in succession to steam and electricity.
Since the beginning of the IT revolution, industry estimates have forecast
that by 2000, the IT sector would generate Dollars 2,000bn a year in sales.
Employment would be created through the formation and expansion of companies
in the sector and through its effect on other businesses which use IT. Jobs
created through the exploitation of IT would more than compensate for those
lost through automation, it was believed.
There has been little to challenge that optimistic scenario for more than 15
years. Growth in every sector of IT has been robust, sometimes explosive.
Microelectronics has been the key to progress. New industries and companies
have emerged as a result of the ready availability of low-cost, miniaturised
electronic components. The modern facsimile machine market, for example, has
grown in a few years to a value of Dollars 2bn a year in the US alone.
Over the past two years, however, the broad picture has deteriorated
rapidly. Many leading IT companies, among them the US computer manufacturers
International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, have fallen into
loss. The Japanese consumer electronics companies Sony and Matsushita are
reporting sharply reduced revenues and profits. Profits at Philips of the
Netherlands, Europe's biggest consumer electronics company, have fallen
sharply despite a radical restructuring of the group.
Overall growth in the semiconductor market this year will average less than
11 per cent; for computers, it will be about 5 per cent. For consumer
electronics, growth will be flat. In mature industries, these would be
unremarkable figures, but IT businesses have been used to growth of 20 per
cent a year or more.
The downturn has a chilling significance for high-technology industries. It
indicates that in each area, the market may not be growing quickly enough to
generate the cash needed to fund development of the next generation of
products. According to Mr Brian Attwell of the Gartner Group, a US-based IT
consultancy, unless the market grows by at least 15 per cent a year, it
becomes difficult for companies to afford the level of investment necessary
for successful innovation.
Why has the optimism which drove the industry in the 1970s and 1980s turned
sour? Can there be a return to the growth rates of earlier decades - which
would seem to be necessary if the industry is to make progress?
The answers are complex. The IT business is at the confluence of several
separate trends which are conspiring to slow growth, drive down prices and
reduce the attractiveness of IT products to customers.
These include the world recession and the falling cost of semiconductors and
computer hardware. Leading semiconductor manufacturers, for example, have
been unable to reap the benefits of heavy capital investment in the present
generation of memory chips because overcapacity has depressed prices. The
price of the industry workhorse, the 4MB fast-memory chip, has fallen by 55
per cent over the past 12 months to a mere Dollars 12.
There have also been moves to standard computer systems, which are
intrinsically less expensive than custom-designed equipment, and a general
disenchantment with electronic technology. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of
ICI, sums up the position: 'I still worry enormously both about the amount
we spend on IT and the increasing difficulty of justifying that expense in
terms of the bottom line.'
His comment explains why this recession is different from those of the past.
In previous recessions, companies continued to invest in IT, especially in
the US, in the belief that it would improve their efficiency and
competitiveness. This time, the simple efficiencies have already been
achieved and there is little faith that further investment will bring
improved performance.
A glance at companies in each of the major IT sectors reveals the
difficulties that they face. It also shows how some 'star performers' which
have focused on products with a high added value have managed to buck the
trend.
Semiconductors. While Japanese and Korean manufacturers - such as Fujitsu
and Samsung, which make the lion's share of the world's commodity memory
chips - face declining profits, Intel of the US produced record results in
1991, pushing both revenues and profits up 22 per cent. Intel is the world's
largest supplier of microprocessors, the chips at the heart of most personal
computers and telephone exchanges. It is profiting from its decision not to
license its most advanced microprocessor technology to other manufacturers.
Consumer electronics: the decline in growth at companies such as Sony,
Toshiba and Philips also reflects a lack of current products with high added
value. The industry is between product cycles; customers are weary of minor
improvements in old products such as hi-fi and television. It will, however,
be several years before the price of innovations touted to become successes
on the scale of Sony's Walkman fall sufficiently to attract mass audiences.
These include the digital compact cassette, the mini-disc, high-definition
television (which offers cinema-quality images) and interactive video.
Where a company can add value through innovation, however, it can buck the
downward trend. Sharp, for example, which has developed a relatively cheap
high-definition television, is almost alone among Japanese electronics
companies in not having had to revise downwards its profits forecast.
The computer industry is undergoing a transformation more profound than any
other IT sector. Computers, especially personal computers, are falling in
price by 20 per cent or more a year as microprocessors and memory chips
become cheaper and competition intensifies.
Manufacturers, distributors and dealers are being forced to accept narrower
gross profit margins to the point where there is concern that resources will
not be available to support existing products or develop new ones.
Typically, margins in the computer industry have averaged between 40 and 60
per cent. In the case of personal computers, however, margins are less than
20 per cent.
The problem has been intensified by a sudden slowdown in the market, which
is only partly the result of the recession. It also reflects a
dissatisfaction among customers with investments in IT.
In a forthcoming study, Mr Carl Dahlman and Mr Ashoka Mody of the World Bank
argue: 'The aggregate impact of IT on productivity performance has been
disappointing.' Dr Peter Weil, author of a study on the value of IT in
manufacturing, notes: 'What makes managers uneasy about IT is the lack of
evidence that previous investments have generated business value.'
Computer manufacturers are increasingly turning to computing services -
helping their customers get the best out of their investments - to counter
disenchantment with their products and to restore falling revenues. Services
such as facilities management - operating a customer's computer systems -
command higher gross profit margins than making computers.
Telecommunications is a relatively distinct member of the IT sector. It is
linked to the other electronics industries only by its prodigious use of
semiconductor technology. While the growth of the other members of the IT
group has been based on products, telecommunications has operated as a
service operated by monopolies under strict regulation.
The outlook for telecommunications is broadly encouraging. Growth will be
driven by continued deregulation and the removal of state monopolies. In the
competitive US market, the average person makes twice as many telephone
calls as in Europe, where the authorities are only now starting to
liberalise
What conclusions can be drawn from the hiatus in the IT industries? First,
the technologists have done a good job; the industry has moved from youth to
maturity in only a few years. The revolution has not been halted, but the
corporate structures of its leading players have found it difficult to
respond to the rate of change.
Second, there will be an increasing trend towards products and services that
provide high added value, and therefore respectable profit margins, rather
than the production of commodities such as memory chips and basic personal
computers.
There are already moves in this direction. Mr John Diebold, a US computer
consultant sometimes known as the 'father of automation', has been examining
new uses for IT in intelligent road systems, environmental monitoring and
health care.
The IT industry is like a train forced to slow unexpectedly; there is little
chance of it being derailed but passengers without a handhold have been
severely shaken. Without developments of the kind Mr Diebold is encouraging,
it may be difficult for it to pick up speed again when the way ahead is
clear.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Aspiring to an evening on the old green sofa -
Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE the child who asked 'Mummy, what is that man for?' one is occasionally
inclined to ask 'What is television for?', especially after three weeks
spent on an Umbrian hillside with BBC Radio's World Service as your sole
source of news and entertainment. (Incidentally, what possessed the
excellent World Service to add that ghastly jazzed-up version of the famous
Lillibullero signature tune to the conventional one?)
Perhaps those of us who earn a living from writing about television should
not admit this, but, to be honest, once you turn your back on the box you do
not miss it. Deprive me of print and I suffer withdrawal symptoms. Left
without a book I would probably behave as I did when I used to smoke: drive
any distance for fresh supplies. But take away the television and I do not
even notice its absence.
To return to London and the near hysteria concerning television is an odd
experience. We are, of course, in the silly season, but can there be any
justification for the hectares of newsprint devoted to the 'crisis' of the
latest BBC soap opera, Eldorado? Are there really people who regard this as
being, in news terms, on a par with events in Bosnia, Russia and Somalia?
Like every other soap opera ever launched, Eldorado has not reached the top
of the ratings in its opening weeks. It has had a particularly hard time
because, in the middle of the summer when ratings are always at their
lowest, the Olympic Games have been dominating the figures.
Yet you would have to be brave or foolish to bet folding money against the
ability of BBC1 Controller Jonathan Powell and series originator Verity
Lambert to pull it round within the next six months. No doubt there are
faults to be ironed out: as with so much drama on television (and radio)
these days, the dialogue is often difficult to hear, the male characters are
uniformly contemptible, and so far there may be too few familiar points of
reference to allow most viewers to identify.
But it could be argued that, far from the general quality being too low, it
is actually a bit too high. Offer soap opera at the lowest of low levels and
it is instantly recognisable and acceptable to dispiritingly large numbers
of people. Go for something rather better, even though set in the same
social milieu - Minder, say, another of Lambert's series - and it takes
longer to build a dedicated audience willing to put in the slightly greater
effort needed for the sake of slower, richer rewards in the end.
Gleeful detractors of Eldorado insist that soap must be set amid the working
classes or - given the middle class tendencies of the hugely successful
Australian soaps - amid tight-knit old fashioned families. But since you can
achieve high ratings with serial drama as disparate as Crossroads, Dynasty
and The Bill, such 'rules' look like nonsense and there is surely no reason
why Eldorado should not be the first smash hit sunny ex-pat Euro-soap.
Provided they are given the time, my money is still on Powell and Lambert.
So is this what television is for? Having never been able to get hooked on
any soap opera, hard as I have tried, my answer is no. In the first week of
my return television's purpose seemed to be the relaying of hours and hours
of Olympic coverage, something which I expected to enjoy greatly. However,
having missed the big build-up and the opening days it was difficult to feel
properly involved.
Desmond Lynam, seated somewhere in limbo, with intimations of hell in that
perpetually flickering flame on the studio wall (dreadfully distracting
during interviews) was professional enough. But if, on the first three
occasions that you switch on, you happen to see two lots of so-called
synchronised swimming and one lot of dancing horses you do begin to wonder
whether this is any longer a serious sporting occasion.
The closing ceremony suggested it is not. We had a mime company, a display
by mounted police, a Spanish ballet, big production numbers from Placido
Domingo, Victoria de Los Angeles, Jose Carreras and one of Andrew Lloyd
Webber's ex-wives, many fireworks, speeches from committee men, a fire-dance
with devils repeatedly described by David Coleman as 'traditional', and an
introduction to the peculiarly nasty mascot for the next games, presumably
to give commercial promoters as much help as possible.
Finally, with proceedings running half an hour late, the athletes began to
pour out of the stands and into the centre of the arena, whereupon an
amplified voice repeatedly demanded that they leave the stage. The
competitors were getting in the way of television's big event. It was all a
far cry from that unforgettable closing ceremony at the Commonwealth Games a
few years ago, when the athletes linked arms in a laughing, dancing parade
which ended the occasion on an inspiring note of sporting camaraderie.
A massively unwieldy mixture of commercial promotion and overblown spectacle
may indeed be what television is for nowadays. Had you switched on without
knowing the occasion, you might have guessed it to be a special edition of a
game show with royal guests, an international rock concert, or a charity
telethon. To look at, they are indistinguishable.
Yet it would be dishonest to pretend that, even in midsummer, there is
nothing worth watching. One of the things that television is really for,
surely, is the programme which you flick to in the vague hope that it may
hold your interest for a while only to find yourself utterly engrossed and
incapable of switching off.
It occurred on Friday with successive programmes: BBC2's Business Matters
which investigated Kenichi Ohmae's ideas about the global companies which we
are now beginning to see develop, and the third in ITV's Around Whicker's
World, an account of an amazing globe-circling package tour, costing Pounds
37,000 a head. Whicker, the total professional, not only conveyed the touchy
atmosphere of the whole business but induced helpless laughter with his
account of the film crew's disastrous midnight skinny-dipping. This was
entertainment of a high order.
It happened again on Saturday with BBC2's Video Diaries, a fascinating,
agonising account of 25-year-old Edel O'Brien's job as chaperone to a party
of Irish teenage ballet dancers, all girls, who were among the first
westerners to pay to attend a Russian ballet school. Their treatment, which
appears to have been cynical and disgraceful, will have done nothing for
Russia's market enterprise ambitions. However, the real interest of the
programme was in the meeting between Irish and Russians, whether at the
barre or in the food queues.
There was yet another example on Sunday in Channel 4's profile of Chad Varah
 -The Good Samaritan. It will win no prizes for revolutionary technique: we
saw Varah speaking to camera, heard from some of those who were inspired by
him to join in starting The Samaritans, and revisited some of the places
where he has worked; nothing complicated, nothing difficult. It was simply
the character of the man that made the programme, though it probably helps
to bring that out if you are as experienced as producer Michael Darlow.
So what is television for? To a large extent, it seems to be for filling in
the time which modern man has gained by no longer having to chop his
firewood, carry his water or tend his animals. All over the world,
apparently, peasant farmers aspire to the lifestyle of western industrial
nations. There seems little hope of persuading them they are better off on
the old green hillside than the old green sofa.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Management: Just like Mamma used to make - Haig Simonian
finds local fare reigns supreme when Italian businessmen eat out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Untouched by political corruption scandals, recession and Mafia murders, the
business lunch is alive and well in Italy.
In Milan, the country's business capital, companies may be tightening their
financial belts, yet corporate midday eating remains a tradition.
But unlike some of Italy's north European neighbours, the stress is as much
on 'lunch' as on 'business'.
The hard bargaining will have already taken place in the office or will be
reserved for a post-prandial contest. By contrast, lunch represents an
agreeable truce, a pleasant way of sizing up the opposition or having a good
gossip with colleagues outside HQ.
Although executives have grown more conscious of their waistlines than in
the pasta-guzzling past, quality remains paramount.
Italian businessmen are likely to be as concerned about the preparation of
their toadstool-sized portion of branzino (sea-bass) as they were with the
consistency of the gorgonzola sauce on their gnocci a decade ago.
Business diners are conservative, patronising a handful of places they know
well, rather than experimenting. Moreover, Milan's legendary work ethic
(which is true only by Italian standards) means people prefer to eat within
walking distance of the office rather than taking a cab. Gastronomic
expeditions tend to be left for the evening or weekends.
Likewise, meals tend to grow longer the further south one heads. Times are
another big national difference. While northern lunches will invariably
start around one - or half an hour later at a pinch - that is still early
for Rome, where most restaurants would barely be starting to fill up, with
the real rush after two.
Times for dinner differ accordingly. But one factor is constant irrespective
of location. In a country where inebriation is definitely brutta figura (bad
form), alcohol consumption, especially at midday, is moderate. Familiarity
with a restaurant means diners often forego the menu and look to the head
waiter, always addressed informally, for guidance instead. Though usually
genuine, the technique is sometimes just a sham to impress the unknowing.
The gradual shift towards 'healthier' eating has put a premium on fish.
Surprisingly, Milan, although about as far as any Italian can get from the
sea without crossing into Switzerland, is one of the best places to eat it.
The city's fabled fish market is a clearing house for the country's catches,
meaning that the chances of finding fresh fish are as high - if not higher -
than in many coastal resorts.
However, even the most diet-conscious executives are grasping that eating
fish, invariably dearer than meat, has its price. Italy is no longer the
bargain basement of many first-time visitors' dreams, and Milan is easily
its most costly city. So the bill for a small, albeit tasty, filet of a
pricey catch like sea-bass can be upsetting. And when served by weight, as
is often the case, the bill can be shockingly high. Emerging from one of the
city's big-name restaurants like Savini, Don Lisander or Alfio for less than
L100,000 (Pounds 46.79) a head is a considerable achievement.
In spite of healthier eating, some factors remain constant. First, you can
safely assume that any corporate meal will be Italian. The number of foreign
restaurants in Milan especially has crept up of late. Some, like Suntory,
Rasa Sayang or Royal Dynasty, are sufficiently up-market to tempt the
business luncher. Yet if the diners - or at least the hosts - are Italians,
you can bet your next pay rise that local fare is what you'll get.
The stress on things domestic stretches to wine. It is hard to find a
restaurant, even top-notch, offering anything but home growths. A few of the
most upmarket places may stretch to some French vintages, but thirsty
Spaniards or Germans hankering for a familiar tipple will be disappointed.
Some Italians complain that the rise of city centre expense-account dining
has been the bane of thousands of sleepy, traditional trattorias, turning
them into the cool, antiseptic eateries that now dominate corporate dining
in much of northern Italy, notably Milan. For once a respectable trattoria
has started making big money, out goes the old wood-panelling and in come
the ubiquitous grey or white tiles, forecourt halogen lighting and pine
furniture.
Although uninviting, that ambience is a magnet for many well-travelled
younger executives, or older colleagues who want to promote a more
cosmopolitan image. Peck in Milan, with one Michelin rosette, typifies the
look.
But regional allegiances are still sufficiently strong for many businessmen
to opt for tradition and choose a restaurant specialising in dishes from
their local area. Milanese wanting to strike a balance between good food and
a solid, but not stuffy, atmosphere often go to Boeucc, a big, efficient but
attractive restaurant that is expensive enough to impress without being
outrageous.
Seasonal variations are also much more noticeable in Italy than most
European countries. Choosing a heavy stew, or kidneys, traditionally served
with polenta - a leaden maize-based potato substitute - would be a gaffe in
a stiffling Milanese summer. Likewise, ordering a strong red Barolo in
mid-July is not recommended, even in Turin, the capital of Piedmont where it
is grown.
Choosing local dishes is a sure way to impress one's host, but newcomers
needn't exaggerate.

FT  12 AUG 92 / July truck sales show 6.7% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUCK SALES in July were 6.7 per cent higher than in the same month a year
ago, the first monthly year-on-year increase in 34 months.
Commercial vehicle sales fell by 21 per cent, however, after only a brief
respite in June when the sector succeeded in reversing 32 consecutive months
of decline.
According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, new commercial
vehicle registrations fell to 7,887 in July from 9,964 a year before,
largely because of a 36 per cent fall in medium vans.
Registrations of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - fell 9.8 per
cent to 2,760.
Commercial vehicle sales were 9.6 per cent lower in the first seven months
at 122,161. Sales have fallen 47.5 per cent in the past three years.
Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) were 1,473 in July compared with 1,380 a year
before. Truck sales in the first seven months of the year, at 16,536, were
still 8.8 per cent lower than a year earlier. Sales have fallen 59.5 per
cent in the past three years.
Sales of heavy trucks have declined less this year than other market
segments with a fall of only 2.8 per cent.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Bowater told to sell offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, acted yesterday to
prevent concentration of power in the medical bags and pouches market.
He has asked the Bowater packaging group to dispose of one of its two
businesses in the sector, under threat of a referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Bowater built up a dominant position in the market after
acquiring DRG Packaging in March.
Mr David Jones, Bowater's finance director, accepted that its two businesses
had a combined share of 51 per cent of an Pounds 11m market. He added that
Bowater had not anticipated competition problems.
Bowater can sell either its Welton bags and pouches business, which has
annual sales of about Pounds 2m, or the medical bags subsidiary of the DRG
group, with a turnover of Pounds 4m. 'Either way, we will still have a
significant share of the market,' Mr Jones said.
The company's shares fell on the news but recovered to close 5p lower at
734p on the day after Bowater disclosed that the action affected a business
that accounted for less than 2 per cent of DRG's turnover.

LABOUR yesterday called for the government to clarify its policy on
unemployment benefit in the wake of newspaper reports that it plans to halve
the period for which benefit will be paid to six months, David Owen writes.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said such a move would
amount to 'a cynical cost-saving exercise'. The government 'should not try
to get themselves out of the economic mess they have created by attacking
the incomes of the unemployed'.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Cadbury proposals too vague, accountants say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CODE on corporate governance proposed by the Cadbury committee is too
vague to be effective, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants
said yesterday.
The association, which represents 38,000 accountants, said in its response
to the proposals that annual reports should give a statement of principles,
setting out goals and how effectively they have been met.
It said the objectives set by Cadbury required far more clearly defined
responsibilities and methods of compliance by bodies including the Stock
Exchange and the Financial Reporting Council.
The association called for more weight to be given to internal audit and
control systems and for less reliance on non-executive directors. It said
the guidelines should be extended to smaller companies.
Separately, Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, issued a submission
arguing that the Cadbury committee should be more forthright on the
supervisory role taken by company boards.
It said responsibilities should be allocated to specific non-executive
directors, and consideration given to creating 'two-tier' boards in which
non-executives would act as guardians of shareholders' interests,
scrutinising the work of executive directors.
It also called for interim and annual financial statements to be published
more quickly - perhaps three months after the period in question.
The committee, which issued its draft proposals in May, is to produce a
final report in November.

FT  12 AUG 92 / An anxious dawn for Glorious Twelfth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPORTSMEN and landowners will be anxiously scanning the skies over Scotland
and northern England early today as the Glorious Twelfth brings the opening
of the grouse shooting season. Shooters are always anxious because the fast
jinking birds are extremely hard to hit. Their hosts are worried because
commercial prospects this year are mixed.
In some parts of Scotland the Twelfth may be marred by a shortage of young
grouse, the result of a poor breeding season. On the moors of Yorkshire and
Northumberland, grouse are more abundant, but in places the stock has been
ravaged by strongylosis, a perennial grouse disease.
Yet in spite of recession and the wounds inflicted on some members of the
upper-middle classes by losses at Lloyd's of London, the insurance market,
demand for grouse shooting has held up reasonably well, according to Mr
Peter Hudson of Game Conservancy, the advisory body. While some Britons may
not be shooting, the French, Italians and Germans are coming back in force,
as are US shooters who booked before the dollar collapsed.
The cost to a shooter of driven grouse shooting works out at between Pounds
60 and Pounds 80 a brace (pair), so a group of eight guns may pay Pounds
7,000 for a 100-brace day.
Yet according to Mr Malcolm Borthwick (pictured above, with gun) who
operates a grouse moor at Raeshaw, south of Edinburgh, 'the viability of the
operation is as fragile as ever'.
In the cruel economics of grouse shooting, game dealers, who may today offer
Pounds 20 for a brace of shot grouse, may be paying only Pounds 4 when the
season is in full swing. As always the Savoy Hotel in London will be
offering grouse shot at dawn for lunch today, charging between Pounds 9.50
and Pounds 10 a bird.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Four new telecoms licences confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday confirmed details of its plans to award
telecommunications licences to four companies in order to increase
competition for British Telecom and Mercury.
The licences, which are subject to approval by parliament, are the first to
be awarded since the government's duopoly review of the industry in 1990,
which opened the sector to further competition. The Department of Trade and
Industry said it was studying applications from a further 22 groups.
The companies that are to receive a public telecommunications operator's
licence are Ionica, a Cambridge-based private enterprise, Millicom, a US
telecommunications company, National Network, based in Buckinghamshire, and
WorldCom, a Swiss-owned company operating in the UK.
The four will be able to build fixed networks throughout the UK and provide
local, trunk and international services.
Two of the four plan to use radio links and the DTI has allowed Millicom the
use of space in a radio band for that purpose.
Millicom plans to offer voice, data and videophone services on its
radio-based network, which it hopes to start in 1994 and build into a
national network by the end of the decade. Millicom said it would be able to
handle the launch on its own but would look for partners for the national
build-up.
The company said its technology would enable it to offer voice
communications 'at a substantial discount' to BT's rates.
Ionica, which is also using a radio-based system, plans to make its network
available to half the population when it launches its service in 1994. The
company, which is funded by a group of private investors, expects to invest
'hundreds of millions of pounds'.
National Network, which uses the Post Office's private network, intends to
invest about Pounds 150m in the next few years to build its own fibre-optic
system, although it is talking to several groups about possible equity
participation.
The companies' ability to compete with BT and Mercury may depend on how much
they are able to invest in networks over the coming years. Mr Paul Norris,
industry analyst at the securities company BZW, said: 'Mercury has invested
Pounds 1.5bn to gain 7.5 per cent of the UK telecoms market.'
The government also announced yesterday that it was issuing licences to 13
private mobile radio operators and to Hutchison Paging to provide fixed
services in addition to the mobile services it is currently licensed to
offer.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Telephone charges set to fall as BT agrees toOftel plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELEPHONE charges are set to fall after BT yesterday accepted a stricter
pricing regime.
BT agreed to implement proposals by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator,
by keeping price changes on a range of services to 7.5 percentage points
below the rate of inflation.
At present, price changes have to be kept to 6.25 per cent below inflation -
as measured by the retail prices index.
The new pricing regime, which will last for four years starting next August,
means that BT's 19m residential and 6.5m business customers can expect real
cuts in charges while inflation, currently about 4 per cent, stays below 7.5
per cent.
One immediate benefit for consumers is that connection charges are set to
come down by 40 per cent from Pounds 163.75 to Pounds 99.
The agreement between BT and Oftel follows two months of heated negotiations
during which relations between the two became increasingly strained.
The City welcomed the decision by BT, whose shares closed up 1p at 333p. The
agreement will lead to lower revenues, but the threat of being referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was removed.
According to Mr Peter Golob at SG Warburg Securities, this was 'a far
greater threat than anything else'.
While BT decided to accept all Oftel's main proposals, it said it had
seriously considered rejecting them - a move which would have triggered a
reference to the commission. This option was ruled out due to the
uncertainty for the business and demands on senior management time.
BT's decision contrasts with that of British Gas, which recently chose to go
to the commission rather than agree to stricter price controls proposed by
its regulator.
However, BT criticised Oftel's tough stance, saying that its proposals
represented 'a significant change in direction towards more interventionist
regulation, which could impede the development of the truly competitive and
open marketplace that everyone is aiming for'.
The deal, which comes at a time when BT's profit growth is expected to come
largely from cost cutting rather than additional revenue, puts more pressure
on the group to reduce costs. It has already announced plans to cut 35,000
jobs this year, and a further 15,000 each year over the next two to three
years.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Central banks step in to halt dollar's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED intervention by the world's leading central banks yesterday halted
the dollar's decline but failed to give the US currency much of a lift.
As many as 15 central banks bought dollars for D-Marks in what appeared to
be a determined effort to establish a floor for the US currency.
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policymaking central
council, said in Frankfurt that the buying was initiated by the US Federal
Reserve. The intervention began as the dollar was falling towards DM1.461 in
quiet lunchtime trading in Europe and continued during the afternoon.
Analysts thought the central banks, which included the Bundesbank, the Bank
of England and the central banks of France, Switzerland, Italy, Canada and
Spain, bought more than Dollars 500m altogether. The intervention, however,
was less effective than the most recent bout of concerted official support
on July 20 when a similar number of central banks bought Dollars 400m at
about DM1.447.
Yesterday's action pushed the dollar up quickly by about 1 1/2 pfennigs, but
it later slipped back to stand at DM1.4670 in late New York trading, while
in Tokyo early today it opened at DM1.46575. July's intervention lifted the
dollar by 5 pfennigs.
A US Treasury Department official said the action was a sign that the US and
other members of the Group of Seven industrial countries did not wish the
dollar to depreciate. But statements by other policymakers gave less support
to the US currency.
The dollar softened after Mr Gaddum said there was no firm dollar exchange
rate that the Bundesbank would commit itself to defend through intervention.
Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, was quoted by news agencies as
telling a political gathering at Scottsdale, Arizona, that the US did not
have a policy to cheapen the dollar. But any support provided by this remark
was offset by Mr Brady's later statement that there was 'no reason why (US)
interest rates shouldn't be lower'.
Analysts speculated that the Fed intervened to prop up the dollar for fear
it could start a free fall if it dropped through its previous record low of
DM1.443, set in February 1991. There are few signs of inflationary pressure
in the US but such a decline could harbour risks for the future.
Of more pressing concern could be the fragile state of world equity markets.
In the past week, Wall Street has fallen, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei
average has dropped to levels last seen in early 1986. Yesterday, it closed
at 14,822,56, down 243.78. This morning share prices edged higher, with the
Nikkei up some 50 points in initial trading.
The intervention boosted European equities. German shares rose in
after-market dealings, while in London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at
2,309.6, down 16.1, but well up on the day's low. In New York the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was down 6.48 at 3,331.10.

FT  12 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 2,300 mark under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS underwent a further trial of confidence in the UK stock market
yesterday when the Skipton Building Society raised its mortgage lending
rates by half a percentage point, triggering fears that other home loan
groups might follow suit. The stock market, led by the futures sector,
plunged through the FT-SE 2,300 level at mid-morning but rallied later when
US dollar support operations by the central banks helped some overseas
earning stocks.
Yesterday's session demonstrated, once again, the powerful influence of the
troubled UK housing sector on the stock market. Equities opened firmer,
taking more notice of overnight improvement in New York than of the Nikkei's
fall below the 15,000 level. But, rumours that one or more UK building
societies planned to increase lending rates - the Skipton Building Society's
move was not confirmed until mid-morning - surfaced early in the stock index
futures market.
The September contract on the Footsie opened sharply lower and the stock
market almost instantly reversed its early gain to show a loss. The loss was
rapidly extended and the FT-SE Index was 30 points off before 11.00am, the
timing of its low point coinciding almost exactly with that of the stock
index future.
The market did little more than steady on good trading results from General
Accident and a satisfactory, if unexciting, set of domestic producer price
figures for last month.
The rally made little progress until the second half of the session when the
round of official support for the US dollar brought a spin-off improvement
in sterling. The fall in the stock market was trimmed to around 10 points on
the Footsie scale and trading volume increased as at least two London
securities houses operated trading programmes; both were weighted towards
the sell side and blocks of several Footsie stocks were sold at a discount
to prevailing market quotations.
The impetus was lost again when Wall Street opened with a fall of 18 Dow
points in UK hours. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,309.6 for a
loss on the day of 16.1 points. Analysts expressed little confidence in the
regaining of the Footsie 2,300 mark and continued to point warningly towards
2,150 as the nearest support level if the rout in share prices continues.
Seaq volume, slow at first, jumped to 563.9m shares at the close, compared
with only 331m on Monday when retail, or customer, volume was worth a mere
Pounds 698.9m.
The final picture was perhaps less pessimistic than the fall in the index
might suggest. Oil shares continued to rally, despite further gloomy
comments on British Petroleum from brokerage houses, and insurance stocks
brightened after General Accident's interim results. But Wellcome sagged as
the syndicate involved in the recent share sale cut its support price to
780p.
Also dragging down the Footsie index was ICI, still weakened by adverse
comments on the demerger proposals currently under boardroom consideration.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVE markets were volatile yesterday as they reacted to the Skipton
building society's decision to raise its mortgage rates and, later, to a
firm set of producer price figures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,330, but the talk, later
confirmed, that the Skipton was about to raise rates quickly sent the
contract into retreat, pulling the underlying cash market lower. By 10.45am
September was just hovering above the 2,300 level.
The release of producer price figures for July, in line with market
expectations, helped steady nerves and in the afternoon bargain hunters
moved in to lift the contract off the bottom. By 3pm the contract had clawed
back earlier falls to trade at 2,335, the high point of the session before a
weak Wall Street once again led to nervous selling.
September closed at 2,317, down 12 on the previous session and around 3
points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover
of 13,168 was greatly improved on recent levels.
Traded options were also busy, with the FT-SE index option particularly
active. Total turnover reached 32,118 and the FT-SE option accounted for
19,709 of that total.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo extends slide and
closes below 15,000

Tokyo
THE Nikkei average extended its slide to a fourth consecutive day, closing
below the 15,000 level for the first time since March 1986, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index fell 243.78 to 14,822.56, a four-day loss of 7.3 per cent. It rose
to the day's high of 15,172.72 in the morning but hit a low of 14,777.90
just before the close as small-lot selling by individuals and futures-linked
trading depressed sentiment.
Volume declined to 190m shares from 201m. Declines led advances by 788 to
96, with 108 unchanged, and a total of 548 issues fell to new lows for the
year. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 21.76 to 1,126.80
while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.68 to 933.46.
Fears over bankruptcies among companies with high exposure to the stock and
real estate markets resurfaced and prompted short-selling.
The plunge in share prices, however, raised hopes of further monetary
easing, causing a rally on the government bond market. The yield on the No
129 10-year benchmark bond fell 0.036 percentage points to 4.985 per cent,
and short-term money market rates also eased on anticipation of lower
interest rates.
Comments by government officials that measures to prop up share prices may
be brought forward have had little effect on sentiment. Furthermore,
proposals to buy land placed as collateral at the banks, or to invest postal
savings funds in the stock market have not provided fresh trading
incentives.
'The longer the government takes to implement economic measures such as the
supplementary budget, the slimmer the effects will be,' said Mr Robert
Feldman at Salomon Brothers.
Speculators continued to liquidate issues bought on margin. Okamoto
Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y42 to Y825, and Meiji
Milk Products lost Y31 to Y729.
Companies famous for their stock market investments in the late eighties
plunged. Hanwa, the steel trader, fell Y142 to Y928 and Hazama, the
construction company, fell Y35 to Y290. Nippon Credit Bank, which faces
mounting bad property-related loans, declined by its daily limit of Y500 to
Y3,600.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y2,000 to Y465,000. The share has fallen
19.3 per cent over the past four trading days. In Osaka, the OSE average
fell 317.75 to 16,014.06 with 11.4m shares traded.
Roundup
TOKYO's decline again affected sentiment and most of the region's markets
were dragged lower.
HONG KONG saw moderate gains, influenced by the futures market trading. The
Hang Seng Index advanced 18.81 to 5,886.75 in turnover of HKDollars 1.83bn.
Hutchison Whampoa was the most actively traded share after its share
placement on Monday but it closed unchanged at HKDollars 15.50. Cheung Kong
rose 20 cents to HKDollars 23.80.
SEOUL fell but reports that the government may announce the award of the
country's second telecom contract next week helped bidding companies.
Sunkyong and Yukong, which have bid for the contract, both rose Won1,000 to
Won21,500 and Won23,500 respectively.
The composite stock index shed 5.43 to 502.45 in turnover of Won102bn.
TAIWAN finished mixed as most investors remained on the sidelines. The
weighted index closed up 6.55 at 3,958.28 in low turnover of TDollars
17.6bn.
Cement, food and plastic shares fell slightly but other sectors were up.
MANILA was largely unmoved by the resignation of one of President Fidel
Ramos's close aides. The composite index lost 0.02 to 1,445.67 in combined
turnover of 205m pesos.
SINGAPORE lost 2.2 per cent as foreign investors sold bank stocks and blue
chips. The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 31.68 at 1,392.91 in
turnover of SDollars 94.2m.
Development Bank of Singapore foreign shares ended 90 cents lower at
SDollars 12.00 with some 401,000 shares traded. Oversea-Chinese Banking
foreign shed 90 cents to SDollars 11.80 in volume of 757,000 shares.
KUALA LUMPUR was pulled higher by Telekom which gained 30 cents to MDollars
14.10. The composite index closed 2.64 higher at 597.80.
Resorts World fell 40 cents to MDollars 6.60 after reporting flat half-year
earnings.
AUSTRALIA fell as the local currency weakened against the US dollar. The All
Ordinaries closed down 4.6 at 1,587.6 in turnover of ADollars 144.4m.
Alcan closed up 1 cent at ADollars 1.72 after reporting a
better-than-expected interim loss of ADollars 6.5m.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE 40 index closed 8.52 lower at 1,514.68.
BOMBAY rose strongly in spite of a bout of late profit-taking. The BSE index
closed up 24.44 at 2,693.42.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Pakistani shares lose the lustre of
1991 - Farhan Bokhari profiles the bottom performer among emerging markets
last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP WITH the Latin American leaders last year, Pakistan hit trouble in July
and slipped 15.8 per cent in dollar terms, the worst decline in the emerging
markets list from the IFC, part of the World Bank.
There has been a recovery this week and last but the Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) index is still 181.75 below the 1,520.90 registered on July 1, when
the new financial year began, and 375.42, or 22 per cent below its 1992 high
of 1,714.57 on January 7.
Political uncertainty loomed recently after a split within Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's ruling alliance, the IDA (Islamic Democratic Alliance). A
Karachi-based regional ethnic party, the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement) broke
ranks with Mr Sharif, after an army-backed crackdown against its members,
allegedly for running torture cells to victimise opponents.
That immediately raised fears of economic and commercial repercussions.
Karachi, the country's most important port and centre of banking and
corporate activity, is largely controlled by the MQM. A rift with the ruling
alliance has raised the possibility of MQM-backed street agitation or other
forms of disturbances which would disrupt life in the city.
'For now, the presence of army troops in the city has helped to restore some
confidence, but that may last only until the army is called back to its
barracks,' says one leading businessman.
However, there are other reasons for the fall in equities this year. Last
December, an Islamic court handed down a ruling which required all banks to
eliminate pre-determined interest or usury, known as 'Riba', by the end of
June this year, because the practice is considered unlawful under Islamic
codes. The government has now appealed the ruling to Pakistan's supreme
court.
During the first six months of this year, sentiment was dulled by concerns
that the judgment, if enforced, would have implications for the country's
financial sector. Now, many investors are watching to see the outcome of the
supreme court's decision.
In addition, many investors are nervous over the worldwide decline in the
cotton price. This means a lower profitability in the textile sector, and
approximately one-third of KSE's 606 listed companies are textiles related.
Despite recent trends, the KSE's President, Mr Arif Habib, continues to be
optimistic, pointing to a rise in market turnover from last year's average
of some 2.4m shares a day to 2.8m this year, and continued corporate
interest in floating new shares on to the market. Since January last year,
he says, 150 new companies have been registered on the KSE.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: South African equities fall as De Beers
loses 6 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DE BEERS's warning of a substantial cut in its final dividends saw over
R3.2bn wiped off the market capitalisation of the diamond giant and its
associated companies, Anglos, Anamint and JCI.
De Beers, which reported its half-year results at midday, dropped R4.50, or
6.2 per cent to R68.50 in active trade after a R2 fall on Monday, while
Anglos fell R3 to R109.75 and Anamint, which has an effective 25 per cent
share of De Beers linked units, fell R6 or 7.2 per cent to R77. JCI lost R1
to R57.
For the Johannesburg market, this helped outweigh a relatively flat
performance in industrials, only 9 lower at 4,158, and the overall index
dropped 37 to 3,309. The gold index, depressed by the weak bullion price,
was off 10 at 994.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar support credited for
intraday recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTED support for the dollar was one reason why bourses recorded an
intraday recovery yesterday, but not all dealers were convinced by this
argument, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed at new 1992 lows but well above its worst, the DAX index
ending 17.95, or 1.1 per cent lower after a drop of 14.02, or 2.2 per cent
to 614.07 in the FAZ at midsession.
Turnover rose from DM4.2bn to DM6.1bn. Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in
Frankfurt attributed the turnround to a little foreign buying as the DAX
approached its support level of 1,550 - its intraday low was 1,551.39 - and
some subsequent short covering.
The market gave its worst treatment to retailers and construction groups
which, until recently, still seemed to have stories to tell in higher
consumption prospects, and the rebuilding of east Germany.
Yesterday Karstadt and Bilfinger &amp; Berger, both high quality stocks, led
their sectors down with falls of DM18 to DM579.50, and DM33 to DM837. Both
are now approaching their lows for the year.
PARIS fell for the fourth consecutive day as the CAC 40 index gave up 17.42
to 1,737.80 in turnover of some FFr1.38bn. Alcatel Alsthom was the most
active stock and fell in line with the market to close down FFr8 at FFr622.
The computer services group, Cap Gemini, was affected by a revision of an
analyst's 1992 EPS forecast, falling FFr14.30 or 6.8 per cent to FFr194.00.
Moulinex was also hit by a downgrade and closed FFr4 lower at FFr120.
A 5 per cent rise in first half turnover at Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez helped
it close unchanged at FFr493.30. However, a 20 per cent increase in turnover
did not help the insurer, UAP, down FFr11.20 at FFr388.50.
MILAN reported very thin trade as the Comit index fell 5.27 to 401.49. Fiat
closed 1.6 per cent lower at L4,310 and fell to L4,225 after hours.
On the screen market, the telecoms company Sip was the most heavily traded
stock, and closed unchanged at L1,145. At the other end of the spectrum, Mr
Carlo De Benedetti's industrial holding company, Cir, fell L83 to L1,250
ZURICH extended its showing of relative strength, the SMI index posting a
rise of 0.3 to 1,800.3. Interest focused on selected chemicals in low
overall volume, Roche certificates topping the active list as they rose
SFr50 to SFr3,430.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by a batch of gloomy results which dissipated any
relief in satisfactory half year figures from Polygram. The music and film
group was one of the few stocks to buck the trend, closing up Fl 1.00 at Fl
45.50 while the CBS Tendency index closed down 1.0 at 113.0.
Hoogovens fell 60 cents to Fl 38.30 on disappointing results while KLM lost
50 cents to Fl 30.10 on losses at Northwest Airlines; DAF continued to
weaken, down Fl 1.20 at Fl 17.50. Fokker eased Fl 1.10 to Fl 22.60,
reporting worse-than-expected interim profits after the close.
BRUSSELS suffered from a further setback in Petrofina which closed down
BFr320, or 3.1 per cent at BFr9,930. Some analysts said that the oil group
remains depressed after last week's disappointing first half results. The
Bel-20 index lost 10.66 to 1,114.76.
MADRID's general index fell 4.29 to 209.57 in low turnover of Pta7bn. Banks
were weak with Santander losing Pta110 to Pta3,340.
VIENNA reacted to declines elsewhere on the continent and fell to another
all time low. The ATX index closed down 16.28 at 683.45.
ISTANBUL rose on pleasing first half results. The 75-share index advanced
72.73 or 1.85 per cent to 4,012.51.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed leads massive intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL RESERVE led a massive round of central bank intervention to prop
up the dollar yesterday, but first indications were that the operation had
not been as successful as the one held on July 20, writes James Blitz.
The Fed intervened in the market at around 1.15 pm London time, buying the
US currency as the dollar/D-Mark rate fell to around DM1.4610. In its third
intervention in the foreign exchange market in three weeks, it bought
dollars at DM1.4715 and later at DM1.4770. Fifteen central banks joined the
Fed in the operation, in three concerted waves of intervention.
The intervention, which lasted over three hours, was more extensive than the
one held on July 20, and more than Dollars 500m was spent by all the central
banks. However, in late US trading, the dollar was still hovering at around
DM1.4675 after peaking at DM1.4791.
The Fed and the European central banks would have wanted to keep the dollar
above a floor of around DM1.4700 for several reasons. The US authorities
might have been concerned yesterday that the new Treasury refunding issue of
Dollars 15bn of 3 year notes went ahead smoothly yesterday, with investors
confident that the dollar has the long-term potential to rise. European
central banks are concerned that a weak dollar/D-Mark rate will exacerbate
tensions in the European Monetary system. And the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries will want to show that they can control the
dollar/D-Mark rate, avoiding a free-fall that would damage already brittle
stockmarkets.
But dealers said that yesterday's operation was hampered by bad timing. The
central banks did not surprise the market as completely as they did on July
20. Dealers had already anticipated that the Fed could intervene at around
DM1.4600, and most dealers' books were already square.
Fundamental factors also make it difficult for the dollar to break out of
its current ranges. There is still a fear that the huge 6.75 per cent
differential between US and German interest rates will widen further, and
comments yesterday from a senior US official that US interest rates could go
even lower worsened sentiment.
The immediate outlook for the dollar depends on today's Bundesbank
intervention in the German money markets. Yesterday, German call money was
virtually unchanged at 9.70-75 per cent, narrowly below the Lombard rate. If
the Bundesbank adds liquidity to the market, reducing the rate for call
money, the dollar could rally on easier monetary conditions in Germany. If
the Bundesbank keeps conditions tight, the market will anticipate further
intervention to stop the dollar going into free-fall.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investors cut gold holdings,
says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN AND North American investors cut their gold bullion holdings by
nearly 300 tonnes in the first half of this year, according to the Metals &amp;
Minerals Research Services consultancy group.
That is equivalent to six months output from South Africa, the world's
biggest producer, it points out.
The 'ease with which metal has so far been tempted away from these
investors' at a time of low and flat gold prices is one important reason
that prices have not been rising in spite of a substantial fall in supply
and continued record demand, says MMRS in its latest World Bullion Market
report.
Looking ahead, it suggests that, while low interest rates and higher gold
prices in recent weeks may be restraining further gold disinvestment in
North America, 'the opportunity cost of holding gold in Europe remains
significant.'
Although gold's price went up in dollar terms in July its price in most
European currencies was virtually unchanged because of a weakening dollar.
So 'major disinvestment from Europe could well continue through the
foreseeable future'.
MMRS also suggests that much of the growth in demand for gold in recent
years has been in high carat, low added-value jewellery and bars in the
developing Asian economies. The consultancy group believes that any
substantial price increase would result in a concurrent drop in demand from
this area of consumption, causing prices to ease again.
The report estimates that western world gold production remained stable in
the first half of this year and that supplies from the former eastern bloc
countries dropped by half to only 135 tonnes. Taking other components into
account, MMRS suggests that total gold supply in the western countries is
likely to fall by 7 per cent during the whole of 1992 to 2,470 tonnes.
Meanwhile, demand has remained high and 'assuming no further large sales by
central banks' the market should be in deficit for the foreseeable future.
Nevertheless, MMRS concludes that 'while the bear market might have ended,
it is far too early to suggest that recent dollar price gains are the start
of gold's long awaited revival'. It believes the gold price will move
sideways for a while, 'laying the foundations for a slow recovery towards
the mid-1990s'.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: More US futures approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator,
has approved three new contracts that will serve to heighten competition
among US futures markets. They include platinum and palladium futures for
the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex), although contracts for the two
metals already trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).
The commission has also approved the application of the Chicago Board of
Trade to trade a new international physical commodity index designed with
the Commodity Research Bureau. The CBoT's move to trade a such a contract is
aimed at competing with the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which started
trading last month at the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Comex said that it expected to launch the new platinum and palladium futures
as early as next month.
Mr Alan Hanson, Comex spokesman, said the exchange was consulting yesterday
with the Platinum and Palladium Advisory Group on the exact times for the
start of trading.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada's high-cost coal mines
feel the pinch - Bernard Simon describes desperate efforts to improve
efficiency and competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER another, western Canada's coal mines are confronting the painful
reality that high-cost producers usually suffer the heaviest casualties in
an over-supplied market.
Financial restructuring, labour confrontation, pleas for lower taxes and
protracted negotiations with suppliers are the order of the day in British
Columbia, as the coal producers seek to improve their competitiveness by
bringing down costs.
'There's a future only for a mine operating at absolute maximum efficiency,'
says Mr Jim Gardiner, president of Fording Coal, whose mine in south-east
British Colombia has been shut by a strike since early May. Fording, which
was hoping to ship 6.3m tonnes of coking coal this year, has demanded that
its workers accept management's right to do business with non-union
contractors.
Westar Mining's Balmer mine, which is among Canada's biggest coal exporters,
has also been closed by a labour dispute for the past three months. Another
property, Line Creek, changed hands earlier this year, and the future of
several other mines is uncertain.
The province's seven major coal producers suffered their biggest losses ever
last year, with a combined shortfall from operations of CDollars 62m (Pounds
27m) and write-offs totalling another CDollars 160m.
The adjustment process has progressed furthest at the Quintette mine in the
north-east corner of the province. Quintette, which was a showpiece of
Canadian resources policy when it opened eight years ago, was pushed to the
brink of bankruptcy in the late 1980s by high costs, a heavy debt burden and
the unremitting squeeze on prices.
But a financial restructuring (which left a group of banks as sizeable
minority shareholders) enabled the mine to emerge from court protection
earlier this year. With the help of a change in management, Quintette has so
far succeeded in bringing down its costs by even more than its owners
expected. The labour force has shrunk by 20 per cent in the past 12 months.
While strike-bound Balmer and Fording have declared force majeure on their
export contracts, Quintette is now shipping coal at a record pace to
Japanese steel mills. The mine is currently exporting over 400,000 tonnes a
month, and its stocks will have dwindled to 8,000 tonnes by the end of
August.
Quintette has now been overtaken by Westar as the industry's most critically
ill patient. The Vancouver-based company, with debts of about CDollars 400m,
applied for court protection from its creditors in early June.
Mr Peter Dolazel, Westar's president, says the company has enough cash to
last till the end of September, and has put together a restructuring plan
which, in his words, 'we believe is workable'. Westar's smaller Greenhills
mine is understood to be still operating normally and profitably.
Besides debt relief, Westar needs at least CDollars 75m for a new pit at
Balmer. The mine's existing seam has only seven or eight years of reserves,
and costs are high. The difficult mining conditions pushed Balmer's output
down to 5.4m tonnes last year, from 5.6m tonnes in 1990.
A financial restructuring is necessary for Balmer but would not be
sufficient to save the mine.
The leaders of the United Mine Workers local branch have a reputation for
being among the most intransigent trade unionists in the North American
mining industry. They rejected the recommendation by a government-appointed
panel last month that the management's latest package should be put to a
secret, union-supervised vote among their 1,300 members.
According to Mr Dolazel, several hundred workers have signed a petition in
recent days demanding a vote.
Westar's most immediate problem however, is to hang on to its board. Seven
of its nine directors, including the chairman, have quit over concerns that
they might be held personally liable in law for severance payments to
workers while Westar is under bankruptcy protection.
A British Columbian Supreme Court judge last week refused Westar's
application to provide security for the liability of the three remaining
directors. The three are now considering whether, as a last resort, they
should put the company into liquidation.
The British Columbian coal producers' troubles are being exacerbated by the
political and economic environment. A labour-backed government, which took
office in British Columbia last September, has expressed sympathy for the
industry. But in the words of one senior mining executive, it 'talks both
ways at the same time' by intervening with a never-ending series of review
panels, mediators and commissions.
On the commercial front, the producers have received a boost this year from
a weaker Canadian dollar. But they still face a market that has been
over-supplied for almost a decade, and where no respite is in sight as
steelmakers try to cut their use of the high-quality metallurgical coal
produced in British Columbia.
Mr Richard Marshall, a Calgary coal consultant, warned in a report last year
that British Columbia's exports of coking coal to Japan could fall from
12.7m tonnes in 1990 to as low as 6.7m tonnes by 2010.
Producers have had to accept price reductions from their Japanese customers
in each of the past two years. The industry claims that its export prices
have plunged by 66 per cent in real terms over the past decade.
The mines hope that domestic power-station business will take up some of the
slack on the export markets. Fording and Luscar's Coal Valley mine won
hard-fought contracts in competition with US producers earlier this year to
supply Ontario Hydro. The mines are also pressing for cuts in provincial
environmental standards to allow more coal-fired power stations.
But the industry's emphasis for the forseeable future is likely to remain on
cutting its own costs, and stepping up pressure on other links in the export
chain - notably the railways - to become more competitive as well.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tribunal backs Maori claim on
fisheries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAITANGI Tribunal, the powerful advisory body on Maori affairs, has
recommended that most of the fisheries of New Zealand's South Island be
handed over to the Ngai Tahu - one of the country's smallest tribes.
The tribunal in its findings said that the government had failed in a number
of ways to honour its obligations to the South Island-based tribe from the
signing of the treaty between the British and Maori people in 1840.
These included purchasing 34.5m acres from the tribe which left them
landless and with no economic base on which to fish, failure to protect and
conserve the sea fisheries and an assumption that non-Maoris had equal
rights with Maoris over their fishery.
The tribunal said that the Ngai Tahu had an exclusive right to fish
virtually all the South Island coastline as well as a reasonable share of
the 200-mile deep water fishery.
In the past similar findings have led to substantial cash settlements with
the Maori tribes concerned, and observers say one in this case could be
worth between NZDollars 500m and NZDollars 800m. However, a settlement much
smaller than this is likely with the tribe gaining a direct share of the
resource.
Tribunal members rejected the tribe's claim for all sea fisheries off its
boundaries, equivalent to 70 per cent of New Zealand's total commercial
fisheries.
Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said the recommendation would not be accepted
in full, especially as it would favour just one small group of Maori.
Maori representatives have emphasised that they do not plan any compulsory
acquisition of South Island fishing held now by non-Maoris.
In its finding the tribunal said allowances should be made for the serious
depletion of the inshore fisheries, caused by non-Maori fishing, when
working out a reasonable share of the deep water fisheries.
Ngai Tahu's 28.000 members are already set to become the main beneficiaries
of a Dollars 120 million 10 per cent commercial fishing quota that had
previously been agreed they would receive under the Maori Fisheries Act.
If the tribunal's recommendation was granted, the Ngai Tahu tribe would
receive about 85 per cent of the total fishery for hoki, the major export
fish.

IN THE second day of a major sell-off, orange juice futures fell yesterday
to life-of-contract lows on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Prices are plummeting following reports that the Brazilian harvest is larger
and has begun sooner than expected. The Florida crop is also reported to be
up significantly.
By mid-morning, the spot month, the September contract, had dropped 2.05
cents to 106.25 cents a lb, but the farther out contracts were all flirting
seriously with the 5 cent permissible daily limit on price movements.
Analysts said that the near term fundamentals in the market were all
bearish, but chart-minded traders were also joining in the sell-off.
Commodity funds jumped into sell on Monday driving all contracts but the
spot month to limit falls. The September spot month contract nearly reached
its 10 cent limit with a fall of 8.25 cents to 108.30 cents a lb.
According to Ms Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman, Brazilian supplies this
1992-1993 crop year will exceed the 273.5m boxes that were forecast earlier.
Florida's crop is also expected to increase to at least 175m boxes, up 25
per cent from last year's 139.8m.
If the October crop report by the US Department of Agriculture confirms the
trade's perceptions about the higher Florida output, some analysts say that
prices for frozen concentrated orange juice futures could plunge to just 75
cents a lb. However, the next level of support for prices is expected to
come at 99 cents a lb. At that level frozen concentrated orange juice would
be at a six year low.

THE INTERNATIONAL Natural Rubber Organisation is reported to have asked its
members for more cash in order to increase its buffer stock buying and shore
up prices.
Mr Aldo Hofmeister, the organisation's buffer stock manager, told the local
news agency here that Inro members would be asked to contribute MDollars
150m (USDollars 60m) in order to support further buffer stock operations. Mr
Hofmeister said that Inro countries had till mid-October to come up with the
funds.
Traders feel that the Inro action reflects increasing frustration with
present pricing structures as natural rubber prices continue to fall.
At the end of last week Inro bought between 4,000 and 8,000 tonnes of
Malaysian rubber and between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes of Indonesian rubber as
part of its efforts to stop prices falling.

London COCOA prices were sharply down at the close, while New York continued
to slide in late trading on selling tied to the market's inability to follow
through on the firmness early last week. Dealers cited discouraging chart
factors. 'Over the past few days, the big question had been: was it going to
drift or drop? I think today we've had our answer,' one London trader said.
London robusta COFFEE prices held steady in spite of an overnight fall in
the New York arabica market. Traders were predicting further losses in New
York, with London steadier because of tighter robusta supplies. GOLD tested
support, but held above, Dollars 348 a troy ounce on the London bullion
market. Much of the day's early flurry of activity was dictated by the weak
Australian dollar, which prompted physical buying and selling of gold in
that currency, one senior dealer said. Middle East buying was also reported
earlier. New York PLATINUM futures fell early on the back of another drop in
Japan's Nikkei stock average, sparking fears of lessening demand from the
world's biggest importer, analysts said. BASE METALS trading on the LME
remained dull, with the summer lull well entrenched.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Guidelines on Ecu bonds price
quotations reset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARKETMAKERS have reset guidelines on price quotations in Ecu bonds, in the
wake of a one-day suspension of marketmaking last month.
The suspension was triggered by chaotic selling of Ecu bonds, following
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union in June,
which threw the future of the currency into doubt.
Although market conditions have stabilised since then, allowing the spread
between bid and offer prices on the most liquid bonds to return to 10 basis
points, the market's former liquidity has not been restored.
At a meeting late 0n Monday, marketmakers agreed that the top 35 Ecu bonds
will continue to be traded at a bid/offer spread of 10 basis points to 25
basis points in a minimum size of Ecu3m or Ecu5m. However, the top tier of
bonds (those traded at a 10 basis point spread in a minimum size of Ecu5m)
has been reduced to bonds issued by France and the UK. Most other large
sovereign and supranational deals are also traded on a 10 cent spread, but
in a minimum size of Ecu3m.
The spread for Ecu bonds issued by Italy has been officially widened to 15
basis points. Bonds totalling Ecu500m-Ecu1bn issued some time ago are now
traded at a 20 cent spread.
Bonds are to be quoted on a 25 basis point spread if they are difficult
credits, or are particularly hard to trade for technical reasons. Small
issues are to be traded on a 50 basis point spread.
Mr David Ovenden, who heads the International Securities Market
Association's Ecu sub-committee, said none of the market's 44 marketmakers
had pulled out, but added that he expects 'to lose about half a dozen over
the next six months.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: International draft rules on
capital delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROPOSED international regime governing the capital adequacy of securities
firms has been further delayed, in spite of indications earlier this year
that regulators in the world's main financial centres had reached agreement.
The regime, mirroring the Basle capital rules for banks, is intended to make
sure investment firms have the financial resources to withstand losses,
preventing a domino-like collapse in financial markets.
Iosco, the grouping of international securities regulators, and the Basle
committee of banking supervisors said, in January, draft rules would be
published this summer.
However, this has been delayed to October at the earliest after a recent
Iosco meeting failed to endorse the proposals.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission is believed to have been among the
regulatory bodies which wanted more time to consider the proposals. The SEC
was also responsible for delaying an earlier attempt to reach agreement, 18
months ago.
SEC chairman Mr Richard Breeden has been concerned that the international
rules would be weaker than those already imposed in the US. That would
either force the SEC to water down its regulations, or leave US securities
firms at a disadvantage. Issues still under discussion include the amount of
subordinated debt securities firms can count as capital for regulatory
purposes. Also, regulators have yet to decide on what should fall within a
bank's 'trading book', which will be subjected to the less stringent
securities rules rather than the Basle rules for bank capital.
Part of the reason for the delay is the European Commission's draft rules on
capital adequacy, which were adopted at the end of June, said Mr Roy Croft
of the UK's Securities and Investments Board. Iosco members wanted more time
to consider these before formalising their own plans.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Forex dealers can buy time -
James Blitz looks at computer trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to dealing in the foreign exchange markets, every second
counts. Now, thanks to new technology, the time it takes to make a deal will
be even more precious.
A group of computer trading systems developed by Reuters, Quotron Systems
and the Japanese telecommunications company, KDD, could accelerate the
already furious speed at which currency deals are transacted. These systems
will provide automated brokerage matching buyers and sellers electronically
in the time it takes to blink.
'It will change the way currency dealers look at the world,' says Mr Chris
Deuters, managing director of global foreign exchange at Lehman Bros in
London. 'In particular, it will increase the pace of trading at moments of
crisis in the market.'
Automatic brokerage sys-tems aim to increase the speed at which a trader can
find a buyer. Currently, a trader contacts a known counterparty via computer
or telephone, makes an offer and waits for confirmation. Alternatively, he
contacts a currency broker who can match the offer with another bank's bid.
Using automated brokerage, a dealer can type on to his computer screen the
price at which he is willing to sell his currency, and the system will match
him automatically with an anonymous buyer.
The Reuters Dealing 2000-2 system has been operational since April and is
used by about 30 banks. Quotron's Electronic Brokerage System, backed by 10
leading banks is due to become operational early next year. The systems may
have a number of effects on currency trading:
The volatility of the market could grow, increasing volumes and sharpening
foreign exchange peaks and troughs. Mr Ian Doull, project director of the
Quotron system, says electronic brokerage may increase volatilities
hour-by-hour or day-by-day. Liquidity will increase. The dealing systems
will reduce the commissions that banks pay to brokerage firms. The project
directors of the Reuters 2000-2 system say they will charge about half of a
broker's current commission for each trade.
Some foreign exchange traders are pessimistic about the future of electronic
broking. The systems are technically complex, and several forex heads in
London who have purchased the Dealing 2000-2 system say it is used for only
a small percentage of business.
There are several reasons for caution. All the systems face the problem of
ensuring the creditworthiness of counterparties. Under conversational
dealing, a trader knows from the outset whether his counterparty is an
acceptable credit risk. Using electronic brokerage he cannot be so sure. The
trader may conclude a deal, only to be told moments later that his
counterparty has insufficient credit. 'Relationships are very important in
the market and traders will always need to get the feel for what is
happening that a machine cannot provide,' Mr Doull said.
Dealers may take time to learn the new techniques. 'Currency traders will be
uncertain about handling the new systems in periods of heavy volume, and,
until they learn how to use them, their impact on the market will be
limited,' said Mr Deuters.
In the immediate future, electronic broking will complement existing dealing
methods without superseding them. The longer term impact is less
predictable. 'We don't know what impact these systems will have. We are all
going into uncharted waters,' said Mr Doull.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Strong demand in Australian dollar
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH volume of redemption flows in the Australian dollar sector of the
Eurobond market is fuelling demand for paper in the sector, which normally
experiences a lull in August.
Redemptions of Australian dollar-denominated Eurobonds total ADollars 1.1bn
this month, according to Hambros Bank. The current weakness of the
Australian dollar is encouraging a high level of reinvestment, but the flow
of redemptions is set to tail off to about ADollars 200m in September and
October.
Following three deals last week totalling ADollars 425m, the South
Australian Government Financing Authority yesterday launched an ADollars
125m issue of 9 per cent bonds due 2002. Investor interest is concentrated
at the longer end of the market, according to dealers, due to the steep
yield curve in the Australian government bond market. For example, 10-year
government bonds, yielding 8.84 per cent, offer a yield pick-up of more than
 1/2 point over seven-year government bonds.
Also, despite the decline of Australian interest rates, the government's
success in curbing inflation (now at 1.1 per cent) means real interest rates
are still higher than in Europe.
The SAGFA deal, arranged by Hambros Bank, was bid at less 1 1/2 points,
comfortably within full fees of 2 1/8 points.
In the Japanese equity warrants market, Toyo Kanetsu, a manufacturing
company, launched a Dollars 100m four-year issue of bonds with equity
warrants attached, via Yamaichi International. The deal did not suffer from
further fallsin the Japanese stock market, leaving the Nikkei index below
the 15,000 level.
Most warrants are substantially out-of-the-money (that is, the exercise
price is far above the current stock price), and many are expiring
worthless.
Scarcity value, coupled with a sense that the stock market must bounce soon,
have boosted interest in new paper. The Toyo Kanetsu deal was bid at 105,
above its par issue price.
In the sterling market, Compagnie Bancaire launched a Pounds 100m issue of
senior, unsubordinated floating rate notes, paying interest at  1/8 point
above the London interbank offered rate. According to arranger UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, the deal was placed mainly with UK institutions.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: De Beers loses a little sparkle
 -Philip Gawith on the dividend cut at the S African diamond producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The De Beers board has a quaint habit of meeting in Kimberley, the northern
Cape mining town where the South African diamond producer began.
Yesterday it seemed very far removed from the country's financial centre in
more than just a geographic sense as the prediction of a 'significant
reduction' in the final dividend sent shock waves through the Johannesburg
investment community.
Although the 26 per cent fall in attributable earnings was in line with
predictions, most analysts were aghast at the announcement that the final
dividend would be cut. Some said this would do serious damage to the
credibility of De Beers and Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, its chairman.
The confusion stems from the seemingly inexplicable difference between the
fairly optimistic predictions De Beers was making as recently as six weeks
ago about the outlook, and the much more bearish picture it has presented.
Until yesterday, De Beers had been sending a clear message that the position
of the diamond market was not too bad. It told those worried about the poor
results from the first three auctions of rough diamonds of the 10 to be held
this year to refer to the directors' forecast. Its main point was that sales
of rough diamonds in the second half of 1992 would be better than in the
same period in 1991.
However, yesterday the board withdrew this prediction saying second-half
sales could well be lower than during the first half.
The gravity of the group's position was emphasised by the imposition
yesterday of a 25 per cent quota reduction in the diamonds bought from
producers by the Central Selling Organisation (CSO) - the De Beers'
organisation which markets about 80 per cent of the world's uncut diamonds.
The directors offer two reasons for its changed forecast:
Low retail and rough diamond sales, due to weaker than anticipated upturns
in Europe and the US and the continued slowdown in Japan; and
A 'dramatic increase' in supplies of illicit diamonds from Angola. The CSO
has mopped up a lot of this supply, but some of it is being sold outside of
the CSO.
Recently Mr Richard Stuart of Martin &amp; Co, the firm of stockbrokers and
South Africa's leading diamond analyst, said De Beers directors would rather
cut their throats than cut the dividend. Yesterday, Mr Stuart spoke for many
when he said they probably had cut their throats as far as the investment
community was concerned.
Aside from the damage done to De Beers's reputation, yesterday's dividend
announcement casts a pall over its stock market status. Mr Charles Booth,
research director of JD Anderson, the stockbroking firm, said that apart
from being bad news for the share price - which fell by more than 6 per cent
yesterday to R68.50 on the news - it also damaged the group's reputation as
a quality stock whose dividend would never be cut. (The dividend has only
once before been cut - in 1981). He said the market might be tempted to
regard De Beers as more of a cyclical stock and to downrate it accordingly.
There was disagreement among analysts over whether it was necessary for De
Beers to cut the dividend. Although some brokers had forecast a cut in the
final dividend, saying the company would not have enough cash to maintain
it, others differed.
Mr Stuart thought the cut unnecessary given the financial strength of De
Beers, which has net assets at market value of more than R30bn (Dollars
10.9bn). He also argued that De Beers should have given the market time to
adapt to the imposition of quotas before considering a dividend cut.
Some see the hand of Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the retired former chairman of De
Beers, behind the forecast dividend cut. His thinking, it is reasoned, is
that if De Beers is going to impose quota constraints on the industry, then
it must also be seen to be taking some pain itself.
A further puzzle about the dividend cut is that it seems to be something of
an over reaction. Even with the second-half forecast revised downwards, it
seems unlikely that CSO rough diamond sales for the year will be much worse
than Dollars 3.5bn, against Dollars 3.9bn in 1991. This compares with a near
halving of CSO sales in 1981, the year of the earlier dividend cut.
Analysts caution that comparisons with the early 1980s, when the industry
experienced the worst slump in its history, should be resisted. Then
deflation in the world economy caused large stocks of diamonds, which had
been bought as an inflation hedge, to be deposited on the market. De Beers,
as a result, lost a degree of control over the supply of diamonds to the
CSO.
Today, De Beers has much improved control over the supply. The difference is
evident from the ratio of CSO stocks to sales which rose above 160 per cent
in 1984. Last year it was 77 per cent, and even with the gloomy second-half
prognosis it is still unlikely to rise above 100 per cent.
There is no comparable overhang of diamonds, excepting two problems. The
first concerns the increase in supply from Angola. The second relates to De
Beers's Venetia mine in the Northern Transvaal which opens in two days time.
Originally the mine planned to open in a US election year, traditionally a
period of firm demand in the US economy.
This calculation has clearly backfired. As a result an extra 6m carats of
diamonds - Venetia's full production - will be entering the CSO, without a
market and hence will have to be stockpiled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CATHAY Pacific Airways yesterday said it had agreed provisionally with Hong
Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) to buy 10 per cent of the colony's
monopoly handler of air freight for HKDollars 95m (Dollars 12.31m).
Cathay said the deal was subject to HACTL being awarded an air cargo
handling licence for Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok.
If it goes through, the Swire Group, which already owns 30 per cent of the
company, will increase its stake to 40 per cent.
Two weeks ago, China National Aviation Corporation (Canc) paid HKDollars
106m for the Hong Kong government's 10 per cent stake in HACTL. Its purchase
was not conditional upon HACTL's success in winning a licence to operate at
the new airport.
Cathay will acquire HKDollars 4m of shareholder's loans to the company. If
the loan facilities are fully exercised Cathay's commitment could be as high
as HKDollars 30m.
If the deal, which is due on or before January 1995, goes through, Jardine
Matheson will sell Cathay a 5 per cent stake, of its 30 per cent
shareholding, and Wharf and Hutchison Whampoa Docks will each sell it a 2.5
per cent stake of their 15 per cent shareholdings.
Mr Peter Sutch, Cathay chairman, said cargo handling was one of the
fastest-growing aspects of Cathay's business.
'This agreement demonstrates our intention to continue to be a major force
in Hong Kong's air freight industry,' he said.

ALCAN Australia, the Sydney-based integrated aluminium group, has come
through the worldwide slump in aluminium prices with reduced losses in the
first half to June.
The company's loss eased to ADollars 6.6m (USDollars 4.88m) from ADollars
13.4m on a 7 per cent fall in sales to ADollars 276.4m from ADollars 297.2m.
No interim dividend will be paid. The directors said the average aluminium
price for the half was USDollars 1,295 a tonne, down USDollars 150 a tonne
from a year earlier.
The restructuring programme begun last year resulted in a further reduction
of 100 people from the workforce. A charge of ADollars 1.3m for redundancy
costs was incurred compared with ADollars 5.6m last time, the company said.
Alcan has written off ADollars 18.3m from its asset revaluation reserve
following a valuation of land and buildings. The result followed a tax
credit of ADollars 2.7m compared with ADollars 3.5m previously and interest
costs of ADollars 7.5m against ADollars 9.3m.

CALTEX Australia, the Sydney-based petroleum group, has returned to the
black in the first half to June, helped by a big asset sale.
However, the company yesterday announced a heavy restructuring programme
which will cut the workforce by almost 14 per cent.
The company turned after-tax losses of ADollars 18.4m (USDollars 13.6m) into
ADollars 7.9m profits on a 2.5 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 1.64bn
from ADollars 1.59bn. The interim dividend has again been passed.
The result included a ADollars 5.3m abnormal pre-tax profit - compared with
nil previously - mostly comprising a ADollars 7.9m profit on the sale of a
crude oil carrier.
'Whilst pressures on the industry, including sustained competition, are
unlikely to abate, directors are determined to see that the Caltex group
will emerge as an efficient and low-cost entity,' said Mr Barry Murphy,
chairman and chief executive.
The result followed a reduced interest bill of ADollars 27.3m compared with
ADollars 34.8m and depreciation of ADollars 32.2m against ADollars 31.3m.
Tax took ADollars 10.9m down from a ADollars 4.5m credit previously.

<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Mulholland, chief executive of South African Times Media (TML),
has been appointed chief executive of John Fairfax, Australia's
second-largest newspaper group.
Fairfax has been without a chief executive since December, when it was
acquired for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.03bn) by a consortium led by the
Daily Telegraph, the UK newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black.
Mr Mulholland's success in his new appointment will depend on the extent to
which he replicates in Australia the methods he used to turn round TML. He
was appointed to the company in 1986 to rescue the ailing TML, then known as
South African Associated Newspapers (Saan), by Mr Gordon Waddell, then
chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI), the South African
mining house which controlled Saan.
Mr Mulholland had been editor of the weekly Financial Mail magazine, with no
previous management experience.
However, his appointment is widely seen as having been a success. He turned
the company round from heavy losses to steadily increasing profits.
Fairfax publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, The Australian Financial
Review, and The Age in Melbourne.
It has about 20 per cent of Australian daily circulation, compared with 70
per cent controlled by News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-based media
group. Fairfax was put into receivership in 1990 after an abortive buy-out
of family shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax.
Mr Mulholland will be replaced at TML by Mr David Kovarsky, the youthful
chairman of Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the ferrochrome
subsidiary of JCI.
Mr Kovarsky, who has been on the TML board for a number of years, is
regarded by many as a successful mining executive.

BK VISION, the specialised investment holding company created last October
by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ Bank group, is raising SFr200m (Dollars 152m) in a
rights issue.
BK Vision's strategy, which has aroused some controversy in Swiss financial
circles, is to hold significant stakes in a small number of banks and
financial institutions with a view to influencing their management.
BK is already one of the largest shareholders in Union Bank of Switzerland.
Its only other holdings at the end of April were in Leu Holding, Zurich
Insurance and Banca del Gottardo. The net asset value of BK yesterday was
SFr728m.
The rights issue is on the basis of one new share for every three held at
160 per cent of par value. The bearer shares closed yesterday in Zurich at
SFr950.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fokker blames interest charges
for 37% plunge

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker in which Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of
Germany is to take a 51 per cent stake later this year, yesterday blamed
higher interest charges for a 37.5 per cent decline in first-half profits
and for an expected fall of more than 50 per cent in full-year results.
First-half net profit fell sharply to Fl 26.3m (Dollars 15.9m) from Fl 42.2m
the year before, as net interest costs jumped to Fl 56.9m from Fl 38.9m in
the first six months of 1991.
The increase in interest payments - which reflects delays in deliveries of
completed aircraft as well as a slowdown in the receipt of new orders and
advance payments - is also expected to cause 1992 net profit to fall to
roughly Fl 40m from Fl 87m the year before, the company said.
Mr Rennie Hendriksen, Fokker's finance director, said they had arranged new
credit facilities of Fl 1bn with a consortium of Dutch and British banks.
The rise in first-half interest charges was also partly the result of the
postponement of a planned Fl 500m issue of new shares. Under an agreement
reached last month, Dasa will now take up the entire share issue as well as
purchase the 32 per cent stake in Fokker held by the Dutch government.
The exact price which Dasa will pay for these Fokker shares has not yet been
fixed. In response to queries, Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, Fokker's chairman,
said prices frequently quoted in the Dutch press, such as Fl 38 per share,
were 'low'.
Fokker's shares have recently fallen to around 12-month lows of Fl 22, due
partly to the fact that Dasa will not be launching a public bid to attain
its controlling 51 per cent stake.
Minority shareholders have criticised the deal because their shares will be
worth less than the government will receive for its holding.
However, Mr Hendriksen said the transaction 'was not a dilution but an
enrichment', arguing that Dasa, as part of the Germany's Daimler industrial
group, would be able to provide financing for Fokker, thereby avoiding the
need for interest payments in future.

American boost
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, one of the world's top three music companies, yesterday announced
a 16.3 per cent increase in interim profits, helped by an improvement in
North America and strong sales from recording artists such as Lionel Richie,
Elton John and Kiri Te Kanawa.
The company, 80 per cent owned by Philips and listed in the Netherlands and
the US, reported net income after tax and minorities of Fl 171m (Dollars
103m) in the six months to 30 June, up from Fl 147m.
Mr Alain Levy, chief executive, said the results were pleasing, especially
since European markets were affected by recession. The performance was in
sharp contrast to that at Philips, which last week announced a 63 per cent
fall in interim net profits due to price cutting in consumer electronics.
PolyGram increased sales 10.1 per cent to Fl 2.98bn. North America's
proportion of group sales rose 4 per cent to 22 per cent. Mr Levy said
margins also improved, but remained below those for other main markets.
Compact disc sales continued to increase at the expense of cassettes and
records. CDs accounted for 67 per cent of units sold in the period, compared
with 58 per cent last year. LP record sales fell from 7 per cent to 3 per
cent.
PolyGram has started production of pre-recorded digital compact cassettes
(DCC), which Philips plans to launch later this year as the new generation
for recorded tapes.
Really Useful Holdings, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's music company in which
PolyGram holds 30 per cent, performed well, the company said.
Net income per share increased 17.4 per cent to Fl 1.01. The company does
not pay interim dividends.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel and aluminium group, fell into a net loss of Fl
49m (Dollars 29.7m) in the first six months of 1992, compared with a net
profit of Fl 55m in the same period last year.
The loss confirmed the company's earlier predictions that it would see no
improvement during the period.
The company, which was forced to omit its 1991 dividend after it posted
full-year losses of Fl 51m last year, said it did not expect any improvement
in European steel and aluminium markets in the 1992 second half.
It warned there was a 'serious possibility' that results in the second half
on ordinary activities would be substantially lower than they were in the
first, when these activities - comprising operating profit and financial
income and charges - posted a loss of Fl 70m, against a profit of Fl 73m the
previous year.
First-half operating profit tumbled to Fl 35m from Fl 169m a year earlier,
while financial charges widened to Fl 105m from Fl 96m. Group turnover fell
5.2 per cent to Fl 3.9bn.
The weak economic climate in Europe and competition from non-EC countries
such as Russia had undermined prices for most of Hoogovens' steel products.
Similar factors were at work on the European aluminium market.
Hoogovens' steel production rose in the first half from the reduced levels
of the first six months of 1991, when a key blast furnace had been
undergoing refurbishment.
However, the company said it would probably maintain steel production at the
new lower levels introduced in June.
Aluminium production fell in the first half because of a reorganisation,
aimed at refocusing the group's Belgian plant on higher added-value
products.

DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, yesterday
reported pre-tax profits up 15 per cent to DM164m (Dollars 112m) in the nine
months to June. This was achieved on turnover down 5 per cent to DM9.4bn.
The company said it expected the benefits of a restructuring and
cost-cutting plan to produce better profits for the final quarter, compared
with the same period last year. In 1990-1991, total pre-tax profits dropped
by 44 per cent to DM179m, reflecting difficult conditions in many markets.
Degussa said yesterday it had cut losses in the metals sector
'significantly'. This sector, accounting for nearly half of group turnover,
suffered through losses at the Leybold machinery subsidiary and because of a
30 per cent drop in turnover in precious metals trading, where trading
volumes were significantly lower than the previous year.
Excluding the drop in precious metals trading, group turnover rose by 5 per
cent, Degussa said. But it added that 3 percentage points of this were due
to the inclusion of the recently acquired Arzneimittelwerk Dresden (AWD) -
an east German pharmaceutical group.
Profits in the chemical division - where turnover climbed 2 per cent to
DM3.54bn - picked up from the early weak months of the year. Degussa said
that while prices remained under pressure volumes had at least returned to
the previous year's levels.
Degussa also announced details of its expected capital increase. It will be
issuing 1.08m new shares in September at DM225 per share, raising DM243m.
The funds from the one for seven rights issue will be used for 'general
corporate financing purposes'.

FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y dispute focuses on New York
towers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Financial Centre in New York is emerging as the focus of Olympia &amp;
York's efforts to keep its US buildings out of the bankruptcy protection
which has engulfed the troubled developer's operations in Canada and the UK.
Three disputes have surfaced between O&amp;Y and its creditors over loans
relating to the 44-storey Tower B of the 7.6m sq ft World Financial Centre.
Some of the lenders predict O&amp;Y has little chance of settling these
disagreements without seeking court protection.
Talks broke down last week with a group of eight banks led by Morgan
Guaranty and Bank of Montreal which advanced Dollars 160m on security of a
pledge of O&amp;Y's partnership interest in Towers A and B of the World
Financial Centre, as well as four other buildings in New York and Los
Angeles.
The Morgan group has threatened legal action to seize rental income from
these buildings in excess of amounts required for debt-service and
maintenance payments.
An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday, however, that the company views the threat
merely as 'another step' in negotiations towards a debt restructuring. All
payments on the Dollars 160m loan remain up to date.
The Morgan dispute stems from O&amp;Y's failure to pay Dollars 62m in interest
last March to a group of Japanese institutions led by Nomura Securities
which hold the Dollars 800m first mortgage on Tower B. The World Financial
Centre has a low vacancy rate and a strong cash flow, but O&amp;Y funnelled
rental income from Tower B earlier this year to prop up its ailing Canadian
operations.
The Morgan group objects that O&amp;Y is compensating the mortgage holders by
paying them excess cash flow from the building, in effect putting Dollars
62m of debt ahead of the Morgan security. It wants to prevent the same
happening with the other five properties. O&amp;Y and the Nomura group have yet
to reach a longer-term agreement on the missed payment.
Separately, Morgan has threatened to auction an interest-rate swap, which is
classified as an O&amp;Y asset, and forms part of the collateral for the Dollars
160m loan. The auction has been postponed several times while negotiations
continue, but is now scheduled to take place on August 28.
Debt payments on the other two World Financial Centre buildings in which O&amp;Y
has a stake are understood to be up-to-date. The fourth building, Tower C,
is owned by American Express.

INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, yesterday announced its
first venture in eastern Europe with the acquisition of an 80 per cent stake
in Poland's second biggest paper manufacturer.
International Paper will pay Dollars 120m for its stake in Kwidzyn Pulp and
Paper Company. It will also invest another Dollars 175m over the next four
years as part of a programme to modernise and expand the company.
The deal was announced by Mr Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's minister of
privatisation.
Kwidzyn, which started production in the early 1980s, recorded sales of
930bn zlotys (Dollars 71.5m) in the first five months of this year and
pre-tax profits of 45bn zlotys. It is Poland's only integrated bleached pulp
and paper company.
The move comes when International Paper has started to look further afield
for acquisitions, after expanding aggressively in the US and western Europe
in the 1980s. About Dollars 4bn of the company's roughly Dollars 13bn in
annual sales comes from western European operations.
International Paper has agreed not to make any Kwidzyn employees redundant
within the next 18 months and to maintain existing social benefits. In the
US, International Paper ran into trouble with its unions in 1987 over
proposed cuts in wages and benefits which resulted in a lock-out at one mill
and a 16-month strike at three others.
Mr George Adler, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham in New York
described the investment as 'very interesting. This seems to be a fairly
modern mill - the first machine was put in there in 1985'.

The provisional figures revealed life insurance revenue rose 39 per cent to
FFr32bn from FFr23bn, while casualty registered a 6 per cent gain to FFr33bn
from FFr31bn.
UAP said the life advance mostly reflected the integration of Sun Life into

REXMORE, the Liverpool-based upholstery, textile and timber supplier, blamed
the 'lack of activity' in the furniture manufacturing and building trades
for a downturn in annual profits.
Despite a promising start, the year to March 28 ended with profits of Pounds
931,000 (Pounds 1m) pre-tax, on turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 44.8m
(Pounds 43.4m).
Interest charges amounted to Pounds 916,000 (Pounds 1.07m). The costs of
withdrawing from the loss-making Letherens business, along with losses on
the sale of Rexmore's stake in Rosebys, resulted in an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 1.66m.
However, the contract furnishings side achieved record profits of Pounds
1.8m (Pounds 1.39m).
After a transfer from reserves of Pounds 1.29m, earnings emerged at 4.36p
(4.75p). The final dividend is reduced to 1.05p for a 1.75p (2.25p) total.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional 'transfer fee' lifts Manchester
Ship Canal by 63%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER SHIP Canal yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise, from Pounds
4.79m to Pounds 7.81m, in interim pre-tax profits after exceptional credits
totalling Pounds 3.05m.
Turnover for the first half of 1992 was flat at Pounds 10.5m, but operating
profit improved 21 per cent to Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 2.63m).
Earnings per share were 182.5p (152.8p), but a decision on whether to pay a
dividend will depend on the full year results, Mr Robert Hough, chairman,
said yesterday. A dividend of 4.5p was paid last year.
Exceptionals included Pounds 2.43m from Heywoods, the ship canal's container
terminal operator - in effect a transfer fee from Ellesmere Port to Seaforth
in Mersey Docks, where Heywoods will start operating later this year.
Since Heywoods will take Ellesmere Port's specialised cranes with it, the
ship canal will handle no more containers. However, Mr Hough said container
traffic accounted for only Pounds 644,000 of turnover; most turnover came
from bulk chemicals and liquids and the basic customer base was 'secure', he
said.
Another Pounds 800,000 of exceptionals came from Massey Ferguson, the
Varity-owned farm machinery manufacturer, to buy the ship canal's rights to
first option on land in Trafford Park, where Massey Ferguson has been
reorganising.
The ship canal's long term worry, however, is its property portfolio in and
around Salford Quays, the Port of Manchester's former disused docklands,
where it has about 200,000 sq ft of new office space unlet.
The company says this is worth Pounds 2m a year in rental, which prices it
at only Pounds 10 per sq ft, compared with Pounds 15-Pounds 20 for lesser
accommodation in Manchester city centre.
'Since we have only 6 per cent gearing, I believe we can take a long-term
view of this,' Mr Hough said, although letting is 'an immediate priority.'

It also reported losses deepened from Pounds 875,000 to Pounds 2.4m pre-tax
in the six months to September 30.
The deficit included Pounds 1.12m of accrued interest which the company said
would not have to be paid under the refinancing.
Embassy said it had reached agreement with an investor group to take up a
proposed placing to raise Pounds 2.8m gross. It had completed the
negotiations on the commercial terms on restructuring the large majority of
its bank debt and was in the final stages of negotiating the remainder.
In the six months the construction and shopfitting companies contributed
'positive returns' but housebuilding incurred a loss and property sales had
been difficult.
Turnover fell to Pounds 6.33m (Pounds 10.8m) of which property development
and trading contributed Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 7.36m). Losses emerged at
26.1p (8.5p).

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Fleming reduces buying price of Wellcome
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT FLEMING, the merchant bank which organised the Pounds 2.16bn sale of
270m Wellcome shares last month, has cut the price at which it was buying
shares in the company from 800p to 780p.
The mid-market share price fell from 800 1/2 p to 782p.
Fleming has been stabilising the share price since the sale was concluded on
July 27 by bidding for shares at 800p, the price at which the Wellcome Trust
sold the shares.
However, the fall in the stock market since the issue was priced left
Fleming vulnerable to sellers looking to raise cash. On Monday it had to buy
10m shares when four large institutions - two in Scotland and two London
merchant banks - decided to sell stock.
After the London market closed on Monday, Fleming was understood to have
instructed Morgan Stanley to cut the price it was buying back shares in New
York. Fleming's bid price in London was then reduced yesterday morning. It
was thought that Fleming bought less than 2m shares yesterday, under a third
of the volume done in Wellcome shares.
The FT-SE 100 index stood at 2377.2 on the day the Wellcome tender closed
and has fallen 2.8 per cent to yesterday's closing level of 2309.6. The 20p
cut in Fleming's bid price is a slightly smaller percentage fall.
Under the 'green-shoe' option attached to the share offer, Fleming
over-alloted 40.5m shares. It is thought to have over-alloted another 10m to
15m shares giving it a short position. This enabled Fleming to buy back
shares - to stabilise the price - without reducing the size of the issue.
If Fleming does not buy back all the shares by August 26, when the
stabilisation period ends, it can buy more shares from the Trust to meet the
over-allotment - in effect increasing the size of the share offer.
Before Monday Fleming had used up about 10m of the 'green-shoe' option, and
has now bought back more than half the shares it can.
The idea of stabilisation is to create a price level where there is good
two-way business rather than to keep the price artificially high. Under
stabilisation rules Fleming can lead the market down, but cannot push the
price up unless another market maker puts its bid up first.

Shares of Crown Eyeglass, the USM-quoted maker and retailer of spectacles,
yesterday rose 18p to 163p on news of an 80 per cent rise, to Pounds
451,000, in annual pre-tax profits.
Turnover for the 12 months to March 29 rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
3.99m. The profits took account of an exceptional provision of Pounds 56,000
and interest income of Pounds 2,000 (charge Pounds 62,000). Directors said
the latter reflected the elimination of group borrowings.
Earnings emerged at 19.4p (11.2p) and a final dividend of 4p makes a 6p
(3.5p) total.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Council tax and house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W A JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There have been a number of recent articles in quality papers
concerning the bands to be used for Britain's council tax. The bands are
based on two-year-old house prices. According to the government 'the bands
are so wide that reflecting the fall in house prices would cause little
movement between bands'.
The problem is worst in the south and East Anglia, where house prices have
fallen most dramatically. I do not believe that anyone has yet considered
the mathematics involved. If every house and flat in the country dropped
into a lower band then the price for each band would have to increase in
order to raise the same total amount of tax.
It will be difficult to convince people that it is fair to charge tax based
on what a house was worth in the past. Government spokesmen should remind
the public that the prices used to set the banding are a snapshot at a point
in time and that those prices would have continued to be used if prices had
carried on rising.
The government could learn from the private sector marketing experts. They
consider how to influence the perception of the customer. An example is
retailers who increase prices and soon after offer 20 per cent off]

FT  12 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome 'floor' lowered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FLOOR set on the Wellcome share price at the recent share issue began to
suffer yesterday from wet rot seeping in from the rest of the stock market.
Because of the general fall in market, the floor was lowered from 800p to
780p and shares in the pharmaceuticals group fell 18 1/2 to 782p with 7.7m
traded.
Wellcome Trust, the charity which has been reducing its majority
shareholding, had said it would buy up to 40m shares until the issue closes.
This 'green shoe' buy-back option allows the issue price to be stabilised.
Robert Fleming, lead broker for the global sale, had announced that it would
support a price of 800p. However, some analysts pointed out that, in this
case, selling Wellcome shares provided a guaranteed exit from a falling
stock market.
On Monday, two large institutions offloaded large lines of stock. As a
result, Fleming told Morgan Stanley, the lead US broker, to quote Wellcome
at a market level in New York, where the shares are traded in the form of
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The ADRs were quoted overnight around
Dollars 15, the equivalent of 782p.
When London opened, Fleming followed suit, cutting its bid price, and
arguing that the new level reflected the general fall in the market since
the strike price was set on July 27. Fleming is believed to have bought
about half of the green shoe allocation so far. The final closing date for
the issue is August 26.
BA declines
Disappointment at a fall in British Airways' (BA) passenger yield in the
three months to June 30 saw a fall in the shares after first quarter results
just shy of market forecasts.
By the close the shares had given up 8 to 253p in average trade of 4.4m
shares. Profits for the period April to June reached Pounds 91m, against
Pounds 9m in the same period last year. tA good result had been anticipated
from the UK's leading airliner which led to strong demand for the stock
ahead of the results, however a close examination of the figures left the
market slightly disappointed with the underlying profits figure.
Nonetheless, Mr Chris Will at Lehman Brothers remained positive on the stock
and said he was maintaining his full year profits forecast at Pounds 400m
because, 'the falls in the yield have been more than matched by the cuts in
costs'.
Waters easier
Water shares were generally weaker amid investor concern about tomorrow's
Ofwat report on quality standards in the industry. Recommendations are
expected on issues including metering, leakage, and capital expenditure.
Detailed costings are unlikely, however, as three other reports due in
coming weeks address the sector's cost base more closely.
Analysts said yesterday that the outlook for the sector remained positive
and that fears had been exaggerated. Mr Stephen Doe at Smith New Court said:
'The regulatory nervousness has been overdone. Higher capital spending will
prolong growth in the sector.' Among the main movers yesterday, Thames lost
12 to 385p, Welsh 10 to 413p and Yorkshire 13 to 410p.
Insurer General Accident was one of the strongest performers in the FT-SE
100 index as half-year results beat most expectations. The shares were up 13
at best and closed 8 higher at 398p.
The firm posted a half-year loss of Pounds 21.2m against a loss of Pounds
105.2m previously. Analysts' forecasts ranged from a loss of Pounds 20m to
Pounds 52m. The group said UK underwriting losses had improved as action on
premiums and cost controls took effect, helping the company to make a profit
in the second quarter.
Banks were generally stronger but a couple were put under pressure by
downgrades. Barclays fell 4 to 300p after a sell recommendation issued by
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Analyst Mr Derek Chambers cut his forecast for this
year's profits to Pounds 300m from Pounds 450m and for 1993 to around Pounds
450m from Pounds 1bn, the latter believed to be around the bottom of the
range of analysts forecasts.
Bank of Scotland lost 2 to 100p in early trade after Credit Lyonnais Laing
cut its current year profit forecast for the group to Pounds 135m from
Pounds 177.5m previously. The bank made Pounds 140m in the year to the end
of February. The cut was prompted by a downward revision in net interest
income.
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank saw heavy turnover of 10m shares as a block of 5m
was traded at 328p. The shares were unchanged at 328p.
Speculation later denied that James Capel had changed its attitude to RTZ
prompted the world's biggest mining group to close 25 lower at 525p.
Oils were firm as investors speculated on renewed tension in the Middle
East. Among the gainers BP lifted 2 to 189 1/2 p with 22m shares traded and
Enterprise rose 7 to 347p.
Switching out of Guinness and into Grand Metropolitan continued. Guinness
shares dropped 12 to 516p, Grand Met lifted 9 to 425p. Allied-Lyons, another
Kleinwort buy, added 4 to 602p.
BZW's review of the food manufacturing sector continued on the back of what
it considers tough trading conditions. Yesterday, the house trimmed
forecasts for Associated British Foods by Pounds 10m to Pounds 305m for this
year, and United Biscuits, by Pounds 5m to Pounds 195m. AB Foods shed 7 to
386p, while UB tumbled 12 to 300p. A James Capel downgrade was said to have
unhinged Northern Foods, off 11 at 232p.
Ranks Hovis McDougall slipped 4 to 168p as a block of 4.6m shares went
through the market at 150p, taking turnover to a hefty 5.6m,
Textile group Coats Viyella saw unusually heavy turnover as one institution
sold 3.8m shares at 161 1/2 p through Smith New Court which placed the
shares at 162p. The shares closed 6 lower at 165p with recorded turnover of
8.7m.
A squeeze continued in BAA and the shares gained 4 to 629p. Rolls-Royce
eased a penny to 138p.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pulled down by several
sell programs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AMID confusing cross-currents from overseas stock and currency markets, US
share prices eased slightly yesterday under the weight of several computer
sell programs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.48 at 3,331.10. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
0.52 at 418.90, while the Amex composite finished 0.33 lower at 388.08 and
the Nasdaq composite down 1.54 at 571.60. Turnover on the NYSE was 175m
shares.
Once again declines in foreign markets overnight set the tone for a downbeat
opening to trading. The vulnerability of the dollar, which needed fresh
support from world central banks yesterday, also troubled US investors,
although another fall in long-term bond yields, which now stand at their
lowest levels for five years, provided some help to sentiment.
Against such a confusing background, computer program trades provided the
market with its direction. After one buy program had helped prices in early
trading, a series of sell programs sent the Dow tumbling almost 20 points in
mid-morning. The light volume exaggerated the effect of these programs on
the major equity indices.
Among individual stocks, Philip Morris fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 80 in
active trading after the broking house, Kidder Peabody, lowered its
investment rating from 'buy' to a 'hold' citing the stock's recent gains.
One of the most actively traded stocks was McDonnell Douglas, which jumped
another Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 in turnover of 1.1m shares after
several broking houses upgraded the stock after Monday's announcement of a
restructuring of the aerospace and defence group and on the news that
McDonnell's Employee Stock Ownership Plan would be buying Dollars 50m of
company stock in the open market.
Various retailers released a mixed bag of second quarter results which
produced some contrarian responses from investors. The Limited rose Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 , in spite of flat earnings, while JC Penney, which
has risen steadily all year, fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 after
reporting a big rise in net income to Dollars 80m. Wal-Mart, the biggest
retailer in the US, recovered from early weakness to end up Dollars  1/4 at
Dollars 57 1/2 on news of a 21.5 per cent improvement in earnings to Dollars
420m.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed steady in moderate trading which was boosted by a
block trade of about 5.5m Geddes Resources rights.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 lost 4.11 points, or 0.12per cent, to
3,404.67. Declines led advances by 279 to 232 and volume of 28,883,000
shares was above the previous 16,742,000 shares.
Trading value rose to CDollars 302.9m from CDollars 186.7m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX losses at Louis Newmark, the maker of electrical, mechanical
engineering and specialist equipment, were reduced from Pounds 1.07m to
Pounds 980,000 in the year to April 4.
The result came on lower turnover of Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 36.6m), which
reflected the loss of the Swatch agency and was after depreciation of Pounds
1.16m (Pounds 1.6m).
Losses per share were 29.9p (34.8p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holmes Protection, the US security company with a UK listing, said
shareholders had taken up a very small proportion of new shares on offer as
part of its debt restructuring.
Of 25.5m shares on offer at a price, after share consolidation, of 62 1/2 p,
only 825,355 were taken up. The balance has gone to institutions, the
company's previous lenders and Sir Ian MacGregor, the chairman.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Canary Wharf offer considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LEWIS RANIERI, the Wall Street investor, has emerged as a partner of Mr
Larry Tisch, the media billionaire, in a possible bid for Canary Wharf, the
east London property development.
The two investors, who expect to receive backing from investment funds, have
offered to provide the Pounds 300m needed to complete the initial phases of
Canary Wharf and find tenants for offices.
Their offer will be discussed tomorrow by 11 commercial bank lenders to the
project, which have provided Pounds 576m in commercial bank loans. Mr Tisch
and Mr Ranieri are putting pressure on the banks to decide.
Though Canary Wharf is being managed by administrators from Ernst &amp; Young
under insolvency legislation, the final decision on the future ownership of
Europe's biggest office development will be made by the banks, which include
Barclays and Lloyds.
Mr Paul Reichmann, who created Canary Wharf as founder of Olympia &amp; York,
the Canadian property developer, persuaded Mr Ranieri and Mr Tisch to become
potential investors. If their bid is successful, they would expect O&amp;Y to
continue managing the project.
Under the terms of the Tisch/Ranieri offer, the banks would be repaid
nothing until the new investors had earned a return on their Pounds 300m.
A banker said yesterday that the banks are split on what to do about the
offer: 'A third believe we should examine it slowly, a third think we should
accept it and a third think we should reject it'.
However, Mr Tisch and Mr Ranieri have hinted that they will withdraw if they
do not receive strong encouragement. Some bankers are concerned that if the
offer is rejected, there is a risk that Canary Wharf will go into
liquidation.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BA climbs to Pounds 91m and meets City
expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY COST cutting helped British Airways achieve a first-quarter recovery
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 91m.
The comparable figure of Pounds 9m was depressed by the aftermath of the
Gulf war.
Profits for the opening quarter, to end-June, were in line with analysts'
expectations with further growth held back by poor sales of first and
business class seats. BA shares fell 8p to 253p.
Lord King, chairman, said bookings for the second quarter 'indicated
continued strength in demand, though passenger yields would continue to
reflect pressures associated with the strength of sterling and depressed
premium demand, with the economies of several major markets remaining
difficult.
'The airline is on track to achieve its planned Pounds 150m in cost savings
in this, the second phase of its three-year gap closure programme.' Last
year the programme saved Pounds 265m.
Turnover in the first quarter rose to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.26bn), helped
by a 15.5 per cent rise in passenger numbers. Most of this recovery was
accounted for by growth in economy ticket sales.
The passenger load factor - a closely examined industry measure of how full
aircraft are - rose from 69.1 per cent to 71.6 per cent. However, the
revenue per passenger fell 6.5 per cent, reflecting poor sales of higher
priced tickets and increased competition in fares, especially across the
North Atlantic.
BA generated Pounds 93m in cash after covering financing charges and
spending on fixed assets and investments. This helped cut debt to Pounds
991m - down Pounds 181m on the March year-end - and left gearing five
percentage points lower at 37 per cent.
The interest charge fell from Pounds 35m to Pounds 8m, helped by lower
interest rates, the weakening dollar and off-balance sheet financing of
aircraft purchases.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were 8.4p, against 1.4p a year
earlier.
Cargo traffic suffered from the economic recession and excess capacity in
the market, said the company. BA increased its cargo capacity by 11.5 per
cent over 1991, but the weight of cargo carried fell and revenues were
unchanged at Pounds 98m. By contrast, the company increased passenger
capacity by 13.1 per cent and saw revenues from scheduled passenger services
rise to Pounds 1.13bn from Pounds 1.03bn.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi back in the black with Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI, the advertising company, yesterday reported a return to
profit with a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 11.1m for the first half of 1992.
That compared with a loss of Pounds 32m for the corresponding period of
1991.
Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive, said it was the first time the
company had made a profit since he joined at the start of 1990. 'It is nice
to be in the black,' he said.
The group's shares rose 5p to 136p on the news although that was still well
below the 175 1/2 p equivalent price at which Mr Louis-Dreyfus invested
Dollars 3m of his own money on joining the group. He said it was 'the worst
financial investment I have made in my life'. He has already announced plans
to leave in June next year.
The chief executive said the group, which completed a recapitalisation
including a Pounds 60m share issue in March last year, was now on a stable
financial footing. He added that it was not planning to raise any new funds.
Net debt was Pounds 185m at the period end, and there were Pounds 26m of
earnouts to be met. Mr Louis-Dreyfus said he expected it would be 1995
before the group could pay a dividend. He pointed out that revenues were
showing no underlying growth, and he expected them to be similar to last
year, excluding currency movements. Revenues in the half year were Pounds
354.7m (Pounds 352.8m).
That was despite the loss of some large clients in 1991 such as the
Northwest Airlines account. Mr Louis-Dreyfus said that the second half of
the year would suffer from the loss in the UK of Rover, the motor group.
However, in the Far East, accounts worth nearly Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m)
had been won recently.
Trading profits were Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 10.6m) showing an improvement in
margins from 3 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Mr Louis-Dreyfus revealed that
group margins were targeted to reach 10 per cent by the end of 1994. 'There
is no reason today we will not get there with flat revenues'.
Staff numbers had fallen from 13,000 in 1991 to 12,300 currently, and a
further 100 jobs could go in the second half through natural wastage. First
half severance costs amounted to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 6.3m). Interest charges
were Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 14.6m) and there was an exceptional profit of
Pounds 1.9m (loss Pounds 28m after restatement in line with the 1991
accounts).
Earnings per share were 0.7p (losses 55.6p). There were extraordinary
charges of Pounds 9.4m relating to goodwill written off on the sale of YCS.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Polly Peck finds buyer for fruit side: Hopes for creditors
as Mexican group pays Dollars 499m for Del Monte Fresh Produce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MAINLY Mexican investor group has agreed to pay Dollars 499m (Pounds 260m)
in cash for PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce, the fresh fruit side of Polly Peck
International, the fruit and electronics conglomerate which collapsed in
October 1990.
The deal represents the last hope of securing a large amount of cash to pay
the group's 23,000 creditors. Sources close to the group's administration
said it still seemed likely that most creditors would only get a payment of
between 3p and 11p in the pound.
The investor consortium is led by Grupo Cabal of Florida, the holding
company of Mr Carlos Cabal which holds a controlling interest in Banco BCH,
the eighth largest commercial bank in Mexico.
Grupo Cabal, a diversified business group, is already a leading producer of
bananas in south-east Mexico.
Other members of the consortium include Nacional Financiera, the Mexican
government development bank with assets of Dollars 20bn, and other strategic
investors. Nacional Financiera may put up around 10 per cent of the total.
Mr Harold Schenker, executive vice-president of PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit
Company, said he was happy with the deal, which would be closed 'in a couple
of months'.
Mr Schenker said that when Del Monte was put up for sale, there had been
'more than 10 bidders', but that towards the end the number of finalists had
been 'less than five'. Of these, some were investor groups and some were
fruit companies.
The administrators, who abandoned long-standing plans to float part of PPI
Del Monte on the New York Stock Exchange in the spring amid worsening
conditions in the banana market, were advised on the sale by Goldmann Sachs
International.
The price paid by Grupo Cabal is well below the Dollars 875m paid by Polly
Peck for PPI Del Monte three years ago, but that figure included nine ships
which were subsequently sold off.
The management and structure of PPI Del Monte will remain 'unchanged and
intact' after the sale, Mr Schenker said.
The company is the second largest marketer of pineapples in the world and
the third largest banana marketer. Its annual turnover is a 'bit under
Dollars 1bn', Mr Cabal said.
The sale of Del Monte may now open the way for the administrators to resolve
the future of the remaining parts of the group.

FT  12 AUG 92 / UBS P&amp;D warns head of research over book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the leading City securities house, has asked the head
of its UK research department to cancel publication of a book which is
critical of the accounting techniques used by many of the UK's biggest
companies.
Mr Terry Smith, one of the best-known analysts in the City, has been told by
senior P&amp;D executives that his future at the firm is in doubt if the book is
published. P&amp;D did not comment on the dispute yesterday.
Mr Smith yesterday met Mr Rudi Mueller, head of the UK operations of Union
Bank of Switzerland, the biggest Swiss bank and owner of P&amp;D.
The book, called 'Accounting for Growth', is an expanded version of research
published by P&amp;D in January 1991, which highlighted a number of accounting
techniques used by companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or
minimise the level of borrowings shown on their balance sheets.
In the book, due to be published in mid-September, Mr Smith highlights 12
commonly used accounting techniques with the following characteristics:
They may allow a company to declare a profit, even though there is no cash
being generated.
They may allow a company to generate a profit at the expense of the strength
of the balance sheet.
They may tend to disguise the extent of a company's exposure to borrowings.
Mr Smith examined the accounts of the UK's 200 biggest quoted companies to
see which were using the techniques. He stresses in the book that there is
no implication of any impropriety if a company uses any of the techniques.
P&amp;D has been embarrassed by reports about the book, which appeared in the
Mail on Sunday newspaper, and Accountancy Age, the specialist periodical.
These articles highlighted Grand Metropolitan as the company which used more
of these accounting techniques than any other.
Grand Met, which has a banking relationship with UBS, was so annoyed that
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of the drinks and foods group, contacted Mr
Mueller to complain about the articles.
A spokesman for Grand Met said yesterday that P&amp;D had assured Grand Met that
the book represented Mr Smith's private opinions and not those of P&amp;D.
However, the draft dust-jacket of the book contains the UBS P&amp;D logo.
Investment institutions, polled by the financial news group Extel, voted the
original P&amp;D research as the best piece of analysis produced in 1991.

FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom had good reasons for giving way to the regulator Oftel. The
pricing regime of inflation minus 7.5 per cent is tough, but with BT's scope
for cost savings, not impossibly so. Given that, the risk of going to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was simply too great. The market may now
take heart from the stability this agreement will bring. In current
conditions even reduced earnings prospects can seem attractive when combined
with a strong balance sheet.
There is also much to be said for leaving others to fight your battles.
Privatised companies may feel that regulation is becoming too autocratic and
interventionist, but they can rely on such issues being raised by the MMC's
investigation of British Gas. The differing routes chosen by BT and British
Gas highlight which can more easily cope with pricing restrictions.

FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was almost inevitable that British Airways' first quarter profits should
bounce back sharply from last year when business was still severely
depressed by the Gulf war. Less easy to foresee was the 6.5 per cent drop in
yield per passenger kilometre. BA has not only suffered a shortfall in
premium fares from business and first class passengers, it has been
discounting to boost economy class volumes.
The upshot may be an increase in market share, but the strategy also makes
BA particularly dependent on its ability to trim its expenses. Since
yesterday's figures also show it on track to cut costs by Pounds 150m in the
current year, the market may have been a little negative in marking the
shares down by 3 per cent. The need for discounting should abate quite
quickly when economic recovery does eventually come. Even if this takes
until well into next year, the chances are BA's economy programme will
continue to pay off meanwhile.

FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: De Beers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A diamond may be forever, but not alas a dividend. De Beers' announcement
that it will reduce its final dividend substantially shows the recession has
not left the Byzantine world of diamond dealing untouched. That would be
unsurprising, had not the company's chairman, Mr Julian Ogilvy Thompson,
given an upbeat assessment of prospects only three months ago. The 6 per
cent fall in De Beers' shares reflects how far the market has been
wrong-footed. His credibility has been dented.
The company may have been rash to rely on optimistic projections of the
world economy, but the problems with the diamond market run a little deeper.
De Beers' decision to defer purchases of 25 per cent of the diamonds for
which it is contracted reflects the strain facing the cartel which it runs
through the Central Selling Organisation.
Mopping up illicit diamonds from Angola has proved expensive, and one of the
beauties of the cartel's marketing operation is its ability to spread the
misery around producers. This will clearly be unpopular. Besides saving
cash, cutting the dividend may make the reduction in diamond purchases more
palatable to cartel members outside South Africa. The company should be able
to contain any leakage of diamonds from the cartel, but it is hard not to
conclude that part of De Beers' difficulty is of its own making.

FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The equity market could not quite decide how to take yesterday's mortgage
increase by the Skipton Building Society. Initial alarm gave way to relief
that other larger lenders would not immediately follow suit. That may yet
prove to be optimistic. The Skipton's move is a harsh reminder that
competitive pressures in the retail savings market are still strong despite
two cuts in National Savings rates .
The risk remains of other societies being forced to raise rates. If this
does not happen, some damage must already have been done. Mere talk of
possible higher rates seems calculated to depress further housing market
confidence. As confidence ebbs, the government looks even more boxed in. It
could not after all reduce National Savings rates a third time without a
truly embarrassing loss of face.
Nor does the foreign exchange market relish reminders of the government's
acute desire to avoid a mortgage rate increase. Each such reminder only
serves to dilute its faith in the authorities' determination to raise
interest rates if necessary to defend sterling. Perhaps it is just as well
that, for yesterday at least, exchange dealers had the distraction of
concerted intervention in support of the dollar to keep their attention away
from sterling.

FT  12 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: GA's preferred option
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident's announcement that it will follow Commercial Union into
the preference share market underlines the gaping hole blown by recession in
the balance sheet of the UK insurance industry. An issue of perhaps Pounds
150m should be feasible given GA's excellent connections among Scots
institutions, many of which are increasing holdings of fixed-interest
securities. This would improve GA's solvency margin by around 5 percentage
points. Yet the margin fell by that amount in the last eight months alone.
With an investment portfolio delivering little or no growth, no retained
earnings to rely on and the cost of maintaining an uncovered dividend, GA is
running just to stand still. The uncut interim pay-out drained Pounds 43m
from net assets in the first half alone. A slug of preference capital would
certainly improve the odds in favour of the dividend being maintained from
here on. More than anything this may explain yesterday's 2 per cent rise in
the share price.
However, yesterday's interim results also suggest that GA has reached the
turn at an operating level. The biggest concern must be that profitability
is so far being restored at the expense of market share. UK premium income
in the first half was virtually unchanged over last year, despite sharply
higher rates on some lines of business. A sceptic might question the wisdom
of shedding so much business at the bottom of the cycle. One suspects that
GA is only too aware of the conflict. A preference issue may give it
breathing space to preserve market share until conditions improve.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Bush urges go-ahead for Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees to
Israel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE transformation in relations between the US and Israeli governments was
officially sealed yesterday with President George Bush 'enthusiastically'
recommending that Congress grant Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan
guarantees to the Jewish state.
Mr Bush described his two-day meeting with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister, as 'a consultation between close friends and strategic partners'.
The US relationship with Israel was characterised by 'trust, warmth and a
commitment to meeting common challenges. This is strategic co-operation at
its very best,' said Mr Bush, who reaffirmed the US undertaking to maintain
Israel's qualitative military edge over its neighbours.
After the press conference outside Mr Bush's holiday home at Kennebunkport,
the two leaders flew to Washington where Mr Bush was due to seek
congressional approval for the loan guarantees, needed by Israel to finance
housing for immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
The administration had refused an earlier request from the government of Mr
Yitzhak Shamir, defeated in the June general election, until Israel stopped
building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories.
Mr Bush praised Mr Rabin's approach to the issue and said that it had taken
a lot of courage to impose a ban on new Jewish housing in the territories.
The president declined to give details of the loan guarantees deal but said
discussions had gone beyond broad outlines. He was convinced the agreement
was not just in Israel's interest but also that of the US people.
Mr Bush said he had also been persuaded by Mr Rabin of the new Israeli
government's determination to make Middle East peace negotiations succeed.
'I call upon the Arab parties to respond in kind,' Mr Bush said. 'The time
has come to make peace, not simply to talk of it.'
Peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are
due to resume in Washington on August 24 when Israel is expected to make a
series of proposals for granting the Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza a
degree of autonomy.
Criticised for his cautious approach to the Bosnian crisis and challenged by
President Saddam Hussein's partial rejection of UN ceasefire resolutions, Mr
Bush clearly revelled in yesterday's opportunity to demonstrate a foreign
policy success.
Mr Rabin praised Mr Bush's leadership during the Gulf war and expressed
personal gratitude to Mr Bush for helping Jews emigrate from Ethiopia and
the Soviet Union.
But he also reminded Mr Bush of Israel's concern over the human tragedy in
Bosnia. 'The killing must stop,' he said.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Shenzhen agrees on more share issues after riots
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY INVESTORS were yesterday promised by officials in the southern Chinese
city of Shenzhen that they would get another chance to enter a lottery for
new share issues after China's worst civil unrest since Tiananmen Square.
Trading on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange - China's first stock market which
opened in December 1990 - was suspended for both local and foreign investors
after rioting on Monday night over alleged corruption in allocating share
application forms.
Exchange officials said they hoped to re-open the market today - when the
local bottler of Pepsi Cola, Shebao, is due to be listed. China's other
exchange, Shanghai, suffered an 11 per cent fall in prices of shares
reserved for Chinese yesterday.
China's cabinet met in emergency session in Beijing to discuss the riots and
extra police were drafted in to Shenzhen to keep order. Mr Lau Gan, the
cabinet secretary, was reported to have been sent to Shenzhen to assess the
causes of the riot.
Late last night, thousands of frustrated, weary people still stood in queues
outside two banks in the city centre. Riot police swinging wooden clubs
charged the crowds several times while other police dragged suspected queue
jumpers out of the crowd and beat them.
The outbreak of civil unrest has come at a delicate time for those in the
Chinese leadership who advocate further economic reforms.
A congress of the Communist party, which is widely expected to endorse plans
for fast implementation of reforms promoted by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior
leader, will be convened in the autumn. The riot may be used by those
opposed to the reforms to show the destabilising effects of market-oriented
policies.
Deng praised the Shenzhen market during a visit in January, but said that if
the experiment did not work it could be closed.
The rioting, which continued into the early hours yesterday, was the worst
civil strife since pro-democracy demonstrators occupied Beijing's Tiananmen
Square in June 1989.
Over the weekend, an estimated 1m people flocked to the city to apply to
join a lottery for new shares. Unsuccessful investors rampaged through the
city. Demonstrators carried placards alleging corruption in the distribution
of 5m application forms for the lottery for new share issues.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Letter: Cyprus not a 'poorer' applicant for EC entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL EROTOKRITOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Both preceding and in the wake of the recent Lisbon Summit of the EC
there have been a number of reports in the Financial Times relating to EC
enlargement. In these reports we see the dangerous tendency to lump together
existing and potential EC applicants in certain entry baskets. We read that
the 'Efta states' are likely to be the next batch of members of the EC and
that 'the three poorer southern countries' of Turkey, Cyprus and Malta will
have to continue to do time in the EC's waiting room. The former socialist
countries of eastern Europe are also bracketed together over the timing of
their possible entry into the EC.
In Cyprus we consider that it is more appropriate to examine the case of
each EC applicant state on its own individual merits. In terms of economic
development both Cyprus and Malta cannot be considered poor. An examination
of the income statistics in the 1992 World Development Report of the World
Bank shows Cyprus with per capita GNP of more than USDollars 8,000 in 1990
compared with USDollars 6,610 for Malta and USDollars 1,630 for Turkey.
Furthermore, the per capita income of Cyprus is considerably in excess of
that of two existing EC members, namely Greece and Portugal, with per capita
GNPs of USDollars 5,990 and USDollars 4,900, respectively, in 1990.
We would add that the flourishing and sound economy of Cyprus is based on
the twin pillars of a strong market-oriented system and a pluralistic
democracy.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Each-way bets in the market' (August 1) states '. . . the
hints in this country from the new director-general of the CBI and the
chairman of ICI, to take the two most prestigious examples, suggest
realignment or even a return to independent floating (of the pound) as
preferable'.
Certainly I have called for concerted action within the ERM to secure lower
interest rates. But at no time have I advocated floating the pound, or
supported a unilateral devaluation of sterling. Indeed, all recent CBI

FT  12 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Camp David revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT A difference an election makes. Less than two months ago, the leaders
of the US and Israel were barely on speaking terms, and President George
Bush was punishing what he saw as intransigence on the part of Mr Yitzhak
Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, by withholding Dollars 10bn in US loan
guarantees.
Yesterday at the presidential summer home in Maine, Mr Bush and Mr Shamir's
Labour successor, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, gave a vivid demonstration of how much
has changed since the latter's election victory in late June. Amid
extravagant expressions of mutual affection, Mr Rabin evidently convinced Mr
Bush that he is committed to making a success of the next round of Middle
East peace talks, due to commence in Washington on August 24, and Mr Bush
responded by promising to press Congress to release the loan guarantees.
For good measure, Mr Rabin even gave President Bush's flagging re-election
campaign a fillip by praising his leadership in the Gulf war.
The change is more than atmospheric. Mr Shamir was a genuine obstacle to the
peace process that Mr Bush and his secretary of state, Mr James Baker, have
expended so much effort on. In the past six weeks, Mr Rabin's centre-left
coalition has done much to prepare the way for progress: he has frozen
almost all new Jewish settlement activity in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, and has promised to engage in intensive negotiations on
interim self-rule for their Palestinian inhabitants. Circumstances have not
been set so fair for some form of new Israeli-Arab understanding since the
1978 Camp David accords negotiated between Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and
Anwar Sadat.
Rapid progress
President Bush himself has good political reasons to want to secure rapid
progress in the Middle East. In the eyes of the American public, the failure
to make headway with Arab-Israeli talks has tarnished the US victory in the
Gulf war; at a time when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is still taunting Mr
Bush from Baghdad and Washington seems at a loss over Bosnia, any prospect
of foreign policy success will be gratefully seized. If the prize can be
achieved in a way that improves Mr Bush's standing with the influential US
Jewish community, as yesterday's love-in certainly will, so much the better.
This represents, in Mr Henry Kissinger's phrase, a 'window of necessity' for
all sides - not least for the Arabs. Palestinians' suspicions may be aroused
by the sudden US-Israeli rapprochement, but it is they who have most to gain
from exploiting the new Israeli flexibility that underlies it. That
essentially means being realistic about what they can obtain at this stage
of the process.
More limited
As Mr Rabin has repeatedly made clear, there is no question of his current
government offering a land-for-peace deal as such. What may be available is
something much more limited - a transitional arrangement on Palestinian
autonomy as provided for at Camp David, and an understanding that the
territories' final status is to be negotiated after a specified number of
years.
Even this much will be very difficult to agree. However far and fast his
left-wing coalition partners want to go, Mr Rabin feels constrained by his
desire to carry with him mainstream Israeli opinion and to keep opposition
from Jewish settlers to the margins. The Israeli and Palestinian definitions
of autonomy will be so different as to be mutually unrecog-nisable.
And however strongly Mr Bush may want the talks to succeed, some of the
external impetus behind the negotiations may be lost if, as is widely
expected, Mr Baker steps down as secretary of state to take charge of the
presidential campaign.
That the talks have reached this point is thanks to American pressure as
much as to growing realism among Arabs and Israelis. But America is not
going to be there holding the reins, or holding Israel's hand, for ever; the
US election campaign itself illustrates how domestic concerns have come to
the fore. All the more reason, then, for the parties themselves to demand
that the talks restart in a brisk and decisive fashion.

If you have been out of the country for a few years, tonight provides a
chance to catch up on what you missed on television. BBC1 shows a repeat
episode of Lovejoy (8.00), the series about a canny antique dealer. BBC2
repeats an episode of Rough Guide To Careers (7.30) covering money jobs:
accountant, croupier, and so on. It also repeats the 'ScreenPlay' drama
Journey To Knock (9.00) which contrives to squeeze laughs out of miracle

ITV screens repeats of the top-rated, slushy The Darling Buds of May (8.00)

Evening's best bet, if last week's programme is any guide, will be BBC2's

FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Hush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Court is going through an exciting period. Give it a few months
more and we might see it has led a change in fashion, just as it did in the
second half of the 1950s.
There are two recent big successes behind it. The Court pioneered Ariel
Dorfman's Death and the Maiden, which continues to run in the West End and
has won awards around the world. It also brought to London John Guare's Six
Degrees of Separation, which likewise filled the house and moved elsewhere.
Now it has come up with Hush by April de Angelis, the key to which lies in
its title.
The common theme between Dorfman's play and Six Degrees is that they are
about ambiguities, not certainties. No one in Death and the Maiden is quite
sure what to do about the excesses of the past as a country moves from
dictatorship to at least limited democracy. In Six Degrees no one is certain
how to handle an imposter who happens to be black.
Hush acknowledges the dilemmas of trying to come to terms with a world
without fixed sign-posts. It is one of the first pieces I have seen by a
British playwright that admits how much the world has changed since the
collapse of communism, and tries to look forward to an unknown future rather
than back to the supposed certainties of the past. It has become
permissible, even at the Royal Court, to poke fun at the once fashionable
left.
As one of the characters says: 'This is an amazing time, an amazing time to
be living in. Huge empires are breaking up. It's like the end of the ice
age. Watching the ice cracking. All warm blooded species rejoice]' Those
lines are spoken by a writer, Tony, who was probably always more of a
liberal than a Marxist. Yet that is where the novelty of the play lies. If
socialism is dead, can liberalism survive? The piece is called Hush because
the question requires a pause for thought and prolonged, quiet discussion.
The theatre has not approached such a new frontier for a very long time.
Otherwise, the play is set in more conventional Royal Court terms. A
15-year-old girl is being ( playfully) buried on a beach. The girl
subsequently demands, and gets, sex, from a character called Dogboy. He then
practically turns canine and, having killed his dog, kills himself. Another
girl, temporarily employed as the house cleaner, wants to go off to Tibet to
meet the monks, there not being enough sex on the beach at home.
Do not be put off by such old hat. Beneath the attempts to shock is a new
voice trying to get out. Dogboy, played by Andy Serkis, is a reminder of the
old question of what you do about people who don't quite fit: throw them
out, try to be nice to them or send them to the social security? Tony, the
liberal writer, played by Stephen Delane, finally gives him money and the
social security telephone number. 'Throw your weight about,' he says.
'Demand to see the manager.' But it does not stop the suicide.
Another plus about the Royal Court nowadays: everything is remarkably
well-staged and acted. Hush, directed by Max Stafford-Clark and designed by
Sally Jacobs, makes the playing area seem much bigger than it is. The piece
has its faults, notably the character Colin who simply wanders off, but it
certainly points in new directions.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH National Ballet is showing its production of Ashton's Romeo and
Juliet on the South Bank this week. The staging does not, I feel, do any
service to the choreographer's memory.
Created for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955, the year before the Bolshoy
Ballet revealed the power of its monumental Romeo on a first visit to the
West, Ashton's version is domestic in scale, oddly lacking in passion. As
presented by the Royal Danes, it had a sweetness and modesty which might,
generously, be described as lyrical.
Piously revived in 1985 for ENB (20 years after it had dropped from the
Copenhagen repertory) it looked something of a revenant - pale, and a bit
tremulous. In this latest restoration to the Festival Hall's stage, it
nowhere convinces us of the lovers' tragedy - or of Ashton's genius.
Ashton treated of love's many guises in his ballets. He could fix physical
passion - remember Marguerite and Armand - as he could explore tenderest
romance (in Two Pigeons), show us ecstasy (in Daphnis), love unwise (in A
Month in the Country) or sorrowful (in Ondine).
In no work did he seem uncertain in portraying feeling - save in this Romeo,
whose emotions appear constrained by the rules of an academic style.
Conventional mime, conventional attitudes, even conventional steps, are like
brakes upon the tragedy's momentum. And from a master of dramatic structure,
the plotting of the story, the pacing of incident, lack Ashtonian subtlety.
What might justify the ballet for our time - but has been absent from any
ENB performance I have seen since the company acquired the version - is
lambent interpretation of the lovers.
There are moments when one thinks of what Fonteyn might have made of this
Juliet (far better suited to her gifts than the MacMillan production), or
how Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell might have shaped the duets. But
given with ENB's un-stellar casting, the piece has an even more papery look
to it.
On Monday night Jose Manuel Carreno made a debut as Romeo, and dealt
honourably enough with his task, albeit passion seemed in short supply.
Rebecca Sewell was his Juliet, also a newcomer. Her reading was carefully
prepared, innocent, in a role which can only come alive with a ballerina of
more secure gifts.
It was Tim Almaas as Mercutio who showed the panache, and assurance of
style, to give character any theatrical resonance. It is one of the best
things that Almaas has done with the company. For the rest, the guests and
townspeople scampered and wore attractive Peter Rice costumes with a will.
But it was none of it much like Romeo and Juliet.
English National Ballet presents Ashton's Romeo and Juliet, Royal Festival
Hall until August 15, (071) 928 8800.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: James MacMillan - London Promenade Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND time the Proms have played host to a James MacMillan premiere; and
a second time the work has stirred its audience to roof-raising enthusiasm.
Two years ago it was the orchestral work The Confessions of Isobel Gowdie,
given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra; on Monday it was Veni, veni
Emmanuel, the percussion concerto written for Evelyn Glennie and the
Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
But whereas the 1990 Proms triumph took the larger musical world by
surprise, Monday's was predicted (and preceded by a wave of publicity).
MacMillan's appeal is cheering. The young Scot (b. 1959), a devout Catholic,
nationalist and socialist, does not compromise his artistic goals, does not
soften his idiom or his 'committed' stance. Yet in Isobel Gowdie and now in
Veni, veni Emmanuel, he seems to have found a musical voice that speaks
vigorously, passionately and above all directly to a wide public.
The new concerto, about 25 minutes long, is a sure, confident, expertly
engineered piece of soloist-versus-orchestra showmanship, which draws its
peculiar dramatic energy from the brilliance - whirlwind and
will-o'-the-wisp by turns - of Glennie's virtuosity.
Since the impact of the work is cunningly devised in visual as well as
instrumental terms - MacMillan sends his soloist to different 'stations' of
the vast percussion armoury at key sections of the musical development - it
is good that BBC2 was there to record the premiere for a forthcoming relay.
It is also an ambitious examination of religious faith in music, whose
thematic substratum, an Advent plainsong hymn, rises, finally and with
strong significance, to the musical surface. In the words of MacMillan's
programme note, this process may be understood as a 'musical exploration of
the theology behind the Advent message'.
The same note later hints that the exploration is also deeply concerned with
the ideas of liberation theology. This suggestion finds confirmation in the
form and sound-evolution of the piece, a 'five-sectioned arch' in which
successive phases of aggressive and then more inwardly-turned confrontation
between sounds beaten and sounds blown or bowed achieve a final ringing
reconciliation. (Literally: as the soloist climbs a ladder to strike key
patterns on a set of tubular bells, the string players exchange their
instruments for hand-bells.)
Veni, veni, Emmanuel arrests attention from the first downbeat. MacMillan's
harmonic signalling and underpinning are lucid. His gestures are graphic in
vividness, focused in purpose, powerful yet economical in musculature.
The directionality of the work - its modulation from fast to slow and back
again - is achieved by means at once 'popular' (rock-inherited contrasts of
blunt phrases and fiercely bright, hard-edged textures) and carefully
organised (rhythmic patterns of Rite of Spring complexity).
Messiaen, the 20th-century's great master of Catholic mysticism in music,
seems to hover over the central, tonally ambiguous slow dialogue between
musing marimba and quietly repetitive string chords.
For my taste, the ending flushes out an un-Messiaen-like quality that I
sense running throughout the work - a cumulative preference for gesturally
achieved 'uplift' over discourse hard-worked and hard-won. Is 'facile' too
forceful an epithet to describe that quality? In any case, a second hearing,
at the very least, is needed to confirm or deny the suspicion - and
meanwhile, the memory of Glennie's scintillating performance is ample
compensation.
The conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste, should also be praised for the
fighting-fit precision of the SCO ensemble. A brief, reproachful mention
only of the Beethoven First Symphony that opened the concert, all brutal
accents, driven phrases, avoidance of lyricism and wit; and a word of regret
at the worn sound (at the top especially) of Kathleen Kuhlmann's once
velvety mezzo in two Rossini arias.
James MacMillan's concerto was commissioned with funds from Christian
Salvesen PLC

FT  12 AUG 92 / Tim Waterstone: 'a perfect conclusion'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Waterstone, founder of the eponymous bookstore chain which is now
controlled by WH Smith, is staying on the board for a further year until May
1994 - after Smiths buys out his remaining shares next May - in order to
develop the American market.
Alan Giles, yesterday named as Tim Waterstone's successor, joins Waterstones
next month, on the tenth anniversary of the opening of the first Old
Brompton Road branch, for a period to be spent getting his feet under the
table before he takes over officially as chief executive next February.
Waterstone, 53, will then move to New York to ensure his name 'is not used
in America inaccurately'. The first store, opened in Boston in October, is
thriving,
and another located by Chicago's Water Tower is the next, set to open in
November.
'We are taking it brick by brick,' says Waterstone, who first got to know
Smiths from another side of the fence; he was dismissed as head of the
group's US operations in 1981. 'That was book distribution,' he points out
now, a very difficult and different business. 'Anyway, this is the perfect
conclusion to that irony.'
Meanwhile, there will be no concessions to American book buying habits.
'Either (the Waterstones style) works or we come home again.' And post 1994?
'I am going to be very busy,' is all he will say.
Giles, who is 38 and has been with the W H Smith Group since 1979, is 'very
well known in the book trade', according to Waterstone, from his time as
general manager of the books and news division of W H Smith books. Just over
three years ago, he moved to Do It All - since formed into an as yet not too
successful joint venture with Boots' Payless. He was latterly operations and
development director.

Berg Sons and Co Ltd and others v Adams and others (FT, July 10)
In the present case, a winding up of the first plaintiff, Berg Sons &amp; Co
Ltd, was made on the petition of a creditor, Union Discount. Both Berg and
Union Discount alleged breach of duties owed to it by Berg's auditors,
relating to an unqualified certificate signed by the auditors which, it was
alleged, failed to give a true picture of the state of affairs of the
company.
In Al Saudi Banque (1991), Ch 313, Mr Justice Millett held that
foreseeability that a lender might rely on audited accounts was not, without
more, enough to establish the duty of care. There had to be a specific
relationship between the function which the auditor was requested to
perform, and the transaction in relation to which the plaintiff said he had
relied on; see also Caparo (1990) 2 AC 630. The statutory audit had a
restricted purpose so that there was also a restriction on the scope of the
duty of care that arose simply from carrying it out.
In the present case the person who had a proprietary interest in the company
and was concerned with its control did not rely on the accounts in order to
further his business activities and the accounts were not a critical factor
for the substantial credits extended to Berg.
The Nicholas H (FT, July 15)
The owners of the cargo carried on Nicholas H began an action against the
shipowners and the Japanese classification society, Nippon Kaiji Kyoshai.
The claim against the owners was settled for Dollars 500,000 (Pounds
261,800) but the action against Nippon was for the sum of Dollars 5.5m for
alleged breach of a duty of care to the cargo-owners. On the facts assumed
for the purposes of the preliminary issue only, it was stated that cracks
had developed in the hull of the vessel and arrangements had been made for
Nippon to survey the vessel at anchor. An initial survey recommended
permanent repairs but only temporary repairs were carried out. The vessel
then continued with its journey on the surveyor's second recommendation but
it sank with all the cargo.
Mr Justice Hirst stated that the proximity criterion for a duty of care in
tort was essential in the present case, particularly since there was such a
wide variety of circumstances where a party not in contractual relationship
with Nippon might seek to establish liability. On the assumed facts there
was a very close degree of proximity between the surveyor and the
cargo-owners. Although there was no direct physical control over the vessel
the decisive influence on the shipowners which the second recommendation
must have had, and would reasonably be foreseen to have, was very akin to
control.
The Depositors' Protection Fund v Dalia and another
(FT, July 16)
To alleviate hardship when a bank became insolvent, the Banking Act 1979 set
up the Depositors' Protection Fund and money from the fund was payable to
depositors on the insolvency of a recognised bank or institution. The fund
was continued under the Banking Act 1987, under which the maximum amount of
a protected deposit was increased to Pounds 20,000. After the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International ceased trading but before it was wound up, BCCI
depositors assigned part of their deposits to family members or close
friends so that each assignee could look to the fund for maximum
compensation payable. The transfers totalled several million pounds with
more than 200 assignees.
Giving judgement for the assignees, the vice-chancellor stated that for
compensation purposes the position was the same as with regard to a
statutory assignee. There was no reason in principle why, for the purposes
of the deposit protection scheme, an assignee of part of a deposit should be
treated any differently from an assignee of the whole.
Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways and another
(FT, July 17)
Kuwait Airways Corporation obtained judgement against Iraqi Airways Co for
delivery of commercial aircraft and damages assessed at Dollars 489.455m.
The case had arisen as a result of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq when six
Kuwaiti civilian aircraft, owned by Kuwait Airways, were flown to Iran and
interned and four other Kuwaiti civilian aircraft were destroyed on the
ground.
Iraqi Airways claimed immunity under section 14 of the State Immunity Act.
However, in refusing a striking-out application, Mr Justice Evans stated
that the scheme of the act was such that a state had no general immunity,
except with regard inter alia to 'commercial transactions'. The government
of Iraq had identified the 10 particular aircraft involved as required for a
civilian operation by Iraq Airways and there was no evidence to justify a
finding that the purpose was governmental rather than commercial. Iraqi
Airways had been incorporated as 'being operated on a profit and loss basis'
under Iraqi law. Moreover, under the Companies Act 1965, a writ had to be
served on an overseas company at its registered address of any place of
business established in Great Britain. In the present case the writ had been
properly served on the accountant of Iraqi Airways as acting manager of its
business at its Regent Street offices in London.
Napier v Kershaw
(FT, July 22)
A Number of Lloyd's Names, who belonged to the Outhwaite syndicate, had
formed an association to claim against RHM Outhwaite Underwriting Agencies
Ltd and members' agents at Lloyd's to recover losses attributable to
allegedly negligent underwriting. Under a settlement in March 1992, Pounds
116m was paid by the Outhwaite defendants to Richards Butler on behalf of
the Names. The defendant stop-loss insurers were joined as representatives
of other Lloyd's syndicates which wrote stop-loss insurance policies for
1982 for individual Names and claimed that the Names were constructive
trustees of the recovery monies, and that the amounts due to to the insurers
were traceable in equity in the monies held by Richards Butler. Dismissing
their appeal in part, the Court of Appeal stated that the intricacies and
doctrines connected with trusts ought not to be introduced in to commercial
transactions. However, in allowing in part the appeal, the Court of Appeal
also stated that the Names had contended that they were entitled to recoup
the excess in each policy out of recoveries. Those contentions were
inconsistent with the agreement that there was to be an excess which was to
be borne by them; the insurers' argument that recovery should be applied
from the top down leaving the excess the last to be recouped, was
preferable.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Penney follows Pimlott to the Takeover Panel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last time that law firm Lovell White Durrant seconded one of its
partners to the City Takeover Panel, it sent Graham Pimlott. Young Pimlott
returned after the statutory two year term, but he was soon on the move
again, first to Kleinwort Benson and then BZW where he now runs the
corporate finance team.
Who knows, if Charles Penney, who has been seconded to the Panel as a
secretary from September 21, plays his cards right he too might emerge as a
leading player on the corporate finance stage.
Penney is the same age (32) as Pimlott was when he was seconded to the Panel
in 1981, and he is one of a number of bright young lawyers of roughly the
same age who have worked in New York as legal assistants. Penney worked
there between 1986 and 1988, overlapping with David Graham of Freshfields,
whom he replaces, and Allen &amp; Overy's Mark Gearing, the other seconded
secretary.
As one of the Panel's eight senior executives, Penney will help referee the
City code on takeovers and mergers which is designed to ensure equality of
treatment and opportunity for all shareholders in takeover bids.
Penney used to work under Pimlott, when the latter returned to White Durrant
in October 1983, but plays down the similarities between them. 'For a start
I can't thump the table as hard as he can,' jokes Penney.

FT  12 AUG 92 / It grows on trees: Biodegradable plastics made from plants
are bearing commercial fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biodegradable plastics are continuing to make commercial and scientific
progress, in the face of scepticism from environmental groups and a
formidable cost disadvantage compared with petrochemical plastics.
ICI, the UK chemical group, has just opened a plant at Billingham in the
north-east of England to make 300 tonnes a year of Biopol, which it says is
the first fully biodegradable commercial plastic. The company plans to raise
annual production of 'Nature's plastic' to 5,000 tonnes by the mid 1990s.
Biopol is made in an industrial fermenter by bacteria that convert sugar
(refined from corn or beet) into a polymer. But US scientists recently
announced an important step towards making biodegradable plastic directly in
plants - raising the vision of farmers growing plastic potatoes in the next
century. Researchers at Michigan State University and James Madison
University in Virginia have made a plastic similar to Biopol in genetically
engineered Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of cress.
At present Biopol costs about Pounds 10 per kilo - 20 times more than
conventional plastic. Although the price will fall as ICI scales up
production, plastic produced in a bacterial fermenter is bound to be much
more expensive than its petrochemical equivalent.
But the US experiments - and similar research being carried out by ICI Seeds
in the UK - could open the way to a cheaper source of biodegradable plastic.
Plants are more efficient than bacteria at producing large quantities of
organic material, says Christopher Somerville, professor of botany at MSU,
and the cost could eventually be reduced tenfold by growing Biopol-type
polymers on farms. For example, potatoes might be genetically engineered to
make and store plastics instead of starch in their tubers.
Even at its current price ICI has no shortage of buyers for the limited
amounts of Biopol available. It has been used in Germany since 1990 to make
bottles for Wella's Sanara shampoo.
Biopol's US launch came this year in the form of bottles for Brocato
International's Evanesce shampoo, and the material is being tested by
Creightons Naturally in the UK for cosmetics containers.
Japan has shown particular enthusiasm for Biopol since its introduction
there in 1991 as a container for Ishizawa Kenkyujo's Earthic Alga shampoos
and conditioners. This year three other Japanese hair care companies started
using Biopol containers and next month Kai will introduce a disposable razor
with a Biopol handle. ICI Japan is developing other applications with local
users - for example, Biopol nets to collect edible seaweed.
However, several environmental groups are distinctly unenthusiastic. 'Our
view of biodegradable plastics including Biopol is that they are a red
herring,' says Sarah Finch of Friends of the Earth.
'They give people the wrong message - that it's OK to throw plastics away -
and distract from the real need, which is to recycle plastics,' she adds.
ICI responds that there are many applications of plastic - particularly when
it is mixed closely with other materials - for which recycling is not
practical. Examples include rubbish bags, disposable nappies, and paper
plates and cups coated with thin plastic film. In these cases a material
such as Biopol, which is consumed by micro-organisms in a landfill site,
should have a clear environmental advantage over petrochemical plastics that
last for decades. A Biopol shampoo bottle disappears within two years in a
typical dump, ICI says.
Biodegradability is not the only environmental claim made for Biopol.
Another point is that it is made from renewable resources - sugar refined
from crops - rather than fossil fuels. And Biopol does not have to be thrown
away; it can be recycled or burned cleanly to provide energy in an
incinerator.
Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), the polymer on which Biopol is based, is produced
naturally by a wide range of micro-organisms as an energy store, in the same
way as humans accumulate fat. ICI uses Alcaligenes eutrophus, a common
bacterium, in its fermenter.
Pure PHB is too stiff and brittle for most applications, so ICI adds small
amounts of a simple organic acid to the sugar feedstock, to make the plastic
stronger and more flexible. In technical terms, the bacteria then produce
co-polymers composed mainly of PHB with varying amounts of hydroxyvalerate
(HV).
In this way ICI can produce a range of thermoplastic polymers which can be
processed with conventional techniques to make bottles, mouldings, fibres
and films. High-grade Biopol is being developed for medical applications,
including woven patches for use inside the body to protect tissues from
scarring after surgery; after the wound has healed, enzymes in the blood
dissolve away the patch.
The genetically engineered Arabidopsis plants have so far produced only
small amounts of pure PHB, but Yves Poirier of Michigan State University
believes it will eventually be possible to make a range of PHB-HV
co-polymers directly in crops.
Although PHB-based polymers have set the pace so far, researchers are
developing other biodegradable materials. In the US, for example, Du Pont
and the Battelle Institute are working on plastics based on lactic acid, a
cheap by-product of the dairy industry.
Another approach is to use carbohydrate polymers based on starch. Partially
biodegradable shopping bags are already manufactured from a thin matrix of
conventional polythene filled in with starch. After the bag has been thrown
away, micro-organisms eat away the starch, leaving a flimsy polythene
structure which soon disintegrates. Ferruzzi of Italy and Warner Lambert of
the US are developing fully biodegradable starch-based plastics.
At present, biodegradable plastics represent just a tiny market compared
with conventional petrochemical materials whose production amounts to more
than 100m tonnes per year. But oil and gas prices will rise substantially
over the next 20 years, according to most economists' predictions, and
bio-plastics will become cheaper through a combination of scientific
progress and improved process technology. Farming for plastics could then
grow into a large agribusiness.

FT  12 AUG 92 / A taste of one's own medicine: Chile's olive growers have
challenged the word of one of Europe's green businessmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a far-flung corner of Stephan Schmidheiny's business empire that is
not as green as the Swiss magnate's concern for the environment.
Schmidheiny, founder of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and
voice of enlightened corporations at the Rio Earth Summit, is a leading
shareholder in an iron pellet plant which is destroying the livelihood of
hundreds of farmers in the Huasco Valley of northern Chile.
The valley used to be Chile's leading producer of olives - harvesting some
6,000 tonnes a year, according to local agriculture inspectors - until the
pellet plant was built in 1978. Today, the olive harvest barely reaches
1,000 tonnes.
Standing in the middle of an olive grove planted by his grandfather,
Gregorio Gonzalez points to the cause: the canopies of his sturdy trees are
pitch black. The evergreen leaves are encrusted with iron dust. They leap to
a magnet like pins.
'Our trees are dying,' says Gonzalez. 'The leaves are choking. The dust
withers the flowers. Some years they bear no fruit. In other years, the
olives are so badly stained that we cannot sell them.' Many farmers, he
says, are being forced to uproot their trees, which are sold for firewood.
His warehouse used to hold up to 100 tonnes of olives. It is almost empty
now. In a neighbouring hacienda, Julio Cereceda, the foreman, says: 'The
owners employ us out of charity. The olive trees are barren.'
Yet several years passed before farmers linked their dwindling harvests to
the smoking chimneys of the pellet plant. 'The company denied it was
emitting iron dust,' says Gonzalez. 'It said the iron came from the
sand-dunes.' Lacking scientific evidence to prove the contrary, the farmers
lost a lawsuit brought against Compania Minera del Pacifico (CMP), the owner
of the plant, in 1986.
The dispute resurfaced with Chile's return to democracy, which brought a
novel concern for the environment. In March 1990, the Mining Research
Council began monitoring emissions at the plant. It was belching more than
37 tonnes of particulate matter, mainly iron dust, a day.
If the plant were located in the US, it would have been breaching
Environmental Protection Agency norms more than 50 times over. But the
dearth of environmental legislation in Chile allowed CMP to claim that it
was not polluting the valley.
The new political leaders also had to deal with CMP's economic clout. The
company is not coy about its importance as the main employer and benefactor
in an impoverished province on the fringes of the Atacama desert. 'The
Huasco valley lives off CMP,' Luis Villagran, CMP's public relations
officer, explains. 'We pay Dollars 24m (Pounds 12.5m) a year in wages. We
are everywhere, donating ambulances, fire engines, building schools and
sports grounds.'
But when Carlos Gonzalez, the new regional governor, first approached CMP
about the need to curb emissions, he says the company threatened to close
down the plant. Meanwhile, Gregorio Gonzalez was preparing to aim his
slingshot at the Goliath of his valley. New evidence, from a study conducted
by the Agriculture Research Council, proved that CMP's iron emissions were
the same substances that fell on the olive groves.
The Huasco farmers filed an injunction against CMP's polluting activities.
An appeals court last June found CMP guilty of 'polluting the environment .
. . inhibiting the normal development of plant life, and the main farming
activity, olive growing, in particular.' It ruled that CMP's emissions
violated the olive growers' constitutional right to live in a pollution-free
environment. It declared the emissions illegal.
CMP, and its parent company, Compania de Aceros del Pacifico (Pacific Steel
Company), in which Schmidheiny owns a 30 per cent stake, appealed against
the ruling before the Chilean Supreme Court. CMP argued it had curbed
emissions since monitoring began two years ago. The company also claimed to
have studies showing that poor farming techniques were responsible for the
shrinking olive harvests.
Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the olive growers. CMP will
be forced to curb its emissions drastically in line with new regulations
that come into effect in October. 'It is absurd,' says Fernando Dougnac, the
farmers' lawyer, 'that we had to fight all the way to the Supreme Court to
prove that companies in Chile do not always practise what they preach.'
The ruling also sets a precedent for other agricultural communities who feel
threatened by the proximity of mining smelters and refineries. 'We believe
in sustainable development,' says Erick Weber, CMP's research and
development vice-president. 'But the farmers are not interested in technical
solutions, they are after monetary compensation.'
The farmers are indeed preparing a civil action for damages of Dollars 35m
against CMP. They are eager to test one of Schmidheiny's maxims, often
mouthed by his executives in Chile: 'The polluter pays'.

FT  12 AUG 92 / Management: Madonnas in retreat - Opportunities for women
are shrinking fast in cash-strapped Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, the success of the Iron Butterfly, Miss Takako Doi, the
Socialist Party leader, created a 'Madonna Boom' in Japanese politics, with
parties rushing to enlist women candidates and the country debating when the
first woman prime minister would be appointed.
Corporate Japan had its own Madonna Boom, as image-conscious companies
commissioned advertisements that portrayed strong women talking on cellular
phones or putting in overtime long after the men had left for their karaoke
bars and their water-weakened whiskies.
In the meantime, Miss Doi has resigned, the number of new women candidates
at last month's Upper House fell by half, and cash-strapped Japanese
companies have begun a back-to-basics campaign which includes trimming the
intake of new women and the opportunities for women already on the career
path.
Companies are remarkably blunt about their intentions. Toyota Motor will
reduce its intake this year of young male high school graduates by 7.4 per
cent to 1,580, while the number of women graduates is to fall by 25.6 per
cent to 570. Nomura Securities will halve its annual intake of women from
last year's 800, and the total number of women workers is likely to fall to
3,000 in 1997 from the present 5,000.
There are two career tracks for women in Japan: the 'ippanshoku', which
involves general administrative work and carries no promise of promotion;
and the 'sogoshoku', which is supposed to provide women with promotion
opportunities equal to those of the mainstream men.
Women on both tracks are having to pay the price for bad management
decisions made in the late 1980s, the easy money era, when firms rapidly
expanded their workforces. For example, securities industry personnel
increased by 41.6 per cent in the four years until the peaking of the stock
market in December 1989.
The collapse of the stock market and the economic slowdown have shown that
while Japanese women are making incremental gains in the workplace, the
impression of equal opportunity was as exaggerated as the Nikkei market
average in 1989.
At that time, the labour shortage and the need for more women managers were
urgent themes in the Japanese financial press, and it seemed women would
inevitably take places at the top corporate tables.
However, a study by Recruit Research of graduates' job opportunities has
shown that not only are opportunities for women severely limited at the top
end of management, but that there is a striking imbalance at the entry end,
even for graduates of the more prestigious universities. University
background is important, as about 45 per cent of the bureaucratic elite come
annually from Tokyo and Kyoto universities.
Recruit found that the ratio of new job offers to male graduates last year
was 2.72:1, but that for the present year, the figure fell to 2.22. For
women graduates, including those from two-year specialist courses, the job
offer ratio was a meagre 1.30 last year and had declined to 0.93, meaning
that there are more applicants than jobs for the first time in eight years.
A section manager at one of Japan's Big Four securities houses suggested
that women have suffered most because they were hired simply to sell stocks
 -and the market collapse had made them redundant. A second role in
corporate identity campaigns has also evaporated - companies were once keen
to attract publicity by hiring more women, he said, but this image-enhancing
drive has been scaled down.
For example, securities companies were particularly keen to impress foreign
clients, and made a point of dispatching women to their offices in London
and New York. A Japanese house had sent four women to its London office,
but, to save money, recently cut back to just one. one.
Personnel managers generally argue that women are unable to make the
commitment necessary to justify the expense of training them for management
positions. Without that commitment, there will be no promotion goes the
argument, though the research by Recruit suggests there are fewer
opportunities regardless of the commitment.
Companies are continuing 'experiments' with women managers, in that they are
allowed to do what male graduates of the same age would do. In one test
case, a 27-year-old woman at a Japanese commercial bank was recently sent
from Tokyo head office to a suburban branch to work as a loans officer,
enabling her to gather the experience necessary for further promotion.
The bank found that some proprietors of smaller businesses were offended
when their account was given to a woman, so she has concentrated on less
prejudiced proprietors, as well as foreign businesses and the more
liberal-minded of the larger Japanese companies.
Her work schedule is tough, with 13-hour days the norm, and she fears that
somewhere down the career track, the male-dominated system may reject her.
But she is determined to succeed: 'The personnel department is always
checking on me, ringing the branch manager to ask about my work. But I feel
that I have to stay. If I stop, it will be more difficult for other women.'

FT  12 AUG 92 / Liverpool backs Tory homes plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENANTS of 67 council-owned tower blocks in Liverpool voted overwhelmingly
yesterday for their homes to be transferred to independent management under
a Housing Action Trust (HAT) for a Pounds 100m-plus improvement programme.
The vote represents a breakthrough for government plans to reform
local-authority housing. Two other projects have been agreed - but the one
in Liverpool is the biggest so far in terms of homes affected.
HATs, introduced in 1988, were slow to get off the ground. Several proposals
were rejected in ballots of tenants. Tenants' fears have been allayed by
concessions, including the right to return to local-authority control after
the completion of improvements.
A significant factor in yesterday's 82 per cent vote for the Liverpool HAT
was the support of Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour leader of Liverpool City Council
 -Labour councils have generally been hostile to HATs, fearing loss of
control.
Mr Rimmer said yesterday: 'It is a departure from what had become
established thinking by Labour authorities. But we could not afford to
improve people's quality of life without trying something different. We just
did not have enough resources to afford it.'
The vote allows more than Pounds 100m of government funds to be spent on the
67 blocks over the next 10 years. Only four of the city's 71 blocks voted to
stay with the council, which will be responsible for funding any
refurbishment and improvements.
The new HAT will cover 5,700 homes. The other HATs are a Pounds 55m,
2,100-home programme in Hull and a Pounds 170m, 2,837-home programme
covering four council estates in Waltham Forest, London. Several
Labour-controlled London boroughs are now expected to ballot tenants on
HATs.
The government says HATs are a means of targeting spending, rather than
putting it into a pool. After the HAT programme is completed, tenants are
asked to choose who they want their landlord to be. They can opt to return
to local-authority control if they wish, or choose a housing association or
private landlord.
The Liverpool HAT will cover only 8 per cent of the city's council housing
stock of 60,000 homes, 40,000 of which are officially rated as sub-standard.
In the ballot, conducted by the Electoral Reform Society, turnout was 78.7
per cent.

IN A REPORT of the latest Labour Research Department survey of directors'
pay (August 3), it was said that Britannia Hotels had made a loss of Pounds
8.5m at a time when its directors Mr Michael Morton and Mr Alexander Langsam
had received a 98 per cent pay rise, taking their pay to more than Pounds 4m
each.
The LRD figure was incorrect. The company made a profit of Pounds 216,093
after payment of the increased remuneration to the two directors. In any
event, as Mr Morton and Mr Langsam are the sole shareholders it is entirely
up to them whether profits are distributed as dividends or salary.
The FT apologises for any contrary impression given by its report.

FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: China prepares to launch Australian
satellite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA will try again to launch an Australian satellite on Friday, five
months after a fire halted the last attempt and threatened to undermine its
efforts to offer such commercial services, Daniel Green writes.
Also hoping for success are BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the
UK and the Mayne Nickless group of Australia, members of the Optus
consortium owning the satellite. The consortium has paid Dollars A200m
(Pounds 77m) to buy, launch and insure the satellite, to provide pay TV for
Australia and New Zealand.
The satellite, Optus B1, was built by Hughes Aircraft, part of General
Motors. The rocket vehicle is the Long March 2E, a converted ballistic
missile. A technical fault in the first stage of a Long March-2E rocket on
March 22 caused a shutdown of its motors shortly before lift-off, aborting
the programme. The failure raised doubts about China's ability to enter the
world of commercial satellite launchers. The market is dominated by the US
(General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta) and Europe
(Arianespace).
Success for China would give it a lead over the other likely new entrant,
Russia. Commercial launches by Japan and India are several years away. Optus
B1 is to join the company's three-satellite network, the Optus A series, in
orbit over Australia, servicing Australia and New Zealand. The second
B-series satellite is set to be taken into orbit by a Chinese rocket in
December.

A MEXICAN consortium headed by Grupo ICA has won a contract to build a 340km
toll road from Mexico City to Guadalajara, at a cost of Dollars 1.2bn
(Pounds 620m), the biggest such contract ever awarded in Mexico, Damian
Fraser reports from Mexico City.
The consortium, made up of the Mexican companies Grupo ICA, Tribasa, Grupo

half the cost by international and domestic highway bonds, with returns
guaranteed by future motorway tolls.
These would be the first international bonds to finance an as-yet-unfinished
motorway. The building company PACSA, owned by Tribasa, re-financed a
completed motorway with Dollars 207.5m of international bonds in June.
Concessions have been awarded for 3,500km of toll roads, with plans to raise
this to 5,700km. The ICA group has the concession on the Guadalajara-Mexico
City motorway for 18 years.

SENATOR Max Baucus, Senate trade sub-committee chairman, yesterday warned
the Bush administration, previewing the Congress debate on the North
American Free Trade Agreement, to answer labour and environmentalists'
concerns with action, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington.
With negotiators still working on Nafta in Washington yesterday, he said the
administration's record on the environment was such that Congress would
insist the pact contain: protection for US environmental laws, with pledges
they would not be weakened; a funding mechanism for environmental
enforcement on the US side of the border, estimated to cost Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 500m); enforcement of Mexico's own environmental laws.
'In recent weeks, the administration has raised the spectre of
protectionists in environmental clothing. Though I understand that concern,
I am far more concerned with the possibility of polluters in free trade
clothing.' He was challenged by Mr William Riley, administrator of the US
Environmental Protection Agency. The Nafta, he said, would be 'the greenest
international trade treaty yet seen,' setting a model for future trade
pacts.

AUSTRALIA'S fragile economy was yesterday shaken by the fall of the
Australian dollar to a three-year low. It fell to 73.1 US cents in the
Australian market, despite intervention from the Reserve Bank.
While the slide was triggered by gloomy retail trade figures announced by
the government statistics bureau, markets have also been made nervous by
rumours of a budget deficit of Dollars A16bn (Pounds 6bn) in 1992-93, and of
another cut in interest rates.
The government is committed to allocating more funds for job-creating
programmes in the 1992-93 budget. This is in addition to a Dollars A2.3bn
spending programme announced in February which has so far failed to
alleviate unemployment, which stood at 11 per cent in July. The Dollars
A2.3bn programme, allocated over two years, helped push last year's budget
deficit to around ADollars 9.4bn.
The government is now banking on favourable growth figures being released
tomorrow and is confident that growth of 2 per cent was achieved in 1991-92.
This would mean a budget deficit of ADollars 13bn-ADollars 14bn.
The government is hoping for a big revenue-raising boost, in the shape of
the planned sale of Qantas, Australia's international flight carrier. Mr
Ralph Willis, minister for finance, yesterday said the government was to
press ahead with the airline sale to raise over ADollars 1bn during the
year.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council was scheduled last night to hold a
special session to hear charges of massive violations of human rights by
Iraqi forces against the country's Shia population in the southern
marshlands. The Council was expected to consider despatching UN observers to
the area to maintain continuous monitoring but this would require Baghdad's
co-operation.
Mr Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister now serving as a UN
rights investigator, recommended in an interim report last week that 'some
credible mechanism' be established to ensure that the Iraqi government
halted the repression.
Acting alone and making occasional visits to the country, he could not
himself adequately fill that role. A positive response by the government to
the proposal would indicate a commitment to stop the violations and refusal
could only increase fears that the attacks would continue.
Mr van der Stoel, who was to testify at the Council meeting, said there was
convincing evidence of heavy shelling of Shia villages. Measures to stem the
assaults were 'of utmost urgency.'
The western powers accused Iraq of ignoring a 16-month-old Council
resolution condemning mistreatment of civilians and called for an end to all
repression, including human rights violations against Kurds.

THIRTEEN hours of tape recording of police radio calls during the afternoon

the next day had been accidentally erased by the person on duty.
Maj Davidson was testifying before the Goldstone commission of inquiry into
political violence, sitting in Vereeniging, near Johannesburg.
Mr Justice Goldstone ordered that the tapes be submitted to the commission.
Witnesses from the township have alleged that armoured patrol cars had
dropped off attackers from Boipatong's Kwamadala hostel and had escorted
them back to the hostel after the massacre in which 42 people were killed.
Maj Davidson said that his investigation left him satisfied that the
security forces were not implicated.
South African government ministers were due to meet a delegation from the
Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) at a Johannesburg hotel last night.
The meeting, the second this year, is expected to include discussion of
possible PAC participation in constitutional talks, currently suspended but
expected to resume soon.
The PAC has refused to join the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa), the forum for negotiations, insisting that talks should take place
outside South Africa, under neutral chairmanship.

PHILIPPINE National Oil Company (PNOC), the state-owned energy group, has
finalised plans to auction off its 10-year-old shipyard under a
privatisation programme, Jose Galang writes from Manila
The shipyard, which has an aggregate capacity of 31,500 gross revenue tons
spread over a 22.9-hectare facility at Batangas Bay just south of Manila,
will be sold for at least 420m pesos (Pounds 9.1m). It is owned by PNOC
Dockyard and Engineering Corporation, a subsidiary of the state enterprise.
The sale of the shipyard, along with several other assets in the coming
months, will allow PNOC to concentrate on its energy business, an official
said.
Invitations to bid are due to be announced in the next few days, PNOC said
yesterday.

FT  12 AUG 92 / European Diary: Zurich stalls in effort to rewrite highway
code - Drivers draw battle lines and give the hard shoulder to proposed
car-free zone / Switzerland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH'S socialist-green coalition, in control of the city for the past six
years, has been one of the most aggressive in Europe in its attempts to
discourage the use of cars. Its experiences are sobering for other cities
considering traffic curbing measures.
Zurich's traffic engineers have built bewildering one way mazes, raised
speed bumps everywhere and eliminated vehicle lanes in favour of more space
for bicycles, trams and pedestrians.
The council has financed an efficient new commuter train network to the
suburbs and the council has banned the creation of new parking places in the
city.
Recently, it has taken to removing existing parking places by stealth.
Hardly a week goes by without a few street parking places being replaced
overnight by bollards and trees.
This summer, the council has resorted to trying to provoke feelings of guilt
 -mounting posters on the outskirts of the city, shouting 'Zuviel Ozon' (Too
Much Ozone), imploring people to abandon their cars and use trams or
bicycles in the city.
The most significant gain is that the city has a wonderful public
transportation system, with smooth trams that roll for the most part
uninhibited on reserved lanes, and whose drivers have the power to turn
traffic lights in their favour.
The system is also extremely successful, winning some 300m passengers a year
within a population basin of little more than half a million.
But the use of cars for commuting into the city has continued to rise.
According to the town council, the number of cars registered in the city has
risen from 130,000 in 1986 to 141,000 last year.
In addition, the number of motor units (a measure which reduces lorries to
car equivalents) coming into the city every day averages 474,000, roughly
150,000 more than the city's population.
Perhaps the biggest failure of the programme is that it has riled the city's
business community to the extent that several attempts to enlarging downtown
pedestrian areas have been stymied.
The businessmen favour more pedestrian precincts but insist that parking
places lost in the greened streets be replaced one for one in adjacent
streets or with new multi-storey car parks. The town council insists that
the operation must be used to reduce further the total number of parking
places available.
The council has twice proposed closing off the whole centre of town to cars
for the summer months, but this has been rejected by the Conservative
cantonal government as impractical.
'They imagined barriers - rather like Checkpoint Charlie - with every car
driver being checked to see whether he had a personal parking space in the
centre or if he was a doctor on an errand of mercy,' says Mr Hans Georg
Luchinger, the recently retired president of the Zurich Vereinigung (chamber
of commerce).
The chief strategist of Zurich's war on cars is its councillor for
transport, Mr Rudolf Aeschbacher, who makes no apologies for his aggressive
approach. A cycling enthusiast, he believes there is simply no point in
trying to satisfy the driving fraternity.
'We have to reduce the actual ability of people to drive in and to town. If
you keep facilities at the same level, people will stay in their cars,' he
says.
He points to one main artery entering the city from a motorway where the
city deliberately reduced the capacity from two lanes to one. 'We
immediately had a 35 per cent reduction of traffic coming in. We wanted to
do it on other arteries, but the cantonal government overruled us.
'When it becomes less attractive to drive into town, people will start
taking the train,' he states. Thus, he refuses to improve the road system.
'We say that we cannot afford to have a good public transport system and a
very good road system. The road system should only be big enough for things
that have to be done with a car, and my view is that probably only 30 to 40
per cent of what is being done now in cars is necessary.'
Mr Aeschbacher's policies have ignited so much anger among Zurich's middle
classes that they have given unexpected staying power to a fringe political
organisation called the Automobile Party.
The party was created in 1985 in response to a short-lived national anti-car
campaign by Greens, but it still claims 8,000 active members and has eight
seats in the federal parliament and two in the Zurich cantonal government.
Mr Michael Dreher, president of the party's federal parliamentary group,
gives no corner to Mr Aeschbacher. 'We think a car should be either moving
or parked, not looking for a parking space. The right to choose your means
of travel is a basic human right.'
In Mr Dreher's view, the chamber of commerce and Mr Luchinger are 'softies',
and the Zurich anti-car policy based on a misconception.
'Zurich has the cleanest air of all European cities. In 1985, they tried to
tell us that the forests were dying because of cars. They were lying. Now
they tell us about the greenhouse effect. Sober common sense in this country
has disappeared.'
Far from being distressed about this political force, Mr Aeschbacher seems
to like it. 'Now we know for how many people cars are the absolute priority.
It is five to six per cent of the vote. If we did not have that party, we
would not know.'
Mr Aeschbacher also has some unexpected allies. Last spring, Nissan Motor
launched a promotion in which any purchaser of a new Nissan car would get a
year's pass on the Zurich public transportation system, worth SFr1,328
(Pounds 524.90) for only SFr100.
'Going by tram is okay and going by car is okay. It is a matter of getting
the proportions right and using moderation,' Nissan and the Zurich public
transport authority said in their joint advertisements.
Even the cantonal government may be moving his way. Recent research by its
statistical department confirmed that it was proving very difficult to pull
Zurich's rich suburban commuters out of their BMWs and Mercedes.
The researchers concluded that the only solutions were slower roads and
fewer parking places. 'As long as a driver can arrive at his destination in
a reasonable time and find somewhere to park, there is no way he is going to
change his habits,' they said.

</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO prominent members of the Russian parliament who have just returned to
Moscow from the former Yugoslavia yesterday described reports of
concentration camps there as 'myth'.
One of them, Mr Yevgeny Ambartsumov, the chairman of parliament's
international relations committee,
spoke out against United Nations sanctions against Serbia on the grounds it
created greater suffering for ordinary people.
With parliament on holiday and public opinion largely indifferent to events
in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Ambartsumov's comments are unlikely to carry
much immediate weight. But they are symptomatic of moves to break away from
an exclusively pro-western orientation in Russian foreign policy.
Yesterday the foreign ministry expressed 'surprise' that a UN draft
resolution authorising the use of all means to ensure the delivery of
humanitarian aid to Bosnia had been drawn up without Russia's participation.
The ministry said it should have involved at least four permanent Security
Council members, and not just the three western members.
But reports from New York later suggested Russia would co-sponsor the
resolution agreed by the US, France and Britain on Monday.
The Russian comments coincided with a visit to Moscow by Mr Douglas Hogg,
minister of state in the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He said
Russia would react 'sympathetically' to a request to send troops to
Yugoslavia to accompany convoys of humanitarian aid.
Mr Hogg confirmed that London would be sending a team of UK customs experts
to Romania to help authorities tighten up on potential breaches of
international sanctions.

THE threat of a summer of discontent looms in France with the dockers
stepping up their industrial action by calling a national strike today and
disgruntled farmers renewing their protests against the European Community's
agricultural reforms, Alice Rawsthorn reports from Paris.
The dock strike will be the second national stoppage at France's ports this
week. The dockers have staged intermittent protests throughout the summer
against new legislation which involves job losses and radical changes in
their employment status.
Today's stoppage has been called to protest against an incident in Dunkerque
on Monday when 12 dock workers were held by police for questioning about
alleged vandalism to the port over the weekend.
Meanwhile French farmers yesterday stepped up their protests. More than 100
farmers occupied the agriculture ministry's regional office at Auch in the
Gers region demanding the right to put their case to Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
the French prime minister.
The demonstration broke up after Mr Beregovoy agreed to see them next
Wednesday.

DEWHIRST, a UK textiles company, was yesterday identified as the supplier in
a contract to make clothes in Serbia for Marks and Spencer, Britain's
biggest retailer
Dewhirst has paid about Pounds 750,000 to Genex, the Belgrade-based foreign
trade company, to make children's school blouses and shirts. Genex is
controlled by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serb leader.
Dewhirst exported raw materials to the factory in the Serbian town of
Ivanjica. Although imports from Serbia are prohibited under UN Resolution
757, the Department of Trade and Industry has issued an import licence to
Dewhirst because the raw materials were not of Serbian origin.
The contract from Dewhirst, long an M and S supplier, was signed two years
ago.
The contract expires this week. M and S said: 'We will not be sourcing from
Yugoslavia in the future.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YMOS, the large German car components manufacturer which lost nearly DM200m
(Dollars 136.9m) last year largely as a result of balance sheet fraud,
yesterday announced a complex capital restructuring.
The plan is to restore the group's equity capital to the DM140m level it was
before it was wiped out by the combined effects of fraud and operating
losses, the details of which were revealed to shareholders in June.
In a two-stage restructuring, the company will cut its basic share capital
from DM67.5m to DM6.75m. Capital will then be built up again through the
issue of 2.025m new shares at DM95 per share. As a result, the company's
capital will be restored to DM143m. Minority shareholders will have the
chance to buy the new shares on the basis of 15 for every one already held.
Ymos warned yesterday that despite profits during the first six months of
the year, the result for the whole year would be 'clearly negative'.
Mr Gerhard Krischer, chief executive, predicted that shareholders would be
receiving dividends after the rationalisation phase, which he said would
last another two years.
Sales climbed 11 per cent in the first half. Last year, they amounted to
DM660m.

INSOLVENCY practitioners need not mount detailed investigations into the
conduct of directors of insolvent companies, according to guidance from
their professional bodies.
An advisory note, issued yesterday, provides guidance on the D-forms, or
statutory reports, that must be submitted to the directors' disqualification
unit of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after each insolvency.
It appears to place little responsibility on insolvency practitioners to be
satisfied with directors' conduct of a business.
The guidance, from the Society for the Practitioners of Insolvency and the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says practitioners
should base their reports on information gained in the ordinary course of
their work.
It suggests that practitioners 'may find it useful' to issue questionnaires
to directors asking for information and 'inviting comments' on the reasons
for an insolvency. It cautions against defamation and says the report to the
DTI, to be submitted within six months of an insolvency appointment, should
be based on proper evidence.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Lonrho asked to clarify Libyan links: London Stock Exchange
reacts to reports of joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange has asked Lonrho, the international conglomerate,
to clarify its relationship with the Libyan government.
The request follows an interview in the Sunday Times with Mr Omar Muntasser,
the Libyan minister of finance, who was quoted as saying that Lonrho and the
Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (Lafico) had established a
joint-venture company to develop their combined interests in Africa.
In May Lonrho told the exchange that it had not had any discussion with
Libyan concerns to sell its African interests and described reports
suggesting otherwise as 'malicious, irresponsible and unfounded'.
Exchange officials want Lonrho to clarify its relationship with Lafico, the
main investment vehicle of Col Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. In order to avoid
a false market being created in Lonrho's shares, exchange officials want to
know whether there is any more information concerning Lonrho's operations
with Lafico which could be put into the public domain. The exchange is to
monitor the situation closely over the next few months.
Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, declined to comment. Lonrho's
shares yesterday fell 4p to close at 76p.
Meanwhile, Mr Sam Jonah, managing director of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation
(AGC), denied reports that Lonrho had any intention of transferring its 45
per cent stake in the company into a joint venture with the Libyans. Mr
Jonah said: 'Let me state categorically there is no short-term, medium-term
or long-term intention to divest the Lonrho stake in AGC. In fact we would
like to acquire further equity if the Ghana government (which owns the other
55 per cent of the company) thinks it in the interests of the economy.'
A senior government official in Ghana yesterday confirmed its plan to float
up to 20 per cent of the company in London and other international stock
markets. Any equity participation by Libya in AGC would probably rule out
such an international sale.
A senior official in the office of the president of Ghana said that under
Ghanaian law any transfer of shares in a mining company would require the
prior consent and approval of the government. He said the government had not
been informed of any change in Lonrho's holding in AGC.

Wall Street
HEAVY LOSSES on overseas markets set the tone for a subdued day's trading on
US stock markets yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.40 at 3,337.58,
having spent all but the final few minutes of the day a few points below
Friday's close. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished up
0.53 at 419.41, while the Amex composite was down 1.72 at 388.41, and the
Nasdaq composite 0.60 lower at 573.14. Turnover on the NYSE was very light
at 143m shares.
Overnight prices in Tokyo fell to their lowest levels for six years, a
sell-off which triggered declines in most European markets. Against this
background, it was no surprise when US markets opened lower and even another
solid rise in bond yields, further pushing down long-term interest rates,
failed to lift investors' mood.
Trading activity was light, typical of a mid-August week, with many
investors away on vacation.
Among individual stocks, McDonnell Douglas climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars
37 1/2 after the defence and aerospace group unveiled a major restructuring,
which will include the consolidation of its six military aerospace companies
into two groups, the sale of its helicopter unit and the closing of its Ohio
plant.
Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 after reporting net
income of Dollars 339m for the April-to-June quarter, higher than the
Dollars 304m reported a year ago but slightly below analysts' estimates. The
company's final quarter took full-year profits to Dollars 1.87bn.
TJX rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 7/8 after the specialty retailer
reported second quarter earnings of 26 cents a share, up from 20 cents a
share a year earlier.
Hewlett-Packard, savaged by selling last week in the wake of disappointing
earnings, bounced back yesterday with a gain of Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 60
3/8 . IBM, which also suffered last week, recovered another Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 88 1/4 in active trading.
The ADRs of British Airways rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 49 5/8 after
analysts predicted first quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 80-Pounds 90m.
Storage Technology plunged Dollars 6 1/8 , or 18 per cent, to Dollars 27 1/8
as investors reacted negatively to the news released late on Friday that the
company has delayed the testing and production of its Iceberg data storage
system.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in
turnover of 1.8m shares on details of a pact in which Microdyne will develop
and market network connectivity cards certified through Novell laboratories
to be optimised for NetWare local area networks.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed in quiet trading. According to preliminary data,
the TSE 300 index rose 2.48 points, or .07 per cent, to close at 3,408.78.
Declines led advances 269 to 229, volume of 16.7m shares was below Friday's
19.6m, and trading value was CDollars 186.7m against CDollars 242.6m.
Eight of the 14 stock groups closed higher. The transportation group posted
the day's biggest decline, off 1.92 per cent on index.

RUBBER TRADERS remain unconvinced that prices will climb despite buying at
the end of last week by the International Natural Rubber Organisation's
buffer stock manager.
Inro bought in 4,000 to 8,000 tonnes of Malaysian rubber and an estimated
1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of Indonesian rubber. It was the first time the buffer
stock manager had intervened in the market since last December. Traders said
that while Inro's action might have prevented a further fall in prices,
there was little optimism that market conditions would improve in the short
term. Prices for Malaysian rubber are now about 220 Malaysian cents a
kilogram, compared with 228 cents a year ago.
'There is still weak demand,' said one trader. 'Factories in the main
markets are closing for holidays plus there is no sign of a pick-up in car
sales - which means tyre demand is down.'
Traders say prices have been helped by purchases by the CIS and China.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS copper smelters come to aid
of western miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVERE shortage of copper-smelting capacity, which has helped to bolster
the copper price in spite of the world recession, is being relieved by
smelters in Russia and Kazakhstan.
The Commodities Research Unit consultancy group estimates that at least
75,000 tonnes of fully-refined cathode copper and semi-refined blister
copper will be delivered back to the west this year from the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
For a fee, smelters in the CIS have been treating copper concentrates
(intermediate material) supplied by mines in the west, where the lack of
smelter capacity has pushed treatment charges to record levels for those
miners that have no long-term contracts with smelting companies.
Two trading houses - Marc Rich, based in Zug, Switzerland, and Euromin,
which has offices in Stockholm and Moscow - have been having concentrates
toll-smelted in the CIS, where smelters in the Urals and Kazakhstan not only
have excess capacity but are also eager to earn foreign currency.
Mr Christopher Stobart, the CRU's CIS expert, suggests that only companies
that know the region well can organise the process. Concentrates must travel
huge distances at a time when much of the CIS transport system is in chaos;
metal recovery from the concentrates is not as high as in western smelters;
and getting the copper back to the west without having some stolen can be
difficult.
Nevertheless, western smelter charges for treating concentrates, which once
ranged between 10 cents and 20 cents a lb, have jumped to 35 cents and this
justifies the risk of the CIS option.
The CRU suggests that toll-smelting in the CIS has effectively relieved the
acute smelter bottleneck in western countries and should keep the price of
refined copper below Dollars 1.20 a lb.
It suggests that concentrate treatment charges in the west are likely to
range between 15 cents and 32 cents a lb from now on but that is not high
enough to encourage new smelter projects. Therefore the smelter tightness,
in a less acute form, is likely to continue for some years.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea growers face
problems over falls in prices and production
</HEADLINE>

   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN tea industry is facing critical problems over production and
prices.
The country's tea output declined by 26.21m kg in the first six months of
1992, compared with the same period last year, to 237m kg. Meanwhile, the
average price realised at the Calcutta auction in the period to the end of
July was down Rs3.78 (6.75p) at Rs44.05 a kilogram.
The combination of lower production and reduced prices has badly affected
the profitability of Indian tea companies, particularly the ones owning
estates in south India and West Bengal, according to industry officials.
First-half production in the south Indian estates was down by a little over
18m kg at 75m kg. Tamil Nadu alone suffered an 11.3m kg shortfall; Kerala's
output was down by 6.6m kg; and Karnataka's by 256,000 kg. Plucking in
earlier months of the season suffered because of a severe drought.
West Bengal, which missed out on pre-monsoon showers, produced 44.43m kg in
the first half, compared with 55.11m kg a year earlier. The production
shortfall in Dooars was 7.58m kg, in Terai 2m kg and in Darjeeling 1.1m kg.
According to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the brokers, the Darjeeling
gardens, which have a small production base but earn a very high unit value
for their tea, will be hit badly by the substantial drop in production.
Out of India's total production of 742m kg in 1991, the share of Darjeeling
was only 13m kg. Assam, where the largest quantity of Indian tea is grown,
had in the first half of the year gained 2.7m kg to 117m kg. There has
since, however, been a marginal fall in production to 47m kg in June.
While India may find it difficult to achieve its production target of 720m
kg in the current year, the quality of tea in all centres has turned out to
be good, says Mr Dudeja. He attributes this to a growing realisation among
the planters that the only way they can make profit is by concentrating on
the production of quality teas.
The price difference between good and plain categories has increased to
about Rs20 a kg. The reduced presence of Russia, traditionally the biggest
buyer of Indian teas, at the auction centres is said to be partly
responsible for low tea prices. Russia has so far bought 14m kg of Indian
tea, compared with 40m kg in the corresponding period of 1991.
Among all the tea producing countries, Sri Lanka has suffered the most, with
production declining by 34.6m kg to 68.5m kg in the five months to May. The
Kenyan crop is estimated to have fallen by 10.08m kg to 76.7m kg.
The world tea crop shortfall during the current year will be about 100m kg,
according to Mr Dudeja.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fights sugar disease
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AGRICULTURE officials are combating an outbreak of the sugar beet
disease rhizomania on a farm in Norfolk, eastern England, the first such
case in two years, the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food said
yesterday, Reuter reports.
The ministry said that the outbreak was detected during an annual survey for
the soil-borne disease which reduces crop yield and the sugar content of the
beet.
Strict movement controls have been imposed on the farm and inspectors are
investigating neighbouring farms, the ministry said.
It said that the disease, which is present in much of continental Europe,
was first discovered in Britain on a farm in Suffolk in 1987. It was found
on two farms in 1989 and three in 1990, all in Norfolk. The last outbreak
was in 1990.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credit boost for Argentine
farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA HOPES to increase farm output and exports with the announcement of
about USDollars 300m of new low-cost, medium-term, revolving credit lines
from state-owned Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA).
President Carlos Menem announced the new measures on Saturday at Argentina's
premier agricultural show. The government also hopes to have more long-term
farm loans, provided by multilateral lending agencies, available by the
first quarter of 1993.
However, no details of the BNA package are available yet. The bank is
expected to raise the money on the international financial markets.
Nonetheless, Mr Osvaldo Sarachu, an agricultural economist, said 'a group of
small farms or a single large farm would be able to borrow money for 180
days at interest rates of about 9 to 12 per cent a year, if they commit
themselves to export their production'.
He said that the BNA, Argentina's largest bank, was lending at about 17 per
cent a year. Nominal interest rates at private banks are even higher,
ranging between 20 per cent and 60 per cent. Interest rates have dropped
sharply as inflation has fallen to 19 per cent after the government pegged
the currency at par to the US dollar in 1991.
Still, financial costs are a heavy burden, and small farms are worst
affected. Mr Sarachu calculates that financial charges average about 8 per
cent of wheat producers' costs. Argentina's farmers are expected to spend
Dollars 1.5bn to plant 16m hectares (40m acres) of grains this year. They
are also investing more on new farm equipment, increasing the demand for
credit.
Argentina's farm grain exports have fallen steadily after reaching a peak in
1983 when exports brought in Dollars 3.23bn. Last year, exports were worth
Dollars 2.05bn. Argentina, one of the world's lowest-cost farming nations,
has been undercut by subsidised exports from the US and European Community.
Domestic instability has made things even worse for farmers.
Sudden economic recovery has led to a rapid increase in imports and
Argentina's trade balance may go into the red for the first time since 1987.
Any increase in farm exports would have an immediate positive impact on the
trade account.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks to issue
perpetual floating-rate notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks are preparing to issue perpetual floating-rate notes, despite
the high cost of such instruments, in their latest effort to build up
depleted capital.
Yesterday's 3 per cent drop in the Nikkei stock index to just above 15,000,
its lowest level since March 1986, has placed further pressure on Japanese
banks, whose stock holdings count towards capital under Basle bank capital
rules.
Although the rules do not formally come into effect in Japan until the end
of the financial year next March, banks are keen to knock their balance
sheets into shape ahead of September's interim book closing.
Sakura Bank (formerly Mitsui Taiyo Kobe) is preparing a Dollars 800m
offering of perpetual subordinated floating-rate notes in the Eurobond
market. Sakura was the sole bank among Japan's 11 commercial, or 'city',
banks to fail to reach the 8 per cent capital adequacy ratio at the end of
the last fiscal year.
This sizeable offering is expected to pave the way for a series of similar
offerings.
'There isn't a bank which isn't considering the issuance of perpetual
subordinated bonds,' said Sanwa Bank, a leading commercial bank.
Mr Kiichiro Ito, president of Tokai Bank, also announced that Tokai is
considering issuing perpetual subordinated FRNs in late September.
Many banks are in need of additional capital injections. According to IBCA,
the credit rating agency, even with the Nikkei index at 16,000, Bank of
Tokyo, Sakura, Nippon Credit Bank, Fuji, Tokai and Hokkaido Takushoku may
already be below the 8 per cent Basle capital requirement level, while many
other banks tail close behind.
Bankers believe interest rates on the notes will be around 80 to 100 basis
points higher than the US dollar London inter bank offered rate of around
3.8 per cent. 'For banks which can finance themselves at Libor rates, the
extra cost would be over Y800m, roughly the equivalent of annual net profits
at a city bank branch with 50 to 60 staff members,' said one Japanese
banker.
The capital raising instruments will be issued in the international markets,
but are likely to be privately placed with Japanese life insurers. However,
Japanese institutional investors are currently looking to limit their
investments rather than expand them. The banks may be forced to turn to
companies with close relationships, in some cases financing the companies
which purchase the bonds.
Bankers outside Japan are becoming increasingly sceptical about the methods
used by Japanese banks in order to meet capital adequacy targets.
'Whether its the subordinated debt issues of a year or so ago, the recent
preferred stock offerings, or these imminent perpetual floating-rate notes,
(the bulk of the paper) ends up with Japanese companies within the same
corporate grouping (keiretsu),' said one bank capital specialist.
Analysts argue that the process of a bank lending funds to a subsidiary to
buy bonds, in order to shore up its own capital, undermines the whole
concept of setting minimum capital requirements on an international basis.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries gain in cautious trading
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasuries followed through from Friday's gains with further advances
yesterday, although trading was cautious ahead of this week's injection of
new supply.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  7/16 at 107
19/32 , to yield 7.358 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/16
at 100 1/4 , yielding 4.099 per cent.
The scene was set for a firm opening in New York after Treasury prices had
risen in overseas markets amid a general flight-to-quality following yet
another big fall in Tokyo equities.
With the Nikkei index at a six-year low, investors in Japan and Europe
viewed US government securities as the safest available haven.
This week the Treasury will sell Dollars 36bn in new issues, starting with
an auction Dollars 15bn in three-year notes this afternoon.
With such a large amount of new securities coming to the market, dealers and
investors were understandably cautious in their trading yesterday.
UK government bond prices ended mixed with medium and long-dated issues
closing lower due to funding concerns while short-dated issues ended
slightly higher.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.06 and drifted down to 97.02
but volumes in the futures market were well below average at around 14,000
contracts.
In the cash market, the 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its
opening level of 115 5/16 to 115 5/32 , yielding 9.43 per cent. However,
dealers said prices for shorter-dated issues remained fairly firm with the
10 per cent gilt due 1994 inching up from 100 1/2 to 100 9/16 by late
afternoon to yield 9.64 per cent. The weakening in prices for medium and
longer-dated issues has led to a slight flattening in the gilt yield curve.
Dealers expect longer-dated gilt prices to remain depressed in the run-up to
the next auction, even though the economic data due to be released this week
is expected to be positive for the market. The Bank of England announced on
Friday that it plans to auction stock with a maturity of 15 years or more on
August 26.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day firmer with dealers reporting good
demand for medium-dated issues.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.025 per cent and traded in a
range of 5.005-5.045 per cent before closing at 5.015 per cent. In the
futures market, the September contract opened at 104.50 and ended at 104.60.
Volumes in both the cash and futures markets were below average, which
dealers blamed on the holiday season.
GERMAN government bond prices ended the day lower with the Liffe bund
futures contract moving from its opening of 87.35 to end at 87.24, just
above the low price for the day.
Dealers said the European government bond markets will be focusing on two
main areas in the immediate future - the next set of German money supply
figures and the opinion polls in the run-up to the French referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty.
The German money supply figures for July are not expected until next week
and bund dealers said they will be waiting to see whether M3 growth is
showing any sign of slowing down.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BALTIMORE circuit court jury yesterday decided that three US companies -
GAF, Keene Corp and Pittsburgh Corning - would have to pay up to 2 1/2 times
their share of compensatory damages to three sample plaintiffs as the
largest asbestos personal injury trial in the US draws to a close.
The three companies, and the Porter Hayden Company, had already been found
negligent either in making or installing asbestos-containing products at a
time when the companies knew, or should have known, that the products were
dangerous.
In July, the jury ruled that these companies, and two others, must pay
Dollars 11.2m in compensatory damages to three sample plaintiffs.
No damages were awarded to three other plaintiffs, whose injuries were
deemed to be unrelated to their asbestos exposure.
Although the latest decision applies to only three plaintiffs, the formula
will be used in a series of mini-trials for the remaining 8,549 plaintiffs
in Maryland whose cases are scheduled to be heard in the autumn. In
addition, the ruling is likely to have implications for the remaining 86,000
asbestos injury cases pending in the US.
Yesterday, the jury decided that GAF should pay punitive damages of 2 1/2
times its share of compensatory damages. Keene Corp and Pittsburgh Corning,
a joint venture between PPG Industries and Corning, must pay 1 1/2 times
their share of compensatory damages.
The jury became deadlocked over a formula for the fourth company,
Porter-Hayden. Two other companies, AC&amp;S and MCIC, were excluded from
punitive damages.
The exact share of compensatory damages for each company has not yet been
decided.
In addition, attorneys for the companies have said they would challenge the
jury's verdicts on the grounds that it was wrong to consolidate the cases.

<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, yesterday reported a
modest 5.6 per cent improvement in after-tax profits during the year to
end-June.
The company made Dollars 1.87bn at the net level, compared with Dollars
1.77bn in the same period a year earlier.
The figure was scored on sales of Dollars 29.4bn, an 8.6 per cent advance on
the previous year's Dollars 27bn.
However, the final quarter of the financial year showed a slightly stronger
trend, with after-tax profits advancing by 11.5 per cent to Dollars 339m,
and sales gaining 6.6 per cent at Dollars 7.17bn.
Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G's chairman, noted that 'after a slow start' and an
earnings dip in the first quarter, the profits improvement had averaged 10
per cent over the past three quarters.
He added that there had been 'continued economic softness' in many markets,
including the US, Canada and parts of Europe.
During the year, domestic profits rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.46bn after
tax. P&amp;G said volume growth was 'particularly noteworthy in the paper,
laundry and food and beverage businesses', while softness in pulp prices
dented earnings growth.
On the international front, P&amp;G made Dollars 625m, up by 19 per cent over
the previous year. The Cincinnati-based company added that every region
showed double-digit volume growth, from Europe to Asia Pacific.
The shares fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 in early trading.

chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, ROEBUCK, the large US retailing and financial services group,
yesterday announced that it was appointing Mr Arthur Martinez to take charge
of its troubled stores division.
Mr Martinez was formerly with Saks Fifth Avenue, where he was a
vice-chairman with responsibility for the company's administrative
functions. Prior to that, he was in charge of the extensive retail interests
which Britain's BAT Industries owned in the US until they were sold off in
1990.
Mr Martinez's appointment comes in the wake of considerable investor
unhappiness over the performance of Sears's retail operations.
Although the division is one of the biggest retail businesses in the US with
sales of Dollars 31.4bn in 1991 and 362,400 employees, it has been dogged by
an uncompetitive cost base, a loss-making catalogue operation and stagnating
sales. In 1991, Sears's domestic retail operations (excluding the credit
business) made profits of just Dollars 90m.
In August 1990, Mr Edward Brennan, Sears's chairman, resumed direct
responsibility for the retail division, and large cost-cutting moves have
followed.
However, with little sign of significant sales improvements, shareholder
agitation has continued. At the annual meeting in May, five dissident
motions gained stronger-than-expected support, although none were passed.
Yesterday, Sears said that Mr Martinez would be responsible for all retail,
catalogue and direct marketing, credit, product services and international
operations of the Sears Merchandise Group, with effect from September 1. He
will also be a member of the Sears, Roebuck corporate management committee,
which also includes the heads of Sears's financial services subsidiaries.
Mr Martinez became a vice-chairman at Saks, when the department store chain
was bought by Investcorp, a Middle East-backed investment company, from
Britain's BAT Industries in 1990.
He had previously been group chief executive for the retail division of
Batus, BAT's holding company in the US. Here, he was responsible for four
sizeable stores chains - Marshall Field's, J. B. Ivey, Breuner's, as well as
Saks - all of which were sold by BAT in the wake of Sir James Goldsmith's
bid for the group in 1989.

UNITED Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, yesterday called on the US
government to block British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m investment in one
of its rivals, USAir, unless concessions on operating in Europe were
obtained.
In a letter to United Airlines employees, Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of
United's parent company UAL, said the US Transportation Department would
make 'the most monumental mistake' if it did not extract a 'fair, balanced
exchange of opportunities' for US carriers in Britain.
British Airways replied that United was trying to link a business deal with
a bi-lateral arrangement between governments. 'The proposed deal is entirely
within US law.'
Meanwhile, Mr Seth Schofield, chairman of USAir, claimed that United's
statement 'parroted' earlier protests from American and Delta, the other US
mega-carriers, and was 'a great testament to the ability of the
USAir/British Airways alliance to create a fourth effective domestic
competitor'.
Last week, American said the US government should not approve the investment
deal unless the US secured 'equal opportunities for US carriers'. Delta
called on the US Transportation Department to take action to stop the deal
'as a matter of law'.
United's comments were the most outspoken yet. 'British Airways is
attempting to secure indirectly that which it is barred by law from securing
directly: effective control of a major US air carrier,' Mr Wolf said. US law
limits foreign ownership of airlines to 25 per cent voting stake and 49 per
cent overall.
The UK was not 'making the slightest crack in its protectionist policies,'
he said. 'Those policies prevent us, among other things from operating
non-stop from our largest hub to London.'
He said that the BA-USAir deal, while not giving majority control to BA
meant that it could veto USAir's decisions.

<TEXT>
A FEDERAL bankruptcy court in Phoenix has declared CK Acquisition the winner
of an auction to purchase Circle K , marking an important step toward the
end of Chapter 11 proceedings for the Arizona-based convenience store chain,
AP-DJ reports.
'There has been a modified agreement, a hand-shake deal, that increases the
price to Dollars 402.5m from Dollars 375m,' said Mr Bart A. Brown, chairman
and chief executive.
CK Acquisition is made up of four investors led by Bahrain-based Investcorp.
Mr Brown said the modified agreement has the support of Circle K and three
of its creditor groups. A fourth group of bondholders opposes the plan.
The chairman added that the 'hand-shake' agreement would be translated into
a formal, written agreement over the next week or two.
Circle K hopes to file a plan of reorganisation on or about September 15 and
hopes to emerge from bankruptcy about December 31.
Mr Brown expects CK Acquisition to reduce the number of Circle K stores to
about 2,800 from the current 3,300.

Holmes Protection, the US security company quoted in the UK, yesterday
announced it had received shareholder approval for its capital
restructuring.
After a decade of making acquisitions, mainly financed by borrowings, Holmes
had been struggling to survive with an enormous burden of debt.
A solution proposed by former directors - which involved selling the best
operating companies - was rejected by shareholders in September 1991, and a
new management team headed by Sir Ian MacGregor was voted into office.
The seven North American institutions which were unsecured lenders to the
group, have agreed to forgive a portion of the debt and accept a part cash
and part debt-for-equity swap for the remainder.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Pilkington to place Dollars 300m debt securities in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass group, has arranged a Dollars 300m (Pounds 156m)
private placement of long-term debt securities with US investing
institutions. The funds will be used to repay other short-term borrowings,
such as part of Pilkington's Dollars 227m unsecured multi-option facility,
which expires in 1995.
The deal, first mooted in the spring, was increased from an original size of
Dollars 200m when it met strong demand from investing institutions such as
insurance companies.
The securities, in five tranches, range in maturity from six to 20 years,
with an average life of 12 years. In 1990 Pilkington did a Dollars 200m
private placement with maturities ranging from 1995 to 2010.
The 10-year portion is paying 1.45 percentage points over US Treasury bonds
and the 20-year portion is paying 1.75 percentage points over Treasuries,
giving an interest rate of under 9 per cent.
Although the debt pays fixed rates of interest, the proceeds have been
swapped into floating rate funds taking advantage of the current low
short-term interest rates in the US.
Pilkington's business has been badly hit by the recession as its main
customers are in the construction and automotive industries. Profits have
fallen from Pounds 325m pre-tax in the year ended March 31, 1989, to only
Pounds 77m in the last financial year, although this was after exceptional
charges of Pounds 37m. The group also cut its annual dividend from 10.5p to
6p.
At the annual meeting last month, Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said that
so far, current year results were down on the previous year.
At the year end the group's net debt, including finance leases, was Pounds
760.2m, while shareholders' funds plus minorities totalled Pounds 1.15bn.
Mr Stephen Schechter, managing director of Wertheim Schroder, which arranged
the private placement, said that the group had been given a top rating by
the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners. He said that
although Pilkington's debt was not publicly rated, he regarded it as a
single-A credit.
He said that in spite of Pilkington's current difficulties, US investors
believed the company would survive the recession.
Other UK companies which have raised money in recent months through similar
private placements include Dawson International, the knitwear group, Tate &amp;
Lyle, the sweeteners company, Senior Engineering, and Williams Holdings, the
industrial conglomerate.

FT  11 AUG 92 / McDonnell Douglas launches overhaul to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace company, yesterday
announced a large cost-cutting overhaul of its military and government
business.
The St Louis-based company will either sell or seek a joint venture partner
for its helicopter business, and close a parts plant in Columbus, Ohio, with
the loss of 1,000 jobs. The commercial aircraft operations of its Douglas
Aircraft subsidiary will be unaffected.
McDonnell Douglas has been buffeted by the downturn in military spending,
and by upheavals in the commercial airline industry. Two weeks ago, the
company unveiled a 51 per cent drop in second quarter earnings, with all
three of its manufacturing segments reporting lower profits.
The shake-up will place McDonnell Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas Missile
Systems and McDonnell Douglas Helicopter in one division under Mr John
Capellupo, president of McDonnell Aircraft.
Mr Kenneth Francis, president of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems will head a
second division, comprising the space business, McDonnell Douglas
Electronics Systems, the C-17 military transport project and other military
work which formed part of Douglas Air-craft.
The group said the new structure would 'lead to other staff consolidations
on a regional basis'. It is creating a new 'office of the chairman', with
five senior executives, to decide the mechanics of the restructuring in the
next three months.
McDonnell said the time and money required to build the helicopter business
into a market leader was too great.
'We will seek a joint venture partner that will enable us to reach that
objective, or we will seek an appropriate buyer,' said Mr John McDonnell,
chairman.
The company has been pursuing a similar policy with its commercial aircraft
division, talking to potential foreign partners, principally Taiwan
Aerospace.
The Columbus plant which is closing makes parts for the C-17 military
transport aircraft, and the MD-11 and MD-80 commercial aircraft.
Yesterday, McDonnell shares, which slumped after the second quarter figures
were released, rallied by Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 37 1/2 .

FT  11 AUG 92 / Hutchison Whampoa seeks HKDollars 4.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the diversified trading company controlled by Mr Li
Ka-shing, yesterday sought to raise HKDollars 4.47bn (Pounds 300.5m) through
a placement of 300m shares at HKDollars 14.90.
Hutchison, which last week reported a loss and cut its dividend, left the
market guessing as to why it needed the money. Mr Li will subscribe to 120m
shares and Peregrine Capital, a company connected with Mr Li, intends to
place the remaining 180m shares with 'independent third parties'.
Last month, during Hutchison's acquisition of Cavendish International,
Peregrine's broking subsidiary was advising international and local fund
managers to sell Hutchison shares.
The brokerage said Hutchison was likely to underperform the stock market in
the short term, although it represented long-term value.
Yesterday an analyst with Peregrine said: 'Institutions have been
underweight in Hutchison. We think at these levels it offers an entry into
an attractive recovery stock.'
Since last Thursday's announcement of a HKDollars 78m interim loss,
Hutchison executives have refused to comment.
Local analysts said the statement Mr Li released with the interim results
raised more questions than it answered.
In particular, Mr Li's bearish comments about the performance of Hutchison's
UK telecommunications subsidiary sat oddly with comments by Mr Simon Murray,
the company's managing director, that it was performing well.
Hutchison has lagged behind the Hong Kong market for some time. During the
past year it has underperformed the market by more than 45 per cent. Since
the beginning of the year, it has underperformed by 20 per cent.
Last year Cheung Kong, the company through which Mr Li controls Hutchison,
issued covered warrants against 273m Hutchison shares at an average price of
HKDollars 17.89.
Hutchison's fall into first-half losses came after a HKDollars 1.42bn
write-down on its investment in Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer.
A year earlier the company wrote off HKDollars 760m for a fall in the value
of Husky's oil and gas reserves.
Hutchison's interim dividend was cut by 20 per cent to 16 cents a share from
20 cents.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Signs of life stir in the loans market: Hopes are being
raised of a return by blue chip borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers in the international syndicated loans market have a tendency to note
details of individual loans with the keenness of train-spotters or
ornithological twitchers. Recently, they have had good reason to watch the
market like hawks.
Over the past few years, pricing on syndicated loans has risen steadily,
reflecting the banks' concern about meeting capital adequacy requirements
and their desire to improve margins on lending. While companies are under
pressure to raise funds as cheaply as possible, bankers found that loans
which were too tightly priced were often difficult to syndicate as other
banks were unwilling to participate in the deals.
However, conditions appear to be changing. Some better-rated corporate names
are finding it easier to obtain more tightly priced loans. These signs that
loan pricing may be starting to fall have raised hopes that more blue-chip
companies may be encouraged to return to the international syndicated loans
market, leading to improved activity.
Bankers have watched three loans with interest: an Ecu499m (Pounds 359.3m)
loan to the European Community; a Pounds 150m loan for Argyll, the UK food
retailer; and a Pounds 290m financing for AMP (UK), the UK subsidiary of
Australia's biggest insurance group.
The EC's three-year loan carries a margin of 3.125 basis points over the
London interbank offered rate (Libor) with a participation fee of 10 basis
points. The pricing is particularly tight on this loan because the EC is a
Triple-A rated borrower which is Zero-risk weighted for capital adequacy
purposes. Also, the participating banks hope to win more business as a
result.
Argyll's 5-year Pounds 150m facility is intended to help finance the group's
store developments. Argyll is borrowing at a margin of 37.5 basis points
over Libor - which bankers describe as extremely favourable for the company.
Mr Colin Smith, finance director at Argyll, said the money was raised 'very
smoothly . . . we were delighted with the response from our relationship
banks'.
This week, bankers will watch the response to another finely priced deal -
from AMP (UK). Fuji Bank, which competed fiercely for the mandate, is
arranging and underwriting the deal, consisting of a revolving credit
facility and a commercial paper backstop facility. While the margin on the
loan is considered small, banks will be rewarded with fairly generous fees.
The funds will be used to help refinance a Pounds 525m 3-year facility (of
which only Pounds 250m is outstanding) which matures in September 1992: the
old loan has a margin of 25 basis points over Libor, and a 12.5 commitment
fee. The new facility has a margin of 20 basis points with a commitment fee
of 10 basis points on the undrawn part of the standby.
Companies such as Argyll and AMP can command tight terms because they are
considered top-quality borrowers. The question remains whether these
indications of lower pricing will encourage companies to return to the
syndicated loans market, which has bordered on comatose for 18 months, in
sharp contrast to the late 1980s when banks fell over each other to lend,
and takeovers and mergers stimulated demand for loans.
Competition among banks to lend was tough, allowing companies to borrow
cheaply. However, conditions in the loans market have deteriorated. The
recession in the Anglo-Saxon economies has depressed takeover activity and
reduced investment in capital equipment.
Many banks have been hit by company failures resulting from injudicious
lending practices and difficult economic conditions. The need to follow the
Basle guidelines on capital adequacy has made many banks, especially
Japanese (an important source of finance in the late 1980s) more selective
about their lending.
Average spreads on new loans have risen from about 50-60 basis points in
1989-1990 (with prime corporate borrowers often obtaining funds at all-in
costs below 40 basis points) to around 80 basis points this year, according
to the recent OECD report Financial Market Trends, June 1992.
Meanwhile, volumes have dropped sharply. Activity in the international
syndicated loans market plummeted in the first half of 1992 as borrowers
scaled back their bank financing and switched to the international bond and
equity markets for funds.
'There's been so little activity in the market that banks are now hungry for
assets. They are ringing each other up trying to get in on deals to the top
names,' says one banker. A Swiss banker says: 'Pricing is more aggressive
for top quality names.'
However, the news may be a mixed blessing. Bankers, anxious about low
volumes in the loans market, want borrowers to return to the market to
refinance outstanding facilities or raise new funds. Yet few bankers want
margins to fall, reducing profit margins.
'Very few banks are making good profits on their syndicated loans business,'
warns one UK banker. Instead, banks are prepared to participate in such
syndicated loans in the hope that they will lead to more lucrative business
 -for example in foreign exchange or letters of credit. Few bankers believe
pricing will return to the levels of a few years ago - but the more
optimistic hope that if top-quality names are encouraged back to the loans
market by better borrowing terms, the phones on the loans desks might ring
again.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Court probe into cash dispensers: Banks and building
societies face action over 'phantom withdrawals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and building societies face the prospect of a High Court action later
this week which will attempt to prove legally for the first time that the
ubiquitous hole-in-the-wall cash dispenser is fallible.
However, Mr Denis Whalley, a Merseyside solicitor who is preparing the cases
of about 400 alleged victims of 'phantom withdrawals' from automated teller
machines (ATMs), believes banks and building societies are doing their
utmost to avoid appearing in court.
Their blanket defence that ATMs are infallible has not been legally tested
in any country.
After months of resistance, there has been a sudden flurry of ex gratia
payments of up to several hundred pounds to customers who were preparing to
take financial institutions to court, according to Mr Whalley, an associate
solicitor at J Keith Park Co in St Helens.
Mr Richard Tyson-Davies, of the Association of Payment Clearing Services,
the inter-bank organisation which handles cheque-clearing and other payment
systems, said he was not aware of any 'run for cover'.
He said he expected the financial institutions to fight the court action
prepared by Mr Whalley. 'The banks are confident in the security of their
system,' he commented.
Mr Whalley believes the ex gratia settlements are unsatisfactory. 'You do
not cure a toothache by taking an aspirin. Eventually you have got to go to
the dentist.'
He will attempt to prove that withdrawals can be made from ATMs through no
fault or involvement of the card holder.
The banks argue that there is no such thing as a phantom withdrawal. The
card and the personal identification number (PIN) are needed to withdraw
cash and because card holders undertake to keep their PIN secret, it follows
that no withdrawal can take place unless the holders break their side of the
contract, according to the banks.
Mr Tyson-Davies says ATM fraud is not a serious problem. 'Out of Pounds 165m
worth of plastic fraud last year, under Pounds 3m occured through ATMs.
There is no evidence that somebody has found a way into the system,' he
said.
Mr Whalley intends to open a 'multi-plaintiff action' in the High Court. He
has prepared about 30 cases, and he plans to add on cases week by week. Many
of them are taking a long time to administer because of legal aid
requirements.
He hopes his tactics of flooding the banks and building societies with
complainants will prevent them settling cases on an ad hoc basis.
This will be the first group action involving a large number of people with
relatively small claims who could not afford to sue individually, according
to Mr Alistair Kelman, counsel for the group.
The case will be heard in the official referee's court, which deals with
highly technical disputes. The prosecution, in an-other first, will use a
database in the trial.
'The database will cross reference the cases and discover links between them
and where the faults are occurring. We will be able to make all sorts of
complex searches,' said Mr Kelman.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Day of misery for equities in Europe and Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY FALLING share prices in Tokyo set the tone for a day of European
stock market misery yesterday. Equities closed substantially lower on
European bourses as local factors added to the gloom.
On Wall Street, the falls on overseas markets unnerved investors when
trading in New York opened, but by the close the earlier losses had been
recouped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 5.4 at 3,337.58.
Japan's 225-share Nikkei average lost 2.91 per cent to close at 15,066.34,
its lowest level since April 1986 and more than 61 per cent down from its
record high in December 1989.
In the UK, the FT-SE 100 index fell to an 18-month low, losing 24.4 to
2,325.7. Germany's DAX 30 index lost 26.95 to 1,582.55, its lowest level
since January 8. Other Continental bourses saw even sharper losses.
In Tokyo, private investors ignored an attempt to talk up the market by Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, and continued to move out of equities on
fears about the country's economic outlook.
The Nikkei continued its downward trend in early trading today, shedding
more than 60 points after half an hour.
In London yesterday , the 1 per cent drop in the FT-SE index was small
compared with the falls on many continental exchanges. In Germany the DAX
index dropped 1.7 per cent as foreign funds sold equities. Fears of weak
six-month profit figures and company staff cuts fuelled concern that the
country might be heading for recession.
The Milan and Oslo stock mar kets both lost 2.6 per cent of their value. As
Italian investors continued to react unfavourably to last week's discount
rate cut, worries surfaced that the government will be unable to raise its
planned 7 trillion lire from privatisations and asset sales.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: An Ecu by many another name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TIM LUND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Economics Notebook (August 10), Peter Norman perpetuates the
non-issue of what the Ecu and its parts should be called. People concerning
themselves with this matter should consider: (1) that French and
German-speaking Swiss have completely different words for one-hundredth of a
Franc; (2) that the French call Britain's currency la livre, without the
average Brit even knowing, let alone caring; and (3) that when a sub-unit
was introduced in the UK at the time of decimalisation, natural linguistic
pressure for 'p' triumphed over the official preference for 'new pence'. The
peoples - in the plural - of Europe should be allowed to call the Ecu, or
any part of it, whatever they want, as in fact they will anyway.

The TSB's sponsorship of Roy of the Rovers, the cartoon football hero, has
opened up a whole new field for sporting-business links. Melchester Rovers
star Roy, who first appeared in the Tiger comic in 1954, has great
attractions for a sponsor; unlike a real footballer, his private life is
immune from sordid revelations in tabloid newspapers.
So which comic book hero will be next to attract the sponsor's eye? Perhaps
Pizzaland could back the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? And those loveable
libertarians at the National Rifle Association would be an obvious sponsor
for Bambi. And how about Rentokil sponsoring Mickey Mouse?

Tut, tut. Observer hears that estate agents Healey &amp; Baker are trying to let
some 'outstanding offices' on the 7th floor of the plush Lansdowne House in
London's Berkeley Square. Is not this the nerve-centre of Charles and
Maurice Saatchi, the advertising men who helped the Tories win the election?
It sounds as if the bean counters running Saatchi &amp; Saatchi are trying to
squeeze every last cent out of their assets and the brothers are going to
have to do their bit. While the rest of the Saatchi advertising machine has
long since decamped to cheaper premises, Charles and Maurice have held out
in their palatial Lansdowne House offices.
However, it seems that they may well soon be moving out. Healey &amp; Baker are
offerring the offices for Pounds 42.40 a square foot, which is a good Pounds
20 less than Saatchi paid in the heady days of 1988. Any offers?

Is Stephen Mulholland, the abrasive managing director of Times Media (TML),
the South African media group, about to follow in the footsteps of the late
tycoon Robert Holmes a Court and cricketer Tony Greig and try and make his
mark in Australia?
Speculation is rife that he is about to take off round the world to head the
Fairfax publishing empire in Australia. Although he has acknowledged that he
has been approached by 'an Australian publisher', he said he was happy in
South Africa. He has, however, sold out of TML where he was previously the
largest individual shareholder.
Mulholland would be in his element in the land of plain speaking. A robust,
self-made man with outspoken free-market views, he is notorious for his
short temper and a manner abrupt to the point of rudeness. Some who have
worked for him regard him as a crude bully; others have been stimulated by
his no-nonsense, can-do attitude.
The former editor of the weekly Financial Mail was promoted in 1986 to try
to rescue TML's stricken predecessor, South African Associated Newspapers
(SAAN), which had been bled dry by losses incurred at the Rand Daily Mail
and the Sunday Express, both closed in 1985. He succeeded immediately and
the group has made handsome profits.
While shareholders may approve of his tenure, journalists are more
sceptical. Many equate Mulholland with the triumph of profit over principle
and hold him responsible for a general retreat from the liberal ideals
upheld by the Mail and the Express.
Sounds just the man for the job. Funny it's taking so long to appoint him.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Observer: Sir Owen stands down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three cheers for Sir Owen Green. The chairman of BTR, one of Britain's great
post-war industrial success stories, has always been a bit of a maverick. He
shuns talking shops like the CBI and has some pretty extreme views when it
comes to the corporate governance debate. But when it's time to retire, he
is a model company chairman.
Whereas the likes of Lord Hanson and Glaxo's Sir Paul Girolami feel that
they owe it to their shareholders to soldier on well past retirement, Sir
Owen plans to bow out quietly next spring. BTR has a rule that no directors
can stand for re-election after they are 65. Since he will be 68 next year,
Sir Owen automatically forfeits his seat on the board when his current term
expires.
BTR, formed out of the old Birmingham Tyre and Rubber Company, has been
going for close on 100 years. But it was not until Sir Owen came on board in
the mid-1950s that it began to motor. Along with his key lieutenants - John
Cahill (now chairman of British Aerospace), Bowater chairman Norman Ireland
and the late Don Tapley - Sir Owen built BTR into one of Britain's top dozen
companies.
He more than anyone can feel proud of what he has created - a company
employing 140,000 people and with a market capitalisation bigger than ICI's.
His annual salary of Pounds 217,000 is modest by comparison with Lord
Hanson's Pounds 1.4m.
It will be interesting to see how BTR copes with Sir Owen's departure. In
terms of boardroom upheavals it is not like Lords White and Hanson quitting
their company. BTR has had an outside chairman before - Sir David Nicolson
did the job for 15 years until 1984 - and it has changed its chief executive
twice since it split the roles in 1986. BTR has shown that it can handle the
succession question.
Even so, finding a successor could prove difficult since BTR has never gone
in for non-executive directors. Cahill and Ireland are too old and Alan
Jackson, the current chief executive, is too untested to be allowed to
combine the chairmanship as well. In most big companies a potential chairman
would have had at least a couple of years on the board to get a feel of his
new company. If Sir Owen is to be faulted it is for not preparing the ground
well enough.

FT  11 AUG 92 / The threat of regulation stirs an unfettered giant: An era
of benign neglect may soon end for the derivatives industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerald Corrigan, the powerful president of the New York Federal Reserve,
could not have been more blunt: 'The growth and complexity of off-balance
sheet activities and the nature of credit, price and settlement risk they
entail should give us all cause for concern,' he told an assembly of
top-level US bankers in New York this January. 'I hope this sounds like a
warning,' he continued solemnly, 'because it is.'
His comments sent immediate shock waves through the global market in
financial derivatives - the complex and innovative off-balance sheet
financial products such as swaps and options which have proved hugely
profitable for banks and securities houses. To the professionals who handle
these transactions daily, Mr Corrigan's words were a warning that, after
more than a decade of benign neglect, financial regulators have their sights
trained on the derivatives business.
Futures exchanges, which list standardised derivative contracts requiring
margin payments to be set aside, have long been the domain of regulators.
Yet the derivatives business with corporate counterparties that is written
by banks and securities houses may, some supervisors fear, have eluded their
grasp.
Regulators are now saying the time has come to re-examine the risks being
taken with over-the-counter derivatives and to ensure that the nature of
those risks is both understood and effectively managed.
They are worried that the explosive growth in the use of derivatives in
complicated hedging and arbitrage transactions poses new risks to the
world's financial system.
Derivative instruments, which are linked to underlying securities, allow
users to bet on market movements, to exploit price variations and also to
reduce financial risk by hedging positions in other markets. Because of
their complex relationship with underlying markets, risk and exposure have
to be calculated using specially designed computer models.
Half a dozen agencies around the world - including the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the General Accounting Office in the US, plus
the Bank for International Settlements - are now conducting studies into the
market for swaps, options, futures and other derivative instruments.
The greatest fear of regulators is that the default of a handful of big
derivatives players could trigger a domino-like collapse among banks,
securities houses and corporations linked by a grid of interconnected
payment obligations.
There has already been a number of scares involving defaults by derivatives
counter-parties. The collapse in 1989 of securities house Drexel Burnham
Lambert left unpaid financial obligations that required careful unwinding,
as did a series of US bank failures, notably the collapse of the Bank of New
England.
What recommendations are regulators making? First, they want banks and
securities houses to record swaps and other derivative-related obligations
on their balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. Derivatives are
described as 'off-balance sheet' because the cash flows involved in
transactions are not listed in corporate accounts.
To this end, the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the US has already
issued rules requiring balance-sheet accounting of derivatives by the end of
1993. The Bank for International Settlements is currently looking at
imposing similar rules on an international basis, and also at ensuring banks
are adequately capitalised to support their derivatives exposures.
Regulators are also concerned about settlement risk (whether clearing and
settlement systems are up to handling high-tech derivatives), about
operational risk at firms (whether senior executives know the full extent of
their companies' exposure to derivatives), and market risk (what happens to
derivatives' positions if a sudden and calamitous move in underlying markets
throws positions awry).
In recent years the growth of the derivatives business has been
considerable. Ten years ago the notional value of outstanding interest rate
swaps was Dollars 5bn, according to the International Swap Dealers
Association (ISDA), the industry's trade body. By 1986 the market had grown
to Dollars 400bn and, by the end of 1991, the value of outstanding swaps
contracts had risen to Dollars 3,800bn.
Some of the infrastructure needed to support the market's development has
lagged behind. Legal and accounting practices, for example, are not always
geared up to cope. In the UK, banks faced losses of close to Pounds 600m
when the House of Lords ruled last year that swaps transactions undertaken
by local authorities were illegal.
Yet the swaps industry believes regulatory concern is overdone and is partly
the result of ignorance of how the market operates. It is a point that some
supervisors concede.
'We admit to being much less knowledgeable (on derivatives than
specialists),' says Mr Richard Farrant, deputy chairman of banking
supervision at the Bank of England and a member of the Basle off-balance
sheet sub-committee. 'The very scope for variations is held to be a major
advantage, enabling transactions to be structured to fit like a glove . . .
but it does make for difficulties of control and risk assessment.'
Since Mr Corrigan's warning in January, advocates for the industry have
worked hard at promoting the benefits of derivatives. They say that swaps
enhance the efficiency of capital markets by allowing for a clearer, more
accurate allocation of risk. They claim that swaps have improved the quality
and diversity of credit risks to which banks and securities firms are
exposed.
The industry's fears about regulatory encroachment may yet prove overblown.
Since Mr Corrigan's blunt comments in January, regulators have appeared to
soften their stance.
Last week, Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked
what he thought Mr Corrigan meant by his warning to bankers. Choosing his
words carefully, Mr Mullins responded: 'I think president Corrigan was
talking about the need for banks and regulators to understand the nature of
these instruments better, and to develop the appropriate infrastructure to
control and manage the risks.'
To the industry's relief, regulators are increasingly taking a position of
open inquiry rather than criticism. One regulator referred to the current
reviews as 'a questioning . . . We need to ensure that there is no
complacency.'
Some bankers now see the voicing of worries by regulators as warning shots
across the bows of the derivatives industry. If regulators intended to keep
bankers on their toes, their strategy has worked, judging by the worried
reactions of market participants.
Even defenders of the industry do not dispute the positive impact of the
renewed focus from regulators. As one head of swaps at a bank admitted: 'It
has certainly concentrated the minds, particularly of senior management,
where there has been a rather laissez-faire attitude in the past.'

FT  11 AUG 92 / Meat and potatoes row: The future of London's produce
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bout of haggling has broken out in London's fresh food markets. The
recession, competition from supermarkets, and new European Community hygiene
regulations have led one market to contemplate a raid on another's pitch.
The protagonist is New Covent Garden Market, the government-owned fruit,
vegetable and flower market housed in functional sheds on 56 windswept acres
in Battersea. After losing more than a dozen tenants last year, it has set
its sights on filling its empty space with tenants from Smithfield meat
market.
Smithfield, the reluctant target of the advance, is the last working market
in the City, occupying an elegant, ironwork building designed by Sir Horace
Jones in 1868, on a bustling site by St Bartholomew's Hospital.
The Corporation of London, Smithfield's owner, expects to spend Pounds 50m
to bring this Victorian market, which still uses wooden barrows and
sawdust-covered floors, up to EC hygiene standards.
The cost has prompted an argument with tenants, who face increases in rent
from about Pounds 11 per sq ft to about Pounds 28 per sq ft. The corporation
says if the dispute is not resolved in six months, the traders will have to
move out.
The debate over Smithfield's future involves a broader question about the
future of London's large fresh-produce markets, namely New Covent Garden,
Smithfield, Western International, a fruit and vegetable market near
Heathrow, Billingsgate, the fish market in Docklands, and Spitalfields, the
fruit and vegetable market at Hackney Marsh.
Are there too many? And would combining two or more markets enhance trade by
attracting buyers such as restaurateurs who want to buy meat and vegetables
at the same place?
'The logic of rationalising fresh food distribution in London is apparent,'
says Mr Bill Bowman, chairman of Covent Garden Market Association. 'Some
degree of consolidation must arise, particularly if trends in the retail
trade continue. There is less business to be done by all concerned.'
Mr Bowman believes that consolidating the London markets in a centralised
operation, such as Rungis in Paris, was an opportunity missed 30 years ago
when the government started moving Covent Garden out of the heart of London.
Consolidation could also help the markets to bear the costs of meeting EC
hygiene regulations. These costs are not confined to the meat trade. The
corporation fears that Billingsgate could need an extra Pounds 20m to be
brought up to standard. The regulations differ from market to market but
they all entail spending on refrigeration and cleanliness. Supermarkets
already comply with them to a greater extent than the markets, so they
should incur less added cost, and could thus gain a greater share of the
fresh food market - currently rising by 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent a year.
Supermarkets account for just over half the fresh produce sold in the UK.
Even if Smithfield and New Covent Garden agreed that joining forces would
cut their costs, a merger would not be simple. Legislation would be needed
to allow New Covent Garden to sell meat and to allow Smithfield to move.
An even more complicated legal battle is likely if New Covent Garden tries
to set up a rival meat market to attract Smithfield's tenants. Nobody has a
right to establish a meat market within six and two-third miles of
Smithfield, according to a corporation charter. The corporation believes the
charter is watertight; New Covent Garden thinks otherwise.
The matter is now in the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture, which is
considering 'very carefully' New Covent Garden's proposal to sell meat. Its
deliberations are coloured by the government's desire to privatise the
market at the best possible price.
A report by Binder Hamlyn, the accountancy firm, two years ago said that New
Covent Garden was worth between Pounds 20m and Pounds 266m, depending on
whether it was sold to its tenants or to a property developer. Since its
value as a development site has largely disappeared since then, the
government may have an interest in bolstering its trading profits. Weighing
against the proposals, however, is the prospect of a bitter confrontation
with the Corporation of London over selling meat.
The corporation has a battery of reasons why Smithfield should not move. For
one thing, it owns Spitalfields, which might be threatened if a 'one-stop'
meat and vegetable market were set up at New Covent Garden.
For another, the corporation thinks that legislation to allow Smithfield to
move could take several years. If a bill was delayed or failed, the
corporation would not have time to implement EC hygiene regulations by the
December 1995 deadline.
But New Covent Garden's Mr Bowman thinks the corporation's strategy is
fundamentally flawed. Its scheme to refurbish Smithfield is 'an expensive
and, arguably, unsatisfactory compromise solution, which is likely to create
as many operational problems as it would solve'.
New Covent Garden argues that combining with Smithfield 'would create a
market complex of formidable strength and attraction to customers'. The cost
of moving Smithfield would be just Pounds 11m.
In response, the corporation says the attractions of 'one-stop' shopping are
overestimated, since relatively few retailers need both markets. It also
points out that half of Smithfield's Pounds 50m refurbishment cost would be
incurred anyway, since repairs to the listed structure are needed.
Nonetheless, most Smithfield traders have told New Covent Garden that they
would consider moving if a formal offer were made.
The attraction of New Covent Garden to the tenants lies in its efficiency
and ease of access. But it is not clear whether a move would resolve the
tenants' concern about rents, since they would face similar increases. The
tenants say that they cannot afford such a sharp rise. 'We can't entertain
it,' says Mr Gerry Vincent, who runs the Market Tenants' Association.
The patience of Smithfield's tenants will be put to the test over the next
few months because the agriculture ministry is unlikely to rule before then.
If it decides that New Covent Garden cannot sell meat, the only route out of
the impasse is for the corporation and the tenants to reach a rent
agreement. Only then could Smithfield continue to trade on the site it has
occupied since the middle ages.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: Reform of UK company law essential to meet
present-day needs of ensuring accountability of management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MAURICE GILLIBRAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, According to your report ('CBI and IoD attack corporate governance
reform plan', July 30) both the Confederation of British Industry and the
Institute of Directors are opposed to the recommendations of the Cadbury
Committee in spite of their limited attempt to make company managements more
accountable to their shareholders.
This should be a clear message to the government that effective
self-regulation is unlikely to be achieved and legislation is therefore the
only alternative.
Present company legislation is based on the Limited Liability Acts of
1855-62. These acts created the limited liability of shareholders, and at
the same time gave them the right to hold management accountable at the
annual general meeting of the company.
The consequences were so profound that they unlocked the door to the
commercial developments of the Industrial Revolution and brought such
prosperity that Britain became the leading industrial nation.
Nevertheless, company structures have evolved to such an extent that company
legislation now bears little relevance to current practice.
In such circumstances reform becomes essential to meet the new situation. In
particular, account needs to be taken of the fact that now the majority of
shareholders are themselves corporate entities and have ceased to carry out
their function at the annual general meeting. Thus, the procedure by which
management is held accountable to the shareholders has become nullified.
One consequence has been that boards have become self-perpetuating, since
invariably it is only they who originate nominations for directors which are
supported at the annual general meeting by the proxies of absent
institutions. Additionally, any erosion of accountability increases the
complacency of management and decreases the commitment to achieving the full
potential of the business.
Thus, many British companies have been unable to compete effectively with
their counterparts in Germany and Japan, with adverse consequences to our
economy.
In order to reform corporate governance it will be necessary for new
legislation either to restore the authority of the annual general meeting or
to create, as in Germany, a supervisory tier of representation of
shareholders within companies.
Coupled with circumstances in which the government had achieved its
commitment to low-level or even zero inflation such legislation would
dramatically improve the international competitiveness of British business.
Thus, by the Limited Liabilities Act of 1855, a new Companies Act could
herald a second era of British prosperity.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GHINO DI TACCO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to Mr Onesimo Alvarez-Moro's letter (August 7) and his advice
for Italians to wake up as soon as possible - I would like to know when the
Spaniards woke up, if they did.
The Spanish unemployment rate is at 17 per cent of the workforce; inflation
will touch 7 per cent average rate in 1992 and only the government believes
that the economic growth will be more than 2 per cent. Real economic
indicators show the same results. In fact the Spanish government begged for
special help at Maastricht, called the cohesion fund.
Concerning the old tricks, I would advise Mr Alvarez-Moro to read the
Spanish newspapers of the last months.
Three or four years of good results, boosted by foreign investments, are
nothing in the history of a company, even less in the history of a country.

Sir, Perhaps I can help dispel any unwarranted gloom felt by accounting
graduates after reading Sunjay Kakar's article, 'Graduates who fail the

This institution's student-entry statistics show that the percentage of
accounting graduates in each year's intake has remained steady at 19 or 20

FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: Pensions equalisation at 65 at odds with reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN FREAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British
Industry, called for the state pension age to be equalised at 65 under the
title of the 'pragmatic option on pension equality' (Personal View, August
7). His concept of what is pragmatic, which is based on highly dubious cost
estimates, is a bit limited since it takes no account of the actual pattern
of retirements which are now taking place.
Less than a half of men in the age group 60-64 are still working and less
than half of women in the 55-60 age group (despite the latter's legal right
to work as long as a man in the same job). Furthermore, about half of those
who stop work before retirement age do so at the direct instigation of their
employers, many of them CBI members, and a good number more retire
voluntarily, but under pressure.
MSF also has a pragmatic view of equality and that leads us to argue for a
flexible decade of retirement extending from 55 to 65, during which period
most people retire, with the full pension payable at 60 when the majority
are retired. We argue that the way to keep up activity rates among older
workers is for determined action to be taken against age discrimination so
as to make it more possible for people to work. This is the real issue that
the government and the CBI should be tackling, enriching the employment
possibilities of older workers and not conspiring to impoverish their often
involuntary retirements.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Manchester's Olympic bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY felt flat. The return to normal life, after two spectacular
Spanish weeks of colour and international competition, must have induced a
sense of loss in all but the most fervent anti-Olympian. But shrug off that
morning-after-the-fortnight-before depression. Preparations to recreate the
Barcelona spirit in Atlanta in 1996 are advanced, and the race to host the
27th Olympiad in 2000 is under way. The competition will be fierce, with
Sydney and Beijing leading the field. At this stage, Manchester looks like a
plucky outsider.
It requires a sober head to assess the economic merits of hosting the games.
Good parties are great to attend; but they can be costly to throw. The
citizens of Montreal are still paying the bills for the 1976 Olympics.
British tax-payers will have to provide much more than the Pounds 55m that
the government has so far pledged.
Yet the Olympics have become an increasingly attractive economic prospect
since Los Angeles infused them with some American enterprise in 1984. It is
too early to assess the final economic impact of this year's Olympics on the
economy of north-east Spain. But the organisers claim strong ticket sales,
and Barcelona expects to repay six years of hard work with a small profit.
.TX- Intangible benefits
The wider economic impact is expected to be much greater. Direct investment
in the games amounted to Pounds 5.2bn, of which 82 per cent came from the
public purse. Most of this was spent on motorways, communications and low
income housing while only 11 per cent directly related to sports
infrastructure. A city of Barcelona report estimates that the total extra
spending in the Catalan economy will total almost Pounds 16bn over the
entire 1987-92 period. Add to this the intangible benefits stemming from the
success of the Barcelona games - the publicity and stature it has gained in
the international community, the confidence and pride it has breathed into
the region.
These are tempting dreams for Manchester which, like Barcelona, is a second
city. A study commissioned by the Manchester bid team from the Manchester
Business School claims that the games could attract Pounds 2bn in investment
and create 50,000 new jobs. This would hardly solve the region's chronic
problems, but it would certainly help.
As important, a successful Manchester bid could do wonders for the region's
morale, redressing the damaging imbalance that tilts so many resources into
the south-east. If Britain is to bid at all for the Olympics, it is best
that the proposed location is somewhere other than London.
Worthy aspirations
Yet Barcelona has also demonstrated that hosting a modern Olympics is no
small commitment; and, despite the worthy aspirations of the Olympic
organising committee, the circus is likely to get bigger rather than smaller
between now and the end of the decade.
Manchester and its surrounding region, unlike London, has the space and the
basic transport infrastructure to cope with the huge scale of a modern
Olympics. But against Barcelona's huge investments, the bid committee's
estimate that a Manchester Olympics would cost about Pounds 1bn looks
misjudged.
Public investment is forecast to cover only a third of that cost,
considerably less than in Spain. The recent sorry experience of
public-private sector partnerships for infrastructure investment in London's
Docklands shows that these arrangements can go badly wrong.
Now that the Barcelona party is over, the Manchester committee has its work
cut out. In framing a fully detailed proposal, it will have to establish
private-sector deals so that the government can come clean about the scale
of public expenditure potentially involved. So far, the prime minister has
spoken vaguely of pro-viding 'substantial public funding'.
A millennial Olympiad as exuberant and rewarding as Barcelona's would be
wonderful for Manchester and good for Britain. The next 14 months will
determine whether the International Olympics Committee will give Manchester
its chance.
That period also needs to be used to ensure that Manchester's bid is more
like Barcelona's than Montreal's.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Rossini rarities in Siena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Settimana musicale senese, the small-scale festival presented by the
Accademia Chigiana in Siena, has just concluded its 49th edition. In its
long history, it has been responsible for countless memorable and
significant events.
In its early, pre-World War II years, the Chigiana played a crucial role in
the Vivaldi revival; in the post-war period it has set trends with
performances of other long-neglected composers or works; and more recently,
it has sponsored world premieres of living composers and has offered gifted
young artists a chance to display their talents.
This year's Settimana concentrated, understandably, on the bicentenarian
Rossini. Over the years the Accademia has made valuable contributions to the
deeper understanding of this composer, too: its Ermione, for example, in
1977, antedated by some years the grander production at the festival of
Pesaro.
In 1976, the festival gave a concert performance of Rossini's then
unpublished and virtually unknown incidental music for Oedipus at Colonus,
14 mostly brief pieces composed around 1815 in Bologna on a commission from
a presumably well-off hydraulic engineer named Giambattista Giusti, who was
also an amateur translator and poet. In 1817 he had his Italian version of
the Sophocles tragedy published by the great Parma printer Bodoni.
Giusti apparently hoped that his work would be staged, but Rossini seems not
to have shared his optimism, and when the impatient translator - who had
imprudently paid the composer in advance - insisted on having the music,
Rossini handed him the manuscript pages, some of them not completely
orchestrated.
For many years, the music was presumed lost, then the autograph surfaced in
the early 1970's (it is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York), and
a critical edition was subsequently published by the Rossini Foundation in
Pesaro. The musical numbers are for chorus and/or basso, and have all the
charm and power of the finest Rossini. Their efficacy is all the more
surprising in that Italy had no real tradition of musique de scene; and
Rossini's numbers for Oedipus are unique in the 19th century repertory.
The beauty of the music, however, is not matched by any similar
attractiveness in the Italian text. Giusti was not much of a poet, and his
stilted, predictable verses sound like a poor libretto without
accompaniment. The decision of Luciano Alberti, artistic director of the
Chigiana, to stage the play seems unwise, for in the end it was the music
that suffered. A respected scholar, Alberti as director was unable to impose
any coherent style on his actors; they were all terrible, but in different
ways.
Only the Coro di Toscana, prepared by Roberto Gabbiani (who also conducted
the performance, with the Symphony Orchestra of Sofia), made a positive,
sensitive contribution - they also acted well, despite the troublesome set,
which consisted chiefly of a steep flight of steps.
More successful was the Chigiana week's closing event: a concert performance
of an 1826 Rossini pastiche entitled Ivanho. This consists of a French text
devised in Paris by the librettists Emile Deschamps and Gabriel-Gustave de
Wailly from the Scott novel and music by the Italian musician and publisher
Antonio Pacini, long a Paris resident. There is some evidence that Rossini
himself contributed to the organisation of the music, which consists of
numbers from perhaps a dozen of his operas, not all of them familiar or
readily available in France at that time. The pastiche had its premiere at
the Odeon in September 15 1826, with enviable success. Within the decade
that followed, it was given in many foreign countries, reaching London on
March 7 1829 as The Maid of Judah, or The Knights Templar.
After all, why shouldn't it be a success? The music is all first-rate
Rossini, and the libretto is based on a popular, dramatic story, even though
the French authors cut it mercilessly and simplified the plot (Rowena and
Rebecca are fused into a single character, the - Moslem] - Lila).
It requires a better orchestra than the musicians from Sofia who gave it,
and a more committed conductor than the slack Peter Maag. It does not
require superstar singers, but they should be able to sing in tune, and the
three basses were a severe handicap. Fortunately, the tenor Craig Estep, in
the title role, gave a more than adequate idea of the music (some of his
high notes were, however, ill-advised, pinched and unpleasing to hear).
Tiziana Fabbricini - the Violetta of the Muti Traviata at La Scala a few
seasons back - occasionally sounded strained, but she sang with confidence
and style. The real winner of the evening was the California baritone LeRoy
Villanueva, who offered a warm lyric sound, handled with sensitivity, enough
to gain applause even for the villain Brian de Boisguilbert.
Any criticism of these performances or these performers must be tempered by
some mention of the Tuscan weather and, especially, of the intolerable heat
inside the Teatro dei Rinnovati. Male members of the opening and closing
night audience, who bravely wore jackets and ties were subjected to cruel
and unusual punishment, but even removal of jacket and loosening of collar
brought little relief. In the old days, the Chigiana used to hold its
festival in the more appropriate month of September. If they will insist on
mid-summer, they must seriously - and promptly - consider air-conditioning.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Four telecom groups may win licences: DTI plans more
competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to award national telecommunications licences to four
groups in one of the biggest steps to open up the UK telecommunications
network to competition.
The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to announce today that it
plans to award public telecommunications operator licences to Ionica, a
private company based in Cambridge; National Network, based in Marlow,
Buckinghamshire; and World Communications, a Swiss-owned company based in
the UK. It is thought the other licensee will be a US group.
National Network expects to take about 4 per cent of the UK market by the
end of 1996.
It applied also for an international telecommunications licence in February.
Ionica is a new enterprise set up by telecommunications executives. It
expects to take about 5 per cent of the UK market within 10 years.
The DTI is expected to invite comments from the public on its proposal to
award the licences to the companies. After a two-month consultation period,
the licences will have to win final approval from parliament.
The development represents the first significant step in opening up the
domestic telecommunications industry since cable television operators were
granted the right, in the government's duopoly review, to operate local
networks without the consent of either British Telecommunications or Mercury
Communications.
The licences are expected to lead to a number of telecommunications services
for subscribers at substantially lower rates than those currently charged by
BT.
Ionica plans to provide national telecommunications services based on radio
systems.
National Network, which already provides a private telephone service over
the Post Office's internal network, plans to invest about Pounds 150m in the
next few years to build up its own fibre-optic network.
The company already provides a telecommunications service to private
customers at rates up to 30 per cent below BT's and 15 per cent below
Mercury's. The new licence would enable it to extend its service to smaller
customers.
World Communications, which also has a private telecommunications service in
the UK, expects to benefit from the international traffic opportunities that
the licence would bring.

The government's proposed 'one-stop' service for benefit claimants may lead
to a cut in Civil Service jobs, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary,
said yesterday, David Owen writes.
Launching a discussion document outlining options for the system, Mr Lilley

The agency, the largest executive agency within the Department of Social
Security, has about 70,000 staff.
The new system - part of a drive by the government to improve efficiency in
its biggest-spending department - will enable claimants to apply for a range
of benefits in the same place, eventually on a single form.
Mr Lilley said the new system would reduce errors, cut costs and crack down
on fraud.
Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat social-security spokesman, said the
shake-up did 'nothing at all to address the inadequacy and anomaly-ridden
social security legislation, which requires urgent and radical reform'.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said he hoped the changes
were moti vated by 'a genuine desire to improve the system for its users and
not just to cut costs'.

FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Brussels starts 'dumping' probe into
ethanolamine

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has opened an investigation into alleged 'dumping'
of ethanolamine by the US, Andrew Hill reports from Brussels. Community
chemicals companies claim that ethanolamine, used in cosmetics and
pharmaceuticals, was sold at artificially low prices in the Community
between 1988 and 1991.
They say US sales rose by 38 per cent in the period, from 40,660 tonnes to
56,197 tonnes, and the market share of US producers rose from 31.3 per cent
to 39.2 per cent. Cefic, the European chemical companies' trade association,
said the boom in cheap US imports prompted a 7 per cent drop in EC
production during the three-year period and a 14 per cent slump in capacity
utilisation.
Reuter adds: The EC is making anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean
car radios permanent, it said yesterday. The Community's Official Journal
said it was setting the duty at 34.4 per cent, with reduced rates for 18
companies which co-operated in its investigation. Goldstar will pay 3.9 per
cent duties, Hyundai Electronic Industries 10.8 per cent and Samsung
Electronics 20.8 per cent.

FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: German rolling-stock maker puts hopes in
Russia - But the Treuhand-owned company wonders how long the good luck will
last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Waggonbau AG (DWA), Germany's largest producer of rolling stock, is
rare among western companies for remaining stubbornly optimistic about the
Russian market.
DWA continued exporting its long-distance passenger carriages and freight
cars to Russia in the first half of this year as most German companies
reported falling sales to the east. Even more remarkably, its Russian
customers were able to pay for the deliveries. But the Treuhand-owned
company is wondering how long the good luck will last. Russia until now has
allotted hard currency for passenger and freight car imports as they are
regarded as top priority items. In a vast country with only minuscule road
transport, virtually nothing moves except by rail.
With its headquarters in east Berlin and five factories in east Germany, DWA
was Comecon's leading producer of rail passenger carriages and
special-purpose freight cars, and a major supplier of the Soviet State
Railway since 1948. Some 70 per cent of its projected total sales this year
of DM2.2bn (Pounds 780m) are to Russia and other republics of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Mr Kurt-Friedrich Ladendorf, a
west German member of the executive board of DWA, spoke of the risks
remaining for the company in the second half of this year. Despite 100 per
cent coverage by the German government's Hermes export credit guarantees,
and payment guarantees by the Russian government, there was no way of
knowing whether the Russians would continue to pay their bills.
Meanwhile, DWA has purchased the raw materials and semi-manufactures to
fulfil the Russian orders, incurring heavy costs, Mr Ladendorf said. For the
entire year the Russians contracted for 1,300 passenger carriages and 150
refrigerated trains consisting of five wagons each. Next year, the Russian
Railway wants to buy 830 passenger carriages and the other CIS republics
100-150 units, an overall drop of 22 per cent. Interest was expressed in
buying 100 refrigerated trains but Mr Ladendorf said the number was expected
to be reduced to 30. This was less than tragic, though, as DWA was barely
earning money on its sales of refrigerated wagons.
Over the next three years, exports to the CIS were likely to drop to 50 per
cent of total sales, with the German Federal Railway and regional commuter
systems taking most of the remaining half. 'It makes no sense trying
forcefully to reduce the eastern business. We are making money on the sales
and are contributing to the transport sector of the CIS,' he explained.
DWA's undisclosed earnings last year included a significant portion set
aside as reserves in anticipation of more difficult times ahead.
To ensure it remains competitive in the Russian market, DWA is negotiating
with Russia's biggest producer of long-distance passenger carriages, Tver
Railway Wagon, to set up a joint venture based in Tver. The Germans have
already installed new machinery at the Russian factory to boost its poor
output. A new plant to produce up to 1,000 rail waggons would be erected and
an existing factory producing rail equipment for the armed forces converted
to civilian production.
Mr Ladendorf estimated DWA needed to invest up to DM300m in the new plant,
while the Russians would invest an equivalent amount in roubles. While DWA
could come up with its share out of earnings, the Russian government would
have to subsidise the investment by the Tver company, which sells its entire
output to Russian Railways.
'The question is whether the Russians can finance such a development. We
believe the west will have to provide help,' Mr Ladendorf says. . Such
assistance in the critically-important transport sector was more beneficial
than selling computer plants to Russia.
The uncertainties of trading with the CIS republics has a direct influence
on DWA's prospects for privatisation. Mr Ladendorf envisages that 51 per
cent of DWA will be sold to an investor (Siemens, ABB and AEG have shown
interest) while 49 per cent would remain with Treuhand. This would allow the
agency to achieve a 'fair price' whenever it chose to sell its share.
All three bidders have expressed concern about the risks involved in DWA's
strong CIS business and for this reason are not interested in a majority
share. For its part, Treuhand is under no great pressure to sell DWA, as it
is one of the few former state companies which until now has made a profit.
Meanwhile, DWA has somewhat lessened its reliance on the CIS market by its
DM500m contract with the Bundesbahn and east German Reichsbahn; it hopes
shortly to land a Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m) contract from Amtrak in the US
for 50 viewliner passenger cars with options on another 170 units. But the
deal would not be profitable with the dollar below DM1.50. Mr Ladendorf,
like other German exporters, hopes the dollar will strengthen soon.

FT  11 AUG 92 / US raid on Iraq 'was set for August 6'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US called off a bombing raid on Iraq scheduled for August 6 after
pressure from the United Nations, the Washington-based magazine Aviation
Week and Space Technology reported yesterday.
As a UN inspection team spent its second day hunting for Iraq's military
secrets yesterday, the magazine quoted a 'senior Joint Chiefs of Staff
official' as saying that F-117 stealth bombers, Tomahawk cruise missiles and
B-52 bombers armed with air-launched missiles were to have been used against
Iraq last week.
The raid was cancelled because of opposition from the UN and concerns that a
confrontation last month, when a UN team attempted to inspect a Ministry of
Agriculture building in Baghdad, was not serious enough to warrant a
military strike.
It was the second cancellation this year, the official said. The previous
planned raid, in March, was aimed at destroying Iraqi missile manufacturing
plants.
The Bush administration had ordered the air force to be ready to strike
quickly if Iraq resisted the next important inspection, the official added.
Such attacks would target Iraqi units and equipment near Kurdish positions
in the north of the country and Shia positions in the south. They would
concentrate on destroying aircraft and helicopters, some of which were used
against rebel Shia positions late last month, according to western defence
sources.
Other targets would include radar installations and factories for tank
assembly and the manufacture of missile propellant. The US might also try to
kill Iraq's President Saddam Hussein and his staff, according to the report.
The administration has been striving to keep up psychological pressure on
the Iraqi regime. About 40 US warships are near Iraq and the US Air Force
has dozens of aircraft within striking distance of Baghdad.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Old wounds still trouble Nicaragua: Land disputes have
plagued the government since it took powerin 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the lush coffee plantations of Matagalpa, central Nicaragua, about 200
peasants at the Santa Maria farm are prepared to fight rather than hand over
the land to the pre-revolutionary owner.
'I fought for this country and now they want to take what little I have,'
says Mr Renaldo Garcia, a worker who has lived at Santa Maria for eight
years. He and his colleagues farm a few acres of corn on the state-owned
plantation, on which they depend for their daily food ration.
They will not let the old owner back to the plantation unless they are
promised access to these plots.
Similar disputes have plagued Nicaragua since Mrs Violeta Chamorro and her
multi-party UNO alliance defeated the Sandinista government in February 1990
elections. The right wing is livid that more land has not been given back;
the leftist peasant unions are angry that their members have been turfed off
theirs; and many former Sandinista army troops and their one-time Contra
rebel opponents have taken up arms again after government promises of land
were not kept.
Land disputes have spilled over into a fierce debate about the continued
Sandinista influence in the government, a row that could topple the
government. Last week, in an apparent attempt to get the US Congress to lift
its hold on more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 52m) of aid, the government
agreed to fire Mr Rene Vivas, the Sandinista chief of police.
His removal was a principal demand of the conservative and liberal
opposition in Nicaragua and of Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who
heads right-wing congressional efforts to put US aid on hold. They claim the
police and army have favoured Sandinistas in land disputes, and aided
takeovers of farms by former Sandinista soldiers.
Mrs Chamorro has let the Sandinistas run the army and police - and
repeatedly vetoed proposals from within the UNO alliance to reverse some of
the land nationalisations carried out by them - to gain Sandinista support
for her orthodox economic stabilisation programme.
In the past two years the government has slashed spending, privatised
industries and let in imports, turning what was once a state-run economy
into one of the more liberal on the continent.
Mr Francisco Mayorga, the former central bank governor, describes the result
as the 'most remarkable stabilisation in all Latin America'. Inflation,
exceeding 7,000 per cent in 1990, was less than 2 per cent in the first half
of this year. The exchange rate of 5 cordobas to a dollar has been stable
for more than a year, and the government budget is in surplus.
The Sandinistas are still the most potent political party in Nicaragua. They
run most of the unions and can call a general strike when they wish. Mr
Antonio Lacayo, the president's son-in-law and minister of the presidency,
argues: 'If the government had opted for the traditional policy of
confrontation that is normal in our political culture there would have been
no democratic opening, nor economic stabilisation. The social costs caused
by the budget tightening could not have been undertaken without a climate of
tolerance and understanding.'
But the strategy is now in danger of falling apart.
Last week the three leading members of UNO - Vice-President Virgilio Godoy,
Mr Alfredo Cesar, president of the National Assembly, and Mr Arnoldo Aleman,
mayor of Managua - called an unprecedented joint press conference to demand
that the heads of the army and police stand down, and that the government
return more nationalised land to its previous owners.
The private sector has been equally critical of the rapprochement with the
Sandinistas, blaming it for low private and foreign investment.
The Chamorro government also risks being squeezed from the left. The sacking
of Mr Vivas brought an angry response from Sandinistas, who blamed the
change on pressures from the US.
The Sandinista grassroots organisation is increasingly opposed to the
government's austere economic policy. Nearly half of adult Nicaraguans are
out of work, and average income is about Dollars 430 per person. Despite
foreign aid equal to more than half Nicaragua's GDP this year, low coffee
and cotton prices will slow economic growth from a projected 4-5 per cent to
just 1.5 per cent, says Mr Lacayo. It will be the ninth successive year that
per capita GNP will have fallen.
Students and many workers are on strike, protesting against budget cuts or
low wages. Peasants are flooding into Nicaragua, with the city estimated to
grow by 8-9 per cent this year.
A doctor used to visit the Santa Maria farm every eight days, says Mr Garcia
 -but there has not been a visit for more than a year. About half the 80
children do not go to school and few receive the once-mandatory
inoculations.
Most if not all of these problems are a result of a decade of war, blockade
and economic mismanagement. Nicaragua is at least now entering the world
economy and, argues Mr Lacayo, the conditions for economic growth have been
laid. But unless the politicians bury their differences, the economy may
never have the chance to take off.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Call for 'Iraqgate' prosecutor rejected: White House risks
another clash with Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration risked another election year confrontation with
Congress yesterday when the attorney-general rejected the House judiciary
committee's request that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate
the 'Iraqgate' affair.
Mr William Barr said the committee's letter of July 9 requesting he appoint
a prosecutor 'contains vague and general allegations and lists a number of
statutes that may have been violated'.
This lack of specifics, he said in a written reply to Congressman Jack
Brooks, panel chairman, did not mean the case was closed but that the
conditions laid down in the act, passed after the Watergate scandal and
empowering the appointment of a special prosecutor, had not been met.
This is the 10th occasion that Congress has made such a request and the
first rejection by an attorney-general. The authority of the act, of which
Mr Barr and President George Bush have been conspicuous critics, expires in
December unless renewed by Congress.
Iraqgate covers the actions allegedly taken by the administration consequent
on the US 'tilt' towards Baghdad, starting in the mid-1980s at the height of
the Iran-Iraq war and continuing until shortly before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
They include fraudulent loans to Iraq channelled through the Atlanta branch
of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the misuse of loan guarantees
offered by the Department of Agriculture, and the alteration of Commerce
Department export certificates to conceal the supply of arms and other
technology relevant to Iraq's military development.
Throughout the congressional investigations, involving half a dozen separate
committees, there have been complaints that the administration has
persistently withheld evidence. Mr Barr's refusal to appoint a prosecutor
will doubtless cause these to grow, although it also leaves the door open to
Mr Brooks and Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking
committee, to make a second approach, naming those suspected of having
broken the law.
The administration has countered that Congress's motives are purely
political and designed to embarrass the president's re-election campaign.
Similar criticism has been directed from the White House at the activities
of the independent prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair.

FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Pakistan Dollars 1.7bn private-sector
power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pakistan government and power authorities have signed a Dollars 1.7bn
(Pounds 890m) contract with a western consortium clearing the way for
building a 1,292MW oil-fired power station at Hub Chowki, 50km west of
Karachi.
The project is the first undertaken by the private sector under the
government's restructuring programme. By the time it is completed in four
years, it will boost the country's power capacity by over 15 per cent.
The contract, which has been under negotiation for more than four years, was
signed by Mr SR Poonegar, secretary of the Water and Power Ministry; Mr
Mumtaz Hameed, chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority
(Wapda), and Mr Mohammed Alireza, chairman of the Hab River Power Group
(HubCo), set up to operate the power station. Mr Alireza is chairman of
Saudi Arabia's Xenel Industries, the Hab project's chief sponsoring company.
A project official, noting the deal has been nearly sewn up twice before,
stressed that this time it had been signed, not just initialled.
The stumbling block had been western bankers' concerns over the threat that
Islamic, or interest-free, banking rules could have for the project.
They had withheld a pledge to provide Dollars 360m in commercial finance for
the scheme, but been assured under the implementation agreement in the
overall contract that their investment would be protected, even if the
Pakistan Supreme Court upheld an Islamic court ruling that charging interest
was against the tenets of Islam.
The other two aspects of the deal were the power purchase accord, covering
the commercial tariffs at which HubCo will sell electricity into the
national grid, and the fuel buying agreement, covering deliveries by the
Pakistan State Oil Company of imported oil needed to run the power station.
The project is being undertaken on a build-own-operate basis with the
sponsors running the company as a self-contained, private-sector utility
alongside the state-owned Wapda. The scheme was structured by the World
Bank, which will provide one-third of the financing under its Private Sector
Energy Development Fund.
This provides long-term finance at commercial rates, with an upfront grace
period. Its purpose is to broaden the private-sector equity investment in
the new power company. The first power from the four 323MW units is expected
in 40 months.
Chief equipment suppliers are Japan's Mitsui (consortium leader), IHI of
Japan (boilers), Ansaldo of Italy (turbines), and Campenon Bernard of France
(civil engineering).

FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US throws out 12 complaints on steel trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US International Trade Commission yesterday threw out 12 complaints of
unfair steel trade - including two cases against the UK - after a
preliminary investigation failed to turn up evidence that those steel
imports were injuring US companies.
The cases were among 84 unfair trade complaints filed by the US steel
industry in June.
The remaining 72 cases will now be sent to the US Commerce Department, which
determines whether companies have been given unfair advantage through
government subsidies or dumping their steel 'at less their fair market
value' in the US market.
The Commerce Department has been so swamped by the filing that officials
have extended the usual investigation period. A preliminary determination of
countervailing duty complaints was delayed until November 27 and
anti-dumping complaints until January 23.
After its first finding, the Commerce Department will investigate further
for a final determination before sending the complaints back to the ITC for
its own last ruling.
Some cases may get eliminated throughout this process. In fact, two of the
six ITC commissioners yesterday complained that many of the petitioners and
respondents had failed to provide 'sufficient compelling factual information
to substantiate their claims'.
By a 5-1 vote, the Commission said the US industry had not been injured by
imports of cold-rolled products from the UK. However, two complaints remain
against imports of British cut-to-length plate.
Other trade cases dismissed yesterday were against Japan, Italy, Australia,
and New Zealand. The big winner of the day was Taiwan which had all four
complaints tossed out.
Dr Hans Mueller, a steel expert with Middle Tennessee state university, told
the commission last month the immediate goal of the US companies was 'to
break steel buyers' resistance to price increases.'
The companies, he said, hoped to take advantage of election year politics.
'The votes in several major steel states are at stake, sufficient reason
even for a free trade president to opt for new restrictions on imported
steel.'

The changing of the top management guard at Sun Alliance Group, Britain's

manager in charge of group planning, has been appointed to the main board,
as has Peter Taylor, 52, the managing director of Sun Alliance Life. Both

Scott Nelson, 53, general manager responsible for corporate finance, was put

Brian Wright retired as an executive director in April, but remains on the
board, and Geoffrey Browne and Eric Coward have retired rec-ently.
The normal retirement age at Sun Alliance is 62 and if 60-year-old Roger
Neville, who has been chief executive since June 1987, follows in his
pre-decessor's footsteps, he could be expected to step down over the next
year or two.
If he did, then the market speculation is that Roger Taylor, 50, who has

FT  11 AUG 92 / Phantoms that haunt the banking network: Banks admit to
stream of complaints over auto-teller withdrawals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTO-TELLER machine systems in use today strike a compromise between cost
and effectiveness.
Contrary to what the banks would like customers to believe, the systems are
vulnerable to hardware and software glitches. However, most experts believe
risks of 'phantom withdrawals' are small compared with human error or
attempts to defraud.
Banks are now being forced to accept that their auto-teller networks are
fallible. Barclays this year admitted that a fault persisted for several
days in the interbank Visa network. It resulted in all rejected auto-teller
transactions for non-Barclays Visa cards being debited in spite of the
rejection.
Miss Elizabeth Bellot, an accountant from the Channel Islands who banks with
TSB, tried to withdraw cash from a Barclays cash machine during a visit to
Crewe in February last year. She was refused, but returned home to discover
that she had been debited Pounds 600 for the attempted withdrawals.
The machine at Crewe was not malfunctioning, Barclays said, adding: 'We
remain satisfied that the integrity of our ATM network remains secure.' The
bank has, however, been unable to explain further the nature of the fault.
No two auto-teller systems are alike, but the principles are universal. The
technology that exists - data written on a magnetic stripe on a card used in
conjunction with a personal identification number (PIN) - is cheap but
vulnerable.
Its main shortcoming is its inability to tell a genuine card-holder from a
fraud. If a card and the corresponding PIN are presented, and the cash
withdrawal is within agreed limits, it will be authorised.
The system has no knowledge of the individual initiating the transaction.
Responsibility for keeping the card secure and the PIN secret lies with the
cardholder.
A stolen card is comparatively easy to copy. On the front it bears the
customer's primary account number, usually a combination of the customer's
account number and branch clearing code, together with some administration
characters.
On the back is a magnetic stripe, divided into three tracks. Track one was
defined historically for airline use only; track three is no longer used by
UK banks - at one time it recorded amounts withdrawn when some banks
operated auto-tellers both on-line and off-line. On-line working is now used
throughout the UK - every transaction is referred immediately for validation
of the card, PIN and amount. Track two contains up to 40 bytes of
information, which can include the primary account number, expiry date and
cryptographic keys.
The technology used to write and read the magnetic stripe is simple. Sweden,
however, is experimenting with deeper levels of magnetisation to 'watermark'
cards.
Fraudsters could therefore duplicate a stolen card. If they had access to
the corresponding PIN, the card could be used to make withdrawals until the
theft was discovered.
Creating an entirely false card is a different proposition. During a
transaction, the PIN is combined with information from the primary account
number in a complicated piece of mathematics that may involve a hardware
security module - a sealed, tamper-resistant box of encryption electronics -
to create a message that includes the amount of the transaction and certain
security codes.
That message is despatched to the issuer's computer centre where it is
checked - again possibly using a hardware security module. The PIN is not
decoded; experts say it should never appear 'in the clear' during validation
and authentication, and there is no reason anybody in the bank should be
able to learn it.
The fact remains that an auto-teller network is made by humans, and is
therefore susceptible to human ingenuity. An experienced computer engineer
could undoubtedly learn a customer's PIN, given enough time. But that would
be of little use without the primary account number and other cryptographic
codes.
Phantom withdrawals are a very British concern. There are roughly equal
numbers of auto-tellers in the US, Europe and Japan (about 100,000 each) yet
disputed withdrawals seem comparatively rare in the US, where there is more
concern about being mugged after making a withdrawal.
To improve the system, the banks are considering including 'message
authentication codes' which would virtually guarantee the integrity of
messages sent between auto-tellers and host computers.
So-called smart cards, with complete computer systems built in, are
intrinsically more secure than magnetic-stripe cards, but significantly more
expensive. They are virtually impossible to forge and all the encryption
technology can be built into the card itself. But smart cards can be stolen.
The real answer is positive identification of the customer when the
transaction is initiated.
Banks are beginning to consider installing cameras within auto-tellers to
photograph customers. Signature verification is a more attractive
possibility, but that technology is relatively immature. It also has to be
made capable of working in the harsh conditions of the real world -
auto-tellers suffer from wear and tear and shoppers struggling with their
bags may not like the trouble of signing their names.
Other possibilities include a range of biometric measurements - eye retinal
patterns, sweat analysis, fingerprint recognition. That could attract
objections both from civil-rights groups and customers.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Simple technology for fraudsters: Equipment to duplicate
cards widely available
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAGNETIC bank cards are notoriously easy to duplicate if you have a copy of
the original. Experts and fraudsters alike claim that duplicates - known as
'white cards' - can be made with just two pieces of information: the
personal identification number (PIN) and the account number. Banks say more
information is required.
Blank cards cost 4p to 5p each and the cheapest machine to write on the
magnetic stripe can be bought for about Pounds 750. The same technology
costs Pounds 300 in Germany.
'The market in magnetic-stripe machinery is fairly open,' says Mr Chris
Bell, managing director of Data-stripe, a specialist company based in
Surrey, which makes the Magnetic Stripe Card Writer. 'Plastic cards have a
wide range of uses, so it is quite difficult to keep a close eye on the
market.'
Datastripe subjects customers to rigorous questioning and reports suspicious
inquiries to the police. The secondhand market is less well controlled and
the technology is readily available elsewhere in Europe, the Far East and
the US.
PINs are not for sale, but can be obtained by 'shouldering' cardholders  -
watching them to discover their PINs.
There are three main methods, according to Mr Ross Anderson, a Cambridge
University cryptologist. Fraudsters can stand behind holders and watch them
tap in their numbers; they can use a pair of binoculars; or they can use a
high-definition video camera to record people using auto-tellers, with the
time of the transaction coded on the videotape, so the receipts frequently
discarded by users can be identified later. Account numbers are printed on
many receipts.
Technological expertise is not required to make the cards, according to Mr
Bell: 'Sixth-form colleges and universities are teaching their engineering
students how to make magnetic-stripe cards.'
It takes a couple of seconds to write the PIN and account number on the
blank card. All cash cards conform to international formats that are
detailed in published documents.
'The method will not work every time, but the success rate seems to be quite
high,' says Mr David Leiper, managing director of Innovative Electronic
Technology, an access-control-card specialist.
Mr Richard Tyson-Davies, of the Association of Payment Clearing Services,
denies that this kind of fraud can be done. 'It is not possible to copy a
card with just the PIN and the account number.'
However, Mr Stephen Edell, one of the building society ombudsmen, is
investigating whether a 'white card' could be produced with just a PIN and
account number.
Banks maintain that auto-tellers are secure and can be breached only if
cards are lost and PINs given away.
Nevertheless, a number of cases of 'shouldering' have occurred. In
post-trial testimony, Mr Andrew Stone told how he stood in queues watching
people type their PINs. He picked up the receipts and made duplicate cards.
If he failed to see the PIN he would use the card in a supermarket,
sometimes signing his name as 'Mickey Mouse'. Mr Stone was eventually
prosecuted for defrauding the Switch system.
Mr Tyson-Davies says he did not believe Mr Stone's post-trial testimony.
However, Mr Stone's techniques were not novel. The first recorded case of
'shouldering' occurred in New York in the mid 1980s, where a dismissed
auto-teller technician withdrew substantial sums through the system.
Other techniques employed to defraud auto-tellers include the use of dummy
machines. In 1988 US fraudsters set up a cigarette-vending machine in a
shopping mall that would accept bank cards and PINs. Information was
recorded and used to forge cards. UK fraudsters are now operating similar
scams. In High Wycombe market, a gang set up a stall where cut-price goods
could be bought only with a bank card.
Internal bank fraud is also a possibility, although banks maintain that
tight security procedures rule that out.
In March, however, Mr Anthony Pratt, a computer engineer for Clydesdale
Bank, was found guilty of stealing Pounds 17,000 from auto-teller machines
belonging to the Clydesdale and TSB. He attached a hand-held computer to
machines and it collected data from the cards fed in.

FT  11 AUG 92 / A trying time for debit victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM LAWRENCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE experience of losing money, combined with having to persuade a bank or
building society that the withdrawal was not your fault, is often traumatic.
In some cases it has led to illness.
Mrs Jean McConville's doctor says she has suffered from nervousness, lack of
sleep, headaches and vomiting as a result of her year-long tussle with
Barclays Bank.
The dispute started in July last year when Mrs McConville and her husband
James, from St Helens, Merseyside, had their Barclays Connect cards stolen.
Although they reported the loss immediately they were later debited Pounds
406 for auto-teller machine withdrawals.
Mr and Mrs McConville say they could not have made the withdrawals: they had
never used their cards to withdraw cash. In fact the couple destroyed their
personal identification numbers (PINs) as soon as they received them,
without memorising them, keeping the cards to guarantee cheques.
'The whole episode has caused us great distress,' says Mrs McConville. 'As a
result of the unauthorised withdrawals, three direct debits were refused and
one cheque bounced. Our reputation has been tarnished.'
Mr Vincent Leigh, an electrical engineer from Stalybridge, Cheshire, found
his family a target for suspicion after he was debited Pounds 3,200 on a TSB
bank card he had never used. The bank suggested his parents might have made
the withdrawals.
'They were made to feel like criminals, even though they are an elderly
couple who have banked with the TSB all their lives,' says Mr Leigh. 'My
parents do not know how to use a video recorder, never mind a hole in the
wall.'
Their innocence was established when Mr Leigh remembered he had kept the
envelope containing his PIN number - unopened. The TSB gave Mr Leigh an ex
gratia refund of Pounds 3,200, although no explanation was provided.
When Mr Richard Hancock, a manager in a computer services company, found
that Pounds 6,070 had been withdrawn from his NatWest account without his
authority, the bank pointed first to his wife, then to his children.
'The bank manager even suggested that my six-year-old son or eight-year-old
daughter could have made the withdrawals as a result of blackmail,' says Mr
Hancock.
Mr Denis Whalley - the solicitor representing 400 'phantom-withdrawal
victims' - claims he has eliminated cases where someone other than the
holder could have had access to the card and PIN.
If Mr Whalley is successful in his action against the banks and building
societies, thousands of card holders may have their bank balances - if not
their faith in auto-teller machines - restored.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING clearing banks speak with a single voice about phantom withdrawals.
They all follow the same line as Barclays, the largest issuer of payment
cards in the UK. 'Our contention is that phantom withdrawals do not occur in
the way it is popularly believed,' it says. 'We have every confidence in the
complete security of our system.'
National Westminster, the second-largest UK bank, says: 'It is not possible
to take money out of an account without access to both the information on
the magnetic stripe and the personal identification number (PIN). We do not
believe that spontaneous transactions by the computer systems are possible.'
It says 'categorically' that it is not possible to make a working credit
card from a NatWest receipt, even if the PIN is known.
Lloyds says: 'So far as we know, there has never been a cash-machine
withdrawal without the PIN number being used.'
All the banks acknowledge a stream of complaints from customers who believe
they have suffered from phantom withdrawals. Some banks privately admit
making ex gratia payments to some customers.
'There are cases when customers genuinely forget having taken out money from
a machine and we cannot take matters forward from that,' one says. 'We are
not prepared to say to good customers that we are accusing you or your
family of dishonesty.'
All the banks are adamant that checks on suspect transactions suggest that
phantom withdrawals never take place. 'We sometimes find that the audit may
not balance, but there is always a clear-cut explanation, for example two
Pounds 10 notes being stuck together in the machine,' says Lloyds.
In spite of such unanimity, customers have gained the whip hand in the last
year in one important respect. The code of banking practice places the onus
of proving what has gone wrong in disputed transactions on the banks and
limits the customer's liability on losses to Pounds 50 where the customer is
not clearly to blame.
So even if you cannot prove to your bank that there are such things as
phantom withdrawals, if one should befall you, most of the losses will be
footed by your bank.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Tougher waste rules will cost Pounds 19m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER NEW licences for the disposing of waste, which come into effect next
year, will cost businesses about Pounds 19m a year, the government said
yesterday.
A consultation paper from the Department of the Environment proposes that
the maximum penalty in a magistrates court for dumping waste or treating it
without a licence will rise from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 20,000 and/or six
months in prison,
The proposals are intended to reduce discrepancies between local standards
and to help move the cost of waste disposal from the taxpayer to the
producer of waste.
Local authorities, which will retain responsibility for waste disposal until
the government's Environment Agency is created, will judge whether licence
holders are 'fit and proper' by looking at whether they have criminal
convictions for environmental offences, at their technical competence and at
their financial resources. They will charge for licences, at a rate set
nationally, to help pay for enforcement. There is no charge at present.
Licence holders will not be able to cancel licences until they have
satisfied authorities that there is unlikely to be long-term pollution from
gases or from poisons leaching into the soil. At present, holders can cancel
the licence when they choose, usually when they finish dumping.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said yesterday:
'This is a step in the right direction, but there is a risk that
unscrupulous waste disposers will now rush to turn in their licences before
next April.'

<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, are to be members of the government's public expenditure
committee, announced last month.
The other members are Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who will serve as
chairman; Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury; Mr William
Waldegrave, public service and science minister, and Mr Tony Newton and Lord
Wakeham, leaders respectively of the Commons and the Lords.
The committee, which meets for the first time next month, will seek to
ensure that the government sticks to its planning total for public
expenditure by arbitrating on individual departmental bids.
The body will submit a list of options for meeting the planning total to the
cabinet, which will decide departmental allocations. The regime is intended
to demonstrate the extent of government determination to limit increases in
the public-sector borrowing requirement by linking spending to the expected
low economic growth in the next few years.
Downing Street said yesterday that Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine had been
appointed in their capacity as spending ministers. Since some committee
decisions might have implications for legislation it was sensible to have
two ministers involved who handled legislative matters.

ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the ac-countancy firm, is to pay up to Pounds 1.44m in
compensation to shareholders in Sound Diffusion, the failed electrical
equipment manufacturer to which it was auditor and adviser.
The firm has agreed to offer all shareholders in Sound Diffusion 25 per cent
of the value of rights exercised in a Pounds 9.94m rights issue in May 1988,
seven months before the company went into receivership.
Mr David Wilson, national marketing partner at Ernst &amp; Young, emphasised
yesterday that the firm did not accept any liability, but felt it had a
'moral responsibility' to offer the same terms as those agreed with one
shareholder in a legal action concluded last month. In early July it agreed
to pay Pounds 1.35m to Tunstall Group, the security and communications
equipment supplier, which bought Pounds 1.7m of Sound Diffusion shares in
the rights issue.
Mr Wilson said shareholders should contact Ernst &amp; Young's solicitors,
McKenna &amp; Co to make their claims.
Arthur Young took over as auditor to Sound Diffusion from Ernst &amp; Whinney in
1987. The two firms merged in 1989 to become Ernst &amp; Young.
A Department of Trade &amp; Industry inquiry into Sound Diffusion said: 'Arthur
Young either failed to identify or otherwise accepted serious defects in the
company's lease accounting practices and did not adequately audit the amount
receivable under finance leases.'

FT  11 AUG 92 / Lord Devlin: an original legal mind - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD DEVLIN, the former law lord who died on Sunday aged 86, became the
youngest High Court judge this century when he was appointed to the Queen's
Bench Division at the age of 42 in 1948.
He retired early in 1964 after only three years in the House of Lords and it
was said that the law had lost one of the finest and most original legal
minds of his generation.
His fellow law lord, Lord Reid, commenting on his decision to stand down at
the age of 58, said: 'He could have been the greatest among us.'
His reasons for taking early retirement, at a time when there was no
compulsory retirement age for senior judges, were never made clear.
Later he said he had resigned because he found the work in the House of
Lords 'so utterly boring'.
It has also been suggested that he saw little prospect of further
advancement under a Conservative administration, having fallen out with the
Macmillan government over his 1959 inquiry into the disturbances in
Nyasaland and having been passed over for the job of Master of the Rolls in
1962.
His early retirement from the bench did not signal retirement from public
life. In 1964 he was appointed chairman of the Press Council, the first
person from outside the industry to hold that position.
In recent years he became a staunch campaigner on behalf of the Guildford
Four and the Maguire Seven.
From 1971-72 he was a member of the committee on identification in criminal
cases and from 1969 to 1991 he was high steward of Cambridge University.
Patrick Arthur Devlin was born in 1905 and educated at Stonyhurst College
and Christ's College, Cambridge.
In 1932 he married Madeleine Oppenheimer, youngest daughter of Sir Bernard
Oppenheimer. They had four sons and twin daughters.
He took silk in 1945 and was appointed attorney general of the Duchy of
Cornwall two years later.
He was appointed to the High Court bench in October 1948, the Court of
Appeal in 1960 and the House of Lords a year later, taking the title Baron
of West Wick.
He presided over many celebrated cases, including the trial for murder of
John Bodkin Adams, the Eastbourne doctor acquitted after being accused of
poisoning his elderly patients.
Among his publications was a book he wrote in 1985 about the Adams case,
Easing the Passing, in which he said he did not think Dr Adams was a mass
murderer.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Retirement for all at 60 urged by TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STATE retirement age of 65 for both men and women could be twice as
expensive for the government as harmonising the age at 60, according to the
Trades Union Congress.
In a response to last week's recommendation by the Social Security Advisory
Committee of a pension age of 65, the TUC also says that equalising the age
at 60 is the most socially progressive option and takes account of social
trends and people's wishes.
The advisory committee had agreed with the government that raising the
retirement age of women from 60 to 65, the same as for men, would save
roughly Pounds 3bn a year in additional expenditure. However, in a letter to
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, the TUC says that independent
calculations produced for it show that the choice of 65 might cost Pounds
1.4bn. The cost of equalising the age at 60 might be Pounds 700m.
To arrive at the Pounds 700m cost, the TUC has assumed that economic
activity rates for men aged between 60 and 65 will eventually fall to 30 per
cent from the present 53 per cent.
In arriving at the Pounds 1.4bn figure, the TUC assumes the proportion of
women retiring after 60 would increase to about the same as for men. It also
assumes that about half of the jobs filled by women who postpone retirement
would have been available to job seekers.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said: 'On this basis, an increase
in the state pension age for women actually increases the net cost to the
economy as a whole.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environmental pressure group, yesterday accused the
government of allowing companies to make the UK the worst sea polluter in
western Europe.
It said government data showed that 5,046 tonnes of toxic waste a year was
going into the seas.
It also claimed that a report from the National Rivers Authority (NRA) would
show that this has led to seas off the rivers Thames, Humber, Tees, Tyne,
Wyre, Mersey, Dee, Severn and Solent becoming pollution 'hot spots'.
Mr Tim Birch, Greenpeace toxics campaigner, said: 'The public need to know
the government and NRA are allowing British industry to destroy our rivers
and seas.'
Greenpeace is calling on the government to set clear timetables for the
phasing out of toxic discharges. Its ship Solo is to tour the most polluted
areas, starting with visits to the Wash and the Humber tomorrow.
The campaign is aimed at drawing attention to the problem before western
European environment ministers meet in Paris next month to agree a new
convention to protect seas into the next century.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Head of opera house criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARTS COUNCIL report being prepared on London's Royal Opera House is
understood to be critical of Mr Jeremy Isaacs, the general director, and his
management style.
Arts Council reports are usually uncontroversial and avoid naming
personalities, so the apparent criticism of Mr Isaacs is unexpected.
Reports at the weekend suggested that the preliminary findings of a
wide-ranging review of the Covent Garden site, chaired by Baroness Warnock,
were that the Royal Opera House was run 'with incredible amateurism and all
the precision of a school choir'.
The source of the reports was not named and members of Lady Warnock's
committee denied any involvement. The reports suggested that if the
financial situation at the opera house did not improve 'the only thing to do
is shut it down and start again'.
The report from Lady Warnock's committee is one of the periodic assessments
of its clients ordered by the Arts Council, which this year is giving the
three companies linked to Covent Garden - the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet,
and Birmingham Royal Ballet - a total subsidy of Pounds 18.9m.
The final report, which has yet to be compiled, is due to be delivered in
time for the Arts Council's meeting next month. It will be passed on to
Covent Garden, which can publish it if it wishes.
Mr Isaacs' five-year term as director ends in the autumn of next year. In
recent months he has improved the opera house's creative reputation, but
falls in box-office revenue and sponsorship income as a result of the
recession have blocked his ambition to cut the Pounds 3.3m deficit this
year. Mr Isaacs would like to renew his contract but his combative
personality has made him enemies. The criticism may encourage the opera
house board to rally round and announce his reappointment.

Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear stations in

which opened in 1962, presented no danger. It was well within the legal

FT  11 AUG 92 / Whisky exports increase by 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTCH whisky exports increased almost 12 per cent in value during the first
half of the year to a record Pounds 870.7m.
The world's thirst for Scotch raised overseas consumption during the six
months by 6 per cent to 325m bottles - 20m bottles more than in the same
period last year.
Mr James Bruxner, chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: 'At a
time when recession is affecting many countries around the world, the sales
increase is very encouraging.'
Sales in the UK were less encouraging. The 12 months to the end of May
showed a 9 per cent decrease.
Exports to the rest of the European Community, however, rose 10 per cent
during the January-June period to Pounds 344.2m and accounted for 40 per
cent of total exports.
Spain, where demand was boosted by visitors to Expo 92 and the Olympic
Games, led the European growth. Exports in June were worth Pounds 23.5m, 188
per cent higher than in the same month last year. The half-year total showed
an increase of 49 per cent to Pounds 89.9m. Sales to Greece rose 29 per cent
during the six months to Pounds 36.3m; and France recorded a 15 per cent
rise to Pounds 98m.
The figures underlined the importance of EC markets for the industry, said
Mr Bruxner. The threat of higher taxes on Scotch in southern Europe had been
averted largely by the recent EC agreement on a minimum duty level of Pounds
1.10 a bottle. Mr Bruxner said the industry would continue to campaign
against the discriminatory rate of taxation on whisky and other spirits
compared with beer and wine.
A review of the rates by the European Commission is to be completed by the
end of 1994.
Buoyant exports to South America also contributed to the first-half growth.
Sales to Brazil were 87 per cent higher at Pounds 13.95m, while Venezuela
recorded a 36 per cent increase to Pounds 20.2m.
A surge in exports to the US during June, which may have been fuelled by
fears of an increase in import tariffs, lifted the six-month total 10 per
cent higher to Pounds 111m.
Sales to Japan slowed, growing only 6 per cent to Pounds 87m. Over the past
12 months, Japan has been overtaken by Spain as the third-largest market for
Scotch exports.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Business Law: A green 'caveat vendor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WHEATLEY QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United States has gone mad on Superfund, the environmental clean-up
operation. The idea of cleansing a vast country of potential hazardous waste
deposits is excellent but enormously expensive. It has also had some curious
results.
The language of the US Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 (Cercla) is intended to make those who cause
pollution liable for the cost of clean-up and perhaps also for damages for
injury to the public. No one could quarrel with an act aimed at 'making the
polluter pay' and it is the policy of the UK Government to do this.
Accepting that those who control the land are primarily liable, Cercla
recognised that lenders who took security over land which was later found to
be polluted might be saddled with unfair liability.
The Act therefore contained the 'secured lender exemption'. This excludes
from liability the person who ' . . . without participating in the
management of a . . . facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to
protect his security interest'.
The difficulty has been in defining what constitutes 'participating in the
management'. American courts ruled that slight acts, little more than any
prudent lender might take to protect his security, might be sufficient.
The matter progressed further to the disadvantage of the lender when the
Superfund law was addressed for the first time by a Federal Appeals Court in
the case of US v Fleet Factors. The Appeal Court for the Eleventh Circuit
found that a secured lender who took no part in management decisions
previously thought to be safe might still be found liable if the court could
infer that the secured lender could have affected hazardous waste decisions
even if it did not do so.
Lenders who had been careful to avoid participation because of fear of
incurring clean-up liability found that, however careful they had been, they
might still be liable. This might be when their security documentation gave
them a right to exercise some measure of control. Most security
documentation does exactly that.
The Fleet Factors decision threw the American banking system into disarray.
Preconceived and carefully thought out procedures were thrown into doubt.
The San Francisco law firm Brubeck Phleger &amp; Harrison described the impact
on the financial community as amounting to 'near hysteria'.
An article in New Law Journal aptly but dolefully recited:
'The Superfund is underfunded and the Environmental Protection Agency will
seek recovery from any potential deep pocket. Banks, insurance companies,
pensions funds, finance companies and other major lenders are viewed by EPA
as potential targets of opportunity. The public policy announced by Cercla
overrides the bankruptcy code and the debtor or debtor in possession cannot
avoid his responsibilities by abandoning property subject to a clean-up
obligation pursuant to the abandonment procedure of the bankruptcy code. The
donation of a closed plant to charity may not fare any better.'
Some recent decisions in the US have failed to follow the Fleet Factors
case, maintaining that at least actual control is necessary and not only an
'ability to influence'.
But the legal position remains doubtful. So great has been the concern that
there has been activity in Congress regarding lender protection from Cercla
liability. Several bills have been introduced intended to limit that
liability and to exclude property acquired through foreclosure, or that held
in a fiduciary capacity or managed pursuant to an extension of credit.
All but one of the bills, however, is dead. Concern remains in spite of an
EPA final rule (56 Fed. Reg. 28798) which seeks to limit the lender's
liability to cases in which he has 'actual participation in the management
or operational affairs of the debtor'.
There is still a difficulty in drawing the line between the actions of a
prudent lender and those of a genuine manager of the concern in question. In
any event, the rule is not binding on private American litigators who sue
banks as opposed to the EPA itself. The EPA cannot overrule the Court of
Appeals and confusion is worse confounded.
In the UK, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 imposes liability on those
who control waste but, in general, liability is not absolute and those who
take reasonable precautions and exercise reasonable care escape liability.
The Draft EC Directive, however, provides (Clause 2(1)(b)) that 'the person
who had actual control of the waste when the incident giving rise to the
damage . . . ,if he is not able within a reasonable time to identify the
producer . . . ', shall be liable.
Liability is absolute and dependent on fault. In many cases it will be
impossible to identify the producer of the waste, for example, a tip where
waste has been deposited by the public over many years.
The EC directive in its present form is likely to become part of English law
and could spell disaster. The increased danger for lenders would mean that,
as in the US, expensive environmental audits would be required of customers
who borrowed money and offered land as security; there would be a need to
provide other security, which might be impossible, and additional loan
documentation.
Less money would be available for borrowers more expensively. The costs of
lending would escalate and customers would have to foot the extra bill.
Something could still be done by exerting pressure both on the UK Department
of the Environment and on the officials in Brussels. It is only a Draft
Directive and changes could be made, but time for effective lobbying is
short.
If no changes are made, the situation in the UK is likely to be as bad as it
was in the US at the worst moments of the Superfund crisis.
From a practical point of view it is quite bad enough already. Recently an
administrative receiver discovered that land valued at Pounds 1m in the
books of a company was badly contaminated with industrial waste. It had to
be sold for Pounds 1 only. The maxim caveat emptor is rapidly being replaced
by caveat vendor.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Smart cards hit the
streets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the 'smart card' a technology whose time has finally arrived? The recent
decision by the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive, the local
authority in charge of public transport services, to issue smart cards to
passengers is bringing into the limelight a technology that has been
standing in the wings since the late 1980s. These credit-card style devices
that incorporate semiconductor chips have so far failed to live up to the
optimistic projections of manufacturers and market analysts who had
predicted that the smart card would rapidly replace magnetic-stripe cards in
the bank card field and become widely used by the early 1990s. Instead,
while there are several well-known examples of smart card use, such as
French telephone cards and toll road payment schemes, the magnetic stripe
card is still the overwhelming standard for bank cards and for most other
applications. New interest in smart cards has been generated by rising
concerns about the security shortcomings of magnetic cards which can be
fraudulently reproduced using relatively inexpensive equipment. Card forgery
is a growing international problem that is driving a search for technology
solutions. In this environment, banks and other financial institutions are
reassessing smart card technology and watching closely as Manchester
transport officials begin to implement their smart card-based ticketing
system. Initially, the scheme will involve 500,000 cards, to be used on
Manchester's 2,700 buses, the city's 'Metrolink' and rail systems.
Ultimately, the system will require more than 1m cards. Each card will have
a monetary value loaded on to it and will be used as a prepaid ticket. The
cost of each journey will be deducted from the card as the passenger boards
the bus. As well as eliminating delays while passengers fumble in pockets
and purses for change to pay the bus fare, the smart cards will store a
record of journeys taken, providing customers with a record of how they have
used the card. The transport executive will also be able to track ridership
patterns more accurately.
But this is just the beginning. In Manchester, bus riders might also use
their cards to purchase newspapers or coffee for their morning commute.
Ultimately, the cards could be used as debit cards to make cashless
transactions. By renting out space on the memory chips contained in smart
cards to other organisations and then clearing the transactions through
their computer system, the transport executive has opened up a considerable
business opportunity.
If banks have been slow to recognise the potential of smart cards in the
past, the prospect of a transport authority usurping the traditional role of
a high street bank has been enough to grab their attention now.
The advantages of smart cards over conventional magnetic stripe cards were
difficult to define. Coupled with the higher cost of smart cards - about
Pounds 5 per card in large quantities versus about 40p for a magnetic card -
potential reliability problems have discouraged widespread adoption.
However, the Manchester scheme uses 'contactless' smart cards, developed by
GEC Card Technology of Walsall, England. The card has no surface contact and
operates when it is brought within a few centimetres of the reader device
thus avoiding any reliability problems. 'We believe that once contactless
smart cards are seen operating in large numbers, there will be a strong move
from contact smart cards toward the contactless alternative,' says John
Baker, managing director.
However, the bigger challenge is to replace magnetic stripe cards with
contactless smart cards. In this regard, smart cards are finally beginning
to look like a serious contender for space in your wallet. For bank
executives faced with a rising tide of fraud and the threat of competition
for the business of their high street branches there may be little choice
but to adopt the technology.

FT  11 AUG 92 / People: McGrath moves to Evered Bardon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Evered Bardon, the aggregates group whose share price has recently taken a
pasting, has found a finance director whose arrival it hopes will underscore
the new commitment to tighter control.
William McGrath, 33, moves from the same position at Norwest Holst where he
has spent the past two years; he also stepped in as acting managing director
there between January and May when Chris Bucknall left after only a few
months in the job.
A chartered accountant, McGrath had previously accumulated six years'
experience in the City - in the corporate finance departments of Lloyds
Merchant Bank and Kleinwort Benson.
His predecessor at Evered Bardon, John Ford, departed at the end of May;
Ford had been brought into Evered by the Abdullah brothers, who launched the
company on its aggressive spending spree that lasted through most of the
1980s.
'Now, it is all about making what we have got sweat,' says pragmatic group
chief executive Peter Tom, who arrived last year following the merger
between Bardon and Evered. Tom thinks McGrath's style will accurately
reflect the change of priorities since the merger.
'John had a rather exciting relationship with the City. It is a question of
fashion; the City is now looking for something else.' Evered has attracted
criticism not only for its high gearing - which it is in the process of
reducing by a series of disposals - but also for the quality of its accounts
with respect to the valuations placed on past acquisitions.
'I never thought I would be pleased to see 30p,' chuckles Tom, referring to
the 3p gain made by Evered's share price yesterday. The shares, down from a
1992 high of 88p, have underperformed the market by 47 per cent in the last
month alone.
*****
David McGarvey has been named managing director of CLAREMONT GARMENTS
(Holdings), second in seniority on the board to Peter Wiegand, chairman and
chief executive. McGarvey has been a director since the company's demerger
from Alexon Group in July 1991 and the new post involves no extra
responsibilities. 'It's in recognition of what he's been doing for the past
year,' Wiegand said yesterday.
*****
James Fyfe, financial director of MACDONALD MARTIN DISTILLERIES, has also
been appointed deputy md.

Trevor Hart (left) has been promoted from general sales manager for WEETABIX
and joins the board as sales director. Les Comley, sales and marketing

FT  11 AUG 92 / Management: Down and out all round the world - Bankruptcy is
on the increase almost everywhere. But Graham Bannock takes a sanguine view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BANNOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of companies going bankrupt or into liquidation always increases
in a recession.
According to the Department of Trade and Industry, almost 500 companies a
week went into liquidation in the fourth quarter of 1991, and that number
rises to almost 1000 if individual bankruptcies are included.
Although the absolute number of company liquidations is rising, the rate of
increase is falling. In 1991 the year-on-year increase reached a peak of 67
per cent in the second quarter.
It fell to 42 per cent for the third quarter and 20 per cent for the fourth,
and in the first quarter of this year it was down to 17 per cent.
Throughout the 1980s and into 1990 the business population, as measured by
the number of companies and unincorporated businesses registered for VAT,
rose every year.
However, the overall number of company closures rose sharply last year and
there were fewer new incorporations.
The number of live companies registered in the UK fell by 27,000 in 1991.
This was about the same as the last large fall in 1985 and was the largest
drop since 1968.
According to the latest Labour Force Survey, the number of self-employed in
1991 was down by 150,000 on the previous year.
Even after compensating for the steep increase in the turnover threshold
introduced in the 1991 Finance Act, it seems probable that the VAT register
will also show a fall in 1991.
Is this a cataclysm? Does it herald the end of the enterprise revolution?
(No doubt some commentators would claim both.) Is the UK business
population, having grown faster than that of other countries, now set to go
on shrinking faster in this recession?
The short answer to all these questions is 'no', although it is most
unlikely that the rapid rise in the business population in the 1980s will be
repeated in the 1990s.
There are considerable difficulties in comparing failure rates
internationally because of differences in statistical coverage.
Differences in bankruptcy law and commercial culture also affect the
proportion of business closures that results in legal insolvency.
Businesses close for a variety of reasons, including takeover and
retirement. In fact, Michael Daly of the Department of Employment calculates
that of all VAT deregistrations (and there were 185,000 of these in 1990),
only about half were closures. It seems likely that compulsory liquidations
and business-related individual bankruptcies accounted for much less than 20
per cent of all deregistrations.
The average rate of business closures (as distinct from insolvencies) in the
UK appears to be not very different from that in Germany and possibly less
than the United States, but it is difficult to make comparisons with other
countries.
It seems safer to compare trends in insolvencies. Trends should be less
subject to differences in coverage, though even here there are statistical
problems, and trends also need to be interpreted in the light of differences
in the timing of the economic cycle.
The chart shows that since 1988, the UK has indeed suffered relatively badly
compared with Germany and Japan, though it did a little better than Germany
in the last recession.
The UK figures probably understate the deterioration somewhat, because they
exclude business-related individual bankruptcies, which are partly included
in other countries.
The proportion of business-related bankruptcies to total individual
insolvencies seems, however, to have been declining sharply in the UK in the
face of a steep rise in debt-related personal bankruptcies.
The UK trend is much lower than that in the US, where bankruptcy is less of
a stigma, but mirrors it closely.
The 1991 increase has brought the UK trend just above that of France,
which is the only country to have seen an uninterrupted rise in the number
of business insolvencies throughout the period (ignoring a small dip in
1982).
The contrast between the UK, the US and France on one hand, and Japan and
Germany on the other, is marked.
However, even in Japan, insolvencies are now rising, and in Germany, with
its tighter monetary conditions, a reversal in the downward trend seems
probable.
The US and UK positions would have looked somewhat better on a chart using
percentages of the business population, or failure rates, rather than actual
numbers of insolvencies.
The UK in particular saw a spectacular increase in the size of its business
population in the 1980s: up by over two-thirds between 1979 and 1989.
As it is, even in 1991, company liquidations in England and Wales were only
2.2 per cent of the number of live companies on the register, though this
compares with 1.8 per cent at the previous peak in the 1980s.
This is why, as the bad news continues to emerge, it is important to keep
things in perspective.
If the structure of the UK economy is to continue to adapt, large numbers of
business closures are inevitable and will resume their normal level only
some time after economic growth is resumed.
Even in good times, businesses need to close to allow new firms to take up
resources released by closures, as technology, competition and consumer
demand shift and grow.
Economic cycles intensify this process, and if swings in these cycles are
too large or banks get into trouble and have to restrict credit, then good
businesses will be lost.
In some cases this is probably happening now, but it is in the social
interest that even in bad times businessmen should take risks in introducing
new products and services: the more risks are taken, the more failures there
will be.
It is easy for economists to write coldly in this way about the social
interest, and it has to be said that many, if not most business insolvencies
result in personal tragedy for the business owners involved and often for
their employees.
The vast majority of insolvencies, like the vast majority of all businesses,
are small firms.
There are, moreover, differences between the effects of failure in large and
small firms. Most large firms survive insolvency in some sense, through
takeover or restructuring.
In most cases, the worst thing that can happen to a director of an
insolvent, very large company, delinquency apart, is the loss of his or her
job, usually cushioned by a golden handshake.
In a small firm limited liability is no protection against recourse to
personal guarantees by banks and leaseholders, and the owner often loses
all.
At this stage in the economic cycle there is not much that governments can
or should do, while rhetoric will not help the sufferers. The last thing
Britain's battered small business people need is panic action to reflate
demand, and another ride up and down the inflation roller-coaster that would
end again in more insolvencies.
What would help, in addition to sticking to the ERM discipline, is more
action to cut business costs and, in Britain, more esteem for those who,
with good intentions, fail in the interests of economic advance.

Smaller companies account for a disproportionately large share of total job
creation in the UK, according to the latest government findings.
In the service sector, companies employing fewer than 10 people accounted
for half of the new jobs created during 1987 and 1989.
Such companies provided only a quarter of total employment in the sector.
The contrast was even more marked in the production sector. Firms employing
fewer than 10 people accounted for two-fifths of new jobs but provided just
one-tenth of overall employment.

the Job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THOMAS SLEMEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you can get together a few vehicle-owners who have 'The Knowledge' - cab
drivers' jargon for knowing where all the streets of a town are - then you
are well on your way to forming a courier service.
There is a glut of dispatch companies in London and most big cities, but
there is still room for competition in smaller towns.
Courier businesses can require heavy investment if you aim to serve a large
area - and the pay-back period can be long. However, more modest services
limited to one neighbourhood can be quite profitable based on a smaller
outlay.
The basic set-up requires an office with a phone, and a control centre where
an operator can keep in touch with the couriers and relay orders via radio
or bleepers.
The vehicles needn't all be high-powered motorcycles. A car or even a
bicycle will do when delivery time is not too important.
You will have to advertise, and that means using mailshots, and running ads
in the local press or on commercial radio.
A dispatch rider's average delivery radius is around 30 miles, but you will
have to determine your own realistic radius based on your resources.
Small courier companies make a profit of about Pounds 35,000 a year, which
may not seem much. But that is just the average.
There are success stories. In 1976, 21-year-old Richard Gabriel left his job
and set up a dispatch company called Roadrunner with a friend. The venture
was initially a success but later faltered because of partnership problems.
However, Gabriel was determined to continue and had the novel idea of
setting up a national franchise network.
The result was Interlink Express, which was later sold to an Australian
group in 1991 for more than Pounds 36 million.
For professional advice on setting up a courier service, dial 100 and ask
for Freefone Enterprise. They will give you the address of your local Small
Firms Service.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Government outlaws loyalist UDA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday outlawed the Ulster Defence Association, the
largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'satisfied that
the UDA is actively and primarily engaged in the commission of criminal,
terrorist acts and so merits proscription'. For those purposes it acted as
the Ulster Freedom Fighters, he said.
The ban, which came into effect at midnight, means it is an offence to be a
UDA member, to solicit funds or membership for the organisation, or to
participate in any acts of the organisation.
The UDA is the fourth loyalist group to be proscribed - the UFF is already
banned, along with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commandos.
The move was broadly welcomed in London and Dublin and by nationalists in
Northern Ireland. It was strongly criticised by Unionists on the grounds
that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, was not also banned.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said he
did not understand why Sinn Fein 'which is also an organisation deeply
involved in sectarian killings of Protestants' was not proscribed.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the
decision not to ban Sinn Fein showed that the UDA ban was a sop to the
mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party.
Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland security minister, said Sinn Fein's
status was also kept under review. 'Sinn Fein is an organisation which does
not condemn violence, which is thoroughly reprehensible and repugnant,' he
said.
'If the criteria for banning an organisation under the emergency provisions
were to apply to Sinn Fein then we would, in the course of a review, come to
a different decision from what we have come to at the moment.'
The UDA is thought to be responsible for the deaths of about a third of the
more than 2,000 civilians killed in Northern Ireland in the past 23 years.
It said yesterday that it would always be there to 'defend its community'.
Six nationalist terrorist groups are proscribed - the IRA, the Irish
National Liberation Army and four smaller groups.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Republican tussle over policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republican party's platform committee began a final round of meetings in
Houston yesterday designed to resolve two controversies over the policies on
which President George Bush will campaign for re-election.
On the economy, a group of prominent conservative activists including Mr
Jack Kemp, the housing secretary, is pushing for adoption of more radical
tax-cutting measures in a second Bush term.
A second pressure group, mostly moderate Republicans but backed by former
Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the old conservative warhorse, wants to
modify the provisional platform's unequivocal opposition to abortion.
The seven-member Kemp group, which includes Congressman Newt Gingrich of
Georgia and four Republican senators, issued a memorandum over the weekend
claiming that growth could be tripled by cutting the present 15 per cent
minimum rate of tax to 12 per cent and by reducing capital gains taxes to a
maximum of 15 per cent and to zero for long-term investments.
Their proposals also run to a government spending freeze, broader
privatisation, and cuts in entitlement programmes, not excluding social
security.
Mr Gingrich said the chances were high that Mr Bush would embrace the
principles, if not all the details, of the proposals in his acceptance
speech to the party's convention next week.
Mr Clayton Yeutter, the domestic policy adviser, said yesterday that radical
tax cutting might have to wait on progress towards reducing the federal
deficit. However, in an attack on the economic policies of Mr Bill Clinton,
the Democratic candidate, he accepted the importance of tax policy in the
presidential campaign by again claiming that the Clinton blueprint, if
enacted, would constitute the biggest tax increase in US history.
The pressure group's political concerns have long been apparent, as the
memorandum makes clear. If the president 'just resorts to old Republican
exhortations about the balanced budget amendment or the line item veto, the
American people will quickly lose interest.' In practice, the platform will
almost certainly contain both recommendations.
There is little chance the platform will change the 1988 commitment to
outlawing abortion, except in a handful of cases. But in an attempt to show
the party tolerates differences of opinion, Ms Lynn Martin, labour
secretary, will give a nominating address next week. She disagrees with Mr
Bush over abortion.

<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of stock speculators yesterday rampaged through China's
southern city of Shenzhen to denounce alleged corruption over share
allocations, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Shenzhen.
In some of the worst violence to hit China's brief but turbulent flirtation
with stock market capitalism, protestors chanting 'down with corruption'
kicked and beat plain-clothes police, set a van ablaze and overturned
several vehicles.
Near-hysteria has gripped the industrial city, which borders Hong Kong,
since up to a million potential capitalists invaded Shenzhen at the weekend
trying to buy share application forms.
Egged on by official media reports of ordinary Chinese making fortunes in
stock trading, vast numbers of investors have tried to cash in on both
soaring markets.
Allegations in Shenzhen of official corruption abounded. 'We're angry,' said
one protestor. 'Police used their power to get their relatives into the best
places in the queues.'
Riot police fired at least 10 teargas shells in one part of the city, which
is a showcase for China's reform drive, to try to control the crowd.
In another area few police were visible and demonstrators chased off a group
of about 10 officers watching helplessly from the edge of seeking a highway.
Shenzhen, a booming city at the forefront of China's drive to modernise, has
come to symbolise the economic reforms of Deng Xiaopeng, the senior leader.
But the sale of forms, which entitled investors to apply for shares to be
issued on the Shenzhen stock market in the 1992-93 financial year,
degenerated into turmoil at the weekend.
Police reported one person was crushed to death in Sunday's mayhem, although
the authorities later denied anyone had been killed or seriously injured in
the stampede for forms.
Thousands of investors failed to get any forms, even though 5m were
officially on sale and by yesterday evening trouble had begun. Police
shouted over loud-hailers that more forms would go on sale today but few
demonstrators believed them.
At least six vehicles were overturned including a police car while
protestors set a van on fire.
China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have had a turbulent
history since they reopened officially in 1990 and last year respectively
under China's free-market reforms.
Shanghai trading has been marked by several stampedes, while two men were
murdered earlier this year in Shenzhen as gangsters fought over positions in
queues of share buyers. Shenzhen authorities later launched a series of
swoops to arrest hundreds of gangsters in the special economic zone.
Analysts say it is vital for the authorities to restore order on the
markets. With backing from Deng Xiaoping, the senior leader who visited
Shenzhen early this year, stock markets have flourished in recent months and
prices have soared.
The analysts also say any such disorder gives hardline conservatives in the
leadership ammunition in their fight against reform and they note even Deng
said the markets should be closed down if they proved a failure.

The Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan's largest state-run commercial bank and issuer of
the republic's currency, yesterday announced that it was freezing all its
loans involved with investment in mainland China, AP-DJ reports from Taipei.
The bank announced its decision after its board directors' meeting, saying
that any loans with links to mainland investment - especially those for
public construction projects in mainland China - would be carefully
reviewed.
Mr David Yu, research manager at Wardley James Capel Taiwan, said the
decision was believed to have been authorised by the government to cool off
the mainland investment heat.
The manager stressed that such decision contradicts the Taiwanese
government's internationalisation principle, 'but maybe it can keep the
capital flowing out, a decision not bad for the stagnant local stock
market'.

<TEXT>
MR TSUTOMU HATA, the Japanese finance minister, promised to look into
further support measures for the Tokyo stock market yesterday, after shares
shed 2.9 per cent of their value in a third consecutive day of selling.
Mr Hata was responding to business leaders' disquiet as the Nikkei index
fell below the 15,000 level for much of the day. He said he had instructed
the ministry's securities bureau to consider what actions it could take.
He acknowledged that apart from a poor corporate earnings outlook, one
factor dragging the market down was concern over an increase in
non-performing loans on the books of the country's banks. However, he
insisted the size of these was 'not big enough to shake Japan's overall
economy'.
Although the Nikkei, which represents Japan's 225 top quoted companies,
recovered to 15,066.34 by the close, after touching 14,929.55, it was still
down 451.93 on the session. Volume, at 200m shares, was relatively high for
the start of a week in which many participants take summer holidays.
The market fluctuated in initial trading early today, at first losing ground
but soon afterwards showing a gain of more than 80.
The market has not closed below 15,000 since March 1986, and some comfort
was drawn from the support this psychological threshold provided yesterday.
But brokers noted that private investor enthusiasm was absent. 'At a rebound
of the market, individual buying becomes active, but that isn't happening,'
an analyst said.
Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the influential federation of
economic organisations, said the slide reflected investors' fears about the
country's economic outlook and lack of trust in the market.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, called
for the government to introduce measures to stimulate the economy on the
largest possible scale, warning that neglect of the market's plight would
prompt fears of a financial crisis.
The government has been pinning its hopes on a package of measures to be
drawn up by the end of this month aimed at assisting the economy and the
equity market. These would be enacted in a supplementary budget of public
works spending and possible tax cuts, due by October, which could inject
Y5,000bn (Pounds 20.6bn) to Y8,000bn into the economy. Expectations of the
package have, however, so far failed to stem the decline in share values.
Another dampener has been a dismal recent performance by Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone, Japan's biggest company and most widely held stock. Its
shares dived a further Y42,000 yesterday in active trading, losing their
hold on the Y500,000 mark to end at Y467,000.
NTT has lost 20.6 per cent of its value since the beginning of the month, at
a time when ownership of its shares by foreign investors was permitted. In
the face of their lack of appetite for a stock regarded by analysts as still
too highly priced, the MoF, which owns nearly two thirds of the utility, has
seen the market value of its holding fall by as much as Y1,240bn in just 10
days.
The MoF is edging towards an admission that its planned sale of a further
tranche of NTT in the current fiscal year to next March will not be
possible. It has used the proceeds from such sales to fund soft loans to
regional and local government for the development of infrastructure. One
local report yesterday said the ministry was considering integrating these
projects into its regular public works budget.
Mr Hata said only that the ministry would decide on whether the scheduled
sale would go ahead after watching the course of the market.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Sharp fall in demand for credit as consumers repay more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND for credit fell sharply in June as consumers paid back more than they
borrowed on credit agreements excluding mortgages.
The news, indicating that consumers are reluctant to spend, came as the
latest consensus of forecasts from the City and economic think tanks shows
output falling by 0.5 per cent this year.
Forecasters have revised expectations for growth sharply downwards since the
middle of the year when it became clear that a post-election surge in
confidence had not turned into sustainable growth. This week a string of
indicators is expected to show that the economy remains stuck in recession
although inflation continues to fall.
In June consumers repaid a net Pounds 55m on credit agreements with finance
houses, building societies and bank credit cards that are part of the Visa
or Mastercard system. This compares with net borrowing of Pounds 68m in May.
According to the new series of figures from the Central Statistical Office,
this was the first time since December that consumers paid back more than
they borrowed. In the first five months of the year they borrowed but more
slowly than in the equivalent period a year ago. The previous CSO credit
business series distorted the net lending figure downwards by treating debts
written off by banks as repayments.
Consumers were wrongly believed to have been making the repayment of debts a
priority in five of the first six months of the year. In fact, they added to
their debts in every month except June.
The seasonally adjusted figures, which do not include mortgages and account
for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt, showed that demand for
credit shrank in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Net
lending grew by only Pounds 39m in the three months to June compared with
Pounds 120m in the previous three months.
The amount of new credit advanced in June was Pounds 4.2bn compared with
Pounds 3.8bn in May. It grew by 1.7 per cent in the second quarter compared
with the previous quarter.
A broader measure of net lending to consumers, including bank overdrafts and
loans from insurance companies and retailers, shows that consumers borrowed
a net Pounds 54m in the second quarter compared with Pounds 93m in the first
quarter.

FT  11 AUG 92 / West drafts UN plan for use of force in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, JUDY DEMPSEY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE UN, NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN last night reached agreement with the US and France on a draft
United Nations resolution calling for the use of force, if needed, to
deliver humanitarian aid in the former Yugoslav republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The draft resolution also endorses international demands for access to
Serb-controlled detention camps. Concern about the camps and human rights
abuses in the former Yugoslavia is spelt out further in a separate draft
resolution.
The two draft texts, also agreed by Belgium, were submitted last night to
the other members of the 15-nation Security Council in closed-door
consultations at the UN in New York. They are not expected to come to a vote
until tomorrow or Thursday.
The proposals were hammered out after days of negotiations to bypass
differences between western powers about the scope of any military
involvement in the former Yugoslavia. Pressure for some kind of gesture has
grown with media reports of Serb detention camps holding emaciated Moslem
prisoners.
The main resolution would authorise 'all necessary means to ensure the
delivery of humanitarian assistance'. This implies use of force, but it does
not spell out exactly what would be involved or who would organise it.
The draft leaves open a number of options. It calls on all states to 'take
nationally or through regional agencies or arrangements all measures
necessary to facilitate, in co-ordination with the UN, the delivery by
relevant UN humanitarian organisations and others of humanitarian assistance
to Sarajevo and, wherever needed, in other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
This resolution also 'demands that unimpeded and continuous access to camps,
prisons and detention centres be granted immediately to the International
Committee of the Red Cross and other relevant humanitarian organisations and
that all detainees therein receive humane treatment, including adequate
food, shelter and medical care'.
Elaborating on western concern about reports of atrocities, the second
resolution repeats a demand for access to detention centres and expresses
'grave alarm' at reports of abuses against civilians.
In London, prime minister John Major's office confirmed that British ground
troops and airmen might be called on to protect the flow of relief to
victims of the fighting in Bosnia. Downing Street said Britain was
negotiating with the US and France to determine what each would contribute
to an escort force to protect aid convoys.
Officials added that the precise role and command structure of the escort
forces involved striking a delicate political balance to keep the UN on
board.
In Brussels, Nato started drawing up contingency plans to send troops to
Bosnia, but senior Nato officials and other military experts voiced concern
about the difficulties and dangers of committing forces to the region.
In London, Mr Willem Van Eekelen, secretary-general of the WEU, the
nine-nation European grouping, said international relief convoys should be
protected by European forces, but backed by US air-power.
There was a lull in fighting around the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
yesterday, but residents said they were running out of bread.
The Red Cross confirmed it received permission to visit detention camps in
Bosnia.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Computer bug alert for 14m credit card accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster is alert-ing its credit card holders to problems it has
had with the com-puter system which processes 14m card accounts, more than
half of all of those in Britain.
The bank is also considering possible recourse against First Data Resources,
the operator of the computer system, for mistakes caused by the glitch. The
cards affected include those of Mastercard, Visa and Access offered by
NatWest, Midland, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB, which are
processed through a computer centre with sites in Southend and Basildon.
At least several hundred people are thought to have had problems using their
cards because of a change in the computer software which took place in
mid-July. First Data Resources and the banks yesterday played down the
extent of the errors, which they said had been corrected.
NatWest's warning to its credit card holders comes in a letter which also
apologises for the problems. They include incorrect charges for late payment
and interest, delays in direct debits, fees for cash advances which did not
take place, incorrect amounts debited and incorrect transaction dates on
statements.
Several people have also reported that retailers have been unable to obtain
authorisation to accept their credit cards when there has been no apparent
reason why they should be refused.
Mr Gary Tobin, senior vice-president of communications and government
affairs at First Data Corporation, the parent of First Data Resources, said
there had been some 'fine-tuning' of the computer system between July 17 and
July 23 when the software was changed and tested.
But he said all the problems had been overcome, and that a few errors were
inevitable on a system processing so many accounts during an exercise
described by one of his colleagues as 'the biggest (computer software)
conversion in history'.
The change from the old system operated by Signet, a company which First
Data acquired last year, was designed to improve security, offer more
services and operate more quickly.
None of the banks would give full details on the number of customers
affected, although Lloyds Bank said it had written two weeks ago to 40 card
customers who had had more than their monthly payments directly debited from
their bank accounts.

FT  11 AUG 92 / US-Israeli summit boosts hopes over Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW chapter in US-Israeli relations opened yesterday as President George
Bush signalled a formal end to recent tension between the two countries.
'The welcome mat is out,' he told Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister,
at the start of a two-day summit at Kennebunkport, Mr Bush's east coast
holiday home.
The summit is expected to pave the way for progress in Middle East peace
negotiations and on American guarantees for loans to build homes for Jewish
immigrants arriving in Israel from the former Soviet Union.
It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Israel's Labour
leader defeated his hardline opponent, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, in June's general
election - a victory welcomed in Washington.
'Prime minister Rabin has many friends in the US, including the man standing
next to him,' said Mr Bush. Mr Rabin responded that his government wished to
alter Israel's national priorities and to give peace negotiations, which
will resume in Washington on August 24, a chance to succeed.
'We would like to give a chance, a real chance, to the peace negotiations
within the framework of the Madrid conference,' said Mr Rabin. 'We would
like to change the order of our national priorities.
'We believe that the real problems are in the domestic field, in addition to
making a real effort to negotiate peace seriously without endangering
Israel's security.'
The two days of talks, attended by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of
state, are expected to cover a broad range of Middle East and international
issues, including Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's latest challenge to
United Nations' resolutions and the crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Israel has largely cleared the way for US approval of loan guarantees for up
to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) by imposing a virtual freeze on building new
Jewish settlements in the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war.
The US refused to accede to Mr Shamir's earlier loan guarantee request,
insisting that the commitment of his Likud party to building more
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza was a serious obstacle to the peace
process.
Mr Rabin has also pledged to negotiate speedily with the Palestinians the
establishment of an interim self-governing authority for the West Bank and
Gaza, pending final agreement on the ultimate status of the territories.
The possible shape of such an interim arrangement was formulated by Egypt,
Israel and the US during the 1978 Camp David negotiations, but rejected at
the time by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Arab governments.
A Jordanian newspaper claimed yesterday that Israeli and Palestinian
representatives had already reached an agreement during secret talks in
Cairo on limited autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza.
However, Ms Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the
peace talks, denied the report, saying it did not reflect the deliberations
and work of the negotiating team.
Israel has signalled a wish to create a better negotiating atmosphere by
indicating it will repeal a law forbidding meetings with official members of
the PLO.
But hostility within Israel to the new government's initiatives was again
evident with hardline settlers' groups pledging to continue building in the
occupied territories.
Mr Micha Harish, the trade minister, said after a cabinet meeting that the
settlers' aim was clearly political and geared towards harming the visit of
the prime minister to the US.

THE DERIVATIVES markets had a dull trading session, with prices drifting
lower as traders backed away in the face of Tokyo's poor performance and the
setback across the range of markets in Europe, writes Terry Byland.
The September contract on the FT-SE index had a poor day, trading for most
of the session below its fair value premium - the figure which allows for
financing costs and dividend flows on the underlying stocks.
The contract opened some 18 points down on Friday's close and, after briefly
trimming the loss, fell away smartly. At the day's low, September traded at
around 2,321 and a rally to the 2,335 area was thwarted when New York opened
uncertainly. Traders reported some arbitrage selling throughout the day,
with one large US firm buying and a London firm selling. At the official
close, the contract stood at 2,329, but it came under further pressure in
after-hours dealing.
In traded options, the FT-SE and Euro FT-SE contracts were the most active
as dealers arbitraged between falling stock prices across Europe. The most
active stock option was British Gas, with a mere 689 contracts. Total
trading volume increased to 26,974 contracts from Friday's 20,619.

LIQUIDATION of holdings in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and other public
utilities depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average fell 2.9 per cent
to its lowest level since March 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 451.93 to 15,066.34, having opened at the day's high of
15,470.79 and fallen to its low of 14,929.55 by mid-morning. Investors
facing additional margin calls on collateral due to the steep fall in prices
liquidated share holdings, traders said. Short selling and futures-linked
arbitrage unwinding also depressed sentiment.
Volume rose slightly to 200m shares from 183m. Declines led advances by 887
to 53 with 61 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell
32.67 to 1,148.56, the lowest level for the year and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed up 0.52 at 942.10.
NTT's decline continued to weigh on the market, its shares losing another
Y42,000 to a new all-time low of Y467,000.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, said that the ministry, which still
owns two-thirds of NTT's outstanding shares, was considering postponing the
public stock offering scheduled for this fiscal year. He added that he had
ordered officials to review possible support measures for the market.
'The fall in NTT is prompting investors to re-evaluate other public
utilities, such as electric power companies,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi,
strategist at Daiwa Securities.
Traders noted an increase in short selling by individuals. 'Investors see
that profits are easily generated by selling short and buying back shares,'
said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He added that investors were
searching for issues with negative news in order to create short positions.
Institutional investors remained inactive. Most leading companies today
enter the summer holiday week. Some traders fear that price manipulation by
option dealers ahead of this Friday's expiry of August option contracts
could cause some volatility in the underlying cash markets.
Banks were weaker on continuing concerns over bad loans. Industrial Bank of
Japan fell Y30 to Y1,730 and Sumitomo Bank lost Y40 to Y1,360.
Dealers and individuals dumped speculative theme stocks. Okamoto Industries,
the most active issue of the day, slipped Y34 to Y867 and Meiji Milk
Products fell Y5 to Y760.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 615.30 to 16,331.81, its lowest level since
April 1986. Volume totaled 12.7m shares against 18.5m.
Roundup
WEAKNESS in Tokyo depressed most of the region's markets yesterday.

to 5,867.94 in turnover down to HKDollars 2bn from Friday's HKDollars 2.2bn.
Hutchison Whampoa and its associate, Cheung Kong, lost 40 cents to HKDollars
15.50 and 10 cents to HKDollars 23.60 respectively.

167 to 60.
TAIWAN eased with the weighted index down 79.00 or 2 per cent to 3,951.73.
Turnover was TDollars 19bn compared to TDollars 15.9bn during Saturday's

negative mood

<TEXT>
BOURSES remained depressed by the low dollar, high interest rates and poor
corporate progress reports and share prices were marked down further
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT dropped 1.7 per cent, the DAX index closing 26.95 lower at
1,582.55 after a 7.57 fall to a new 1992 low of 628.09 in the FAZ index at
midsession. Turnover rose from DM3.4bn to DM4.2bn.
Selling of construction stocks left Bilfinger &amp; Berger off DM32 at DM870,
Hochtief by DM43 at DM977 and Holzmann by DM54 at DM912. There was no
particular rationale about this, except that the sector had performed this
year and investors still had profits to take.
Daimler weakened noticeably on a story that a Swedish consortium involving
Saab, Ericcson and Volvo was planning to offer a substitute for the
sidelined European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). The shares fell DM15.20 to DM647;
the decline was beaten in percentage terms, however, by the DM14.50 drop to
DM543 at BMW, still regarded by some as the quality stock among carmakers.
In retailing, Douglas extended last week's declines on a disappointing
progress report with a fall of DM14.50 to DM499.50; but Kaufhof followed it
down with a drop of DM9.50 to DM487.50, although most retailers were
satisfied with the results of the two-week sales which ended on Saturday,
and that all of them were hoping for a boost in the second half.
PARIS remained depressed with Peugeot and St Gobain continuing declines
begun at the end of last week on disappointing second quarter results. The
CAC 40 index fell 25.11 or 1.4 per cent to 1,752.16 and turnover remained
weak at an estimated FFr1.1bn.
Peugeot remained active as investors reviewed the carmaker's sales figures
and some negative analysts' notes were issued. Its shares lost FFr25, or 3.9
per cent to FFr617.
Downgradings were also in evidence at St Gobain, which ended the day FFr5
lower at FFr515, and a couple of large sellers were said to be responsible
for the 6 per cent fall in Cap Gemini, down FFr13.50 at FFr208.50.
Air Liquide's first half was unexceptional, according to some analysts, but
the stock showed resistance, off FFr5 at FFr770. Yves St Laurent bucked the
trend with a FFr4 gain to FFr829 on a 6.8 per cent increase in first half
revenues.
AMSTERDAM anticipated poor half year results from Fokker, due today and its
shares plunged 6 per cent by the close, down Fl 1.60 at Fl 23.70. The
aircraft manufacturer surprised the market by bringing forward its results
by a week. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.9 to 114.0.
Hoogovens remained weak, also ahead of its results, shedding Fl 1.20 to Fl
38.90. Analysts are forecasting disappointing earnings following the
deterioration in the European steel industry during the second quarter.
News that Polygram is to take a 51 per cent stake in a US film producer
failed to lift sentiment as this group, too, prepared to release figures
today. Its shares came off Fl 1.40 to Fl 44.50, while its parent, Philips,
shed 70 cents to Fl 23.00.
MILAN suffered after last week's technical recovery, and although it closed
above its lows the final MIB index, which takes into account 35 shares
traded by computer, showed a drop of 22, or 2.7 per cent to 799; it had
opened 3.4 per cent lower.
Turnover was estimated at little more than Friday's L57.8bn. Banking and
insurance shares were among the most affected by yesterday's declines,
Credito Italiano and Mediobanca losing L80 to L1,300, and L610 to L11,590
respectively, and Generali dropping L1,180 to L26,805. Mr Michele Pacitti at
County NatWest said that domestic investors were out of the market and that,
with foreigners seen as the main potential sellers, the more liquid sectors
like financials and telecoms were being marked down.
ZURICH was more resilient than most, the SMI index falling 9.6, or 0.5 per
cent to 1,800.0 in thin volume from 1,809.6 on Friday. Banks, chemical and
food shares reduced earlier losses, Ciba-Geigy registered topping the active
list with a fall of SFr6 to SFr659 and Nestle registered coming second as
they closed SFr40 lower at SFr9,180.
BRUSSELS declined as the market continued to react to Petrofina's
disappointing half-year results last week. The Bel-20 index lost 7.86 to
1,125.42 in turnover of BFr533m. Petrofina closed at a year's low, down
BFr275 at BFr10,150. Societe Generale de Belgique eased BFr15 to BFr1,960
while Solvay fell BFr50 to BFr12,350.
MADRID saw dull trading with the general index down 1.85 to 213.86. Repsol
weakened Pta30 to Pta2,560 and Telefonica slipped Pta15 to Pta1,020.
OSLO tumbled for the seventh consecutive session, the all-share index
falling 9.46, or 2.6 per cent to 353.18 in thin trading. The weak dollar
continued to affect oils, metals and shipping, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4 to
NKr130, Elkem free shares dropping NKr5 to NKr60 and the shipping index
falling 13.9 to 292.11.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index shed 16.5 to 834.4 in low volume. The bank
and finance sector fell 3.7 per cent with SE Banken A shares down SKr2 to
SKr22 and Handelsbanken's A declining SKr2.50 to SKr44.
HELSINKI fell further following last week's increase in interest rates. The
HEX index fell 7.17 to 675.37.
VIENNA slid to new lows under pressure from the new ATX stock index futures
contract, the all share index closing down 7.26 at 346.88, its lowest since
May, 1989. The oil company, OMV, lost Sch36, or 6 per cent to a year-low of
Sch556.
ISTANBUL rebounded slightly after the 75-share market index fell below 3,900
in early trade on some disappointing half-year results. The index closed up
7.23 at 3,939.78.

FT  11 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Global sense of depression in thin
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a 1.4 per cent fall in local currency terms last week, the FT-Actuaries
World Index reflected a global sense of depression, thin trading, and
traders and investors unwilling to take risks, heightened by the low volume
of business.
The biggest influence on the World Index was Japan, which is also the worst
performer of the year so far with a drop of 30.7 per cent; early in the week
Tokyo shrugged off the Japanese government's plans to acquire land worth Y3
to Y4 trillion in a bid to rescue the banks, and on Wednesday to Friday
sentiment was abraded by three consecutive falls in Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone (NTT), leaving Japan's most widely-held share down 13.6 per cent
on the week.
In Europe, Norway invited comparison with Japan on a twelve month basis,
32.9 per cent in arrears. Oslo was also the worst performing market of the
week. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel says that the latest fall reflected a
mix of profound depression among domestic investors, and lack of foreign
involvement for the time being; the roots of that were in the weak dollar,
and its effect on the oil price and shipping rates.
Austria ran Norway a close second on the downgrade. Once again, there was a
sense of a relatively marginal equity market losing its occasional foreign
support, and getting heavily oversold at domestic level. The market was
unsettled further last Friday with the introduction of stock index futures
and options trading on its ATX marker. Italy rose after an agreement between
the government, trade unions and employers to scrap wage indexation, but the
technical recovery there had subsided by the end of the week.
Back in the Pacific Basin, Singapore joined the laggards. A review from
Hoare Govett Asia last Friday said that gloom and despondency had
overwhelmed the market, and that poor results from the shipping sector had
weakened sentiment across the board.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Calmer trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE in the short-dated sterling futures and cash markets had a calmer tone
yesterday after the pound stabilised on the foreign exchanges and most of
the shortage forecast by the Bank of England was removed in the morning.
After losing around two pfennigs against the D-Mark in the last week, the
pound had a more relaxed tone on the foreign exchanges yesterday, closing up
a  1/4 of a pfennig at DM2.8275. This pushed the front month contracts up in
the sterling futures market. The September contract closed up 6 basis points
from its opening level, at 89.70. The December contract closed up 5 basis
points from its opening level at 89.78.
Both prices are far from discounting a cut in UK base rates in the short
term. Uncertainty about the currency still hangs over the markets,
especially with a spate of UK indicators due in the latter part of the week,
several of which may underline continued weakness in the economy.
The tone in the cash markets was brighter, although most rates closed
unchanged on Friday's levels. The Pounds 1.1bn shortage forecast by the Bank
of England was removed quickly, easing the tone of trading. Dealers feel no
pressure to hold onto bills at the moment, as there is no expectation of a
cut in base rates which would increase the capital value of the assets on
their books.
One-month money closed unchanged at 10 1/16 per cent on the offered side.
Three-month money was also unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent offered, but the
1-year closed down  1/16 per cent at 10 3/8 per cent.
The Bank of England purchased Band 1 and 2 bills at the established rate of
9 7/8 per cent and the repurchase agreement (repo) at 9 15/16 per cent. In
the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 305m in Band 1 bank bills, Pounds
337m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 300m in the repo. In the afternoon, the
Bank revised the shortage down to Pounds 1bn and provided late assistance of
around Pounds 45m.
In the German money markets, call money rates were still just under the 9.75
per cent Lombard rate, reflecting the tightness of the market seen since the
start of the month. In Italy, the central bank's 'repo' rate was again set
at 14.21 per cent.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar below intervention level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR drifted down towards its previous close of DM1.4640 against the
D-Mark in European trading yesterday, underlining the impression that the
Federal Reserve's intervention on behalf of the US currency last Friday was
a failure, writes James Blitz.
In late US trading on Friday, the Fed intervened in the market five times,
buying dollars between the DM1.4675 and DM1.4730 levels. But the US currency
yesterday traded in a tight range that was below the intervention level,
between DM1.4655 and 1.4705. In Europe, it closed up against the D-Mark at
DM1.4670 compared to a previous close of DM1.4645.
Dealers are worried by the prospect of further intervention and are wary of
pushing the dollar back to DM1.46. But Friday's Fed intervention has also
been deemed a failure. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist
at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, the Fed should have stayed its hand
until tomorrow, in the hope that the Bundesbank will add liquidity to the
German money market. A softening of short term rates in Germany, which are
hovering around the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per cent, would help the
dollar to rally this week.
Otherwise, dealers continue to be impressed by the rate of return on the
D-Mark. Yesterday, the D-Mark/yen cross was the most lucrative trade, after
the Nikkei Index in Tokyo fell temporarily below the 15,000 figure. The drop
in Japanese equities has revived fears of a cut in the Bank of Japan's
Official Discount Rate, widening the interset rate differential with the
D-Mark. The yen closed at Y87.27, from a previous finish of Y86.21.
Sterling closed the day a  1/4 pfennig up against the D-Mark at DM2.8275.
But its underlying tone remains weak. The pound is more firmly entrenched
than ever at the bottom of the European Monetary System grid, with a 3.15
percentage point differential separating it from the Italian lira, the next
weakest currency.
The Italian lira was again softer against the D-Mark, closing at L756.6 from
a previous close of L756.0. This new slippage has led some to believe that
the Bank of Italy was too hasty when it cut its discount rate last week by
0.5 percentage points. But the Bank dealt again at a 'repo' rate of 14.21
per cent in its money market operations, in what may have been an attempt to
stall the trend in falling rates.
Norway's Central Bank said it had not bought Norwegian crowns in the spot
market, after agency reports that it was trying to support its weakening
currency. Instead, the Bank said that it was carrying out ordinary swap
transactions to withdraw liquidity from the market and help lift short-term
interest rates.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board publishes
co-operative proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG drawn out process of reforming the Milk Marketing Board for England
and Wales moved up a gear yesterday with the publication of its proposals to
turn itself into a single voluntary co-operative.
The Bill to end the board's 60-year-old statutory monopoly on milk supplies
is likely to come before Parliament in the autumn and be given Royal Assent
in June next year. The final revocation of the scheme under which dairy
farmers are required to sell their milk to the board would then follow some
time in 1994, along with the flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's
wholly-owned subsidiary, which has a 25 per cent share of the British market
for manufactured dairy products.
Today the published proposals will drop through the letter boxes of nearly
30,000 English and Welsh dairy farmers. They will be able to choose whether
to sell their milk through the new co-operative, or to go it alone.
The MMB's assets - excluding shares in Dairy Crest - will be passed to the
new co-operative. Dairy Crest will be floated as a separate company and
shares distributed to dairy farmers on the basis of milk production over a
qualifying period.
Mr Andrew Dare, the board's newly-appointed chief executive, said yesterday:
'There is going to be a free market in milk. Any farmer can supply any
buyer. It's a million miles from a monopoly'.
Mr Bob Steven, the MMB chairman, said the board was convinced that a
co-operative with pooled prices was the best way forward for the industry.
It would pay market related prices, give security and regular payments to
its members, and 'provide a fair balance against the ever-increasing
concentration of processors and retailers'.
The Agriculture Ministry said yesterday it would comment on the published
proposals as soon as possible, and pointed out that the European Commission
had put up no objections so far.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Paris's musees sentimentaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR almost a century, the small suite of rooms on the first floor of the
Musee Gustave Moreau in Paris were swathed in dirt and dustcloths, unseen by
the public, seldom visited even by the museum staff.
The dustcloths have now been whisked away. The woodwork is freshly papered
and painted. There are pictures on the walls. The rooms have been restored
to look as they did when the artist Moreau himself lived and worked there.
The first floor apartment at the Musee Moreau has joined the ranks of
Paris's musees sentimentaux.
Paris has a dozen or so 'musees sentimentaux' - museums based in the homes
of writers or artists. Gustave Moreau himself was one of the pioneers of the
concept, devoting his last years to raising money and bullying builders to
turn his home on the rue de la Rochefoucauld into a showcase for his life's
work.
The Musee Moreau opened in 1903, five years after the artist's death. It
houses a comprehensive collection of his work - 1,200 paintings and 5,000
drawings - everything from juvenile scribblings to giant oil paintings.
The brutal truth is that, without the museum, much of Moreau's work would
not have been preserved. Even in his own day, Moreau was better known for
his teaching - his pupils included Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault - than
for his art. From time to time, he has attracted a minor cult following, but
the quality of his paintings - dreamy visions, generally of Greek gods and
goddesses in mildly salacious poses - is not high enough to merit much space
in the major museums.
None the less, the Musee Moreau, with its winding wooden staircase and dusty
windows, is a charming place. Even the most salacious of Moreau's classical
fantasies have a certain appeal. Although there is no hint of his tutelage
of Matisse in the sombre colours of his work, it is not difficult to spot
his influence over the morose Rouault. For decades, the museum has been a
little known but much-loved fixture on the Paris arts scene.
Moreau hoped to create more than an art gallery. He also planned to preserve
the tiny apartment on the first floor of the rue de la Rochefoucauld where
he lived with his parents. The renovation of the apartment was ignored in
the bustle of opening the museum, and the family rooms remained closed for
nearly 90 years.
Three years ago the museum staff decided to carry out Moreau's wishes by
renovating the apartment. An inventory was made of the contents and an
architect, Jean-Claude Daufresne, charged with restoring the rooms to their
original condition.
The result is an intriguing glimpse into the home of a mildly eccentric
Parisian painter in the late 19th century. The rooms have been decorated in
the same style as when Moreau was in residence. The restorers have also
reassembled as many of his possessions - paintings, photographs, pieces of
pottery and memorabilia - as they could.
The apartment is now a cheerful clutter of books, clothes, crockery, stuffed
birds, pictures, plants and even a couple of newspapers folded neatly on a
table.
Thanks to the restoration, which was funded both by private patronage and
state sponsorship, the Musee Moreau is probably the most complete of all
Paris' musees sentimentaux, just as Gustave Moreau intended it to be.
All in all, the musees sentimentaux are a motley crew. Some show exhaustive
collections of the artist's work. The Musee Rodin, set in a splendid 18th
century mansion on the rue de Varenne, not only houses most of the
sculptor's main pieces, but also part of his own art collection. Rodin had
so many paintings that Van Goghs, Monets and Renoirs hang haphazardly on the
walls looking almost like an after-thought.
Some collections are almost too exhaustive. The tiny Musee Zadkine near the
Luxembourg gardens, devoted to the work of Ossip Zadkine, the cubist
sculptor, is so packed with pieces that it is almost impossible for visitors
not to bump into them.
Other musees sentimentaux are rather sparse. The Musee Delacroix, set in a
cloistered courtyard off the Boulevard St Germain, was founded so long -
nearly 70 years - after Eugene Delacroix's death, that his work was already
widely dispersed.
The museum has a modest collection, mainly of prints, drawings and personal
documents. Anyone wanting to see Delacroix's major works would be better
advised to head for the Musee D'Orsay a little further along the left bank.
The museums also vary enormously in architectural quality. Musee Rodin is
probably the most sumptuous of all, with its wood panelling, mottled
mirrors, crystal chandeliers and a private garden which almost serves as a
small Parisian park. The closest contender is the Maison de Victor Hugo
tucked away in a corner of the 17th century Place des Vosges where the
writer lived with his family.
By contrast the Musee Bourdelle, devoted to one of Rodin's pupils, Antoine
Bourdelle, is set in a dusty little studio and garden buried beneath the
brutal blocks of Montparnasse. And the musee sentimental of as famous a
figure as the novelist, Honore de Balzac, is in a squat villa in the
boringly bourgeois suburb of Passy - now the stamping ground of the bon chic
bon genre, the French version of the Sloane Ranger - to which Balzac fled to
evade his creditors.
The architectural merits of the musees sentimentaux are not really relevant,
however. The real charm of this type of museum is the flavour evoked of the
person who lived there.
However sumptuous the Musee Rodin may be, it is impossible to go there
without thinking about all those wimpy women that allowed Rodin to treat
them so badly. On the other hand, the otherwise inconspicuous Maison de
Balzac resonates with the raffish character of the novelist. It even has
little boltholes at the back so Balzac could sneak out, if his dreaded

FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Functional fittings and fixtures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PINNING modern sculpture to office blocks as though it were costume
jewellery was a misalliance contracted in the Sixties. The idea of
compensating for the elimination of decoration and ornament from Modernist
architecture seemed to turn into a desperate bid to humanise bleak urban
piazzas of concrete and glass. All too often, the result was to dehumanise
what might elsewhere have been deemed perfectly good art.
The past decade has seen a shift towards a more subtle integration of art in
the environment. This new kind of public art, although less 'heroic' in
intention than monumental sculpture, has a far better chance of success.
Developers and planners are inviting the best of contemporary sculptors,
craftsmen and designers to turn their talents towards the functional: the
fixtures and fittings of our urban and rural landscapes. Railings, fences,
gates, benches, bollards, bridges, planters, paving, playgrounds. . . the
list is surprisingly long. The solutions are unexpectedly various.
Applied art in public places is the subject of the Crafts Council's current
exhibition, 'The Furnished Landscape'. It focuses on several schemes and
works that have already been commissioned across the country, largely
through 'Percent for Art' initiatives, plus recent pieces yet to be placed.
It argues a convincing case for encouraging collaboration among
artists/craftsmen, architects, planners, engineers and, more cautiously, the
community.
Britain has been slow on the uptake. In the US, Philadelphia boasts more
sculpture than any other city, thanks to the privately-funded and
public-spirited Fairmount Park Art Association (FPAA) which was founded in
1872.
The city launched a pioneering per-cent scheme as long ago as 1959, under
which 1 per cent of the cost of construction work on Redevelopment Authority
land was to be spent on works of art.
By 1980, the FPAA was inviting the likes of Siah Armajani, Dan Flavin and
Robert Irwin to propose schemes for improving specific inner-city sites in
Philadelphia; in 1986, it was asking for proposals for creatively lighting
the city. (A comparable scheme with light installations by 30 European
artists will transform Edinburgh from October 22 until January 4.)
Public art in the US has always tended to have a social conscience. The
sculptor Isamu Noguchi, for instance, began designing playgrounds as early
as 1933, although the first was only built in 1975.
A notion of what might be called serviceable sculpture took root. It is
represented in the exhibition most impressively by a model of one of the
American Dan Graham's large outdoor pavilions constructed out of clear and
reflecting glass, structures that continue to intrigue, surprise and delight
as one walks in and around them.
The show is, however, more concerned with the useful. Of all the avant-garde
sculpture-cum-furniture by Scott Burton (steel), Marc Camille Chaimovicz
(steel, teak and granite), Paul de Monchaux (St Bees sandstone) and Floris
van den Broecke (glass reinforced polyester), Rod Arad's stainless-steel
armchair, 'Big Easy Volume II', stands out not only for its lack of
Modernist streamlining, but by aiming to be user-friendly. 'If you can't do
a chair that's more comfortable than the last one,' Arad is quoted as
saying, 'it isn't worth doing.'
Given the English tradition of apparently artless 'natural' gardening, where
landscape is moulded and then enhanced by all manner of Picturesque follies
rich in allusion, it is not surprising that so much here looks well in the
rural landscape.
Jim Partridge and Liz Walmsley's pleasing rough-hewn walkway in Grizedale
forest, small footbridge in Argyll and a rustic bench, and Howard Bowcott's
Oak Leaf seat in Gwynedd, re-invent the formal language of the Picturesque
and its harmony with Nature. The lettering of Richard Kindersley and that
commissioned by Ian Hamilton Finlay from Creative Letterwork, takes up its
literary allusions.
De Monchaux's smooth and Moore-ish slab of sandstone, 250 million years old,
is as much landmark as bench. Richard La Trobe-Bateman's taut, minimalist
green oak and stainless-steel wire footbridges also combine a Modernist
aesthetic with natural materials.
It is with the urban landscape that these artists and craftsmen undoubtedly
face their greatest challenge. The Victorians proved adept designers of
street furniture, but they were not obliged to temper anything of the scale
of London's Canary Wharf development. Some of the most exciting work in the
show was commissioned for this, the world's biggest commercial development,
by Olympia &amp; York.
Bruce Maclean's railings are almost anarchic in the way their frenzied
calligraphic lines and floating spheres defy the regular geometries of the
office blocks behind. The fact that they are one-off and hand-made is
defiant in itself. Guiseppe Lund's railings are more Art Nouveau than
abstract expressionist, but here what looks like convolvulus is rising up
and encircling the railing posts with its insidious stems.
John Maine's faceted granite end-posts and highly sculptural cast-iron
bollards were commissioned by the London Borough of Lewisham as part of its
comprehensive redevelopment of the town centre.
Elsewhere we find images of, say, mosaics inserted into paving in Sheffield,
or banners hanging between the columns of Nottingham Town Hall which gave
the community an opportunity to personalise its own surroundings.
There is humour too. A particularly engaging finale is Jon Mills' whimsical
'Weatherplane' created for Burford School - a weathervane Biggles-style. The
forged steel plane comes hurtling through the air, propeller spinning, flags
fluttering and its begoggled bird pilot aghast. It has to be said that
committees often make lousy patrons; here there is plenty of evidence to the
contrary.
'The Furnished Landscape' continues at the Crafts Council, 44a Pentonville
Road, Islington, London N1, until August 23. The Crafts Council is happy to
provide advice and help to organisations or individuals interested in
commissioning art or craft work.

FT  11 AUG 92 / People: Margree returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last of the Stock Exchange's three divisional managing directors, Rod
Margree, is leaving to take up a new post at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
September, thus signalling the end of a divisional structure set up only two
years ago.
Margree joined the exchange on secondment from Barclays in May 1990 as
managing director of the settlements division, one of three new operating
units set up by chief executive Peter Rawlins. Against the background of
rapid staff turnover, Margree's tenure makes him one of the longest-serving
senior executives at the exchange.
His departure completes Rawlins' reversal of the organisational shake-up of
two years ago. Having originally indicated he would stay for around two
years, it seemed earlier this year that Margree's secondment was to be
extended, but the disappearance of his division seems to have hastened his
move back to the Barclays group.
Formerly the corporate finance director running Barclays' financial
institutions group, Margree moves to BZW to become chief operating officer
of its markets division, one of four operating areas.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Technology: A bitter pill to swallow - Despite strides in
asthma treatment, death from the disease is on the increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every year, 4,000 people in the US die from asthma, and a further 500,000
are hospitalised. The news gets worse. Asthma incidence and mortality appear
to be escalating. In 1984, 3,600 died of the disease, while in 1977 the
figure was only 1,700.
The causes of this soaring mortality rate remain unclear. But a medical
controversy has broken out over whether the drugs most widely prescribed to
treat asthma - known as beta2-agonist bronchodilators - may have contributed
to the swelling death totals. Two studies, one in New Zealand and one in
Canada, have suggested beta2-agonists - which include some Olympic athletes'
preferred drug, Clenbuterol - could increase the risk of death from asthma
by more than twofold.
Doctors are grappling to discover an optimum treatment for this debilitating
disease. The question is whether they should switch from existing therapies
to alternatives, of which the most important are anti-inflammatory
cortico-steroids. Their conclusions will shape the fast-growing asthma
treatments market, worth at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) a year.
Any increase in asthma mortality caused by beta2-agonists is likely to be
small. More significant factors include: changes in the classification of
causes of death; declining access to healthcare in the US, particularly
among poor urban blacks; and, most importantly, increased prevalence of the
disease.
The reasons for increased incidence also remain obscure. But about half of
cases in the UK are directly linked to allergies and the prevalence of these
is rising, according to Richard Fuller, director of respiratory medicine at
Glaxo, the British pharmaceuticals group.
The growth in allergies is linked directly to greater industrialisation.
Modern western houses act as perfect breeding grounds for house-dust mites,
a known cause of asthma. And pets, plants and central heating provide an
ideal environment for the bugs to grow, explains Giovanni Della Cioppa,
medical adviser for asthma in central medical affairs at Ciba-Giegy, the
Swiss pharmaceuticals group.
However, about half of cases cannot be explained by allergies, admits
Fuller. Some cases are related to pollution, smoking and possibly childhood
viruses, he says.
The mechanism causing asthma is only partly understood, says Fuller.
Asthmatic effects are generated when the lungs become hyper-sensitive to
outside stimuli, causing inflammation in the lungs and narrowing the airways
almost to a point of closure. This process makes exhalation difficult,
creating shortness of breath, cough and a sensation of suffocation.
In the allergic type of asthma, the immune cells within the lungs mistake
the allergen, such as a dust-mite, for a dangerous particle. The immune
cells repond by calling in defensive cells, known as mediators, which have
the dual role of killing bacteria and repairing wounds.
To allow the defensive cells to reach the site of apparent infection, the
blood vessels expand, creating the inflammation that obstructs the bronchia
in the lungs. Beta-agonists deal with asthma by dilating the bronchia,
providing almost immediate relief for sufferers. Fuller says it is unclear
how they work, but they are highly effective.
'They were once considered a wonder drug,' says Della Cioppa at Ciba-Geigy.
'They are extremely powerful. But they are not a cure for asthma. They only
treat the symptoms, not the underlying inflammation.'
Francis Cuss, vice-president of clinical research at the Schering-Plough
research institute, says the problem with beta2-agonists is not their
side-effects, which are rare. Rather, patients with a deteriorating
condition tend to rely on the bronchodilator too much, failing to tell their
doctor about their deteriorating condition.
However, the Canadian study has been heavily criticised. Della Cioppa says
there are two possible conclusions to be drawn from it. First, that
beta2-agonists increase mortality. Or second, that people with severe asthma
take more of the drug, and that people with bad asthma are more likely to
die of the disease. He says that otherwise it is like saying aspirin causes
headaches.
Nevertheless, Della Cioppa says the New Zealand study, which had more
limited conclusions, was useful in drawing attention to inappropriate
medication. It has helped trigger important changes in clinical practice.
Hakan Bjoklund, asthma president of Astra Draco, the Swedish group,
explains: 'What has become clear is that moderate or serious asthma should
not be treated by beta2-agonists alone, but also with cortico-steroids to
treat the underlying condition. The beta2-agonists remain highly useful for
treating acute attacks.'
Steroids work by reducing production of the factors that promote
inflammation, according to Fuller at Glaxo. The great advantage of
cortico-steroids is that they treat the underlying inflammation, although
they must be taken continually for a number of weeks before they work.
However, steroids have potential systemic side-effects. In high doses they
can generate Cushing's Syndrome, creating moon-faced features, hunched
shoulders and increased hair growth. In children, the largest asthma
population, they can also inhibit growth. Normally large doses are not used
to treat asthma, so such complications seldom occur.
Nevertheless, while Swedish and British physicians have been willing to
prescribe inhaled steroids - they had 43 per cent of the Swedish and British
markets last year - doctors in the US have been far more reticent. In
America, inhaled steroids have only 11 per cent of the asthma treatment
market. But that reluctance is beginning to change. In 1991 inhaled steroid
sales grew 56 per cent.
One alternative therapy to steroids, used particularly in children, is
Intal, an anti-inflammatory product distributed by Fisons, the British
group. Both Intal, and Fisons' more recent drug, Tilade, produce few
side-effects. They also work by inhibiting the release of the mediators that
cause inflammation.
Meanwhile, pharmaceuticals groups are pouring hundreds of millions of
dollars into asthma drug research and development. The asthma market remains
highly attractive to the pharmaceuticals groups, explains Linda Bilmes at
the Boston Consulting Group. She says this is because:
Asthma is a chronic illness that often requires continual therapy for life.
The market is unsettled with a wide variety of available therapies but no
ideal treatment.
The market is likely to continue to increase at above-average growth rates.
Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market research group, estimates that the world market
will increase by up to 20 per cent a year by value during the 1990s.
There is little competition from low-priced generic manufacturers. This is
because the inhaling devices used to deliver the drugs are patented. Since a
failed device can lead to death, doctors have proved unwilling to trust
generic ones.
The high cost of under-treatment of asthma. The price of asthma is colossal,
explains Bilmes. In 1990, the disease cost the US economy Dollars 6.2bn,
equivalent to 1 per cent of all health expenditure. The largest proportion -
Dollars 1.6bn - was generated by in-patient hospital care.
Given the likely growth in the asthma market - spectacular even by
pharmaceutical industry standards - there is little surprise that the
industry is looking to gain competitive advantage through new, safer and
more effective products. Different routes have been taken to achieve this.
'One aim is to discover steroidal drugs which are more potent, but have a
wider safety margin. To achieve this you need a drug that finds it more
difficult to make its way from the lungs into the body,' says Cuss.
'Alternatively, researchers are looking to find drugs that the liver can
metabolise more quickly, reducing the drug's distribution through the body.'
However, Keith Widdowson, international product manager for allergy at
Ciba-Geigy, argues that the pharmaceuticals groups are a long way from
finding a cure for asthma. The race is likely to be long and expensive.
An article on cancer drugs will appear shortly.

BRITAIN'S oldest nuclear reactor, Bradwell, at Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, is to
continue running for another 10 years, Juliet Sychrava writes.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, says the decision by
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to allow the Magnox-type reactor an
extended lease of life will put the lives of local people at risk.
The group said that radioactive discharges from Bradwell were outside the
new recommendations laid down by the Radiological Protection Board. Nuclear
Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear stations in England and
Wales, said it had satisfied the inspectorate that Bradwell presented no
danger. It said it was well within the legal limits and added that it was
looking at reductions in radioactivity.
Bradwell, which generates 245MW a year, or enough power to supply
Chelmsford, Colchester, and Southend, began generating electricity in July
1962.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Retirement for all at age 60 urged by TUC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STATE retirement age of 65 for both men and women could be twice as
expensive for the government as harmonising the age at 60, according to the
Trades Union Congress.
In a response to last week's recommendation by the Social Security Advisory
Committee of a pension age of 65, the TUC also says that equalising the age
at 60 is the most socially progressive option and takes account of social
trends and people's wishes.
The advisory committee had agreed with the government that raising the
retirement age of women from 60 to 65, the same as for men, would save
roughly Pounds 3bn a year in additional expenditure. However, the TUC says
in a letter to Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, that independent
calculations produced for it show that the 65 choice might cost Pounds
1.4bn. The cost of equalising the age at 60 might be Pounds 700m.
To arrive at the Pounds 700m cost for a retirement age of 60, the TUC has
assumed that economic activity rates for men aged between 60 and 65 will
eventually fall to 30 per cent from the present 53 per cent.
In arriving at the Pounds 1.4bn figure for equalising at 65, the TUC assumes
the proportion of women retiring after 60 would increase to about the same
as for men. It also assumes that about half of the jobs filled by women who
postpone retirement would otherwise have been available to job seekers.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, says: 'On this basis, an increase
in the state pension age for women actually increases the net cost to the
economy as a whole.'
Mr Willis says that although it is not possible to say with any certainty
which figures are correct, 'the TUC's figures are certainly within the
bounds of possibility'.

MORE independent financial advice is needed to help with personal debt,
according to the National Consumer Council, which is calling on the
government to take the lead in providing funding.
The council says that more than 500,000 households are struggling with
multiple debts but only one in seven debtors can expect to receive expert
money advice.
In a report published today, the council says that government appeals to the
credit industry to fund centres on a voluntary basis have largely failed. Ms
Ruth Evans, a council director, said: 'If necessary, (the government) may
need to impose a statutory levy on the credit industry, for instance. Or
maybe they should promise to match, pound for pound, voluntary contributions
from the private sector.'
The council said: 'The Department of Trade and Industry must ensure that
adequate funds are available to meet the need for money advice services.
This includes funding for front-line staff, specialist support staff,
training and computer support.'
The DTI said it opposed a statutory levy. Debt advice should be funded by
the private sector and it would continue to encourage the financial sector
to provide such funding.

<TEXT>
THE EC is making anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean car radios
permanent, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The Community's Official Journal said it was setting the duty at 34.4 per
cent, with reduced rates for 18 companies which co-operated in its
investigation into whether the radios were being sold in the EC at unfairly
low prices.
Under the decision, Goldstar will pay 3.9 per cent duties, Hyundai
Electronic Industries 10.8 per cent duties and Samsung Electronics 20.8 per
cent duties.
The investigation by the European Commission, the EC executive, which
imposed duties provisionally six months ago, backed up industry complaints
that the radios were being sold on the EC market at significantly less than
it cost to make them.
With the help of the low prices, radio imports rose 180 per cent from 1985
to 1989, and EC manufacturers were forced to lower their own prices, leading
to loss of profits and lower market share.

TAIWAN has formally abolished a three-decade-old export subsidy system to
help its application for entry to Gatt, the country's central bank said,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
The system, which helped to fuel the island's export-led economic boom, was
one remaining area where Taiwan did not satisfy the world trade body's free
trade rules, a senior bank official said.
The central bank provided low-interest loans to exporters under the system
beginning in 1961. The island's trade surplus totalled Dollars 5.47bn
(Pounds 2.86bn) in the first seven months of 1992. The need for the system
had diminished and fallen into disuse after Taiwan liberalised bank interest
rates in 1989. It was abolished last week. In December 1989, after the last
loan was granted, outstanding export loans had totalled Taiwan Dollars
14.5bn.
Taiwan applied to join Gatt in 1990 but entry has been delayed by concern
over its trade policies and opposition from China.

A URUGUAY Round world trade agreement would protect, in some cases enhance,
food safety standards, not undermine them, as many environmental lobbyists
claim, a report* by the Consumers Union, a leading US consumer group, says.
The present draft Uruguay Round text, blocked over farm subsidies, would
'clearly allow the US to keep all its standards, only some of which are
higher than Codex' - the Rome-based Codex Alimentarius Commission which sets
international food standards.
The Consumers Union says it has written pledges from the Bush administration
that US standards would not be diminished.
International harmonisation could improve US food safety standards, it adds,
noting 27 per cent fall below international standards, it adds.
The report debunks 19 'myths' created by environmental lobbyists to suggest
the Round would erode national sovereign rights to protect the environment
and set high food safety standards.

in the face of opposition from both left and right in Japan, Gordon Cramb
reports from Tokyo. He sanctioned a trip expected to take place in October
and last nearly a week.
The visit, intended to mark 20 years of normalised relations between the
countries, would be the first by a head of state from the Group of Seven
industrialised nations since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989.
Heads of government led last year by Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Mr Miyazawa's
predecessor, have made the journey since then. An imperial tour is more
controversial, however, because it would be undertaken by a direct
descendant of the dynasty, at the time held in godlike esteem, which
presided over the brutal occupation of parts of China in the 1930s and
1940s.
The emperor, while thought likely to offer a form of words acknowledging the
excesses of that period, is not expected to refer directly to post-war
Chinese abuses.
China has been among a handful of east Asian countries to express
displeasure at a law permitting the deployment of Japanese troops in United
Nations peacekeeping missions, fearing a resurgence of militarism.
Similar qualms have also been aired among leftwingers in Japan, who are also
displeased at attempts to endow the emperor with a more political role. The
right is upset that Ziang Zemin, the Chinese Communist party chief who
visited Tokyo this spring, warned against a Japanese military revival which
it says a UN peacekeeping presence may presage.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Harbin remembers medical atrocities
</HEADLINE>

   HARBIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE most notorious site at Harbin, in north China, lies 20km south of the
city in the village of Pingfang, where a secret Japanese research
establishment experimented on living human beings from 1936 until the
Japanese surrender in August 1945.
During that time at least 3,000 people, mostly Chinese, Russians, Mongols,
and Koreans, were injected with deadly viruses, exposed to poison gas,
frozen slowly to observe the effects of frostbite, and dissected alive.
Unit 731 of the Japanese army was assigned to germ warfare research,
exposing people in north China, then the puppet Japanese state of Manchukuo,
to plague, dysentery, anthrax and tuberculosis.
When the Americans reached Pingfang at the end of the war, they freed the
perpetrators of these terrible crimes in exchange for all the research data
that had been collected. None of the 3,000 Japanese officers and men was
ever bought to trial. One thousand were medically qualified personnel like
the commander of Unit 731, Ishii Shiro, who died in his bed in 1959.
Jing Chengmin receives foreign guests to the little museum, opened a few
years ago to commemorate the victims and keep alive the memory of the
atrocities committed. It is housed in what were the offices of Commander
Shiro. The former headquarters building is used by Harbin Middle School
number 17.
Mr Jing, of Korean nationality, speaks Japanese and Korean and receives
6,000 foreigners to the museum a year, 4,000 of them Japanese. More than
40,000 Chinese come here every year. Mr Jing says the Japanese people know
about these atrocities, but not very much. The Japanese government still
tries to pretend these things were not done, but 'inside they know'.
It has taken decades to arrive at an official Japanese acknowledgement, made
last month, that the Imperial Army procured Asian women, most of them
Korean, as prostitutes. To better inform the Japanese people what happened
at Pingfang, a two-week exhibition was staged in Osaka in 1988.
With the collapse of Japan in 1945, Unit 731 tried to destroy all evidence
of its activities, blowing up the research centre and the central prison
where victims for live experiments were held. The animal houses were also
destroyed but Chinese claim that, before retreating in defeat, the Japanese
freed the infected animals, and 103 people in the surrounding area died of
the plague.
Among live testimony, recorded on video and sold by the museum, a former
Chinese forced labourer at Unit 731 recalls seeing the Japanese transport
victims by rail to the camp. A former Japanese soldier with the Unit
describes the horror of seeing people experimented on alive. They were tied
to trees a few metres apart and a bacterial bomb was exploded beside them.
'Sometimes you could not bear to watch it.'
The little museum, soon to be replaced by a larger, grander and perhaps less
effective building, sells souvenirs and fashion patterns, furs, necklaces,
scrolls and graphic black and white photographs of Japanese war crimes
against Chinese.
With suspected Nazi war criminals still being brought to trial in the west,
I asked Mr Jing how he felt about the fact that no Japanese involved with
the crimes against humanity perpetrated at Pingfang had ever came to trial.
'We should let bygones be bygones,' he said. 'This affair is history.'

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Peter Garrucho, the chief aide of Philippine President Fidel Ramos, has
resigned over policy differences on mining taxes.
Mr Ramos yesterday said he had accepted the 'irrevocable' resignation of Mr
Garrucho, who was his executive secretary and key adviser on energy affairs.
On July 3, only days after the Ramos administration assumed power, Mr
Garrucho signed an order instructing the Bureau of Internal Revenue to
refund Pesos 2bn (Pounds 43m) to mining companies, representing earlier
payments of value added taxes from which, Mr Garrucho ruled, they were
exempt.
The BIR differed, however, and brought up the matter with Mr Ramos, who
apparently was not consulted by Mr Garrucho before the order was issued.
The resignation raises for the administration the awkward prospect of a
cabinet upheaval after only five weeks in office.
Mr Ramos has picked Mr Edelmiro Amante, now a member of the House of
Representatives, as Mr Garrucho's replacement.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UN envoy likely to urge troops for Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations special representative in Somalia is expected to
recommend that troops should be sent to protect relief operations in the
war-shattered country, with or without the agreement of the warring
factions.
A potentially far-reaching UN precedent would be established should the
Security Council act on the recommendation and decide that humanitarian
considerations override claims of sovereignty made by fighting warlords.
The size of the force has yet to be agreed but UN Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun
has concluded that it is now essential to send at least a limited military
presence to Somalia to avert tens of thousands of deaths from starvation.
The shift in UN attitudes came as Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign
minister, arrived in Mogadishu yesterday for a three-day assessment visit.
Unicef, the UN children's agency, also said yesterday it had airlifted
emergency medical supplies to four towns where malnutrition rates among
children were 80 per cent and up to 15 children were dying in each town
every day.
Mr Sahnoun has said that at least 7,000 armed UN guards must be dispatched
urgently to protect and escort relief personnel and food convoys. Without
the approval of all sides, a limited military intervention with purely
humanitarian objectives is now envisaged to secure the international airport
and port in Mogadishu and to establish some safe relief corridors.
A UN team now in Somalia investigating how to get better security for an
expanded relief effort is due to report to the secretary general by the
weekend. The Security Council will consider its report before taking the
final decision on whether to approve the sending of UN troops. Pakistan,
Indonesia and Canada have already placed soldiers on stand-by for the
operation.
Mr Sahnoun is apparently now trying to twist the arm of General Mohamed
Farrar Aideed, the warlord who controls Mogadishu south and who has
threatened that he will shell UN troops who enter the country without his
approval. The ambassador is telling the general that it would be much better
for him to agree to a limited UN military intervention than face an
intervention going ahead without his approval.
The decision to send troops in a limited operation is likely to heal rifts
among UN officials over what to do about Somalia. Officials in the secretary
general's office have been pushing hard for full-scale military intervention
in Somalia. Mr Sahnoun has been cautioning New York that such an action
could be counter-productive for relief efforts if troops faced possible
violent opposition to their presence in the country.
It is now, however, recognised by all sides that military intervention is
the only possible way to ensure food aid reaches the needy instead of ending
up in the hands of bandits or merchants who are diverting relief supplies on
to the market.
But internal division in the UN is continuing to hold back the relief
effort.
Mr Sahnoun, who has achieved tremendous progress in gearing up the UN relief
effort since he was appointed by the secretary general in April, is
handicapped by lack of staff and resources from New York. His repeated
requests for additional assistance have not been met.
Observers say he is still working without the necessary support and is
dependent on the other UN agencies for transport and assistance. By
comparison, Mr Cyrus Vance, the recently appointed special envoy to South
Africa, has a full staff.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Philippines lifts foreign exchange controls to attract
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippine government yesterday announced the dismantling of foreign
exchange controls on current transactions, in an effort to attract more
foreign investment that could support future economic growth.
The liberalisation, announced jointly yesterday by President Fidel Ramos and
Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank, was approved by the
policy-making Monetary Board on Friday.
The move will allow the free flow of foreign exchange and gold into and out
of the Philippines by both residents and overseas investors. It will also
remove the requirement that foreign exchange earned abroad by
Philippine-based commodity and service exporters should be sold to Manila
banks.
Foreign exchange earners will also be allowed to spend their dollars
'freely', once implementing guidelines are put in place by the Central Bank,
without having to secure prior approval from the bank. Since January,
dollar-earners have been allowed to use freely up to 40 per cent of their
foreign exchange earnings, from only 2 per cent previously. In addition,
Philippine residents investing abroad will now be allowed to buy Dollars 1m
(Pounds 525,000) a year from local banks.
Mr Ramos said the liberalisation, which continued measures initiated last
year by former President Corazon Aquino, 'gives meaning and substance to
what I said: that deregulation is one of the key reforms to revive our
economy.'
The liberalisation, Mr Cuisia said, was 'encouraged' by an easing in the
pressure on the peso rate against the US dollar and by a notable increase in
foreign exchange inflows, mainly from remittances of Filipinos working
abroad and income from tourism.
At the end of July, gross international reserves of the Central Bank
amounted to approximately Dollars 4.2bn, representing nearly three months'
worth of imports. The reserves hit a peak in April of Dollars 5.5bn, which
enabled the Philippines to buy back Dollars 1.26bn of its foreign debt at a
discount of 48 per cent.
The overall balance of payments position for January-April showed a surplus
of Dollars 356m, up by some 26 per cent over the year before.
Also providing a boost was the elimination of a big source of Central Bank
losses. It recently unwound Dollars 800m worth of swap contracts that it
entered into in the 1980s to assume foreign exchange risks on loans secured
by local companies.
All these, according to Mr Cuisia, had made the bank confident of staving
off any speculative attack on the peso and paved the way for the
liberalisation efforts.
Since the start of this month, the peso value has been determined through
off-floor interbank trading. Instead of declining, as earlier feared, the
peso rate against the dollar had since risen, and the easing of the foreign
exchange controls could, according to some bankers, even push it up further.

A PROPOSED international treaty outlawing chemical weapons will eventually

draft by some developing countries, the chairman of the negotiating
committee predicted yesterday.
Mr Adolf von Wagner, chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons of
the UN Disarmament Conference, told reporters he was confident that the
treaty 'will have universal adherence - minus very few'. The final draft was
completed last Friday after 24 years of negotiations.
The treaty bans use, production and stockpiling of toxic arms, provides for
the destruction of existing weapons stocks over ten years, and institutes a
strict verification regime.
The US and Britain are among more than 50 countries which have said they
will sign the treaty, which needs 65 ratifications to come into force.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, yesterday
cast doubt over the future participation of the mainly Zulu Inkatha party in
constitutional talks.
Speaking to the board of directors of the Afrikaans publishing house
Perskor, he said Inkatha would not return to the Convention for a Democratic
South Africa (Codesa), the constitutional negotiating forum, 'as things
stand now'.
Chief Buthelezi did not himself take part in Codesa, in protest against the
exclusion from the talks of the Zulu king. Inkatha, however, was
represented. Although the Inkatha party is seen more as a regional power in
Kwazulu/Natal than a national political player, any constitutional talks
that proceeded without them would be fatally flawed.
Voicing clear disquiet that bilateral negotiations between the government
and the African National Congress (ANC) threaten to marginalise Inkatha,
Chief Buthelezi criticised President F W de Klerk, saying: 'I do not quite
know how to read Mr de Klerk at the moment. . . He gives evidence of
following appeasement politics towards the ANC in order to please the
international community.'
The Inkatha leader's comments are clearly a warning to the government that
his party will not play ball if it feels the ANC and government are
hijacking the negotiations process behind closed doors. He described
possible bilateral talks between the ANC and government as a 'threat to
democracy'.
Chief Buthelezi said Codesa was not fully representative and called for a
more broadly based negotiations process in which not only political parties
 -as was the case with Codesa - are represented.
Codesa's activities have been suspended for the past two months because of
the constitutional impasse between the government and the ANC. These parties
appear close to resuming talks, though there is general consensus that
Codesa structures will have to be amended to function more efficiently.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Army experts fearful of sending troops to Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN military experts remain deeply unhappy about becoming involved in
former Yugoslavia even though Nato officials yesterday got the go-ahead to
draw up contingency plans aimed at sending troops to protect humanitarian
relief convoys in Bosnia-Hercegovina,
'However much public opinion is forcing us to take the military option, any
Nato involvement will have a very high financial cost,' a Nato diplomat
said.
'It could have a high cost in human terms as well,' he said.
It would require at least 50,000 troops to open up two relief corridors into
the former Yugoslav republic, he said. 'Because of these large numbers, we
have repeatedly asked western leaders about what objectives they want to
achieve if they go in.'
In terms of the financial cost, experts working with Nato believe that for
every one soldier sent to Bosnia - to support the humanitarian relief effort
 -it would require the back-up of at least three more people.
'Sending in troops is one thing. But you have to back them up with food,
communications, medicine, equipment, supplies, transport. Who is going to
pay for this? Where are we going to get the troops from -if we decide to use
ground forces to protect the humanitarian relief convoys. It is going to
take a long time to get them stationed in Bosnia, if that is what we will be
pushed into doing,' another Nato diplomat said.
He also argued that Nato was simply not prepared for such an operation, even
though the organisation is currently seeking to create a rapid-deployment
force.
'For the past forty years, we were trained to defend Europe. We knew the
terrain. Our facilities were there. We knew what the aims of defending
Europe were.
'In the case of Bosnia, whether you accept it or not, we are entering enemy
territory. We don't know where we can place our supplies and reinforcements.
We have to be clear what we want out of this whole operation,' he said.
Military experts, including United Nations officials, also worry about the
future status of the UN peace-keeping forces both in the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo, and in Croatia.
'If you go in under the aegis of the UN, what happens to the UN
peace-keepers on the ground? They will not be seen as impartial, said
Brigadier Kenneth Hunt, a former RAF staff officer at Nato and
vice-president of the London-based International Institute for Strategic
Studies.
Brigadier Hunt argued that there was little point in sending in a small
force to protect the relief convoys. 'This has got to be a serious policy of
saturation, otherwise it will be meaningless, and a disaster.'
'Personally, I would opt for establishing safe havens for the refugees, and
some form of air power. I would not embark on mounting an operation to
protect the convoys,' said Brigadier Hunt.
Mr Willem van Eekelen, secretary general of the Western European Union
(WEU), the fledgeling defence arm of the European Community, agreed that
safe havens should be established for the refugees - but within Bosnia and
'before the Serbs grab even more land,' he said.
These havens should be protected by the WEU, while sanctions against Serbia
should be stepped up, by land and sea, with powers by individual countries
to search vessels.
'We have to do something. The alternative is worse. The war could spread to
the rest of the Balkans,' he said.

THE ROMANIAN government yesterday confirmed that 'tens of ships' displaying
Commonwealth of Independent States' flags were passing up the Danube towards
Serbia in apparent contravention of United Nations sanctions.
However, Mr Traian Basescu, minister of transport, said Romania has no
authority to stop vessels travelling on the Danube, even if there is strong
evidence they are breaking the UN embargo on trade with the former
Yugoslavia.
'Romania is in exactly the same position as the European Community in the
Adriatic: we have no right to stop shipping in international waters.'
Mr Basescu's comments follow reports that Romania has permitted
sanctions-breaking and that the chief offenders are CIS-flagged ships
embarking from Ukrainian ports. The Romanian port of Galati, last week
recorded around one CIS vessel a day heading for the Serbian port of
Pancevo, carrying cargoes of coal, metals, cars and spare parts.
Romania, traditionally a Serbian ally, has consistently said it is
respecting UN regulations. Both Mr Theodor Stolojan, the prime minister, and
President Ion Iliescu have invited western observers to check Romania's
compliance with the embargo, which they estimate will cost the country, up
to USDollars 3bn this year.
Western diplomats in Bucharest say they do not doubt the Romanian
government's willingness to co-operate. Rather, they believe the country,
which has a weak customs infrastructure, is incapable of policing adequately
either its borders or the Danube.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, has written to Mr
Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, urging him to
reconsider the issuing of a licence to a Marks and Spencer's supplier to
import clothes from Serbia, write David Owen and John Thornhill.
UN resolution 757, which was adopted on May 30 but did not come into force
in the UK until June 5, prohibits the importation of goods from Serbia and
Montenegro.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Union urges greater Bundesbank accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'uncontrolled power' of Germany's independent Bundesbank should be
balanced by greater accountability to parliament and other democratic
institutions, according to Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the I G Metall
trade union.
While the central bank paid 'extensive and excessive' attention to
inflation, it neglected its other legal and economic responsibilities, the
metal workers' leader said in a newspaper article yesterday.
Laws governing the central bank obliged it to support the overall economic
policies of the government, he wrote. Price stability was only one of its
responsibilities; others included increasing employment, steady economic
growth and foreign trade balances.
He wrote that the bank 'sets itself apart from the democratic exchanges over
economic policy aims with its extreme and one-sided focus on price
stability'.
He proposed that the bank present reports at least once a year for debate in
the Bundestag. Parliamentary committees should be able to summon officials
to hearings, and the bank should have a new advisory committee to reflect
the views of society at large.
Democratising German monetary policy in this way was all the more important
in the light of the planned establishment of an independent European central
bank, he said.
This, too, should have increased accountability. The right to hearings and
consultation should apply not just to the European Parliament but to the
economic and social committee, for example. Federal factions, such as the
central banks of Germany's individual states, should also have a say.
Referring to the recent controversial increase in the discount rate, he said
indirect attempts to control inflation through attacking money supply had
negative side-effects. 'All too often a blow aimed at money supply ends up
hitting companies' solvency and their ability to invest,' he claimed.
Seizing on the political and business criticism - at home and abroad - of
July's rate increase, Mr Steinkuhler said the protests must be taken to
heart and the bank should be set new aims.
Although the governing coalition was upset by the Bundesbank's latest move,
which was against the wishes of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, the
parties rejected the union leader's proposals.
'Price stability must remain the main aim of our economic and finance
policy,' said Mr Gunnar Uldall, representing the main Christian
Democrat/Christian Social Union group.
Liberal Democrats leader Otto Lambsdorff suggested the union leader would be
better occupied contemplating the inflationary effects of I G Metall's pay
demands than criticising the Bundesbank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday accused
the 12 EC members of a dangerous lack of resolve in their action over the
crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In a passionate speech to an emergency meeting of MEPs, Mr Delors called for
'realistic military intervention' in the former Yugoslav republic to prevent
the 'cunning and murderous strategy of the Serb leaders' spreading through
the Balkans.
MEPs added their voices to the attack on member governments by fiercely
criticising Britain, which holds the EC presidency, for not taking firmer
action.
'Can the 12 agree to develop a credible military response to demonstrate our
resolve, even if we don't have to use it, or will the 12 remain at sixes and
sevens? Will we see the same sort of disagreement that has started to spring
up around the treaty on European union?' asked Mr Delors, in an unscripted
dig at the EC partners' disarray over the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Delors outlined a six-point plan to help relieve the suffering of Bosnian
refugees and prisoners. The Commission proposals include:
International supervision of detention camps.
A safe corridor for the delivery of humanitarian aid - protected by military
forces, if necessary.
Aid to ex-Yugoslav republics looking after refugees.
Temporary shelter for refugees in other European countries.
Reinforcement of the embargo on trade with Serbia.
Step up diplomatic action to ensure protection of human rights.
Mr Abel Matutes, the EC commissioner responsible for the region, said he was
particularly worried that the embargo was being broken along the shores of
the Danube and Black Sea. He called for armed inspectors to control imports
to Serbia.
Mr Douglas Hogg, the UK's junior foreign office minister, met Mr Delors, Mr
Matutes and European deputies in Brussels yesterday to prepare for the
London peace conference to be held at the end of this month. He later flew
to Moscow, where he will meet government officials before flying on to
Prague on Wednesday and Belgrade on Thursday.
He missed yesterday's European parliament meeting, where a number of
deputies attacked the presidency. Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the
socialist group, the largest in the parliament, asked whether Britain was up
to the task of handling the Yugoslav crisis.
Mr Willem van Velzen, a Dutch socialist, said discussions with Mr Hogg had
been 'extremely disappointing'. 'I'm more concerned about the victims of
this conflict, but the presidency seemed more worried about the aggressors,'
he claimed.
MEPs also heard from representatives of the UN High Commission for Refugees
and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Mr Paul
Grossrieder, of the ICRC, said his organisation was trying to maintain an
objective view of the crisis, and would not make any formal statement on the
detention camps until it had visited them all.
He said calls for the ICRC to supervise the camps 'do not take account of
the fact that our organisation is not made up of prison wardens'.

EUROPE'S airlines face a tough second half, with the recovery from last
year's Gulf war-induced fall in passenger numbers slowing, the 23-member
Association of European Airlines (AEA), warned yesterday.
The improvement over 1991 would drop from 18.4 per cent in the first six
months to 7.5 per cent over the second half of the year.
Traffic to South America and the Middle East continued to grow in the first
half; that to Africa and Asia remained static at 1990 levels.

FT  11 AUG 92 / German privatisation: Eye-catching but little for sale -
Constitutional and other hurdles suggest progress will be slow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE window-dressing put up for the recent re-opening of Germany's
privatisation programme was certainly eye-catching. But for all the
promotional build-up, the government had precious little to offer for
immediate sale.
Finance minister Mr Theo Waigel unveiled plans to press on with the sale of
'a good two dozen' state concerns against a backdrop that plugged Deutsche
Telekom, the country's telecommunications network, as 'the people's share of
the 90s'. Mr Waigel warned, however, that privatising Telekom would require
a change in the constitution. That could take years.
The government also promised to sell off its remaining 51 per cent stake in
Lufthansa, the state airline, 'as soon as possible'. But, as the Finance
Ministry pointed out, stock markets are not in the best of condition at the
moment. Nor is the airline: it lost DM600m (Pounds 213m) in the first five
months of this year.
In fact, Mr Waigel's slender inventory, approved by the cabinet last week,
included only odds and ends: the Mon Repos convalescent home in Davos,
Switzerland; Bonn's holdings in the federal network of motorway filling
stations and cafes; and an array of consultancies, house-building concerns
and canals.
The latest initiative, which follows the finance minister's declaration
earlier this year that privatisation must proceed 'without taboos', suggests
that the final stage of federal withdrawal from commerce is approaching.
His initial task is to convince the opposition Social Democrats, especially
those representatives of the independently-minded Lander sitting in the
Bundesrat, or upper house, that privatisation is both politically and
economically necessary. The Bundesrat holds the power to block
constitutional changes necessary before Telekom and the railway network can
be freed from state control.
Encouragingly, the opposition minority in the Bundestag is already tilting
in favour of change. Mr Arne Bornsen, the SPD's postal services spokesman,
admits that the SPD's 'ideological barriers to privatisation' are coming
down. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the opposition leader, has gone so far as to write
to Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, urging rapid reform of the railways and
offering unspecified support for constitutional amendments.
However, SPD opposition outside the Bundestag remains deep-seated. A recent
suggestion from the monopolies commission (an independent group of
parliamentary advisers separate from the cartel office), that banks owned by
the Lander should be privatised, was promptly rejected by most of the 16
state prime ministers. The mostly SPD-controlled Lander governments also
hold substantial stakes in assets such as airports, insurance companies and
utility groups, which have considerable importance as symbols of the federal
states' independence.
Before Mr Engholm can fully endorse Mr Waigel's plans, the SPD must also
find ways of damping resistance among its traditional supporters in the
trade unions. They fear job cuts and the loss to many members of their
treasured civil service status - and their effective right to jobs for life.
Mr Waigel's response to opponents is that business is not a job for
politicians. But there are other, more powerful, forces behind his renewed
campaign. The government has long been convinced that telecommunications, in
particular, needs to be privatised to become a more effective international
competitor.
However, the crucial factor behind the renewed drive is the financial strain
of unification. This threatens to push up total state debt from its current
level of DM1,300bn to DM1,900bn (Pounds 674bn) by 1995. With some 20 per
cent of annual west German output now being transferred to the east, the
Finance Ministry wants to place as many of the country's productive
resources as possible into efficient, tax-paying private hands.
The loss-making railways alone expect debts and accumulated losses of almost
DM420bn by the end of the decade. According to Mr Gunther Krause, transport
minister, merging the eastern and western networks into a public limited
company - to be called Deutsche Eisenbahn - freeing it from direct
government control, and allowing at least partial privatisation, will almost
halve the expected burden on the state.
Profitable Telekom - which at present has to contribute the equivalent of 10
per cent of its annual revenues to finance deficits elsewhere in the
Bundespost system - is expected to borrow DM17bn this year alone to fund the
installation of new connections in the east. The estimated total cost of
upgrading the former GDR is DM60bn.
As budgetary pressures continue to build, it seems likely that the Lander
may undergo a change of heart. Under the treaty of unification, they are
committed to take over a substantial proportion of the costs of unification
from Bonn, starting in 1995. The already heavily-indebted state governments
have also been told by Bonn to freeze public spending for the next four
years.
Experience and the remaining constitutional hurdles suggest progress will
not be quick. Germany began its phased exit from a handful of industrial
enterprises in 1959, and managed to finish it just 30 years later.
Even so, that experience has given Mr Waigel some fine examples to
demonstrate the benefits of state withdrawal from commerce - the former
state-controlled conglomerates, Veba and Viag, engineering group Preussag,
and Volkswagen, the vehicle maker, today rank among the 20 biggest and most
successful companies in Germany.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Germany 'unable' to defend aid convoys: Kinkel may consider
cutting links with Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY will not be able, 'unfortunately', to take part in the armed defence
of aid convoys in the former Yugoslavia, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister,
said yesterday.
While he welcomed the possibility of a scheme to protect shipments of
humanitarian aid, he believed constitutional constraints and political
problems stemming from Germany's wartime occupation of Yugoslavia probably
ruled out direct participation.
He assumed that, since the US, Britain and France had brought the issue up
in the UN Security Council, they would be prepared to take action, he said
in a radio interview.
Officials refused to comment on what non-military contributions Germany
might be prepared to make. Although funding seems the most likely means,
they pointed out that Bonn had already contributed far more humanitarian
help than its partners.
Meanwhile, Mr Kinkel suggested, Germany was willing to consider breaking all
diplomatic links with Serbia and other means of increasing pressure for an
end to the war.
A European conference in London on August 26 would discuss further
tightening the trade embargo, especially on land routes, and the exclusion
of Serbia and Montenegro from all international organisations.
Mainstream German political opinion, while solidly against any outside
military involvement, has hardened in the past few days, following the
transmission of pictures of prisoners in Serbian internment camps. Many
leaders are now resigned to the view that action will ultimately be
necessary, although an opinion poll yesterday showed a 77 per cent majority
against intervention.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader of the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition,
yesterday rebuked party members for breaking ranks and calling for military
action.
However, even he suggested that in extremis his party might accept German
participation under strict control and conditions.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who spoke at the weekend of 'concentration camps'
and 'genocide' in Bosnia, said he would immediately reopen talks on German
military involvement in the event of the UN approving an all-out blockade
against Serbia.
Germany's limited contribution in the aerial and warship-based monitoring of
Adriatic sea routes is to be examined in the constitutional court in
Karlsruhe following an appeal from the SPD.
The US yesterday secured the backing of over 30 countries for an
unprecedented extraordinary session of the UN Human Rights Commission on
human rights abuses in Bosnia-Hercegovina and elsewhere in the former
Yugoslavia. Agreement of 27 countries was required to call the session of
the 53-member commission, which will meet in Geneva next Thursday and
Friday, Frances Williams writes from Geneva.
A US-drafted resolution, with western backing, draws attention to 'gross
violations' of human rights in the region, calls for immediate access to
detention camps for the International Committee of the Red Cross, and
mandates the UN secretary general to appoint one or more special
representatives to investigate human rights abuses.
Last week Washington said it had begun discussion at the UN on a Security
Council resolution on war crimes, which would make the states of the former
Yugoslavia as well as individuals punishable for violations of international
humanitarian law.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Watching Capricorn rise over
Capitol Hill - A Washington junket devoted to the delights of goat's milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME WINE and cheese parties could be held only in Washington.
Take a recent Thursday afternoon on Capitol Hill. An august congressional
hearing room with a red carpet and stucco walls was spruced up for a
reception: wines and cheeses, both domestic of course, were served and a
motley group of hosts, ruddy-faced and wearing paper name tags, met all
visitors with hearty handshakes.
The talk that filled the air was of one thing only, a subject so dear to the
hearts of all the constituents who travelled to Washington: goats.
The American Dairy Goat Producers Association had put on the party,
according to one of its pamphlets, 'to introduce you to the wonderful world
of dairy goats' who are 'alert, intelligent, socially inclined and
affectionate. A loving and loved pet'.
In fact, the gala affair was only a taste sampling. No cheques or
endorsements at this gathering, only goat cheeses (from chevre to
mozzarella), goat ice cream (chocolate and vanilla), goat butter, goat bon
bons, goat milk, goat yoghurt, goat fudge.
'We're not lobbyists,' said Mr Larry White, a goat and cattle farmer from
Virginia. 'Just trying to get the word out that goat products taste good.'
And, perhaps taking a cue from the Rio Earth Summit, participants emphasised
that their produce was environmentally correct, too. Compared with cows -
the industry's main, and so far untouchable, competitor in the milk market -
goats eat more sparingly and take up less space, and thus put less of a
strain on the earth's resources.
Pound for pound, the goat produces twice the milk a cow can, which is not a
bad sell for economic efficiency in recession-plagued America. 'In the US,
we think bigger is better,' said Ms Linda Cambell, the association's
president, adding that if people were truly serious about economising they
would switch from cow milk to goat milk.
Just as dear to Americans are health concerns, and the goat enthusiasts have
points to make here. Goat milk, with fewer calories and less fat, is
considered healthier than the bovine; this is especially true for those with
weak stomachs, because the protein structure of goat's milk is easier to
break down, according to Mr Jerome Samuels, who not only distributes it but
drinks it to alleviate his own stomach ulcers.
Ms Emily Benedict, who raises cows and goats on her 260-hectare (650-acre)
farm in West Virginia, noted that ironically 'heifers grow better on goat
milk than cow milk.' Little wonder, then, that goat milk is so popular in
health food stores, and especially in California.
But there is a problem. The goat people, like many other Americans, feel a
little disaffected and marginalised by foreign competition and domestic
prejudice.
The foreign threat comes principally from France, which is also a bete noir
of US trade officials. The French dominate the goat cheese market. Although
domestic production of 1.8m lb exceeds the 1.1m lb that is imported from
France, producers lament that the French product is more popular and more
easily available in America. The standard excuse is that US labour costs are
higher and product quality regulations stricter, while the French
under-price their cheeses in the US market and simultaneously play on the
American bias in favour of French cheese.
An appeal to patriotism may be just what is needed. 'We need to promote
'Made in America',' said Ms Cambell, whose group represents 13,000 farmers
and some 400,000 goats. 'The US imports a tremendous amount of goat cheese,
but ours is just as good as the French.'
Even so, bias is not limited to snobbery. Mr Samuels, the goat milk
distributor, said that his product 'has a stigma attached to it - just the
name'. The group, through these meetings, tries to show people that in fact
goat milk 'tastes great'.
And yet, despite the innocuous billing for the party, the political designs
were not far beneath the surface, as became apparent with the arrival of a
Very Important Guest (nobody dared call him the big cheese) to meet the
flock.
This was the powerful House Agriculture Committee chairman, Mr Kika de la
Garza, a Democrat from Texas. He is the group's champion on dairy goat
research, alternative agriculture funds, and medical research for (not on)
goats. He too, like the less prominent congressmen who came before him,
shook hands, had his picture taken, and departed five minutes later without
trying either the Alabama soft chevre or the Oregon feta.
Out in the hallway - irreverently called the Gucci Gulch, because many
well-dressed and well-paid lobbyists drift there to sway votes during
committee hearings - Mr de la Garza explained his commitment to the goat.
'I grew up drinking goat milk in Texas,' he said. 'We have to make the
palates of Americans knowledgeable of the delicacies of the dairy goat.'
So the day was a success. The products were plugged and Mr de la Garza saw
them. And as the sun set on the Hill everyone went back to their goat farms
with their faith in American democracy, and their legislative priorities,
renewed.

Profit taking and long liquidation pushed New York's PLATINUM futures down
sharply by midday, knocking the London bullion market price lower. New York
analysts predicted a further fall as prices had slipped through an uptrend
line. Chartists predicted a further fall to Dollars 365 a troy ounce for
October delivery. A drop in Japan's Nikkei stock index sparked speculation
that demand will lessen in the world's biggest importer. A belief that South
Africa's government will resume constitutional talks with the ANC prompted
expectations that tension would ease in the world's biggest producer.
Considering platinum's fall, GOLD had held up well, a London trader said.
But Comex gold futures were easier at midday and analysts were predicting a
further fall because of a sharp drop in the CRB index, a widely watched
inflation indicator. New York's arabica COFFEE futures had hit lifetime lows
twice by midday. A report in a Bogota newspaper that Colombia would increase
its coffee exports undermined prices. The fall pushed the London robusta
market lower, although traders said there was no physical reason for the
retreat.

TAIWAN'S biggest bank said it would stop providing loans for investment in
China to stem a rapidly growing outflow of capital to the Chinese mainland,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
According to the government-run radio, the state-owned Bank of Taiwan said
the measure would stimulate sluggish domestic investment and boost the
island's economy because excessive capital outflow to China was causing a
severe shortage of funds at home.
Bank of Taiwan will refuse applications from local companies for loans to
invest in China, and will close all channels for remittances of funds there
Mr Pu Chen-ming, the bank's president, said.
The bank's decision, reached at a board meeting on Monday, would pressure
other banks to cut their China lending, Mr Pu said.
Total Taiwanese investment in China has soared to well over USDollars 3bn
since political tensions began easing in the late 1980s.
Net capital outflow from Taiwan surged to Dollars 1.2bn in the first quarter
of this year from Dollars 550m a year earlier, and economists say much of
the money went to China.
Government officials and analysts are concerned at the outflow, saying it
was helping to push up domestic interest rates and suck money from the
battered stock market.
It was not clear how much of an effect the decision would have on Taiwanese
investment in China, as many businesses obtain funds through channels other
than domestic banks.

fund launched
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that Argentine and Brazilian bonds will repeat some of the spectacular
gains recorded by Mexican and Venezuelan instruments after debt reduction
agreements with their foreign bank creditors have prompted the launch of a
specialised Dollars 50m fund.
The Morgan Grenfell Latin American Brady Fund comes as both Argentina and
Brazil are close to completing agreements to convert their bank debt into
so-called 'Brady bonds', named after the former US treasury secretary.
Since Mexico became the first country to issue Brady bonds, in March 1990,
holders of Brady bonds have made substantial paper gains.
The Salomon Brothers index of Brady bonds, consisting mainly of Mexican and
Venezuelan instruments, recorded a cumulative return of around 75 per cent
in its first two years.
Morgan Grenfell's new fund is set to join a small list of investment
vehicles which specialise in Latin American Debt.
Others, such as those run by the London-based Latin American Securities and
Scudder Stevens &amp; Clark of the US, are designed to benefit on the higher
yield of debt securities from Latin American borrowers.
The Morgan Grenfell fund, on the other hand, aims to bring investors capital
gains following the completion of Brady-style deals in Argentina and Brazil.
The Dollars 50m closed-end fund, which terminates in 1993, is arranged
jointly with Nafinsa, the Mexican state development bank, and Banco Medefin
of Argentina. Leverage means that up to Dollars 100m can be invested.
The bank debt of both Argentina and Brazil is currently languishing as a
result of the political scandal in Brazil and concerns about the ability of
both countries to provide the necessary collateral to back their proposed
Brady bonds.

Eurobond

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's rehabilitation in the international financial markets
suffered a setback yesterday, when Escom (South Africa's Electricity Supply
Commission) abandoned plans to launch a Dollars 150m Eurobond in September,
as investor appetite for the offering has evaporated due to political
uncertainty over the country's future. Instead, Escom will raise funds to
refinance a maturing bond issue in the domestic market.
Less than a year ago, the South African government returned to the
international markets after a six-year absence, launching a DM400m five-year
bond issue arranged by Deutsche Bank, the first international bond offering
by a South African borrower since 1985.
In March, the South African electricity utility returned to the market with
a DM300m five-year deal, sold mainly to retail investors in continental
Europe. The new deal would have been the first of the recent batch by South
African borrowers to be denominated in dollars and so would have needed a
stronger institutional investor base.
Following the African National Congress's suspension of talks on a
multi-racial constitution in June, after the Boipatong massacre, millions of
its supporters last week took part in a two-day general strike.
'When conditions are right, we will be back in the international market,'
said Mr Mick Davis, executive director, finance at Eskom.
Bankers said that before the recent setbacks to political process in South
Africa, Escom would have expected to pay a premium of 200-250 basis points
over the US Treasury yield curve.
Meanwhile, activity in the Eurobond market was subdued. The latest variation
on the recent flurry of floating-rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon
levels was provided by Deutsche Bank Finance, which launched a CDollars 100m
issue of floating-rate notes due 2002, arranged by Deutsche Bank.

SUCCESSFUL international diversification has helped Coca-Cola Amatil,
Australia's biggest soft drink and snack food company, overcome recessed
domestic conditions and record a solid earnings rise in the first half to
June.
The company yesterday announced a 19 per cent advance in net profits to
ADollars 25.1m (USDollars 18.5m) from ADollars 21.1m a year earlier, on a 15
per cent rise in sales to ADollars 968.3m. from ADollars 841.7m. The interim
dividend is being raised to 8.5 cents a share from 7.5 cents.
A breakdown of pre-tax profits showed that profits from Australia fell to
ADollars 59.9m from ADollars 64.3m, on virtually static sales of ADollars
640.5m.
However, combined earnings of the company's Asian and European divisions
jumped to ADollars 26.5m from ADollars 16.4m on a 62 per cent jump in sales
from ADollars 200.1m to ADollars 324.8m.
The bulk of earnings again came from the company's beverage division, which
lifted pre-tax profits to ADollars 70.6m from ADollars 68.5m, while the
snack food division's profits rose to ADollars 15.7m from ADollars 12.3m.
The directors said soft drinks in Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
continued to achieve growth in sales and profits, but European snack food
businesses were affected by intense competition.
West Australian Newspaper Holdings, the newly floated Perth media group, is
on the way to exceeding its prospectus forecasts for the current year to
June, after a solid maiden earnings report yesterday.
The group unveiled net profits of ADollars 14.1m for the six months to June
30, it's first period as a public company. Sales totalled ADollars 101.4m
and a 4 cents a share final dividend has been declared.
Mr Trevor Eastwood, chairman, said yesterday that transactions during the
period under review lifted the group's estimated tax losses to about
ADollars 320m from ADollars 79.9m, subject to tax office approval.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu now faces up to harsh
economic realities - Japan's recession has weakened demand in the computer
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S full-line computer manufacturers - which make every size of computer
from notebooks to mainframes - are discovering they are no longer immune to
the harsh commercial realities which have hit their western competitors over
the past two years.
Fujitsu, second only to International Business Machines (IBM) of the US
among global information technology (IT) companies, is warning it will incur
pre-tax losses of about Y10bn (Dollars 78.7m) in the first half to
September. It will not be the only Japanese electronics company to downgrade
its forecasts, as their domestic market continues in the doldrums.
IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, made pre-tax losses last
year of Dollars 2.8bn, chiefly as a result of stagnant mainframe sales and
heavy restructuring charges. It will have shed up to 80,000 people by the
end of this year.
A Japanese computer specialist, asked to describe the difference between the
plight of IBM and Fujitsu, said: 'They both have the same serious problems,
but Fujitsu is in a worse position because Japanese companies cannot sack
their workers.'
Fujitsu broke with that tradition last week by sacking 260 workers at one of
its two US semiconductor plants. It has yet to trim its domestic workforce,
however, and has only just begun to prune loss-making products.
In common with other Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu had not made cuts in
the hope that domestic economic recovery would come this summer. It is now
clear, however, that Japan's economy will remain stagnant at least until
early next year.
This will have serious consequences for the full-line computer companies.
Western manufacturers have been suffering for two years from a combination
of stagnant demand, rapidly rising research and development costs and fierce
price competition.
They have also been hit by moves among customers to standard or 'open'
systems which have contributed to declining prices.
Japanese manufacturers have been comparatively immune to these factors
because of buoyant domestic demand for mainframe computers, especially from
the banks. Open systems, moreover, have yet to have much influence on the
Japanese market.
The Japanese recession, however, has damped demand significantly. Studies
such as a recent report from the Japanese economic planning agency indicate
that the financial sector intends to reduce capital spending by about 28 per
cent in the second half of 1992, after a 7 per cent reduction in the first
half.
Full-line companies make most of their profits from mainframe sales where
the gross profit margin can be more than 60 per cent. Fujitsu may suffer
more than the other Japanese full-line makers because, as the spearhead of
Japan's challenge to the west in computers, it makes only computers,
semiconductors and telecommunications products.
On the other hand Hitachi, another Japanese full-line producer, also
manufactures heavy electrical equipment, and will benefit from Japan's
supplementary budget this year which is likely to fund new power plants and
roads.
Fujitsu said the heady days of the late 1980s blurred its perspective on
longer-term demand. Japanese personal computer output rose 69 per cent in
1989, while that of all industrial electronic equipment rose 21 per cent in
1988, partly in response to increasing demand from securities companies and
banks, which expanded rapidly during the easy-money era.
Fujitsu's profits rose as dramatically as the Nikkei stock market average
during those years. Parent pre-tax profit rose from Y22.6bn in the year to
end-March 1987 to Y60.4bn in 1988, Y106.4bn in 1989 and Y127bn for the
period to March 1990.
Securities houses are now cutting their investments in computers and, in
some cases, cancelling contracts, while Japan's manufacturing industry is
expected to reduce capital spending by about 2.8 per cent in the second half
of this year.
'If you look at business on a short-term basis, there is over-capacity now.
Maybe the timing of our expansion in the late 1980s was not very good.
However, our markets are still growing in the longer-term,' Fujitsu said.
The company is predicting overall pre-tax profits of about Y40bn this year.
A side-effect of the increased spending on plant was a heavy depreciation
burden. Consolidated depreciation charges rose by 17 per cent last year. The
company is hoping to slow that growth by cutting plant expenditure by 30 per
cent this year.
It is attempting to cut costs in other areas. It has decided to withdraw
from the US fax market, merged two of its software subsidiaries, and is to
reduce its graduate intake next year to 1,250, about 100 fewer than this
year. Fujitsu also said it is attempting to 'shift the emphasis from
hardware to software' to improve profitability.
But it is resisting pressure to lay off workers in Japan: 'We don't have any
plan to cut workers here. We have cut the pay of executives and limited
managers' pay rises. These are difficult decisions,' it said.
It will not withdraw from the loss-making memory chip business, though it
said 'we have to be more selective about memory chips', which account for
about 30 per cent of its total chip production. Last month, Fujitsu
committed itself to a joint venture to develop flash memory chips with
Advanced Micro Devices of the US.
Fujitsu's global family of IT companies, including ICL of the UK in which it
holds an 80 per cent stake, seem unlikely to be affected by its financial
difficulties. ICL made pre-tax profits last year and expects to repeat the
performance in 1992. There are no plans to interrupt the timetable for
flotation agreed two years ago when Fujitsu took its stake in the company.
Up to 49 per cent of ICL will be floated in London by 1995 at a minimum
price of 225p a share.

HIGHLANDS Gold, the Papua New Guinea gold miner controlled by the leading
Australian metals group MIM Holdings, raised profits by almost 78 per cent
in the year to June, despite a large exploration write-off.
The company lifted net earnings to K51.9m (Dollars 54.2m) from K29.08 on
almost doubled revenue of K161.9m compared with K85.5m.
The company will pay a final dividend of 3.5 toea a share, making 5.5 toea
for the year.
Mr Norman Fussel, chairman, said the group's 30 per cent interest in the
Porgera mine generated pre-tax earnings of K87.0m.
The group's share of Porgera's gold sales was 437,300 oz and the net
realised gold sales price averaged K367oz.
The result followed an exploration write-off of K9m. Tax took K29.4m against
K20.8m and depreciation K24.8m compared with K18.3m. Bougainville Copper the
company that operated the Panguna copper mine in Papua New Guinea until the
mine was forced to close by separatist rebels in May 1989, has reported net
losses of K1.4m for the first half to June.
Bougainville Copper is 53.6 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian resources
group.

<TEXT>
CHUGAI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug company, yesterday reported a
sharp rise in interim profits for the first six months to June, thanks to
strong sales of its blood and body-fluid agents.
Chugai's non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 50 per cent to Y5.8bn
(Dollars 45.5m), some Y2bn higher than it forecast. Operating profits soared
97.7 per cent to Y6.7bn, on a 7.1 per cent rise in overall sales to Y68.8bn.
Net profits rose 6.1 per cent to Y2bn.
Sales of Chugai's blood and body-fluid agents, including Epogin, a renal
anaemia remedy, surged 77.7 per cent to Y15.8bn. However, sales of metabolic
agents fell 9.6 per cent to Y12.1bn.
The company reported extraordinary losses of Y1.3bn related to the
liquidation of Chugai-Upjohn, a Chicago-based joint venture with Upjohn, the
US pharmaceutical group.
For the year to December, Chugai expects a 32.3 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y14bn, a Y2bn increase from its previous estimates, on a 8.8 per
cent increase in sales to Y145bn. Net profits are expected to rise 33.2 per
cent to Y5.5bn, Y500m higher than initial projections.
Showa Denko, a leading Japanese chemicals manufacturer, suffered a 76.7 per
cent fall in first-half pre-tax profits as weakening sales compounded the
burden of settling US lawsuits related to a dietary supplement, writes
Gordon Cramb in Tokyo.
Showa Denko wrote off Y19.9bn in the six months to June, of which Y12.3bn
went to patients in the US who had alleged that its L-Tryptophan nutritional
compound caused blood disorders and muscle pains. The remainder was absorbed
by legal fees and in providing for a research fund.
On sales 15.6 per cent down at Y259.9bn, taxable profits in the six months
to June were Y2.84bn. Net earnings were 43.9 per cent lower at Y1.09bn.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bombay mix for US investors -
The planned launch of an India country fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN India country fund is to be launched later this year, following the
announcement of a joint venture between a leading US money manager and
India's biggest mutual fund group.
The partners are the US investment firm Alliance Capital, which has Dollars
62bn of mutual fund assets, and Unit Trust of India, the government-owned
mutual fund group which, with Dollars 10bn in assets and 21m unit holder
accounts, dominates the Indian money management business.
The result of their partnership is the Bombay-based investment management
company Unit Trust Alliance Asset Management (UTAAM), the first joint
venture of its kind in India.
The partnership has two purposes: to provide Indian investors with
Alliance's know-how learnt in more developed investment markets, and to sell
Indian securities to overseas investors through new country funds. These
country funds will compete alongside two existing UTI-managed vehicles, the
India Fund, listed in London and the India Growth Fund in New York.
UTAAM hopes for fresh demand for Indian securities around the world by
concentrating on privatisation issues.
It is a policy that has worked well in Mexico, Argentina and other countries
where governments have been selling off state-owned assets. Alliance
believes investors will be drawn by the growth potential and attractive
pricing of privatised issues.
In the past year, the Indian government has sold Dollars 1bn of equity in
public enterprises, and another Dollars 1bn of nationalised holdings is due
to be sold off in the coming year.
The first UTAAM fund is to be launched later this year in New York, Boston,
Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Paris and Zurich. However, the volatile
performance of the New York-listed India Growth Fund, which stands at a
discount to net asset value after falling sharply in the wake of the Bombay
stock market scandal, is a bad advert for potential investors in the new
fund.
Although emerging market country funds are notoriously volatile, and because
of their ups and downs have lost some of their attractiveness, they remain a
draw for sophisticated investors with an appetite for risk.
As Mr Thomas Herzfeld, a leading US authority on closed-end funds, says:
'The time to buy country funds is when they are at a discount. It's a game
for contrarian investors.'
It is a point echoed by Mr Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance, who does not
think the volatility, and occasional scandals, of emerging markets will
greatly deter potential customers of UTAAM. He says: 'Investors in emerging
markets come to expect the unexpected. It goes with the territory.'
In the US, UTAAM is not entering a particularly crowded market.
US investors interested in India have only a few vehicles to choose from.
Apart from the India Growth Fund, there are a handful of regional funds.
About 5 per cent of the Scudder Group's New Asia fund is in India, much the
same as the Indian market's share of the Asia Pacific fund run by
Prudential.
The latter offers access to Hong Kong, Malaysian, Thailand, Singapore and
Korean equities, and with three new China funds launched just last month,
and Philippine, Taiwan and Malaysian country funds also quoted in New York,
there is more choice for investors interested in the emerging markets of the
Asian and Pacific Rim regions.

TORONTO Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth largest, will buy Central Guaranty
Trust from the troubled Central Capital financial services group.
Guaranty, the country's fourth largest trust company, was formerly the
centrepiece of Central Capital, the holding company of Mr Leonard Ellen, a
Montreal financier,
Central Capital piled up excessive debt in a two-year acquisition spree, and
was caught by the recession and the Canadian property crisis. Toronto
Dominion Bank will negotiate terms for taking over Guaranty, which has
CDollars 9bn (USDollars 7.6bn) of assets and 160 branches. It is also taking
over its deposit liabilities.
The bank defeated a joint offer by National Bank of Canada, Canada Trust and
Montreal Trust.
The deal has been approved by the Federal Central Deposit Insurance
Corporation and federal regulators. The bank aims to increase its market
share in Ontario and the Maritimes and step up its trust activities.
SNC Group, Canada's biggest engineering and construction group, says costs
will be cut further in the second half, in spite of growing international
business.
SNC, which specialises in energy, petrochemicals and metallurgical plant
engineering and construction management, earned CDollars 700,000 or 5 cents
a share in the first half, against CDollars 3.7m or 32 cents a share a year
earlier.
Revenues advanced to CDollars 319m from CDollars 219m. This increase came
mainly from the takeover of Lavalin, SNC's rival, last year.
The domestic market has been slowed by the recession and delays in
hydroelectric and other projects. Internationally, several big transport and
energy projects were also held up.

<TEXT>
CHILE'S loss-making state railway, one of the few companies that remains in
public ownership, is to be privatised. The sale of Empresa de Ferrocariles
del Estado (Efe) was given parliamentary approval last week.
Its cargo and passenger services will be put to public tender, while the
government will continue to own the network of stations and railway tracks.
Parliament also authorised the railway company to issue up to Dollars
75m-worth of government-guaranteed bonds to clear part of its Dollars 100m
debt. Another Dollars 75m bond issue will be earmarked to upgrade tracks and
rolling stock.
The government hopes an injection of private capital will help modernise
services after decades of neglect.
Most of Chile's 10,000 km of track has fallen into disuse. Passenger
services to the north of Santiago and between Chile and Argentina no longer
exist. In addition, the railways have lost most of their cargo business to
road transport.
Only the railway, water companies, the state lottery and Codelco, the
Chilean Copper Corporation, remain in state hands following the 1973-90
military government's sweeping programme of privatisations.
However, business leaders and conservative opposition parties are urging
President Patricio Aylwin's centre-left government to privatise Codelco, the
world's biggest copper producer.

FREIA MARABOU, the Norwegian chocolate and confectionery group, yesterday
reported a slight increase in half-year pre-tax profits to NKr236m (Dollars
41m) from NKr225m a year earlier.
The company pushed up profits in spite of a dip in chocolate sales. Group
sales slipped to NKr2.608bn from NKr2.664bn due to exceptionally warm
weather in May and June.
Operating profit in the six-month period declined to NKr225m from NKr245m in
the same period last year, but operating costs were reduced to NKr2.252bn
from NKr2.310bn.
The chocolate division saw operating income fall to NKr1.294bn from
NKr1.371bn, although its share of the Nordic market was maintained at 32 per
cent.
Chocolate exports increased, especially to Germany where they rose by 28 per
cent, measured in value. Exports to the UK fell slightly, but tax-free sales
advanced 20 per cent.
Freia said work began in May on a new chocolate plant in Belgium and trial
production would start in the second half of 1993.
In the confectionery division, first-half operating income fell to NKr325m
from NKr336m, but operating profit rose slightly to NKr17m from NKr16m.
The snacks division saw operating income reduced to NKr498m from NKr507m but
operating profit increased to NKr68m from NKr57m.

WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB), the German regional public
sector bank, yesterday unveiled group operating profits of DM584m (Dollars
399m) for the first half of the current year. This is an increase of 25.5
per cent on half the total profits for the previous year.
The figure included a first time contribution from Wfa, a housing-finance
specialist in the state of North Rhine Westphalia, integrated into the group
at the beginning of the year.
Stripping out the contribution from this acquisition, group profits climbed
by 11.1 per cent on the comparable figure for the previous year.
The bank attributed the profits rise to a marked increase in income from
trading as well as straightforward lending business.
Earnings on interest income rose by 17.5 per cent to DM1.21bn while
commission income climbed by 14.4 per cent to DM172m. Partial operating
profits, which do not include trading results, advanced 24.1 per cent to
DM470m.
Costs rose by 16.4 per cent within the group, reflecting the increased
headcount following two acquisitions last year. Assets at the end of June
stood at DM252bn, 9.8 per cent up on the DM229.7bn figure at the end of last
year.
Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale (Helaba), the large German financial
institution based in the state of Hesse, reported half-year operating
profits down by 3.4 per cent to DM143.3m. Excluding trading profits, profits
dropped by DM8.8m to DM107.6m.
The reduced profits reflect the bank's activities in eastern Germany, where
from July 1 this year Helaba took over the role of regional central bank and
central bank for the savings banks in the state of Thuringia.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Six-month sales static at French
groups

<TEXT>
SEVERAL large French groups, including Peugeot, the car maker, yesterday
reported static sales for the first half of the year reflecting the sluggish
state of the country's economy.
Peugeot, which saw its shares slide last week on the news that its share of
new car sales in France had fallen in July, reported a 3 per cent rise in
overall turnover from FFr80.3bn in the first half of 1991 to FFr82.6bn
(Dollars 16.7bn) in the same period this year.
The group experienced a fall in sales of nearly 4 per cent in the second
quarter after seeing sales increase by 10 per cent in the first quarter of
the year.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, recently warned that the European car market
was likely to fall by 1.5 per cent in unit sales this year and unlikely to
recover until the very end of the year.
The scenario of sluggish sales in a weak economy was replicated by other
large French industrial and service sector groups reporting their
half-yearly figures yesterday.
L'Air Liquide, the industrial gases concern, saw its sales rise by a
marginal 0.39 per cent, below the rate of inflation, to FFr15.42bn in the
first half.
Colas, the construction company, mustered a 3.6 per cent increase in
turnover from FFr5.27bn in the first six months of 1991 to FFr5.46bn in the
same period this year. Bongrain, the food group, saw sales rise by just 2.5
per cent to FFr4.85bn in the first half.
Publicis, one of France's largest advertising agencies, suffered a slight
fall in sales of 0.9 per cent to FFr53.2m in the interim period. Bidermann
International, a leading textile concern, suffered a 14.8 per cent decline
in sales to FFr1.83bn.
These static sales figures come when the French economy is still growing,
despite low consumer confidence in the face of relatively high interest
rates and rising unemployment. Consumer demand slackened in the second
quarter of the year, after rising slightly in the first.
The level of confidence in the industrial sector has also declined since the
opening months of the year.
The building trade suffered a fall in activity during the first half of the
year, according to a study published yesterday by INSEE, the state
statistics institute. However, the French government has so far shown no
sign of relaxing its rigid grip on the economy.

PRIMA Inmobiliaria, a Spanish real estate company controlled by the Kuwait

debt moratorium plan presented to creditors last week, Reuter reports from
Madrid.
Grupo Torras, KIO's 100 per cent owned industrial holding company which has
a 27 per cent direct stake in Prima, said the most urgent payments were
being made to banks and to construction companies.
Prima held a 15-minute meeting on the plan with representatives of some 60
bank creditors on Friday.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sabena reduces half-year
operating loss to BFr300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SABENA, the Belgian state airline, made an operating loss of BFr300m
(Dollars 9.87m) in the first half of 1992, a sharp improvement on its
performance in early 1991.
Sabena did not reveal directly comparable figures for its operating results,
but a year ago it said it had an operating loss of BFr2.16bn for the first
four months of 1991.
This year's losses were the result of world overcapacity and airline price
wars, said Sabena, 37.5 per cent owned by Air France since earlier this
year.
It said that the second quarter of 1992 'had not followed the positive trend
of the first quarter'. Both the yield, revenue per aircraft or passenger,
and the total revenue fell between the first and second quarters.
It warned that results for the second half were uncertain, depending on the
progress of the recession and the strength of the US dollar, which affects
ticket revenues, and fuel and aircraft costs.
The first-half performance was patchy, with some operations doing well.
Passenger traffic increased by 10.3 per cent in Europe, compared with the
first half of 1990 - the last comparable period unaffected by the Gulf war
which drove passengers away from air travel.
Traffic on the African network was up by 5 per cent against the first half
of 1990, but transatlantic passenger traffic dipped by 16 per cent and Asian
traffic by 7.8 per cent.
In 1991 the group made an operating profit of BFr2.13bn following a 1990
loss of BFr7.15bn.
A link-up between Sabena and Air France was finally signed in April, but is
still subject to approval by the European Commission competition
authorities. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, said last
month he expected the deal - a BFr6bn cash injection in exchange for the
stake - to fall under EC merger regulations.

<TEXT>
THE BOARD of representatives of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian
insurer, yesterday unanimously approved the appointment of Mr Anders Echoff
as new board chairman and Mr Rune Brandinger, a former Skandia Forsakrings
employee, as a new member.
Mr Jan Erik Langangen, former president and chief executive at Uni, resigned
last month amid sharp criticism of the company's NKr4.7bn (Dollars 814m)
acquisition of Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. The board
tendered its resignation at the same time.
Uni's board of representatives also approved the reinstatement of Uni's four
other board members - Mr Torvild Aakvaag, Mr Finn Jebsen, Mr Jan Wibe and Mr
Erik Toenseth.
Mr Echoff is a partner in the Oslo law firm Bugge, Arentz-Hansen &amp; Rasmussen
and a member of other boards, including that of Elkem, the troubled
Norwegian light metals producer, Statkraft, the Norwegian utility, and
Kvaerneland, a company which produces farm equipment.
He is also widely considered to be a 'clean up' man - a title he disdains -
because of the many reorganisations he has been instrumental in.
Mr Echoff yesterday had little to say about a strategy which he will
implement to restore confidence in Uni. That confidence has decreased
significantly since the company acquired its 28.6 per cent shareholding in
Skandia Forsakrings.
Mr Echoff replaces Mr Thorleif Borge who will remain as president and chief
executive of the Uni Foundation, the company's biggest shareholder with a
26.6 per cent stake in the company.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: PolyGram buys 51% of film-maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLYGRAM, the music company 80 per cent owned by Philips of the Netherlands,
is spending Dollars 35m to acquire a 51 per cent stake in the film producer
Interscope, which made Three Men and a Baby.
The deal will lead to the winding down of Interscope's two-year-old joint
venture with Walt Disney Studios and Nomura Babcock &amp; Brown, an affiliate of
Nomura Securities.
The deal, which will be financed out of cash-flow and available funds, is a
further step in PolyGram's declared aim of increasing its presence in the
film business. The company said yesterday that it might end up spending more
than the Dollars 200m it originally earmarked for expenditure on film. Last
year, PolyGram took control of Propaganda Films, makers of In Bed with
Madonna, and Working Title, which made My Beautiful Launderette.
The Dollars 35m will include payment for the services of Mr Ted Field,
Interscope chairman and chief executive, and of Mr Robert Cort, chief
operating officer. Mr Field, an heir to the Marshall Field retailing
fortune, made his first film, Revenge of the Nerds, in 1984. Mr Cort is a
former CIA employee turned film-maker.
Under PolyGram's majority ownership, Interscope, which has also produced
Cocktail and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, will make eight films over the
next two years, rising to nine or 10 annually by 1997.
Walt Disney Studios will initially distribute these films in the US and
Canada, while PolyGram will handle them elsewhere. PolyGram says, however,
that it intends eventually to become the worldwide distributor of
Interscope's films. Interscope will continue its current projects with Walt
Disney Studios, but will make subsequent films in-house.
Film funding will be provided by PolyGram, but Interscope will continue to
seek co-funding. Interscope said yesterday that by the end of 1993 it will
have committed the funds previously raised by Nomura for co-financing film
productions. Nomura will, however, retain the option of raising further
money for Interscope.
Exit provisions in the agreement allow PolyGram to limit its exposure if
Interscope performs significantly below expectations.

to Glunz
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PINAULT, the French retailing and timber group, is continuing its debt
reduction programme by selling Isoroy, one of its timber subsidiaries, to
Glunz, the leading German timber products group.
The disposal, for an undisclosed sum, forms part of Pinault's strategy of
selling its original timber businesses to refocus on its retailing
interests. In addition it is raising capital to reduce the debts incurred
after last year's controversial bid for Au Printemps, the French department
store and mail order group.
Pinault, which made net profits of FFr503m (Dollars 102m) last year, hopes
to raise between FFr4bn and FFr5bn from disposals. Its net debt stood at
FFr15.5bn by the end of last year.
So far Pinault, which owns the Conforama furniture chain and La Redoute mail
order catalogue, has sold several timber-related businesses, including Lafa
in furniture and Sofiseb in kitchen units.
Isoroy specialises in wood-derivative panels and has 2,720 employees and 14
production plants in France. It made net profits of FFr60m on sales of
FFr2.2bn last year.
The acquisition forms part of Glunz's efforts to consolidate its hold over
the European wood panelling market where it is a leading player in chipboard
and plywood. The German group, based at Hamm, has been restructuring its
interests since the acquisition two years ago of Conti Products in the UK.
Glunz saw its pre-tax profits fall from DM40m in 1990 to DM16m (Dollars 11m)
in 1991.

<TEXT>
ASPREY, the jewellery group, is restructuring its activities following a
recent spree of acquisitions by turning the parent company into a holding
company and devolving most operational responsibilities to five separate
business units.
The move is designed to enhance the operation of the individual companies
and allow group management to focus more on supervisory and strategic
issues.
The Asprey group board will be slimmed down to six members, with four
executive directors resigning to concentrate on running a new subsidiary,
Asprey (Bond Street), which has been created to run the core group business
operating the Bond Street jewellery showrooms.
The Garrard, Mappin &amp; Webb, and Watches of Switzerland chains will also be
run as separate businesses with the rest of Asprey's companies, including
international businesses and the Hamilton &amp; Inches store in Edinburgh being
operated as part of another division.
From September 1, Mr Naim Attallah will become group chief executive and
deputy chairman, having previously filled the role of joint managing
director.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Henlys forecasts sharp recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS Group, the motor trader and bus and coach combine, yesterday forecast
'at least break-even' for the second half of 1992 as part of its defence
against a hostile bid from rival T Cowie.
Following on a reduced first-half loss of Pounds 898,000 (Pounds 4.5m), that
would mean an improvement of Pounds 5.9m for the whole of 1992 from a
previous pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.8m. The group promised to maintain the 3p
annual dividend and is holding the interim at 1p.
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the group's strengths were
substantial. The loss-making coach and bus side was now forecast to
break-even in the second half before charging Pounds 700,000 of consultancy
costs. Its prospects for 1993 were 'excellent'.
He said the motor division would make an operating profit of over Pounds 6m
for the year, compared to Pounds 3.5m in 1991.
Mr Wood also attacked Cowie's management saying its bid demonstrated 'a
woeful lack of understanding of Henlys' businesses.' He said Cowie's share
price had fallen from 147 1/2 p when the bid was announced.
Cowie's share price closed at 119p, after going ex its 2p interim dividend,
making the bid worth Pounds 22.5m. The 1-for-2 share swap values Henlys'
shares at 59 1/2 apiece - they were unchanged yesterday at 69p.
So far Cowie has won acceptances from holders of 0.7 per cent of Henlys
shares. The feeling among Henlys shareholders is that a higher offer with a
cash element would be necessary before they would accept. Cowie has until
August 18 to improve its bid.
Henlys said recent orders for its Plaxton's bus and coach building business
totalled Pounds 26m, while an export agreement with Volvo Bus of Sweden, was
expected to bring in sales of Pounds 15m a year. That compares with sales in
the division in 1991 of Pounds 19.7m. Cost cutting measures saving Pounds
4.1m in a full year would be implemented by October.
Mr Wood said the new orders, the deal with Volvo Bus and an agreement with
trade unions had all been under negotiation for some months but had 'all
come together over the last three to four weeks'. He said Volvo Bus had the
option to terminate the agreement if there was a change of control of
Henlys' coach building subsidiary.
The interim results showed turnover down nearly 9 per cent at Pounds 166.5m.
Operating profits from the motor division were Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 1.8m) and
the loss from the coach and bus side was Pounds 1m (loss Pounds 1.4m).
Exceptional items relating to a new range of coaches took Pounds 950,000
(Pounds 2.6m) and the interest charge was Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.3m).
The maintained dividend plus the advanced corporation tax resulted in a
transfer from reserves of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 6.7m). Losses per share were
2.7p (12.2p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Jupiter European Investment Trust proposes an open offer and
placing to raise up to Pounds 5.6m net, and to reorganise the company into a
split capital investment trust through a scrip issue of zero dividend
shares.
The reorganisation should bring the market value of the ordinary shares more
closely into line with the underlying net asset value - the discount was 22
per cent on July 17. The trust's life will end on December 31 2000.
Holders of ordinary shares and warrants can apply for up to 7.2m shares and
1.44m warrants at 78 1/2 p, on a 1-for-1 basis. Some 6m shares and 1.2m
warrants have been placed, subject to clawback.
The scrip issue of zero dividend shares will then follow, again on a 1-for-1
basis.
It is proposed to change the accounting date to August 31 and to pay
semi-annual dividends in future. The initial annualised dividend is forecast
at not less than 1.67p.

<TEXT>
Seacon Holdings, the shipping and distribution group, increased pre-tax
profits by 47 per cent, from Pounds 717,000 to Pounds 1.05m, in the half
year ended March 31.
Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 9.52m (Pounds 9.58m) but operating
profit doubled to Pounds 669,000.
Reduced charter hire rates, a more stable D-Mark/sterling relationship and
lower bunkering costs all contributed to better results.
With freight rates often below those of last year, static turnover indicated
an increase in market share. In cargo handling and distribution tonnages to
date had increased and eased the consequences of severely squeezed margins.
The interim dividend is lifted to 2p (1.5p) and a minimum total of 5p (4.2p)
is forecast. Fully diluted earnings per share were 6.88p (4.67p).

Overall, the group lifted revenue from Pounds 32.6m to Pounds 39.2m but saw
pre-tax profit fall from Pounds 4.83m to Pounds 3.22m. Earnings per share

For the nine months revenues came to Pounds 109.1m (Pounds 88.5m), profits
to Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 12.1m), and earnings to 8.1p (10.3p).
Life sciences increased revenues by 5 per cent, while Travers Morgan lifted
its revenues and improved operating margins by 11 per cent.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Williamson and Assoc Nursing to improve
accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED Nursing Services, the private nursing homes operator, and
Williamson Tea Holdings, the tea producer, have agreed to provide more
details of their accounting policies in their next sets of accounts.
The announcements follow judgments yesterday by the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, the new accounting standards watchdog.
The panel has decided to take no further action. The accounting treatments
used by the two companies in their 1991 accounts were referred to it for
consideration for possible breaches of existing UK standards.
With Associated Nursing, the panel had raised concerns over the treatment of
start-up costs and the adequacy of the explanation provided on a change of
accounting pol-icy.
In its accounts for the year to March 30, the company stated that it would
capitalise - or take on to the balance sheet rather than treat as an item of
current expenditure - the costs of building nursing homes until either three
months after they were registered or until they had achieved break-even
occupancy.
The panel said it welcomed a decision by the directors to review and report
on its start-up policies and to include a clear and finite time limit to the
capitalisation of these costs.
Williamson Tea, which is a holding company with operations in India, Kenya
and Tanzania, agreed after discussions with the panel to include fuller
information in future of its accounting policies on certain overseas assets.
These include the non-depreciation of leasehold and lease rental properties,
and why and how asset revaluations are depreciated and transferred to
reserves.
The panel's decision to take no further action in either case suggests that
the practices currently being adopted are acceptable within existing
accounting standards. Any changes to these standards need to be introduced
by its sister body, the Accounting Standards Board.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Takare shows 89% advance as expansion
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKARE, the nursing group for elderly and chronically ill patients, lifted
pre-tax profits by 89 per cent, from Pounds 2.99m to Pounds 5.63m, in the
six months to June 30.
Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the rise was 'fully in line with our
expectations', and added that the financial growth reflected the physical
expansion of the group - during the first half a further 720 beds were added
to bring the total in operation to 3,345.
The company said that the scheduling of beds was weighted towards the first
half. There are another 1,455 beds under construction and by the year-end
Takare expects to have more than 5,700 beds in operation or under
construction.
Since it gained its full listing in April 1989, the company has raised some
Pounds 74.7m in equity issues and there have been Pounds 50m of debenture
issues.
Turnover rose to Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 12.4m) and earnings per share advanced
by 33 per cent to 5.7p (4.3p). The average number of shares in issue in the
half was 88.9m, against 62.9m in the corresponding period.
The interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.5p).
Some 32 per cent of Takare's patients are contracted from the National
Health Service, 54 per cent are private patients means tested and
underpinned by Income Support, and 14 per cent pay their own way.
Mr Bradshaw said the government's as yet unrevealed plans for reforming
community care would change the way that Takare would be paid.
The DSS Income Support umbrella would be withdrawn and the so-called
'Algebra Formula' would come into play.
Nursing home care would then be funded in part from the DSS and in part from
local health authorities. Mr Bradshaw was confident Takare would not suffer
as a result.
COMMENT
The number of old and chronically ill patients will steadily increase, so
Takare, as an expanding provider of care, should continue its already
impressive progress. However, the cycle of good results might be dented by
the government's reforms scheduled for next April. At the moment,
uncertainty is the problem; later, being paid by two masters might be.
Recruiting good enough middle management to run the growing number of homes
is likely to be a more consistent problem. Further demands on shareholders
will arise, though not before September 1993, as Takare has promised.
Forecasts of Pounds 11.8m pre-tax for the full-year give earnings of 12.1p
per share and a prospective multiple of 16. This is not too steep in the
context of continuing earnings growth.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wimpey pays Pounds 5m for Czech quarries
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY, the construction group, is acquiring a controlling interest
in Severokamen, the previously state-owned quarry company in northern
Bohemia in the Czech Republic.
Wimpey is due to pay Pounds 5m cash, most of it during the next two years,
to acquire a minimum stake of 50 per cent. It will also provide technical
and management expertise.
The 19 quarries being acquired are situated close to the German and Polish
borders, providing opportunities for export. The price of aggregates in
eastern Germany is about three times that in the Czech Republic.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said: 'This stake, on which we will build,
represents a long term strategic investment bringing us low cost high
quality reserves, excellent development potential and access to the future
growth markets of central Europe.
Wimpey-Severokamen, as the company will be renamed, produces more than 3m
tonnes of mostly hard basalt rock a year, of which about 400,000 tonnes is
expected to be exported to the rapidly growing eastern German construction
market.
The quarries account for between 55 and 60 per cent of the local market in
northern Bohemia. The company has mining rights to estimated reserves of
520m tonnes of which 220m tonnes are at sites already being excavated.
Wimpey initially will take a 34 per cent stake with the right to increase
this to at least 50 per cent. It said that earnings from Severokamen were
expected to at least cover the cost of finance in the first year.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Tuskar shares suspended at 1p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Tuskar Resources were yesterday suspended at 1p after the
Dublin-based oil and gas company announced the disposal of its last asset.
The USM-quoted company is selling its remaining 36 per cent rights in a
Colombian oil field to Coplex Resources, the Australian exploration company
which failed in a recommended bid for Tuskar.
Coplex will pay for the stake by issuing to Tuskar 11m shares, worth
ADollars 7.15m (Pounds 2.76m) at yesterday's price of 65 cents, next August.
Coplex bought 54 per cent of the Colombian field from Tuskar in April. The
terms of that transaction have been changed and Tuskar will now be paid
mainly in cash.
Following the various deals, Tuskar's stake in Coplex will be between 7.2
per cent and 14.4 per cent, depending on the amount of shares issued.
Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar chairman, said the company could not afford to
fund its share of investment in Colombia.
'We could have been drilled out of the contract,' he said.
The disposal leaves Tuskar with about Pounds 1m in cash and the future
payment of Coplex shares or cash.
Mr O'Donoghue rejected criticism from shareholders that the company was
selling assets to Coplex soon after its bid approach had been rejected. In
May Coplex withdrew its all-share bid after receiving only 47.6 per cent
acceptances.
He said Tuskar had been unable to raise bank finance and shareholders had
not appeared keen to invest further.

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: A new force in the contracting marketplace
 -The pospects for Trafalgar House a year after the Davy acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORPORATE cliche, 'critical mass', is the kind that Mr Allan Gormly, the
quietly-spoken Glaswegian who runs the engineering division at Trafalgar
House, hates using. 'We need to find a better label for it,' he says.
Nevertheless, it is a phrase that is hard for Mr Gormly to avoid when
describing the results of Trafalgar House's controversial takeover of Davy,
the UK process plant contractor whose disastrous losses on the Emerald
Producer rig conversion contract cost it its independence.
The takeover created a new force in process plant contracting worldwide, and
gave the Trafalgar House engineering division an important new leg in
minerals and metals plant contracting.
A little more than a year after the agreed deal was announced, Mr Gormly
says a number of
clients have viewed the enlarged engineering contractor as such a
significant player - among the world's top four - that they have come to
talk to the company rather than wait for a call.
In a competitive global contracting marketplace where business conditions
are decidedly mixed, Mr Gormly says that is quite encouraging - 'much better
than being number 15 in a bid slate of 20.'
None of this, perhaps, is likely to cut much ice with Davy shareholders who
have been hanging on for the past year in the hope - now virtually doomed -
of receiving their second payment of Pounds 54m from what was originally a
two-stage Pounds 114m deal.
For Trafalgar House, the surprise result of the takeover has been the extent
to which it has been drawn into the legal wrangle over the contract.
'We didn't think we were getting into that sort of drama,' Mr Gormly admits,
'and it has taken up an immense amount of senior managers' time. It will
linger on for a while yet, but it is substantially behind us.'
In contrast, the rest of the story has gone according to plan. Davy's
process plant side has been integrated with John Brown Engineering &amp;
Construction - 'You can't see the join,' says Mr Gormly.
The stricken contractor's minerals and metals business, meanwhile, has
retained the Davy name and become one of the six segments of the engineering
division, with 6,000 employees out of 26,000 - nearly half of whom are in
the enlarged John Brown engineering and construction business.
The integration process has produced few surprises. There is 'more mileage'
in some of Davy's process technology than had been thought before the
merger, says Mr Gormly, but as expected management systems have been
tightened up under the new regime.
The main disappointment has been external to Davy - a recession that has
proved to be deeper and longer than expected, notably in steel mill work
across the developed world.
'I don't think any supplier or client saw as recently as a year ago just how
severe the recession, in the case of the metals industry, was going to be,'
says Mr Gormly.
But this is no reason for having any regrets about the takeover, he says.
'We recognised that the world capital goods side was going to slow down,
that was inevitable after four or five years of growth . . . if you wait
until you've got Utopia on all five fingers of your hand you'd never do
anything.'
In fact, one of the key aims of the takeover was to extend the engineering
division's reach, both geographically and in business sector terms, to take
advantage of the more buoyant parts of a 'curate's egg' market.
In geographical terms, the outlook varies from patchy in North America,
which is at the bottom of the cycle but starting to show signs of life, to
booming in south-east Asia.
The story is similarly mixed on the products side, varying from 'bad news
almost universally' in commodity chemicals to 'quite strong' and 'fairly
buoyant' in pharmaceuticals and power respectively.
Inevitably, though, there are nuances within this picture, which the
enlarged business is better able to exploit. While the steel business is
depressed worldwide, there is work in the former Soviet Union, where money
is being made available for steel mill modernisations - right up Davy's
street.
The contracts are smaller than before the break-up of the Soviet Union, says
Mr Gormly, and are being handled in segments of about Pounds 10m apiece.
Since the Davy takeover, the engineering division has tied up a number of
other important deals. In March, John Brown unveiled a 50-50 joint venture
with Austria's Voest-Alpine as a springboard for expansion into Germany and
eastern Europe.
John Brown's Portsmouth office has also broken new ground this year by
signing so-called partnering agreements with ICI and BP Chemicals -
long-term arrangements designed to dovetail client and contractor's
engineering skills to save time and money.
In the case of ICI, for example, John Brown and Foster Wheeler of the US
will share all the chemical company's small and medium-sized contracts.
Tendering is replaced by a rigorous competition to become a client's
preferred contractor.
Depending on ICI's investment pattern, John Brown is thus guaranteed a
'solid baseload' of work, according to Mr Ian Robinson, chief executive of
John Brown Engineering &amp; Construction. The company is in discussions with
other clients on further partnering arrangements.
While these deals are potentially significant in the long-term, the Davy
takeover is already bringing benefits, raising an obvious question: have Mr
Gormly and Trafalgar House got themselves a bargain?
'I really don't know, only time will tell,' says Mr Gormly. 'We paid a fair
price, and recognised there was risk in the rig contract, hence the
contingent second payment.'
According to Mr Peter Deighton at Smith New Court, the deal looks 'very
shrewd' from a process engineering viewpoint. 'Davy had taken on a daft
contract, but the rest of the company was not in bad shape . . . With the
process engineering market beginning to look healthier, and the radical
changes caused by environmental legislation, I would have thought (Pounds
60m) was a very reasonable price.'

FT  11 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Manders confirms its rejection of Kalon
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANDERS (HOLDINGS), the paints, inks and property group fighting for its
independence from Kalon, the Yorkshire-based paints maker, yesterday
officially rejected its rival's final Pounds 93.5m offer.
However, it is understood that in a later development, Manders is having to
issue a retraction of at least part of its document.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, repeated that the offer 'grossly undervalued
Manders', that Kalon's share price - static at 89 1/2 p yesterday - was
fragile because of its over-dependency on a 'handful of large customers' and
that the combined Kalon/Manders business could not achieve the Pounds 5m
cost savings claimed by Kalon. He also said that Kalon's management record
in chemicals and industrial coatings was 'dismal', that it had not produced
a profits forecast and that its offer was not underwritten.
It is thought that Kalon complained of this last point saying that it did
not want to underwrite its original all-share offer, preferring to preserve
cash for the development of the combined businesses.
Kalon increased its share offer from 8-for-3 to 17-for-6 at the end of last
week and added a cash alternative of seven of its shares plus 150p for each
three Manders shares.
Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director of Kalon, dismissed Manders'
document as a 'kneejerk reaction full of the old arguments'. He questioned
the motives of Manders' management in its 'change of mind' over the possible
sale of the Manders Centre and of Windeck, Manders own-label paint factory,
revealed in the last few days by James Capel.
Capel also forecast that Kalon would increase pre-tax profit to Pounds 13m
this year from Pounds 9.2m last year.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Tax staff urged to accept 4.45% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAFF AT the Inland Revenue were urged by union leaders yesterday to accept
a deal which would raise salaries by 4.45 per cent. The offer is the last in
what has been an inflationary pay round in the civil service.
Although the draft deal negotiated by the Inland Revenue Staff Federation is
about the level already offered to other public sector unions, it comes at a
sensitive time for the government.
The latest reported inflation rate, for the year to June, was 3.9 per cent.
Some Tory MPs have been arguing for a public sector pay freeze and the
Confederation of British Industry wants the public sector to bear the brunt
of government efforts to hold down public expenditure and accept rises below
inflation. The proposed agreement covering 57,000 tax workers is also
significant because it is the first in a large government department to be
negotiated by departmental managers rather than by the Treasury.
The government is encouraging the devolution of pay bargaining from the
centre in the public sector as part of its Citizen's Charter.
It is committed to keeping pay deals for more than 500,000 civil servants in
the so-called 'interquartile range' - or middle 50 per cent - of private
sector pay settlements for the previous 12 months.
For agreements due to be implemented from August 1, as in the case of the
Revenue, the interquartile range was 4 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Under the
Revenue agreement, the range of rises will be 4 per cent to 6 per cent with
the overall value at 4.45 per cent.
That is similar to what specialist civil servants are being recommended to
accept by the IPMS union in a deal also operable from August 1, and slightly
above the 4.3 per cent offer made to middle-ranking civil servants in grades
4 to 7 which they are being advised to accept.
Unlike other civil service agreements this year, the Revenue deal does not
include provision for the extension of performance-related pay (PRP).
However, the management has said it expects a PRP system to be in place by
next year and the union is committed to continuing talks about it.
The Revenue intends to start a performance management system, on which PRP
assessments will be based, in October and wants a new pay and grading
structure from April.
Mr Clive Brooke, IRSF general secretary, said the pay offer represented a
creditable outcome to negotiations. However, there is still a possibility
that members will reject the deal, in part because of opposition to
performance pay.
The agreement was backed by 16 members of the IRSF executive in a vote, with
seven members against.
Meanwhile, members of the NUCPS, the 114,000-strong second largest civil
service union, have voted to accept a 4.1 per cent pay rise deal but to
reject an extension of the performance-related pay system associated with
the deal.
The vote raises the possibility that the government will implement the
package without agreement.

FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever more insistent talk of boardroom changes at the Forte is doing little
to restore confidence in the company's share price. Admittedly, yesterday's
fall took the shares a mere 1p lower to 138p but they have still
underperformed the market by 35 per cent since the start of the year. Part
of the problem is continuing uncertainty about the outcome of Forte's
boardroom review. Equally important are the fundamental problems facing the
company. They will not go away just with the addition of a few fresh and
younger faces to the board.
Not only is the UK hotel business deeply still blighted by the recession.
The weak dollar is hardly designed to help boost the spend by US tourists.
The company appears to lack strategic direction after coming so close and
then failing to sell its contract catering business at what would have been
by all accounts an attractive price. For the second year running the
dividend is likely to be uncovered.
To be sure, Forte is operating on a broadly cash neutral basis, even
allowing for a maintained dividend and some Pounds 150m of capital
expenditure this year. But its decision to postpone the rebranding of its US
Travelodge hotels shows the purse strings are having to be held tight when
it would make sense to be spending on expansion in Europe. Assuming the
company can manage a modest increase in profits this year it is trading on a
forward multiple in the high teens, which is roughly twice that of Queens
Moat. The shares are still expensive, however respectable the name.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has painted a slightly less bleak picture of consumer
behaviour with yesterday's revision to its credit statistics. The picture
could also be more accurate despite the confusing presentation of the
change. This involves stripping out debt write-offs by lenders from the
figure for net movements in consumer debt with the hope of reflecting more
closely the actual behaviour of consumers during the month in question. The
revised figures show small net borrowing by consumers during the first five
months of the year compared with a net repayment of debt for every month
except February on the old basis. The snag is that June shows a repayment on
of Pounds 55m the new basis too.
Admittedly these fluctuations are trivial compared with total outstanding
credit of nearly Pounds 30bn. But there is little sign that a savings ratio
of 11.5 per cent in the first quarter left consumers comfortable with their
level of debt in the second. Expectations that rising real wages would
eventually persuade individuals to borrow and spend seem increasingly
forlorn. Instead it may now be time to start asking whether the savings
ratio will eventually settle at a rate rather higher than expected just a
few months ago.

FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Vodafone
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following Cellnet's lead, Vodafone is about to announce an alternative set
of tariffs for users of cellular phones. The new charges will be similar on
both networks and emphasise lower line rentals but higher peak call rates.
The change is being marketed as an attempt to bring cellular to a wider
range of occasional users, but carries risks. Vodafone and Cellnet have both
made the nice calculation that they can increase revenues from new
subscribers by more than they lose as a result of existing users
transferring to the cheaper tariff. In Vodafone's own estimate it will be
close. Others are not so generous.
All concede that it will mean lower revenues than would have been expected
for the next couple of years. Existing subscribers who move will transfer in
the next few months; new customers may be slower in coming. This may not
amount to a price war but it is hardly the brave new world where marketing
hype projected cellular revenues growing geometrically forever.
One reason for the tariff changes is that the cellular world is about to get
more complicated. Next year new digital and personal communication networks
are due to be launched, which the backers hope will bring cellular to the
mass market. New tariffs are one way of keeping conventional cellular
competitive. But in the wait for a mass market, such keen competition smells
of slowing growth.
The wider question is whether the mass market will arrive. Cellular has
proved itself a useful business product with a finite constituency. Whether
individuals need or even want millions of mobile phones remains to be
proved. Judging by its steady erosion of Vodafone's price earnings ratio,
the market has yet to be convinced that the cellular growth trick can be
turned twice.

FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Looking to the future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With UK equities sliding uncomfortably lower it is only natural that the
market should be looking to apportion blame. On most conventional
valuations, equities look like a firm buy. Yesterday's 1 per cent fall had
more to do with the gloom emanating from Japan than any single domestic
factor, but the market is looking closer to home for a scapegoat. The
growing volume of futures trading relative to the size of the cash market
seems to fit the bill.
Volume in the cash market is not unseasonally low. At Pounds 13bn, July
turnover of FT-SE stocks was actually slightly above July last year. Yet the
centre of gravity is certainly shifting towards the floor of Liffe. The
FT-SE future traded more stock than the underlying shares last month. So far
this year the cash market and futures are running neck and neck. Both show
volume of around Pounds 90bn.
Similar concerns in Japan have prompted measures to make index futures
trading more expensive. However, trading of equity futures and options is
twice the size of the cash market in the US, suggesting there is nothing
sinister about the growth of futures trading in itself. Indeed bearish
sentiment in the cash market may have driven business towards futures as
institutions search for liquidity and market makers hedge long positions.
The independent traders operating from the FT-SE future pit may seem
candidates for the lynch-mob. The future seems to be leading the cash market
lower but the pit operators' efforts would be swamped if only institutional
investors were prepared to back their valuations with hard cash.

BBC2's series of personal documentaries 'giving voice to the wisdom of
years', Shaking The Heavens, is devoted this week to John Brookes (7.45).
Though he enjoys nature, cricket, and Castle Cary, it is poetry, we are
told, which has become such an important part of his life since he retired.
Apart from the fact that it is about half an hour too long, and never really
exploits its wide screen format (a characteristic virtually irrelevant on
television anyway) there is nothing obviously wrong with Vincente Minnelli's
1956 cinema biography of Van Gogh, Lust For Life. Indeed, it provides Kirk
Douglas with one of his more demanding roles and he is well up to the task.
Yet, for me anyway, it never quite brings the agonised artist to life (8.30
C4).
The fly-on-the-wall series, Town Hall, about the workings of Lewisham
Borough Council has been fascinating from the start, but there has been a
feeling throughout that something really dramatic is about to happen.
Perhaps today, in the last of the series (9.45, BBC2), it will. We are told
that the long-running argument over the budget comes to a head.

FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: US retailers report profits
growth

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of leading US retailers yesterday reported higher earnings for the
three-months to end-July, but sales growth remained modest.
Woolworth, which takes in both the general merchandise stores and a number
of specialty chains, said that net profits for the 13 weeks to July 25
reached Dollars 33m, compared with Dollars 21m for the same period of 1991.
This brings first-half profits to Dollars 50m, against Dollars 79m a year
earlier when Woolworth incurred a one-off charge of Dollars 113m.
However, in operating terms the improvement came solely from the specialty
stores. Second-quarter operating profits here rose to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 41m, while the general merchandise business saw a decline to Dollars
21m from Dollars 26m.
The picture on the revenue front was similar: specialty store revenues rose
by 1.5 per cent, while general merchandise fell by 1.3 per cent. On a
comparable store basis, Woolworth said that domestic revenues were up by 1.2
per cent, while overseas revenues increased by 3.2 per cent.
Woolworth is carrying out a large-scale store redeployment programme
involving about 900 outlets, both general merchandise and specialty.
Yesterday, Mr Harold Sells, chairman, said the plan was having positive
effects, improving gross margins.
'We are confident that the upward trend established in the first half will
continue for the remainder of the year,' he said.
At May Department Stores, net profits in the 13 weeks to August 1 rose to
Dollars 393m, after a non-recurring gain of Dollars 298m, compared with
Dollars 82m a year ago. This takes first-half profits to Dollars 474m after
tax, against Dollars 158m. Sales during the second quarter increased to
Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 1.85bn, and for the first half, to Dollars 3.8bn
from Dollars 3.62bn. May said that on a same-store basis there were gains of
2.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
Arkansas-based Dillard Department Stores saw second-quarter after-tax
profits to August 1 advance to Dollars 36.5m from Dollars 35.7m, with sales
rising to Dollars 974.9m from Dollars 873.9m. This takes net profits for the
first half to Dollars 81.6m, against Dollars 73.8m, with sales advancing to
Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.76bn.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Europe's future in electronics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A FREE MARKET economy, the performance of private sector companies should
normally be a matter primarily for their shareholders, employees and
suppliers. However, the fate of Philips of the Netherlands, which last week
reported a steep fall in profits, concerns a much wider constituency,
embracing governments, consumers and taxpayers.
Philips is not just Europe's largest electronics manufacturer. Through
energetic lobbying it has contrived to present itself as the foremost symbol
of Europe's future in electronics and its main bulwark against the threat of
technological domination by the US and, above all, Japan. These arguments,
and the company's sheer size, have given it a power-ful influence over EC
and nat-ional policies, notably on trade.
Philips was closely involved in France's notorious decision in 1981 to route
imports of Japanese video recorders through a remote customs point in
Poitiers. Since then, the company has repeatedly persuaded the EC to impose
tariffs, quotas and dumping duties on Japanese electronics products. It has
also benefited handsomely from subsidies from EC technology policies, which
it has helped to shape. Nowhere more so than in high definition television
(HDTV) where, with Thomson, France's loss-making state-owned consumer
electronics manufacturer, it is largely responsible for a grand EC strategy.
Brussels is chipping in with generous funding and costly efforts to secure
the acquiescence of broadcasters.
Absorbing resources
These measures all absorb valuable economic resources. Trade restrictions
have raised substantially the prices of consumer electronics products in
Europe - currently at least a third higher than in the US - while taxpayers
have stumped up for Brussels' ambitious plans in information technology. Yet
Philips has repeatedly failed to deliver. Though the company is fertile in
invention, competitors have consistently brought new products to market
faster and more profitably.
Two years ago, a financial crisis prompted a top management shake-up and
promises of improved performance. Since then, Mr Jan Timmer, Philips'
chairman, has trimmed bureaucracy, axed loss-making activities and tried to
speed decision-making. Yet the company's most important consumer electronics
projects are beset by delays or serious uncertainties, and it foresees no
improvement in the business for at least two years.
Mr Timmer's biggest problem is a long legacy of mismanagement and a
complacent corporate culture. Philips reacted only slowly to the Japanese
onslaught in electronics. It ignored for years the opportunities for
rationalisation and increased efficiency offered by Europe's common market.
Though a vocal campaigner for the planned single market, the company seems
unprepared for the keener competition it is meant to promote.
Inducing complacency
Europe will never have a strong electronics industry if policies remain
geared to shoring up uncompetitive large producers. That not only induces
complacency in the beneficiaries; more important, by distorting the market
and mis-allocating resources, it discriminates against the new entrants
which are often the most promising agents of innovation. In the US, which
virtually abandoned consumer electronics in the 1970s, the industry is now
enjoying a comeback, due largely to the success of small, entrepreneurial
technology companies.
Equally surprisingly, the US has also seized the lead in HDTV technology,
rendering obsolete the EC's standard. Yet the European Commission wants
governments this autumn to authorise further spending of Ecu850m. It says
the money is needed to safeguard large investments already made and the
commercial prospects of Philips and Thomson.
Ministers can help put electronics policy back on track by firmly rejecting
such pleas. The role of policy should be to stimulate innovation by keeping
markets open, facilitating industrial adjustment and encouraging companies
to take risks. Compensating large producers for their own failures is an
indulgence European can no longer afford.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Personal View: Spine for the jellyfish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER TUGENDHAT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the most delicate task facing Mr John Major during the British
presidency of the European Community is to find a way of putting backbone
into what the Financial Times has described as the 'intellectual jellyfish'
of subsidiarity. On the other big issues - enlargement, the budget, Gatt,
etc - the outstanding problems are well understood. Subsidiarity, by
contrast, is more like a mysterious marine creature washed up on the beach
after a storm.
The stakes are high. Success will help reconcile the Danes to the Maastricht
process, which must be done before they assume the presidency on January 1.
It will also do more than anything achieved by Mr Major's predecessors to
set the Community on a course with which the British people feel at ease.
Declarations to the effect that decisions should be taken at the lowest
appropriate level and in the most accountable fashion raise more questions
than they answer. Going to the opposite extreme of drawing up lists of which
functions the Commission should maintain and which it should hand back to
national governments will likewise lead to endless argument.
What is needed is a guiding principle, and for this we cannot do better than
look to Switzerland. As the most enduring confederation in the world, it has
much to teach the rest of Europe. In particular the preamble to its
constitution explicitly states that one of the purposes of that constitution
is to guarantee the continued existence of the cantons.
This goes to the heart of the matter. Throughout the Community there is a
widespread feeling that the process of integration is running out of control
and trampling on national characteristics and sensibilities. In Germany this
manifests itself in the defence of the D-Mark, in France in hostility to
allowing foreigners to vote in elections and in Ireland in the concern over
abortion.
The determination 'to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the
peoples of Europe', expressed in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome, lies at
the heart of the Community. But people also want to maintain their own
institutions and ways of doing things.
If the peoples of Europe are to continue with the work of construction
enjoined by the Treaty of Rome, they must feel that it is complementary to
what they are trying to do at the national level and adds to it, rather than
replaces it. Europe must be seen to enhance the scope and capacity of the
member states, not as a threat to them.
The best way to achieve this is to ensure that the Community constitution -
the Treaty of Rome as amended at Maastricht - places the burden of proof on
those who want powers exercised from the centre. A preamble, protocol or
declaration needs to be drawn up stating that the purpose of European union
is to enhance the ability of national governments and parliaments to fulfil
the will of their peoples.
That, in turn, would require that a case would always have to be made to
show that the states will be better off as a result of the centre gaining
powers and responsibility. This would be so whether these powers are at the
expense of the states or new ones - in relation, say, to the environment -
which the states cannot adequately discharge on an individual basis.
It will still be difficult to decide what should be done at national or
Community level. But there will also be a clear yardstick against which
proposals are assessed in the Council of Ministers and the agreements
reached there are then put to the peoples of the member states.
In most countries, Maastricht and the negotiations leading up to it
represented a classic case of ministers and officials taking decisions
without reference to their electorates. That is why second thoughts
developed so quickly in Germany and France, reinforced by the Danish
referendum.
It is neither possible nor desirable for the European Community to adopt the
Swiss practice of holding referenda on important or controversial decisions.
But unless national parliaments can find ways of legitimising the actions
taken by national ministers in Brussels and the agreements reached there,
the Community will continue to be seen as a rival to national institutions
rather than their ally.
At present, governments are far less accountable for the decisions they take
jointly in a Community context than for those they take singly within the
framework of their own national laws and customs. Small wonder that when
important issues are at stake, the legitimacy of those decisions should be
questioned.

chairman of the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Symbols of hope and hardship: East Germany is a society
struggling to come to terms with the stresses of reunification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One word spray-painted on the prefabricated wall of the Bavarian Hypo-Bank's
new branch in Jena sums up most of east Germany's hopes and fears: it says
'Germoney'.
That is what the west means to the east. It is a classic love-hate
relationship. Germoney is what people want, and it is what they resent. It
is the symbol of their liberation from communism, and equally of their new
subordination to the western way of life.
There is a weary cynicism abroad in the east, less than two years after
unification with West Germany, and a dangerous bitterness about the whole
political process.
It was obvious in the reaction to the recent homecoming of Mr Erich
Honecker, the profoundly unloved former leader of the Communist party: it
was as if the majority did not really care whether he came back to face
trial or stayed away. They were far more concerned with the battle for daily
survival.
But not everything is bleak. For a start, there are large sums of Germoney
being spent in the east. It is coming at the expense of the western
taxpayer, the western banks and the western capital markets and will amount
to a net transfer of about DM130bn (Pounds 44.8bn) this year. The effects
are highly visible.
It is scarcely possible to drive more than 10km in the east without meeting
a diversion to avoid either roadworks on the autobahns, which have not been
improved since the 1930s, or new water pipes and sewers being laid in every
other country town and village.
In the city centres the old buildings, which had survived four decades of
neglect by the communist authorities, are being restored. In the industrial
city of Chemnitz, the former Karl-Marx-Stadt, for example, work starts in
the Theaterplatz at 6.30am - before the heat of the day  - on the municipal
opera, the natural history museum and St Peter's church, all undergoing
comprehensive restoration.
When asked how his city can afford to restore the opera, when it is
effectively bankrupt, Mr Peter Fittig, the city councillor in charge of
culture, replies simply: 'A city without culture is a city which does not
deserve to exist.'
Along country roads, huge billboards proclaim the words Aufschwung Ost -
Upswing East - to identify the source of the funds for whatever village
construction project has been identified as the priority for a western cash
injection.
And yet the gloom and uncertainty prevail. That is the other side of the
story.
The most obvious reason is unemployment. The less obvious, but more
fundamental, reason is the trauma caused by unification. Many people have
lost their jobs and they still do not understand why. They do not know how
to react to the social and economic revolution they are facing. And they
have also lost the will to get back into a system they no longer understand.
The economy has bottomed out, but not before suffering an astonishing
collapse - gross national product in the former East Germany was down 30.3
per cent last year. It should recover by 9 per cent in 1992. Official
unemployment is running at an average 16.9 per cent this year, but only
thanks to massive job creation schemes, retraining programmes, short-time
working and early retirement, which keep real levels of joblessness below
30, 40 or even 50 per cent in some of the worst-hit areas. Even officially,
unemployment is expected to go on rising - to nearly 20 per cent next year.
What is happening is that after 40 years of enforced egalitarianism, eastern
Germany is rapidly becoming a very divided society - between the have-jobs
and the have-no-jobs. The have-jobs are doing fine, but the have-no-jobs are
bitter and alienated.
'We have people who are working day and night, and those who have no work at
all,' says Mr Rolf Scheibe, deputy mayor of Bautzen, regional capital of
east Saxony, which has seen its lorry plant closed, and its railway wagon
plant still desperately struggling to survive. At the same time, Philips has
taken over a factory producing telephone transmission equipment, and Edding,
the west German felt-tip pen manufacturer, has taken over a pen plant, both
providing secure and well-paid jobs for the lucky few hundred.
Bautzen is potentially a charming medieval town, a gateway to Poland and
Czechoslovakia, and the prosperous centre for a thriving regional economy.
Today it is remembered only for its prisons - one political, now closed, one
criminal.
The town council is effectively bankrupt, earning only 10 per cent of its
western counterpart because loss-making businesses pay no taxes, Mr Scheibe
says. He is now trying to raise rents from the present peppercorn level to
make ends meet, against furious resistance.
'People have to learn a different attitude to work, and to money,' he says.
'What is an apartment worth? People storm in here and say they will never
agree to pay DM2 a square metre - just a fraction of the rent they would pay
in the west. They have no idea of value.'
The resentment is part incomprehension, and part the inevitable result of a
harsher new system.
'The old GDR social security meant that nobody starved. Nobody fell through
the net. Now it is possible to slide down the social scale very quickly,' Mr
Scheibe says. 'It is a very complicated time. The people feel themselves
betrayed by the politicians. They made too many promises. They believed
them, and now they are fed up.
'The warning voices at the time of unification were ignored, because people
did not want to hear them. And now there is great insecurity.'
It may seem a simple matter of a sudden collapse in material living
standards, but the malaise of the east is more profound.
Mr Till Noack is a youthful chief executive in the city public utility in
Jena, providing district heating to the barrack blocks of apartments
surrounding the old town centre. Back in the 1970s he was thrown out of Jena
university as a dissident. Now he is one of the new establishment.
He believes that materially most people are no worse off than they were
under the old system - even on unemployment benefit. 'Two different things
are wrong. First, the people have the feeling that, yet again, they are not
the ones deciding what is happening: their lives are controlled from
outside,' he says. 'Second, there is the insecurity: the uncertain future.
There are many people who went to school under the old system, who studied
hard and gradually worked their way up. Suddenly they are out.
'Everything used to seem so unshakeable: it wasn't possible to change, but
at least it was predictable. Now nothing is certain any more.'
Mr Jorg Lesche is an enthusiastic young man who runs the business
development department in the East Saxony office in Bautzen. He extols the
virtues of the new order, of greenfield sites on the edge of town, of the
widening market and possibilities of cross-border trade with Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
But he admits that it has not been easy for everyone. His mother is 54 years
old, a former sports teacher in the world-beating East German system. She
was a member of the Young Communist League in the 1950s, a true believer.
Today she is out of work, and despairs for the future. She has no will to
set up as a private practitioner - as a physiotherapist, for example. She
has simply lost the will to work, he says. 'She is waiting two years, and
then she will simply survive on social security.'
Dr Gunter Hasel is a geologist, 61 years old, who has worked all his life in
the foothills of the Erz mountains, prospecting for uranium and tin. He is
an example of the competent and devoted professionals who came to terms with
the old system against their better instincts, and now have no time to come
to terms with the new.
In the 1950s, he worked for the Russians, mining the uranium for their
nuclear weapons. He is writing an official history of the mines, which will
take him another year. Then he will have to retire.
'I told friends in the west I was forced to take early retirement,' he says.
'They said I was a lucky man. They would love to do the same. But they don't
understand. In the west you have saved up for retirement. You have got a
good pension and savings. I have got nothing to look forward to except a
pittance.'
The feeling in the east is that westerners simply do not understand the
extent of the adjustment being demanded. And yet the feeling of
well-informed westerners is that it is the easterners who have not realised
how much their world has changed.
Dr Dieter Angst, the appropriately named state secretary for planning and
the environment in Saxony, is a westerner who has moved east to Dresden with
his wife, rather than commuting every week like most of his western
colleagues. He believes the whole unemployment problem is misunderstood - in
the east.
'The problem everyone knows, but nobody mentions, is about the proportion of
potentially active people in employment,' he says. 'In the GDR, it was 85 to
90 per cent. That was crazy. In the west it is 55 to 60 per cent. That means
30 per cent of all people formerly employed here are not going to be able to
work again: they are nominally unemployed, but not in the western sense.'
What he is referring to is the inevitability of a major structural change in
the labour market in the east. Whereas in socialist times, female employment
rates were well over 90 per cent, in the west they are far lower - so the
brunt of the change is likely to fall on women in the east.
'This simply is not accepted by people here. They want to be the same as the
west in material terms, but not in social and economic terms.'
He rejects the prevailing pessimism as unjustified, but he does accept that
there is this awful sense of insecurity. 'That I understand,' he says. 'They
never knew it before. But insecurity is the price of freedom. We cannot take
that insecurity away.'
There are no simple conclusions. In purely economic terms, things are not as
gloomy as they may appear on the surface. Recovery will not be quick, but it
could well happen within a decade - if west Germany can keep up its massive
transfers. That cannot be taken for granted but, nonetheless, there is a
feeling that unification is condemned to succeed, economically.
In the east, however, the greatest problem is not material, but
psychological: the challenge of coming to terms with insecurity. That could
take a generation or more to resolve.

FT  11 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend moves hit index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clutch of big Footsie stocks were responsible for knocking just over 7
points off the value of the FT-SE 100 index yesterday as they went
ex-dividend at the start of the new account.
The companies that had the greatest effect were BAT Industries, which took
1.42 points off the index as it released a dividend of 14.6p, and ICI, which
took nearly a point off the index with its dividend of 21p. BAT fell 12 1/2
to 710p xd, ICI lost 4 to 1120p xd and Barclays dropped 11 to 304p ex a
9.15p dividend. National Westminster fell 7 to 305p ex a 6.125p dividend,
despite announcing its intention to acquire - subject to Bank of Italy
approval - the business of Continental Bank's Milan branch. Volatile Rank
Organisation closed a net 15 lower at 550p following a dividend of 10.25p.
However, BP held up relatively well despite the pressure of its recently
halved 2.1p per share dividend and the placing of a block of 1m shares at
181p in early trading. The shares closed up 4 at 187 1/2 p xd on heavy
turnover of 18m, the busiest in the London market yesterday. Reuters also
held up with a gain of 8 1/2 to 1027p xd.
Granada lower
Entertainments and leisure group Granada fell sharply after County NatWest
turned seller of the stock and predicted the shares would underperform.
The shares slipped 10 to 231p on turnover of 2.7m. County said that in spite
of outperforming the market by 79 per cent over the past year, 'the
prospects of the underlying Granada managed businesses do not deserve the
implicit rating on which they currently stand'. The securities house added:
'There is significant scope for disappointment in the current share price'.
Insurers firm
Composite insurance stocks were up on the eve of their interim results
reporting season. However, turnover was generally negligible and the gains
had very little weight behind them according to insurance sector analysts.
General Accident, which reports today, was the best performer with a rise of
10 to 390p. The group is expected to cut its losses significantly from
Pounds 101m last year and maintain the dividend. However, analysts said the
rise in the share price followed a fall from 492p at the end of June.
Commercial Union, which reports tomorrow, gained 5 to 435p and Royal, which
reports on Thursday and is the most heavily exposed to mortgage indemnity,
slipped 2 to 165p.
Speculation in the press that conglomerate Hanson has been planning a
demerger was denied by the company yesterday and the shares eased a
halfpenny to 198p, assisted by the placing of a line of 1.3m shares at 196p.
Hanson announces third-quarter figures on Thursday and profits for the
period are expected to be down to between Pounds 275m and Pounds 325m
against Pounds 379m for the same period last year.
British Airways was sought ahead of today's release of its first-quarter
results. The shares gained 7 to 261p on healthy turnover of 6.4m. Lehman
Brothers is predicting profits for the period April to June at Pounds 85m.
Also in demand was BAA, whose shares gained 8 to 625p.
Weekend press suggestions that Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry
regulator, might step down prematurely helped British Gas to firm a penny to
227 1/2 p. British Gas has been preparing a demand for the system of one-man
regulation to be abolished.
There was continued weakness in music and entertainment group Thorn EMI, the
subject of several profits downgrades last week. The shares gave up another
16 to 696p, after Strauss Turnbull reiterated its sell recommendation.
The general slide in the stock market and the low levels of activity in
recent weeks reflected on the share price of merchant bank SG Warburg which
fell 19 to 421p. Smith New Court was 3 lighter at 85p.
Nervous trading was seen in the water stocks, ahead of Thursday's
publication of a consultative paper on the cost of quality, by the industry
regulator. The day's falls included Anglian Water down 6 at 394p, Thames
Water 7 lighter at 397p, and Yorkshire Water 5 easier at 423p.
Mobile telecommunications group Vodafone eased only a penny to 326p ahead of
Thursday's announcement on a new cellular tariff system. Hoare Govett
remained positive on the stock in the short term.
Industrial gases group BOC closed a penny firmer at 597p, helped by its
defensive qualities and by the announcement that it had completed the sale
of its US-based healthcare business Glasrock for Dollars 72m (Pounds 37.6m)
plus certain liabilities.
Improved turnover for the first six months of this year helped Arjo Wiggins
Appleton to hold firm at 215p.
Among food manufacturers, Northern Foods, continued to suffer from Friday's
profits downgrading by BZW and also more general worries about the company's
potential earnings growth. After a one for one share split took effect, the
shares ended 7 down at 253p.
Pilkington, one of Europe's biggest glassmakers, remained in the doldrums,
easing another 2 to 79p. The continued decline of the stock over the past
few weeks has placed it at the bottom of the FT-SE 100 in terms of market
capitalisation. The company announced yesterday that its US subsidiary had
completed a private placement of Dollars 300m of long term finance.
The stores sector continued to suffer from worries over the economy, which
led to falls in some stocks, although bargain-hunting trimmed losses. Marks
and Spencer ended 3 lighter at 300p, as did Boots at 421p. Great Universal
Stores, however, fell 41 to 1323p.
Aggregates and quarrying group Evered Bardon rose 3 to 30p after it said it
had won contracts worth about Dollars 40m (Pounds 20.9m) to supply concrete
for Boston's Third Harbour Tunnel project. A buy recommendation from Nomura
helped Burton Group close steady at 31 1/2 p.
Nursing homes group Takare performed well on the back of solid first-half
results. Profits leapt to Pounds 5.63m from Pounds 2.99m for the same period
last year and the shares gained 5 to 195p.

FT  11 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE at 18-month low in poor trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in other European markets, triggered by a sharp fall in Japan's
Nikkei Average to within a few points of the important 15,000 benchmark,
gave a further blow yesterday to UK equities already reeling from recent
evidence of recessionary pressures on British companies. The first session
of the new equity account saw the FT-SE index shed a further 25 points to
trade at levels not seen since the end of the Gulf war 18 months ago.
The stock market opened sharply lower and was nearly 30 points off at
mid-session. However, turnover remained poor in the London market and nearly
one third of the Footsie's loss reflected technical reductions in a handful
of blue chip stocks to allow for dividend payments.
At the close, the FT-SE index was 24.4 points down at 2,325.7; the index
closed at 2,322.2 on February 26 1991 when the Gulf war was moving to its
end, jumping to 2,348 the next day as UK base rates were cut to 13 per cent.
The market's gloom on Friday night, as the Footsie approached the sensitive
2,350 mark, deepened over the weekend on press reports of a highly bearish
survey of prospects for the UK housing market from Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank. The collapse of the domestic housing market, with its
implications for the construction and property industries as well as for
banks and mortgage companies, is regarded as a significant restraint on
recovery in both the UK economy and stock market.
The problem of low consumer confidence found further expression in the June
consumer credit statistics, which disclosed a net repayment of Pounds 55m
debt by UK consumers evidently still nervous of spending in the high street
stores.
Bank shares, still perturbed by last week's negative trading statement from
Barclays Bank, gave ground again and store shares were mostly easier. But
the composite insurers, which announce trading profits this week under the
lead of General Accident, managed to put on a brighter face yesterday.
The UK market was not helped by a slow start to the new session on Wall
Street, which was 6.48 Dow points off in London hours. However, British
Petroleum picked itself up off the floor after the heavy fall which followed
the board's decision last week to cut the quarterly dividend.
The institutions showed no inclination to take up new positions as the
account got under way. Traders commented that most of the session was
featured by a trickle of small selling orders.
Seaq volume of 331m was low, even by recent standards, and compared with
480.3m shares on Friday. Retail, or customer, business increased to just
over Pounds 1bn on Friday when both institutional and private investors
continued to grapple with the implications of the week's flow of alarming
company news.
The mood in the market yesterday was one of apathy rather than of alarm.
Equity traders believe that, with the FT-SE 2,350 mark now apparently lost,
the market is searching for a new support level.

<TEXT>
MR RUDOLPH Sprungli, chairman of Lindt und Sprungli, said that neither he
nor his new wife would take over the position of chief executive of the fine
chocolate group.
'Giving my wife, Alexandra Sprungli-Gantenbein, operative responsibility in
the management is not being considered,' Mr Sprungli said in a statement.
Speculation that he himself would become chief executive was also wide of
the mark.
Mr Sprungli, 72, was responding to speculation in the Swiss press that his
new wife, who is 28 years his junior, would become chief executive as early
as next month.
The former chief executive, Mr Ulrich Geissmann, resigned last week after
the Sprungli's marriage was announced.
Last May, when the couple's engagement became known, allegations were made
that Mrs Gantenbein, a sometime adherent of an obscure theosophical sect,
had improper influence on the appointment of Lindt &amp; Sprungli executives. A
study by accountants KPMG found that she had influence but that decisions
were made by responsible directors.
Mr Sprungli said in his statement that she had never worked for the company,
but had only been his personal adviser on personnel matters.
Lindt &amp; Sprungli shares remained unusually active on the Zurich Stock
Exchange yesterday, but closed down only SFr100 at SFr12,900. Last
Wednesday, they sank to SFr10,900 following the resignation of Mr Geissmann.

<TEXT>
NORTH and South Korea yesterday narrowed the cold war gap, agreeing a
framework for re-establishing land, sea and air links in a unified nation,
Reuter reports from Seoul.
Seoul's South-North Dialogue Office said 16 points, including transport
links, had been agreed during two hours of talks between the communist North
and capitalist South at the border village of Panmunjom.
But scores of differences still remain between the ideological foes before
they can sign a full economic pact.
'Both Koreas reached final agreement on 16 items concerning mutual economic
exchanges and co-operation which are included in an accord to implement the
non-aggression and reconciliation pact,' the office said.
The agreements included the re-opening of railways and roads, sea and air
routes and the relinking of mail services and other communications.
The two sides also agreed to forge scientific, technological and
environmental exchanges and co-operation once the border re-opens. The two
sides meet again on August 21.
Direct links between the two Koreas were cut after the bitter 1950-53 Korean
war, which ended in an uncertain truce.
The prime ministers signed a non-aggression pact last December and launched
regular talks aimed at putting the accord into practice. But progress limped
to a halt when a bitter row erupted over the South's demand to inspect
nuclear facilities in the North.
The first victim of the nuclear impasse was a reunion programme for families
divided by the war, which was due this month.
The two Koreas agreed in May to allow cross-border visits by a handful of
elderly Koreans separated from their families by the 1945 division of the
Korean peninsula.
But the humanitarian exchanges have been held to ransom by the nuclear
issue, and talks collapsed last Friday.
The next day, South Korean news media said Seoul might suspend plans to send
deputy premier Choi Kak-kyu and a mission of businessmen and government
officials to the North to study joint ventures and economic co-operation.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Armenia appeals for CIS aid: Ter-Petrosian claims republic
penetrated by Azerbaijani forces

<TEXT>
ARMENIA was yesterday appealing to other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States to take economic, political and even military measures
against the neighbouring republic of Azerbaijan, according to Armenian
spokesmen and news agencies.
Mr Levan Ter-Petrosian, the Armenian president, was reported to have
appealed to the six members of the CIS collective security pact after
Azerbaijan troops allegedly penetrated into the Armenian district of
Krasnocelsk, to the north-east of Lake Levan. Both sides also reported the
capture by Azerbaijan forces of the tiny Armenian enclave of Artsvashen
within Azerbaijan - with a loss of life estimated at between 22 and over
300.
The daily Izvestia reported from Yerevan, the Armenian capital, that
aircraft from Azerbaijan had dropped bombs on the district centre of Goris.
This is near the Armenian-Azeri border and the base from which the Armenians
launched a successful attack earlier this year to secure a land corridor
between Armenia and the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan yesterday dismissed the Armenian charges and said it had no fear
that fellow CIS states would join the conflict on Armenia's side. However no
confirmation was available yesterday of Mr Ter-Petrosian's call being
received by other members of the security pact - who also include Russia
with four central Asian states. In effect, the call is for Russian
protection - as Russia retains an army in Armenia and none of the other
members of the pact would have the independent armed force to intervene.
However, even Russia, the traditional protector of Armenia in its feuds with
neighbouring Moslem nations, would be highly unlikely to respond to the call
with military sanctions. The six-nation pact was concluded in Tashkent,
capital of Uzbekistan, in May this year - committing each of the states to
come to each other's aid if attacked.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's foreign minister arrived in Ankara yesterday for
talks on his country's conflict with Armenia on the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh and on ways of boosting co-operation with Turkey, Reuter
reports from Ankara.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Economic reforms 'hinge on arrears'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE survival of Russian economic reforms depends on the outcome of a dispute
on how to deal with Rbs2-3 trillion (million million) in arrears between
state enterprises, Mr Sergei Ignatiev, a deputy chairman of the central
bank, said yesterday.
Mr Ignatiev, responsible for credit policy, said that contrary to reports
last week, there had been no final decision on the release of large-scale
credits to state enterprises. He also revealed deep divisions within the
central bank and with the government since Mr Viktor Gerashchenko was
appointed central bank chairman.
He defended the record of the radical reformers in the bank and the
government, and said, for instance, that a shortage of banknotes which was
the main source of popular discontent was now virtually solved.
Mr Ignatiev said: 'It is not so much ordinary people but enterprise
directors and various lobbies who have different reasons for wanting to
remove Yegor Timurovich (Mr Gaidar, the acting prime minister and a leading
proponent of radical reform).'
He added that he was not sure whether he himself would be kept on by Mr
Gerashchenko, who had appointed a host of new deputies from his old days as
Soviet central bank chief.
At issue was whether the government would be able to pursue its original
plans for dealing with enterprises that have continued to trade with each
other without demanding payment. 'It's enterprises' fault if they don't have
any money. We need to impose discipline so that creditors act responsibly
and don't send goods to enterprises which cannot pay for them. Otherwise
enterprises will behave like before and non-payments will grow again.'
Mr Gerashchenko had last Thursday withdrawn instructions which countered a
presidential decree in June by President Boris Yeltsin on how to handle the
debt crisis. The decree stipulated that net creditors would be repaid, if it
all, from the liquidation of assets or the sale of debts of other
enterprises.
An agency for managing enterprise debts would effectively decide the fate of
enterprises on a case by case basis.
Prof Yevgeny Yasin, the godfather of the government's medium-term economic
programme, explained that a differentiated approach was required because net
debtors were not necessarily more 'guilty' than the net creditors.
The instructions issued and then cancelled by Mr Gerashchenko would have
automatically compensated enterprises that emerged as net creditors, a move
which according to Mr Ignatiev would have cost anywhere between Rbs500bn and
Rbs1.5 trillion in inflationary financing.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Russian capitalists inherit social mantle cast off by the
state: Signs of a growing private sector culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING could have been more bourgeois. A rugby match on a fine evening,
with a little clump of spectators in a rather dilapidated ground.
Bourgeois is what it was meant to be. The match's main spectator was Mr
Vadim Polovnikov, president of the local team - Rostov-on-Don 'Enpils'  -
and managing director of the Enpils chemical company. Round him was much of
the private sector of Rostov-on-Don: representatives of the new class which
is now reaching for some status and security in a society still dominated by
the state. Rugby, the middle-class ball game of the west, is being used to
help in that quest.
Mr Polovnikov's company, an amalgamation of factories making paints,
chemicals, medicines and building materials, went private last year by
making over the shares to the managers and the workers.
By becoming the first major private company in this southern Russian river
port, Enpils and Mr Polovnikov are at the centre of a slowly growing web of
private sector alliances. He is also president of the Union of Businessmen
and Leaseholders. The vice-president, Mr Vladimir Nikolsky, has founded some
half dozen private companies with help from Enpils.
Many of the businessmen at the rugby match have founded businesses which
supply services to Enpils. These men are together a great deal: their circle
has the air of a slightly embattled yet modernising group establishing new
customs. Some have recently been to the US, all for the first time.
Their conversation already bears traces of a new in-group with their own
concerns. They are discriminated against in prices - the state companies
pricing down in supplies to each other, pricing up to the private sector. Mr
Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank chairman, last week proposed
that credit be advanced to the bankrupt state sector at 10 per cent, 'and we
would still pay 80 per cent or more,' snorts Mr Polovnikov.
They have protectors: the Rostov regional soviet is pro-business. Mr
Vladimir Emilianov, the first deputy head of the administration, says that
'we want to develop private companies: as the state structure fails, we want
the private sector to grow and take its place'. But money is lacking; the
state sector is huge; there are few competent managers or bureaucrats; the
fear of social unrest is deep.
It is precisely the unease over the social position of the new businesses
which impel them in a direction quite different from the 'classic' western
model. Though Enpils has decentralised its various plants into separate
profit centres, it is taking on a range of social responsibilities. It is
building flats for its workers, is managing kindergartens, has a school, is
building a swimming pool, has donated substantial sums to the impoverished
local hospital. The Soviet-era big companies traditionally did much of this
 -a fact which makes it even harder to declare them bankrupt. But Mr
Polovnikov is doing more than his state colleagues, not less.
He is the town's major sponsor. He funds the rugby club; the youth theatre
and the International Children's Theatre Festival. He funds a new choir and
is putting money into the reconstruction of the cathedral's bell tower. He
wants people to see that private enterprise can sustain them and their
culture as well as the state, with the result that he now has a whole range
of dependents, all of whom laud him loudly. His circle is a little like a
court - quite usual in Russian business.
The growth of 'business' - the English word is used as asynonym for
capitalism - coincides with the progressive collapse of the state, both as a
controlling medium and as a social protector. To give themselves legitimacy,
the new businessmen are taking upon themselves a mantle which the state is
shedding.
They are also reaching back into history for legitimation and in Rostov,
that means back to the Cossacks, the descendants of originally outlawed
frontiersmen who, on the Don and the Volga, established settled communities
of farmers who continued a military tradition.
Mr Nikolsky, a vigorous man in his early sixties, was last year received
into the Rostov Cossack district. The Cossacks are also an object of Mr
Polovnikov's charity: their weekly paper carries on its masthead the name of
the company or companies sponsoring that edition. Since they were private
farmers, they now push for the privatisation of land; and since the new
capitalists must find a tradition before the Soviet one in which to wrap
themselves, they take them up. Mr Vladimir Popov, the elected attaman of the
Rostov Cossacks, is at the rugby match, too: when he mentions that he cannot
attend a grand meeting of attamans in Moscow because of the expense, Mr
Nikolsky assures him the expenses will be taken care of, and he should go.
Mr Polovnikov's team, perhaps drawing on a Cossack tradition of
anti-Muscovite revolt, has beaten the visiting Moscow Spartak by 79-3. As
they move towards their cars, the Rostov capitalists could almost be the
executive committee of a Rotary Club after an outing. So they would like to
become. 'Normal businessmen,' as they say of themselves. But not yet, for
all the show they are still precarious, still at the frontier.

FT  11 AUG 92 / Republics take refuge in soap: A Mexican TV saga is
enthralling the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEREVER the Mexican ambassador goes in the former Soviet Union, the burning
question he is asked by presidents, foreign ministers and ordinary people
alike has nothing to with diplomacy. They want to know what happens at the
end of a soap opera called The Rich Also Cry.
An estimated 140m TV viewers from Belarus to Russia's far east have fallen
prey to this chronicle of the love and torments of Luis Alberto and
Marianna, a handsome upper middle-class couple with lots of money and
problems.
The 248-part 'telenovella' (there is no word in Russian for soap opera), on
the air three times a week, has become a common obsession for republics
striving to be independent in every other way.
'They all want to know how it ends but I can't tell them because I haven't
seen it,' confides Mr Carlos Tello, ambassador to all the former Soviet
republics apart from the Baltics. 'But I tell them that logically it must
have a good ending because in Mexican soap operas the bad people have to
lose and the good people have to win.'
Not since Soviet factories came to a standstill to watch the country's first
independent sessions of parliament under President Mikhail Gorbachev has
television had the power to stop a great nation in its tracks. At a time
when the novelty of glasnost has worn off and people are fed up with
politics, the programme offers half an hour of escape to people ground down
by economic hardship.
'It's wonderful,' exclaims Ms Olga Kovolyova, a teacher in her 40s. 'For a
while I can forget all the troubles of my life in Moscow. The people are
beautiful, the houses are grand. They never have to worry about cooking or
buying food, and wrongdoing is punished, which never happens in our life.'
The sets are prosaic and the acting over the top, but the plot is grippingly
simple. Love triumphs, even though men can be blind and evil temporarily
gains the upper hand. This week for instance, Marianna has finally found the
son she gave away to a lottery ticket seller 18 years ago (this happened
when she was in a state of delirium three weeks ago).
Now she has to find a way of telling the lottery ticket seller, whose life
she has just saved, that she wants her son back. She also has to convince
Luis Alberto, who caused her to give away the child by not believing it was
his, to drop charges against their son without yet telling him that the boy
who broke into their house was the infant she gave away.
Despite the embarrassing 1970s style of dress and the simplistic dialogue,
it all looks and sounds good to Russians. Even the poor have nice flats.
'This has a comforting effect on viewers. They want things to be such in
their own lives,' says Ms Maria Starostina, deputy head of programming at
Ostankino, which beams programmes all over the Commonwealth of Independent
States. The series is the second or third most watched programme after a
game show called Wonderland and the evening news.
Both Ostankino and the Mexican embassy have been flooded with thousands of
fan letters, including a 24-page poem from Belarus.
Is there life after The Rich Also Cry? Perhaps. The Russians are now
negotiating to obtain the rights to that other blockbuster, Dallas.

<TEXT>
THE head of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia says two currencies would be
possible if the Czech and Slovak republics become separate states, but the
states could also have one currency with the necessary financial and
budgetary co-ordination, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Josef Tosovsky said in an interview published yesterday in the Slovak
daily 'Smena' that the introduction of separate Czech and Slovak currencies
would have to be by 'legal means'.
'The change in state set-up is by a definite political decision, a political
move, which would be necessary to realise by a definite means in monetary
policy,' Mr Tosovsky said.
At the same time, Mr Tosovsky said that separate states with a joint
currency or an agreement for a monetary union would require a co-ordinated
financial and budgetary policy 'for such a close economic union'.
'Both partners would have to surrender their sovereignty roughly in the
sense that European states intend to surrender it in the framework of the
proposed monetary union,' Mr Tosovsky said.
'The agreements in Maastricht are in that regard inspirational.'
Czech and Slovak political leaders have ordered the parliaments of the two
republics to devise a plan for a new federal structure by September 30.
Economists say that a split in the currency, the koruna, is likely if
Czechoslovakia is divided in two, because of wide differences in the
economies of the two republics and the economic policies of their
governments.

THE Polish government, under pressure from organised labour to ease tough
free market policies, rejects subsidies for struggling state factories, Mr
Zdobyslaw Milewski, the government spokesman, said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Warsaw.
'The government will not bring back subsidies for state enterprises,' he
said.
The former communist trade union OPZZ decided last weekend to support pay
demands at a copper combine where workers have been on strike for three
weeks.
It threatened a general stoppage if the government refused to open
negotiations with the strikers.
The union called for a 15-minute cross-country warning action yesterday to
build up pressure on the goverment but according to radio reports the
response among workers was weak.
Mr Milewski said the government had presented a plan to speed up changes of
state enterprises to help them adapt to market-oriented policies but that it
could not decide about pay issues.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Violence tops agenda in S Africa: The ANC's week of protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest came to a subdued conclusion over the
weekend, overtaken by the prospect of a United Nations observer mission to
the country and a call for a thorough investigation into the security
forces.
The disclosure that Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National
Congress, spoke to President FW de Klerk by telephone on Friday - the first
direct communication between the two men for weeks - fuelled speculation
that an early resumption of the stalled constitutional negotiations was
likely.
Whether the week of protest played a significant part in bringing the two
parties together is debatable. An ANC official said yesterday that the
two-day general strike on Monday and Tuesday and marches during the rest of
the week had strengthened the ANC's hand.
But if the objective was to force Mr de Klerk to concede to the early
implementation of measures leading to majority rule, there is little
evidence of success. Government ministers continue to talk in terms of power
sharing - a concept which envisages guaranteed minority representation at
all levels of government.
In the meantime, the need to curb political violence remains a critical
issue. The judge leading South Africa's official inquiry into township
killings has called for a full-scale investigation of the country's security
forces and the military wings of political organisations.
In a weekend statement, Mr Justice Goldstone urged the government to act on
recommendations made by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in
his report to the Security Council on Friday. Mr Boutros Ghali proposed that
about 30 UN observers be stationed in South Africa to help curb political
violence.
For some years, Justice Goldstone said, 'there had been widespread and
serious allegations' about the unlawful activities of the South African army
and police, as well as the guerrilla wing of the ANC and the police force of
the KwaZulu homeland.
Piecemeal investigations will do no more than 'scratch the surface of the
widespread perceptions which make all of these agencies the object of
mistrust, distrust and suspicion'.
Turning specifically to the South African Defence Force and police force,
the judge said that, unless they were 'fully investigated by a neutral and
reliable body, they will have no prospect of receiving the trust, confidence
and co-operation of the South African public'.
The police investigation of the Boipatong massacre in June was criticised
last month by a British criminal expert attached to the Goldstone
commission. This was followed by allegations from a prominent pathologist
that police brutality had been responsible for scores of the deaths in
custody that he had investigated.
The judge also noted that the continued existence of the ANC's guerrilla
wing had been a cause of complaint, especially from Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party.
At the same time, commented the judge, the activities of the KwaZulu police
force had come under question. 'It is widely perceived to be a force acting
as the arm of the IFP.'
In short, he concluded: 'The commission believes that, if it is not able to
investigate fully the operations of these agencies, it will not be able to
carry out its mandate of making recommendations for curbing the violence.'
The judge also raised the possibility of offering an amnesty to members of
organisations allegedly involved in violence, saying this 'would make the
work of the commission more efficient and searching'.
The grudging response of the police to criticism of their Boipatong
investigation, and the truculent conduct of SADF counsel at the Goldstone
commission, suggests that both parties remain reluctant to open their
activities to detailed scrutiny.
Indeed, observers believe that without amnesty provisions, their
co-operation will be difficult to obtain. As for Mr Boutros Ghali's
recommendation that UN observers should be sent to South Africa, Mr de Klerk
has already made clear that he supports such a proposal in principle.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Morocco still cautious despite economic progress: The stiff
challenges facing a government widely praised for springing back from a debt
crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NINE years ago Morocco shared the fate of many Latin American countries.
Like them it had borrowed heavily to finance large current account and
public sector deficits, both of which, by 1982-83, exceeded 13 per cent of
gross domestic product.
The inevitable happened when, in August 1983, with virtually no
international reserves left, Morocco was forced to reschedule its Dollars
13bn foreign debt.
Today Moroccan leaders can claim solid progress on a number of fronts - the
public sector's finances are broadly balanced, trade has been liberalised,
growth has averaged 4.6 per cent a year since 1985, and foreign investment
is increasing.
A recent study by the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell concludes that, unlike
any Latin American country, Morocco 'managed to push ahead with structural
reform, while maintaining single digit annual inflation throughout and
registering growth broadly in line with the country's output capacity.'
It has avoided the severe financial dislocation that in Latin American
countries kept the risk premiums on interest rates and currency high, long
after the original financial problem had been resolved.
External factors, most notably the more favourable terms of trade the
country enjoyed after 1985, have helped. So has the strong support afforded
by western creditors as Morocco rescheduled its Paris Club debt six times
and its London Club debt three times.
Despite its achievements, commended during a visit to the kingdom last month
by Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank president who promised that the Bank
would extend Dollars 500m worth of loans annually for the next few years,
Morocco faces some stiff challenges. Unemployment affects an estimated 20
per cent of the population and the imbalance in wealth remains a serious
problem.
The labour force is growing at about 3 per cent a year and a steady rate of
growth is thus vital to avoid repetition of the rioting which occurred in
1981, 1984 and 1990. Compared with countries with similar per capita income,
Morocco scores lower where child mortality, child labour and illiteracy are
concerned. With 55 per cent of men unable to read or write, it is not
surprising that labour qualification levels remain low and constitute a big
handicap for the expanding export sector.
Meanwhile, cuts in government spending mean than the quality and
availability of free education and health, which are already low, have
declined in recent years. Morocco still has a woefully inadequate telephone
network.
The macro-economic results of the past decade speak for themselves.
Inflation has averaged 5.8 per cent, thanks in particular to a conservative
monetary policy. Since December 1990 the central bank has relied on bank
reserve ratios and domestic interest rates rather than direct credit
ceilings for Moroccan banks. Savings have responded favourably.
A current account deficit of almost 8 per cent of GDP in 1984 was turned
into small surpluses in 1987 and 1989 but slipped back into a 2.5 per cent
deficit in 1991. The share of the budget deficit in the GDP fell from more
than 11 per cent to 3.1 per cent in 1991. The cuts, although initially
needed, were so drastic that basic social and, to a lesser degree, material
infrastructure were hit.
The risks of such a situation are acknowledged by senior Moroccan ministers
such as Mr Mohamed Berrada, who has held the finance portfolio since 1986.
Hence much of the proceeds of the second structural adjustment loan, worth
Dollars 275m, agreed by the World Bank in April, is to be channelled towards
health care and education for the poor.
Apart from its role in modernising Moroccan industry, trade liberalisation
has helped contain inflation. More than 90 per cent of imports are now free
from licensing and the balance should be freed by the end of the year. The
maximum level of import tariff was reduced from 400 per cent in 1983 to 35
per cent this year and average import tariffs are projected to reach 12 per
cent by the end of 1992.
Foreign investment, which increased by 80 per cent last year has also been
encouraged by the abolition, 2 1/2 years ago, of the 1973 Moroccanisation
Law and the rather more equal tax and legal footing foreign companies now
enjoy with their Moroccan peers.
Equally important is the emergence of a stronger, younger and more outward
looking class of entrepreneurs.

FT  10 AUG 92 / US, Israel edge towards pact: Bush-Rabin meeting raises
hopes of progress in Mideast talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A distinct improvement in relations between the US and Israel will be marked
today when President George Bush and prime minister Yitzhak Rabin hold the
first of two meetings.
Although preparations for the talks, at Mr Bush's holiday home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, have been overshadowed by the crisis in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, the two leaders are expected to reach broad agreement on
the provision of US loan guarantees and on the next stage of Middle East
peace talks, scheduled to resume in Washington in two weeks.
Prospects for progress at the talks received a boost yesterday when Israel
proposed legalising contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
firmly viewed as a terrorist organisation by the government of former
premier Yitzhak Shamir.
Mr Bush and Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, made no secret of their
wish for Mr Rabin to lead the Labour party to victory in June's elections.
Under Mr Shamir, relations between Israel and the US had fallen to their
lowest level since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and siege of Beirut in
1982.
Mr Shamir's refusal to contemplate relinquishing control over the Arab
territories occupied by Israel in 1967 in defiance of UN resolutions came to
be seen in the US as the main obstacle on the path towards a Middle East
peace agreement.
The US response to Mr Shamir's commitment to retain the territories was to
refuse the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) in loan guarantees Israel needed to
house Soviet immigrants, unless Israel first stopped building new
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
The refusal represented the most serious setback suffered by Israel in
Washington for many years and Mr Rabin has moved quickly to ban most new
settlement building in the occupied territories.
The loan guarantees, however, are unlikely to be provided without some
further debate.
Suggestions have been made that the US would like some offset arrangement
included which would allow American companies to take part in the building
programme.
Mr Rabin is also expected to outline to Mr Bush the proposals that Israeli
negotiators will put on the table when peace talks resume in Washington. He
is looking for agreement by early next year on some form of interim
Palestinian self-governing authority which would administer the territories
prior to an eventual conference to decide their final status.
With Mr Rabin keen to demonstrate early achievements in the face of
hostility from the right-wing and settlers' organisations at home and Mr
Bush trailing far behind Governor Bill Clinton in the US presidential
election race, both men have powerful reasons for wanting the talks to
succeed.
A successful resumption of Middle East peace negotiations might also allow
Mr Bush to deflect some of the political damage done to his Gulf war triumph
by the fresh challenges to UN ceasefire agreements being made by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Britain's hospital chaplains face day of judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH SERVICE managers are praying for some divine inspiration after
hospital chaplains agreed to talks on relating their pay more closely to
performance.
Performance pay is spreading rapidly throughout the public sector as part of
the government's Citizen's Charter.
However, chaplains and many of their clergy colleagues employed by the
Church of England believe extending the principle to them would present
managers with an unholy headache.
'We do not see it getting very far,' said Mr Alastair Henderson, assistant
national officer for the Nalgo public services union which represents many
of the 220 health service chaplains.
'How can you assess the quality of the work of people whose job is to deal
with the sick and dying?' he said. 'Any performance targets you set would be
completely meaningless. The number of bedside visits would tell you nothing,
for example.
'In crude Christian terms, a measure of success could be whether a patient
has eternal life. I do not think that health service managers have quite
grasped how to judge that.'
Many chaplains are equally puzzled. The Reverend Gillian King, a chaplain at
Kingston and Esher health authority, said: 'How effective a chaplain is, is
a matter between the chaplain, the patient and God. How can you define and
relate that to pay? I don't know. Having said that, we are accountable and
we are regarded in many respects as senior managers.'
In the Church of England, moves are in train to introduce performance
appraisal but there are no plans to relate this to pay.
Canon Hugh Marshall, chief secretary of the Church of England advisory board
of ministry, which advises on pay and conditions, said: 'How do you evaluate
a priest's ministry? It would not be easy this side of the pearly gates.'
Nalgo agreed to the performance pay talks as part of this year's pay
agreement.
The deal provided for increases of 4.75 per cent, taking salaries to between
Pounds 17,345 and Pounds 20,291, and accommodation allowances to Pounds
2,880. Chaplain assistants earn between Pounds 12,187 and Pounds 14,258.
The clause on performance pay was the same used in various agreements which
have been made for differing groups of health service workers this year.
The agreement also calls for a look into pay determination generally, and Mr
Henderson believes there may be scope for linking settlements to those of
other health service workers.
However, he said many managers already believe that performance pay is
unlikely to get off the ground.

FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: German banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see the 3.2 per cent fall in Deutsche Bank's first-half
operating profits as the harbinger of disappointments to come in German
banking generally. The figure contrasts, for example, with a 17.5 per cent
increase in Commerzbank's interim profit and even higher growth rates at the
Bavarian banks. Yet while Deutsche's results do bear the hallmarks of a
slowing economy, there also appear to be special factors at work. The bank
is paying the price for expanding into eastern Germany where its new
customers are becoming more sophisticated about wanting higher-yield
accounts. This partly explains the squeeze on interest margins.
Come the end of the year, the difference with the other banks may be less
striking. Most German banks are suffering some pressure on their funding
costs from the inverted yield curve. First-half operating results are no
guide to the impact of economic slowdown on loan loss provisions. German
bank accounting in this regard is notoriously opaque, but, if the bad debts
really do start mounting, Deutsche could end up with two advantages. First
it almost certainly has a large surplus of developing country debt
provisions. Second it has at least already begun to scale back its domestic
lending, placing more funds in the interbank market, even at the expense of
compressing its interest income.

FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long gilt yields scarcely flinched after the Bank of England announced on
Friday that it had scheduled an auction of long-dated stock later this
month. That suggests there is still enough demand from domestic institutions
to absorb the Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn in stock which will be on offer. But
the Bank also has little choice. It cannot afford to disrupt its funding
programme so it must simply assume enough domestic demand to satisfy its
needs. Exchange rate worries mean gilts are receiving little support from
overseas at present: witness the softness of prices in the 10-year range
normally favoured by foreign buyers.
Sooner or later, however, the government will need the help of foreign
investors too. While equities remain weak, it may be natural for UK
institutions to put new cash into gilts, especially if they believe
inflation will eventually fall to almost nothing. Investing at the long-end
not only fits with their liability schedules. It is also the point on the
maturity spectrum best insulated from the turmoil that would follow any
increase in base rates to protect sterling.
Yet these same investors also have to consider that, despite the market's
frenzied optimism in the immediate aftermath of the election, the total
return on gilts bought at the April auction has barely exceeded that on
cash. Doubtless they would be quick to redirect their attention to equities
at the first sign of real life in that market. The hope must be that the
same factor which eventually revives shares will also rekindle the
enthusiasm of foreign investors for gilts. A devaluation will hardly fit the
bill. Doubts on that score are liable to remain until after next month's
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The Bank must be hoping they do
not get strong enough to discourage domestic investors as well.

FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest US unemployment figures leave the Federal Reserve in a cleft
stick. The economy is growing, which in the UK would be enough to raise a
statue to the chancellor, but the recovery is still very weak. US growth may
be around 2 per cent this year, and a little more next year. That is not
enough to stop unemployment rising, exacerbating the Fed's political
difficulties with the administration.
Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, thus has a difficult decision to make.
At the risk of frightening the bond market, he could cut short term interest
rates once more, hoping to spark consumer confidence. Alternatively, he
could hold off, gambling that the Fed's tough anti-inflationary attitude
will help long yields fall, stimulating the housing market. Ideally, he
would wait for a clearer picture, but once the presidential election
campaign formally starts in September, interest rate cuts would look
partisan.
By selling dollars heavily on Friday, the foreign exchanges took the view
that an early rate cut was possible. The Fed intervened to stem the fall,
but more significant is the way Mr Greenspan has dragged his heels over
previous rate cuts. At this stage, falling long term interest are more
important for the recovery in the economy. The Fed will not let haste
threaten that prize.

FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Loss in translation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weak dollar has added an unwelcome element of uncertainty to the already
shaky earnings outlook for UK companies. Real earnings growth looks elusive
on cyclical grounds, but the latest batch of profit downgrades from brokers
also contains a currency component. Dollar profits will suffer on
translation into sterling. This will act as a brake on earnings in the
second half of the year and possibly beyond.
UK companies are more exposed than their continental European rivals. As the
chart shows, some 40 per cent of UK quoted company earnings are, in one way
or another, dependent on the US currency. Sales in the US market account for
about 25 per cent of total profits reported by UK quoted companies. The
balance is made up of profits from commodities priced in dollars and
earnings in currencies which are closely linked to the dollar. Compared with
last year, the translation impact of the weak dollar is not yet severe. Even
if the dollar remains at around Dollars 1.90 against sterling, the average
rate for the year as a whole is unlikely to be far from that of 1991. Until
recently, however, the market was anticipating a currency benefit. This has
now been stripped out.
Among the bears, Morgan Stanley does not anticipate a dollar recovery until
the second half of next year. On this basis alone it has trimmed its UK
earnings growth forecast from 17 per cent to 13.5 per cent for 1993. The
select group of UK companies which hedge translation exposures, such as TI
Group and BOC, aim to iron out these fluctuations in earnings. But this
brings no discernible lasting benefit to their share prices. Indeed, it is
questionable whether a company should hedge a pure accounting phenomenon by
taking a view on exchange rates. Investors might prefer to take the view
themselves.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID ROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Porter (Letters, August 5) and I J Blakey (Letters, August 7),
from both sides of the energy argument appear to be overlooking the fact
that the Pounds 1.26bn subsidy paid to Nuclear Electric is intended to
outlast the needs of the nuclear industry. It is part of the Non-Fossil
Fuels Obligation, introduced to subsidise energy sources other than coal and
oil to maintain diversity.
If we are to move away from the burning of pollutants such as gas, coal, oil
and orimulsion, we shall have to invest in building the structures, such as
wave and offshore wind power stations along with tidal barrages, that will
ensure all our energy futures. That must mean a continued payment of at
least 11 per cent of electricity bills until the capital investment has been
amortised.
It may be some consolation to recognise that without diversity we would be
dependent on world prices of finite fuels which are bound to increase as
demand grows, resources diminish and a captive market competes for supplies.
As to nuclear power, the French have shown that even with extensive
development and serial production, it needs continued government subsidy.

FT  10 AUG 92 / A sale that promises to pay on delivery: The options being
considered by the government for privatisation of the Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'For Sale' notice has been hung outside Britain's Post Office. Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wants to free the corporation from
what he calls the 'shackles' of public ownership.
So far, the government has not yet committed itself to privatisation. But
for the first time is it willing to consider selling off Europe's most
profitable nationalised postal service. The Post Office's record pre-tax
profits of Pounds 247m for the year to March 29 included the loss-making
Parcelforce, which is now to be sold as a separate unit. By deciding to shed
Parcelforce the government has made the Post Office a more attractive
proposition for investors.
What is potentially on offer is Post Office Counters (shops selling stamps
and other postal products), which made a profit of Pounds 26m in the year to
March, and Royal Mail, which handles 61m letters a day and increased pre-tax
profits by almost 120 per cent, from Pounds 121m to Pounds 266m, during the
same period.
It is, therefore, not surprising that when Mr Heseltine recently announced a
government review of the Post Office's structure and organisation - to run
until the end of the year - private postal operators warmly applauded his
decision, as a precursor to possible privatisation. The operators are now
expected to submit proposals on how the Post Office could best be
transferred from public to private ownership.
The government has said it is prepared to look at everything, including
breaking the Post Office up or selling it off as a whole to a single buyer.
However, the path it takes is likely to be dictated by the proposals
submitted by the private sector. So far three options put forward by private
operators and one from the corporation's own managers are under
consideration: The splitting-up of mail collection and delivery. Securicor
Omega, the biggest independent parcels business in the UK, has informed the
government of its interest in collecting letters from post boxes and
transporting them to Royal Mail offices for final delivery. Mr Pat Howes,
chief executive, says: 'We have the infrastructure to provide a significant
service for the Royal Mail.'
Other companies interested in sorting and transporting letters include
Bridoc, the only company licensed to carry letters below the cost of the
Pounds 1 Post Office monopoly on condition that it only handles business
mail.
Companies could be encouraged to bid for part or all of the Post Office.
TNT, the Australian-owned courier and parcels group, has long been
interested in delivering letters in the UK if the government gave it the
exclusive rights to compete with the Post Office.
The idea was rejected by Mr Nicholas Ridley when he was trade and industry
secretary in 1988. But there are indications that TNT has changed its
position slightly and may now be more optimistic about its chances: it may
bid for, or take part in, a consortium wishing to buy all or part of a
profitable letters monopoly. Mr Alan Jones, UK managing director of TNT,
says: ''We are keeping all our options open.'
A management buy-out. Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, is
keen to win more commercial freedom. Free from government control, he would
look at introducing a range of different services. He has already
investigated the possibility of offering a premium letter service,
guaranteeing next-day delivery at a cost of about 35p.
Sir Bryan will only say that any changes in the Post Office's structure and
future must take the views of its staff on board. One Post Office executive
says the corporation's directors have already started to work on plans for a
management buy-out.
Private postal operators could be licensed to compete with the Post Office
in different regions of the UK.
Mr Michael Kane, managing director of Business Post, an express delivery
service that operates throughout most of the UK, says he would like to
opportunity to compete against the Post Office, which could remain a
nationalised monopoly under this option.
However, since the Post Office is so big, Mr Kane suggests that private
operators be given the exclusive right to offer the same service at the same
price in different regions across the country. The Post Office would then
face competition from a range of private operators. But no one private
postal service would compete against another.
The most striking feature about the four options is that they all envisage a
regulated market with restrictions on the right to compete with the Post
Office. From the point of view of the private postal operators, competition
is only good if it is limited enough to enable them to make a healthy
profit. Similarly, the Post Office management hopes to buy a letters
monopoly if it should acquire the service.
The Post Office letters monopoly is at the heart of the debate - this is
where its profits lie. TNT is unlikely to remain interested in privatisation
if the Post Office loses its letters monopoly; Securicor Omega would like to
do all the collecting and transporting of mail; Business Post wants the
exclusive right to compete with the Post Office in a given part of the
country; and the corporation's managers do not expect the threshold of their
Pounds 1 letters monopoly to be reduced lower than 50p.
Yet Mr Heseltine has reiterated the government's commitment to the proposals
in the Citizen's Charter on the Post Office, which suggested lowering the
monopoly on letters under Pounds 1 to a level closer to the price of a
first-class stamp, currently 24p.
This commitment poses a dilemma for the secretary. If he introduces
unfettered competition, then it would be unlikely that the private sector
operators would be interested in privatisation; if he keeps the monopoly
more or less intact, then he would have broken a government pledge.
Mr Pat Lupo, chairman and chief executive of DHL, the international courier
company based in Brussels, agrees that the Post Office only looks attractive
to potential bidders because it is a nationalised monopoly. Apart from its
letters monopoly, Mr Lupo says the Post Office benefits from other
privileges inherent in being a nationalised company. He cites the example of
Customs. Packages sent by nationalised postal offices throughout Europe are
not subject to the same rules as the private operators, which are required
to fill in longer custom forms.
'We would welcome the opportunity to compete on an equal basis,' says Mr
Lupo.
Mr Heseltine is no doubt aware that he has a difficult balancing act to
perform. It may be possible to sell the Post Office and introduce some
competition. But if he tilts too far in favour of competition he may find
himself with a very short queue of buyers.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: German rivals would see ICI demerger argument as
spurious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr RAZEEN SALLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Before we are carried away on the wings of City euphoria in the wake of
the ICI announcement ('ICI sets out radical plan to split its operations',
July 31), it may be instructive to compare ICI with the international
chemical industry's pace-setters, Hoechst, Bayer and BASF. For them, the
argument - used by Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, to justify the
demerger - of having separate technologies catering for discrete, bounded
product lines, is spurious. They are intent on reaping economies of scope
(the diffusion of generic technologies, of management expertise and
vocational skills, across broad product ranges and production processes).
They also seek scale to leverage competitive advantage.
There is little evidence of their diversifying into unrelated product areas;
rather they penetrate the spectrum of the chemical sector, with the crucial
proviso that relevant organisational capabilities and massive financial
resources be seen through to successful product commercialisation.
Also of prime importance to them is to build up long-term, stable and solid
relationships with a range of 'stakeholders', not only Mittelstand suppliers
and clients, but also unions, works councils, chambers of commerce,
universities, research institutes, industry associations and public
authorities. Such links are a means of reducing 'transaction costs' (to use
the economic jargon) in creating and improving advantage, particularly in
upgrading human capital within the firm and in diffusing technology.
Hoechst, Bayer and BASF have organisational capacities and financial
resources to add value across the span of the chemical sector, and they are
embedded as science-based manufacturing firms in the conducive environment
of Germany's social market economy.
ICI's financial weakness has led it to a strategic change of direction that
is heavily reliant on short-term, reductionist financial criteria. Given its
current competitive problems, the decision taken may well be the least-worst
option available to it for the longer term.
Finally, one has to bear in mind the external constraints of this policy
choice: shareholder pressure and a British home base that leaves much to be
desired for technology-driven large industrial firms. Razeen Sally,

FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Abbey National house sales plan has flawed basis,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEVEN ROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Compared with West Germany, France, the US and Switzerland, the UK has
an unhealthy proportion of properties in owner occupation. In the last 20
years, the government's stance on home ownership - not to mention its
attempt to turn Britain into a nation of speculators in stocks and shares -
has been responsible for helping fuel inflation and encouraging a
something-for-nothing mentality.
Although it is difficult to see an easy short-term answer to the problems in
the housing market, a healthy private rented sector is clearly vital to the
long-term financial health of the UK.
Via the business Expansion Scheme, the government has addressed the supply
side of the problem by giving generous tax incentives to encourage private
landlords. But there has been little positive action to try and make
long-term renting more socially acceptable and via 'right to buy' and 'rent
to mortgage schemes', the government still encourages the damaging
Thatcherite ethos of home ownership for all - at all costs.
Encouraging more people to become capitalists may be a sound ideological
concept for a Conservative government - but the long-term effect of this
policy can only be the erosion of the work ethic. A nation of Sids may look
good on the drawing board - but I have my doubts about what it will do for
the balance of payments.

<TEXT>
Sir, Abbey is getting into bad habits by wishing to throw money at the
housing problem. The housing market's overriding problem is oversupply.
Homes are no different from any other abundant commodity in experiencing a
price fall. Sideline the incidental problems; the basic cause of the malaise
is too many vendors chasing too few buyers.
A remedy is to regulate supply. Since this will not happen naturally, a
capital gains tax on all homes sold within the first five years of
occupation would produce this effect. Exceptions could be made to cover
essential sales caused by job relocation, down-sizing on retirement or
redundancy, and for moves to cover the expansion of a family by birth or by
accommodating an elderly or dependant relative. Terry Blocksidge,

Sir, Abbey National's proposal to revive the UK housing market would
encourage a further cycle of house price inflation, as seen in the mid- and
late-1980s. This is irresponsible.
To prevent the misery and costs of repossessions is another matter, which
would be best served by the introduction of a means-tested housing benefit
for owner-occupiers. It should be available for a limited period of, say,
five years (with a less generous scheme available thereafter) and be
financed in total or in part by the phasing-out of mortgage interest tax
relief - in conjunction with falling interest rates, I would hope.

Sir, Surely what is required by the housing market is not an incentive to
sell to obtain tax relief as proposed by Abbey National but an incentive to
buy in the form of the reintroduction of higher rate relief for mortgage
interest and the raising of the Pounds 30,000 Miras cap on standard rate tax
relief.
It is the buyer who requires financial assistance over the term of the
mortgage to encourage him to take on additional borrowings, particularly at
a time of high real rates of interest.

Sir, Houses are a commodity, with several hundred thousand a year being
either built or coming on to the market as a result of the death of the
owner.
Until this fact is realised and house prices drop to a point that reflects
the cost of building without any allowance for the site cost, then the house
market will continue to stagnate.
The site value is limited to any alternative use - which in the case of
farming would represent less than Pounds 100 per plot.

Sir, Has Abbey National lost sight of the fact that houses are for living
in? The days of houses simply being profit centres are gone. If the British
consumer now wishes to live in his/her home for a period of years rather
than months, then that is for the better.
During the late 1980s we endured the peaking of a speculative bubble that
had been gradually inflating since the early 1970s. Unfortunately some
lenders, when given a free reign, have run riot and the 1990s will be a
sombre consequence of this.
The government does not ask for taxes on the profits made on residential
property; is it fair, therefore, to seek credits when those profits are not
realised.

   From Mr PHILIP BEDOS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Abbey National's proposal to revive the housing market ('House sales
boost urged as prices fall further', August 4) is flawed in terms of cost
and of long-term economic prudence.
The current housing malaise is caused by deep-rooted problems within the UK
economy - exacerbated by excessive borrowings to finance home purchases in
the 1980s. It will not be solved by implementing short-term palliatives.
The scheme is flawed because:
Insisting that home-owners reinvest their tax credit in property is unlikely
materially to reduce the level of debt in each household and therefore
unlikely to improve confidence and consumer spending;
Even if all 375,000 home-owners with 'negative equity' were to use the
scheme it is doubtful that it would stimulate the housing market
sufficiently to offset the dampening effect caused by record repossessions;
It is manifestly unfair that particular individuals, no matter how
distressed, should enjoy a free option funded by the taxpayer;
The recession may finally persuade the public that home ownership is not a
one-way bet and act as a brake preventing the speculation of the 1980s.
Hopefully this would persuade individuals to release savings for productive
investment; As Lex (August 4) rightly contends, effectively underwriting
loans would improve the quality of the lender's assets, but it would also
improve the credit-worthiness of those lenders. This would allow these
lenders to raise capital more cheaply than they might otherwise deserve to
the detriment of other issuers. Surely this government would not wish to be
a party to such a distortion in the markets?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM JOHNSTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, August 6) has missed a fundamental
point in his discussion. Probably, of more concern to most retailers is the
issue of the Uniform Business Rate (UBR) which will contribute more to
inflationary pressures in the short term than the upwards- only rent review.
The tax has been particularly onerous to retailers who have suffered most
due to the distortions created by an overdue revaluation which occurred in
1988. As a result, tenants are having to pay rates calculated on rental
values close to the peak of the market. When the tax was introduced in 1990,
in order to soften the blow, the increase in rates was restricted to a rise
of 20 per cent per annum. Therefore, many occupiers are having to suffer an
annual increase in their fixed costs due to the phasing-in of the tax.
In addition, every business occupier in the country - not only retailers -
will suffer an annual increase in their rates bill geared to the rise in the
rate in the pound multiplier which is indexed. There is no respite until
1995 when the next revaluation is instituted based on 1993 rents. However,
all this will do is iron out additional regional distortions created by the
property crash. The rate in the pound will still be indexed to the RPI and
set annually.
At least those stuck with upward only rent reviews reviled in 1988 will be
guaranteed that their next review in 1993 will not increase due to the
collapse of the market. They will not have to consider a rental increase
until at least 1998. In real terms rents will have fallen and many occupiers
will be facing lease expiries allowing them to enter into more adaptable
leases.
Therefore, I put it to you, which is more inflationary?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Flemming, the energetic chief economist of Jacques Attali's European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is not the first officer to jump
ship. But he is the most senior, and his planned return to a less turbulent
academic life will leave a nasty hole at the top of the two-year-old
institution.
Flemming's decision to join the EBRD less than two years ago did much to
establish its credibility in the City. He had been number four in the Bank
of England hierarchy and during his six years as chief economist had done
much to increase the Bank's standing in the economics profession.
Admittedly, his departure from the EBRD is still some way off. But it sounds
as if the 51-year-old economist is going to be the next warden of Wadham
College, Oxford.
Statistician Sir Claus Moser, who has been warden since 1984, will reach the
normal retirement age of 70 in a few months time, and a straw poll of dons
has already decided in Flemming's favour. A formal election will take place
during the coming academic year and Flemming could be in his new job by
October 1993.
Flemming - one of the UK's brainiest economists - was an undergraduate at
Trinity College, has studied and taught at Nuffield and Oriel, and still
lives in Oxford.
Given that Wadham is not one of the richer Oxford colleges, Flemming is
likely to spend a good deal of his time on the fund-raising for the college
and free-lancing on his own account.

The SDU, often ridiculed as a last resort for the Single, Desperate and

married and producing bright children. The unit, which organises cruises and
tea dances where graduates can get to know each other, now has 13,000 single
graduate members compared with 1,000 when it started.
In 1984 only 704 Singapore graduate couples tied the knot. Last year there

there was a stigma attached to it,' says deputy director Susan Chua. It even
sports a new nickname Single, Desirable and Unattached . . .

Why is it that some big companies are so reluctant to publish the age of
their directors and how long they have been on the board? Surely
shareholders shouldn't have to turn up at the agm just to check whether
their representatives are in their forties or their eighties.
Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, is one blue-chip company, which maintains a
discreet silence on the subject. No wonder its annual report doesn't win the
same accolades as its merchandise. Lord Forte, an executive director and
chairman of Britain's largest hotelier, is in his 84th year and has been a
director for over 50 years, although you couldn't tell it from his company's
annual report. Nor can you tell whether Forte's board is packed with young
turks or elderly time servers.
By contrast, Land Securities, one of the few solid pillars in the property
world, makes no secret of the fact that one of its directors, 78-year-old
Richard Caine, has been on its board since 1948. Old men have their uses,
and Land Secs deserves to be congratulated for its openness in reporting its
affairs.
Meanwhile, Observer offers a bottle of finest malt to anyone (Forte
directors excepted) who can prove that they are the longest-serving director
of a FT-SE 100 company.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: Excellence on the small stage - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PLAYS in London this month are worth seeing as an illustration of how
technically excellent the small stage has become. They are Seven Doors by
the German writer, Botho Strauss, at The Gate, and Porcelain by a
Singaporean writer, Chay Yew, at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs.
On the face of it, the two pieces could not be more different. Seven Doors
is very German abstract, with references to Faust, and hops about all over
the place, including hell. Porcelain is an investigative documentary about a
homosexual murder in a public lavatory in Bethnal Green. Technique brings
them together.
Both productions use casts where people play more than one part - not
particularly for reasons of an economy, but as a deliberate style. In the
programme for Porcelain, indeed, only one actor is listed against a specific
part. That is Daniel York as John Lee, the young Hong King Chinese student
who commits the murder and plays only himself throughout. All four other
actors are named simply as voices and take on whatever role is appropriate:
police officer, television interviewer and so on.
The Gate, as so often, is ambitious about the staging, despite having one of
the smallest available spaces in London theatre. David Farr's direction of
Seven Doors has a cast of 10. Sometimes they appear all at once without
falling over each other. Moreover, this relatively large cast does not
preclude an effective and frequently changing set. The seven doors of the
title are not always in the same place, yet there is still no impression of
overcrowding. There is also some dramatic use of lighting and colour.
The same goes for Glen Goei's and Stephen Knight's direction of Porcelain,
which is played almost entirely in black and white. One notably harrowing
scene is played in the dark with only the voices heard, and is all the
better for such restraint.
There are other similarities. Botho Strauss and Chay Yew both have a
fascination with television. Seven Doors picks up a television quiz show and
there are frequent scenes of characters being interviewed. Much of Porcelain
develops as though it were a documentary for Channel 4. I do not find this
simply derivative; it is the playwrights' acknowledgement that television is
a very power influence, whether revealing or distorting.
Quite apart from the technical excellence and the high standing of acting,
the two pieces have a high level of seriousness. Porcelain is one of the few
modern plays that I have seen which does not seek to blame crime on the
police. Indeed, the police officer, when interviewed, is studiously neutral
and fair. He says that he thought he detected a look of mourning on the face
of the presumed killer.
It is also hard to say whether Porcelain is more about homosexuality, race
or just plain loneliness. This is a compliment. Any play which manages to
bring off such a mixture of themes deserves to be praised. In the young
Asian it adds a new voice: a clever man who is about to go to Cambridge, but
has not adjusted to the society around him. Daniel York's performance is
outstanding; so is that of the unnamed Cambridge psychiatrist who talks to
him in prison. And whatever you may think of the subject, it is immaculately
handled.
Seven Doors is about loneliness, too: more particularly, the difference
between supposed extraordinary and ordinary people. There is a splendid
scene when the inventor of a video machine that records dreams has committed
suicide and arrived on the 'other side'. Hell turns out to be exceedingly
boring. Among all the excellent playing, I would single out Barry Wallman
who plays a Mephistophelean figure called simply The Void. The whole piece
is haunting. Between them the two plays tell you a great deal about modern
theatre.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: A triumphant Semiramide brings the house down -
Rossini Opera Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM WEAVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S Rossini bicentenary has been an occasion for rejoicing
everywhere, but hardcore Rossinians have been keeping an eye on Pesaro, the
composer's birthplace, to see how its pace-setting Rossini Opera Festival
and its parent organization, the Rossini Foundation, would celebrate the
important anniversary.
The 1992 festival opened with new productions of The Barber of Seville and
Semiramide, along with exhibitions, publications, and promise of more music
to come. In other words, Pesaro is joyfully doing its duty by the composer
who brought glory to the city and also - practical man that he was - made
the city heir to his sizeable fortune (which underwrites the Foundation).
The opening night Barber was, sad to say, a sore disappointment and high
hopes were dashed. High, because in theory this production should have been
particularly interesting: shunning the big-name stars associated with
earlier festivals, the artistic direction called on young, almost unknown
artists and engaged a conductor, Paolo Carignani, still at the outset of his
career. To stage the work, they chose the veteran Luigi Squarzina; but this,
too, was an unconventional choice, for Squarzina is most admired for his
serious work, and humour is not his long suit.
It is not the conductor's, either. He and Squarzina deliberately set out to
present a Barber shorn of traditional gags and grimaces; actually, Squarzina
made up some gags of his own and trotted out some hoary stage action.
Obviously a fine musician, Carignani led the RAI Orchestra of Turin with
sober accuracy and delicacy, but absolutely without sparkle. Coupled with
Squarzina's heavy, unspontaneous staging, this approach spelled disaster,
especially as the singers lacked a sustaining familiarity with their roles.
The obtrusive, inappropriate sets of Giovanni Agostinucci (Bartolo's study
transformed into the Bologna anatomy theatre) contributed to the oppression.
Nevertheless, Roberto Frontali (recently admired as Rodrigo in a Genoa Don
Carlos) sang with style and indicated a roguish wit, still to be developed.
Bruce Ford, not in his best form, was an acceptable Almaviva, though he
relied too much on pianissimo singing. So did some of the others: Maurizio
Picconi's Bartolo was often inaudible. Giovanni Furlanetto, lanky,
sharp-faced, seems born to sing Basilio and will surely grow into the part:
this was a dry run. Whether or not Lola Casariego will ever be a real Rosina
is hard to say; the evidence in Pesaro was surely negative. The voice is
unreliable at top and bottom, and the style was mannered, superficial, all
smirks and flounces, with no hint of the real character so clearly defined
in the music.
After this experience, the audience approached Semiramide with
understandable apprehension: over four hours of music in the inhospitable
Sports Palace, with singers unknown and a young producer.
What ensued was one of the most exciting evenings that Pesaro has vouchsafed
in recent years. The veteran scholar-conductor Alberto Zedda (who
collaborated on the edition) knows and - more important - feels every note
of the score. He neither dawdled nor sped, but let the long, complex numbers
unfold at their proper pace; the singers were not indulged, nor were they
prodded. Fortunately, all of them displayed an excellent sense of tempo and
a real dramatic skill.
The Georgian soprano Iano Tamar was an unusual Semiramide: not the lighter
coloratura we are used to, but a genuine dramatic soprano capable of
remarkable agility. As Arsace, Gloria Scalchi (who made a stunning
impression a couple of years ago in Ricciardo e Zoraide) confirmed her
position as a valuable addition to the Rossinian ranks.
But the great triumph of this production was Michele Pertusi's Assur: a
flexible, dark bass voice, accompanied by penetrating dramatic skill. His
'mad scene' towards the end of the opera brought down the house (and the
Palazzo dello Sport is quite a house to bring down). Gregory Kunde, a
relatively new Rossini tenor, with a sweeter voice than most in that
category, turned Idreno into a major figure; and the even smaller part of
Oroe was masterfully interpreted by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo, another Pesaro
debutant of great promise.
The musical success was parallelled by the overwhelming success of the
production: director and designer was Hugo De Ana, who made his Italian
debut in 1990 with a Rossini opera (Mos) in Bologna.
He filled the vast stage with supers, dancers, mingling with the chorus in a
pageant that was always meaningful, apposite and uncluttered. The soldiers
really looked fierce; the zealots created authentic tension. The gestures of
the singers were hieratic, inhuman, on a larger-than-life scale; and yet the
more private scenes found the characters equally convincing as their extreme
emotions were laid bare. There was an Oriental quality about the costumes -
sometimes suggesting Siam, or even Bali - and also about the acting:
entrances were commanding in the manner of Kabuki. The monumental sets
enhanced this splendid, awesome dimension. And the final tableau, a
light-hearted scene of the reaping of grain, set the seal on the
celebration.
Visitors to the festival, unless they want to spend their days on the beach
or in excursions into the lovely hills behind the city, can pleasantly pass
some hours in the Museo Civico, where the rooms have been rearranged to show
off to advantage the several dozen pictures Pesaro inherited from Rossini.
Or, they can visit the handsome Palazzo Montani Antaldi, newly restored,
which houses a commemorative Rossini exhibition, rich in unfamiliar
treasures or in new juxtapositions of familiar ones. The curator, Mauro
Bucarelli, has assembled hundreds of items - autographs, portraits, personal
objects (even one of the composer's wigs) and albums - to create a picture
not only or Rossini but of an age. The catalogue will remain a permanent,
indispensable contribution to Rossini scholarship.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Sharp drop in business overdrafts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of small businesses with bank overdrafts has dropped sharply
during the past year as the cost of borrowing continues to be seen as a
serious constraint, according to a survey of Institute of Directors members
in England.
Only 52 per cent of small businesses now borrow from banks - 17 per cent of
those surveyed said they had paid off their overdrafts during the past 12
months. The reduced borrowing mirrors the repayment of debt in the household
sector, the institute says.
Small businesses in the south were more likely to have paid off their bank
overdrafts than those in the north, according to the survey. A total of 7
per cent of businesses in the north cleared their bank debts, compared with
20 per cent in the south.
The use of overdrafts was also linked to the size of the company and the
sector in which it operated, the report says. Companies with medium
turnover, particularly in agriculture, property and construction, were the
most likely to have continued borrowing from banks.
Although half of small companies consider the cost of overdrafts to be a
serious business difficulty, relatively few were being charged excessive
margins of interest over the base rate, the survey shows.
The institute decided to carry out the research after complaints from
members that banks were charging high margins and failing to pass on
base-rate cuts. A random sample of members whose companies employ fewer than
100 workers was interviewed.
Just over half of those surveyed were being charged 1 to 2 percentage points
above base rates at the time of the survey in late July, with 39 per cent
paying 3 to 4 points above base rate. Overall, 90 per cent paid 4 percentage
points or less above base rate on their business overdraft.
Again, there were substantial regional variations: 79 per cent of businesses
in the north paid 1 to 2 points above base rate while in the south only 44
per cent enjoyed such low margins, the research found.
A quarter of those surveyed reported that they had not had reductions in the
base rate passed on to them in the form of lower interest rates, with a
slight bias towards those in the north having reductions, the research
found.
Overdraft facilities were reduced during the year for 16 per cent of those
businesses questioned. Top justifications given by banks for the reductions
were: reductions in the value of property used as security for the loan, and
lack of take-up of the existing facility.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Northern recovery held back by south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE north-west of England and north Wales are experiencing tentative
improvements in economic activity but the depressed south-east is holding
back recovery. Those are the findings of regional surveys by chambers of
commerce in Manchester and Liverpool, and the latest Lloyds Bank Economic
Bulletin.
Prospects in the service sector in the north of England have been improving
for five successive quarters. Manchester chamber for the first time in two
years reported more service companies taking on labour than shedding it.
Low levels of spending in the still relative wealthy south-east, though, are
preventing a national recovery and restraining the investment plans of
northern companies.
In the Manchester chamber's region, manufacturers' investment intentions
moved into positive balance - more planning to increase investment than
decrease - but were still in negative balance and declining in Merseyside's
catchment area.
Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of Liverpool chamber, warned: 'Nearly half our
firms are still reducing investment in new plant and machinery. This will be
disastrous for future prosperity unless the trend is reversed.'
The north of England has suffered less than the south in the recession,
correcting much of the growth of inequality in income levels between the
regions.
Incomes per head in the south-east have fallen relative to the national
average to levels not seen for 10 years, said Mr Patrick Foley, Lloyds
Bank's chief economic adviser.
He said, however, that south-east incomes remain 15 per cent higher than the
national average, and the region is still best placed to lead Britain out of
recession. 'The south-east has the most confident consumers and has also
seen the largest adjustment in the overheated housing market. The region
seems set to lead the recovery when it happens.'
The northern surveys suggest that confidence is rising in all sectors except
the building industry. Manufacturers are struggling with a flat UK market,
but more are reporting rising export sales than a decline.
The chambers cover an area with more than 7m people from the Lake District
to mid Wales, accounting for more than 10 per cent of UK gross domestic
product. The surveys, of second-quarter trends, involved 930 companies
employing more than 150,000 people.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Paper hopes go through the shredder: How Continental 'green'
laws are hampering recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Williams, chief executive of David S. Smith, the company that
collects and recycles almost a quarter of the UK's waste paper, says he is
watching his industry 'go down the pan'.
In recent months he has campaigned vigorously to air his concerns about the
deteriorating competitiveness of the UK paper packaging industry. He argues
that the deterioration stems not from the recession but from environmental
legislation introduced by several countries in mainland Europe - most
notably Germany.
A glut of cheap waste paper across the Channel has enabled Continental
recycling companies to obtain their raw materials more cheaply than their
counterparts in the UK (see graph). That allows them significantly to
undercut David S. Smith's prices.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in April,
Mr Williams urged the government to take action to address a situation of
'crisis proportions'.
He warned that the profitability of the industry had plunged, capacity was
being cut, and - in contrast to all other European countries - the UK's
paper recycling rate was actually falling.
If nothing is done, he predicts that the industry will shrink by up to 20
per cent by the end of the decade, with the balance of trade being Pounds
1bn to the worse. Moreover, the government's target of recycling 25 per cent
of all household waste by the year 2000 would be unattainable because of
lack of capacity, he told Mr Heseltine in a subsequent meeting.
Such talk may sound alarmist, but others echo his concerns. Mr Bryan
Bateman, director of business and the environment at the British Paper and
Board Industry Federation, the trade body, says: 'The problems affecting
this particular sector arise because of the singularities of the German
legislation and the differences in raw-material prices that the respective
countries now enjoy.
'Corresponding legislative thrusts in France and Holland have mitigated the
effects in their countries. But there is no desire or capability to have
similar legislation in the UK.'
Although other sectors of the packaging industry have felt ripples from the
stone that the Germans have thrown into the recycling pond, the UK paper
industry is particularly vulnerable because of its dependence on recycled
materials to sustain its competitiveness.
In the 1960s and 1970s, large parts of the UK paper industry were destroyed
by their general uncompetitiveness against the large-scale Nordic
manufacturers.
Then after extensive rationalisation and investment, the industry recovered
strongly through the 1980s and was greatly helped by tapping into a cheap
source of recycled materials from Britain's 'urban forests'.
Almost 60 per cent of the 5m tonnes of paper and board produced in the UK
each year now uses recycled paper - a far higher utilisation rate than in
almost every other industrialised country. But because the UK imports
another 4m tonnes of paper each year, its recycling rate as a proportion of
total consumption is only 33 per cent - one of the lowest in Europe.
Mr Bateman argues that the UK could realistically collect another 1m tonnes
of paper a year but that the recycling rate can be substantially increased
only by expanding manufacturing capacity. 'But that means increasing
investment which can only be funded by generating profitability in a stable
market,' he says.
One example of how difficult it can be to plan substantial investment
programmes is provided by SCA, the Swedish paper company, which is
contemplating investing about Pounds 250m in a newsprint mill, using
recycled paper, at Aylesford in Kent.
SCA's calculations are complicated by disagreements over proposed government
subsidies, a surge of imports of cheap Canadian newsprint manufactured from
virgin pulp - diverted from US markets because of state environmental
regulations stipulating set percentages for recycled materials in newspapers
 -and the prospect of four German newsprint mills due to start production
soon. They will soak up surplus local recycled paper.
Such investments would be aided if the UK were to follow the German route
and in effect force local authorities and industry to collect a greater
proportion of waste for re-use. That would have the effect of reducing
prices for raw materials, guaranteeing a reliable source of supply, enabling
investment decisions to be taken within a stable framework and allowing the
UK industry to compete on level terms with Continental competitors.
However, the UK government shows no signs of doing any such thing. It
harbours serious misgivings about the environmental impact of the German
system, arguing that more energy is consumed in collecting materials than is
recovered from recycling them. Ideologically it also prefers market-based
solutions to legislative or administrative ones. It is contemplating what
incentives it could introduce.
Some industry observers suggest that raising the costs of tipping recyclable
materials in landfill sites or imposing a levy on packaging products to
subsidise recycling schemes would have beneficial effects. Others propose
removing value added tax from recycled products to encourage greater
consumer demand - although it is unlikely that the Treasury would approve.
Whatever it decides, the government will have to act soon. A recent survey
by Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, of 402
waste-collection authorities in England and Wales estimated that the
recycling rate for all household waste is just 4.4 per cent, up from 2.6 per
cent the year before, but below the government's estimates in the 1990
environment white paper.
The group commented that most local authorities would find it
near-impossible to achieve the government's suggested 25 per cent recycling
rate because of a lack of end markets for recycled materials. It urged the
government to tip the balance in favour of recycling by introducing a
national waste strategy.
Unless the government does so, Mr Williams is fearful for the future of the
recycling industry.
'The impact of the German environmental legislation has been to give the
German paper industry a significant cost/price advantage over the UK
industry through indirect subsidies,' he says. 'The situation is really
quite incredible. The German industry will move ahead while the British
industry will be devastated.'

FT  10 AUG 92 / Tory MPs warn on council tax valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPs and local authorities are concerned that valuations of
properties for the council tax, which will replace the poll tax, may provoke
resentment and a mass of appeals next year. This is because they are based
on two-year-old valuations, without any allowance for the decline in
property prices since then.
The concern is greatest in London, where the drop has been steepest. Sir
Rhodes Boyson, the Tory MP for Brent North and a former local-government
minister, warned yesterday that householders in London and the south-east
would feel 'betrayed' if their first council tax bill in April comes to
significantly more than their poll tax.
He urged the government to send civil servants to 'individual streets' to
compare next year's likely bill with what people are paying this year.
If people are going to be faced with larger bills, then the government 'may
again be walking off the cliff-end' as it did with the community charge, he
warned.
The timing of the change was also unfortunate, he said, coming during 'a
major recession' when 'people are battling to survive'. Because of the price
of property, the council tax would 'disadvantage seriously' those who live
in London and the south-east.
For council-tax purposes, properties are being allocated to one of eight
bands by their estimated value in April 1991. The tax payable will rise from
Pounds 361 a year for properties in the lowest band (properties valued up to
Pounds 40,000) to Pounds 1,078 for those in the top band (payable for
properties valued at more than Pounds 320,000).
Homeowners will have a right of appeal against the valuation of their
properties, but the Department of the Environment insists that appeals will
not be allowed on the basis of price falls since April 1991. Since
properties in London and the south-east, which will fall disproportionately
among the higher-value bands, have suffered the greatest losses in the past
two years, the number of aggrieved taxpayers is likely to be considerable.
Sir Rhodes urged the government either to introduce a separate set of bands
to take account of higher property values in London and the south-east, or
to put London properties in a band lower than that appropriate to their
value.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Councils 'fail to exploit' volunteers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities are failing to exploit volunteers as a resource in
developing their community care programmes, according to Community Service
Volunteers, a charity that organises voluntary effort.
A survey by the charity of half of all local authorities in England and
Wales found that in spite of rising demand for community carers, only 14 per
cent of councils had a clear strategy for recruiting and deploying
volunteers. Barely two thirds even consider volunteers. The charity noted
that although all authorities mention the voluntary sector in their plans,
many refer only to services bought in from professionals employed by
voluntary organisations.
The charity reports an increase of nearly a third in the number of young
people putting themselves forward under the organisation's full-time
volunteer scheme. A recent survey by the organisation showed that up to 50
per cent of older people would give time for organised voluntary work if
they were asked.
Ms Elisabeth Hoodless, director of the charity, said: 'Councils should
develop clear strategies for involving volunteers - a flexible,
cost-effective and highly motivated resource.'

FT  10 AUG 92 / Further housing price fall forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES will continue to fall at least until the middle of next year
and delay economic recovery, according to a report by Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank.
Falls in house prices will continue to be concentrated in the southern
regions, Morgan Grenfell says. It expects house prices over the whole of the
UK to fall by 2.5 per cent next year but by 4.5 per cent in the south-east.
Scotland and the north may see a rise in nominal prices next year.
Housing turnover will remain low until prices stabilise, depressing spending
on consumer durables, the report argues. Housing turnover has fallen to
80,000 a month this year, down from a peak of 200,000 a month in August
1987. The number of first-time buyers entering the market this year has
fallen by a third since 1987 to 300,000.
Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The weak housing market
is a major drag on the economy and it will hamper economic recovery.'
Morgan Grenfell says further falls in house prices will compound the burdens
of heavy debts and high interest rates facing many homeowners. Lower house
values will increase the number of homeowners with a mortgage debt that
exceeds the value of their house. It estimates the number of households in
that position will increase by 500,000 this year to 1.5m.
The number of households that cannot meet mortgage payments at current
interest rates is expected to rise with a further 70,000 house repossessions
this year against an estimated 75,000 last year.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Private post operators may win local licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering a plan to allow private postal operators to
bid for licences to compete with the Post Office in different regions. The
move is part of the government's review of the organisation of the Post
Office.
Ministers are not expected to make a decision until the end of the year and
the licences plan is the most radical under consideration.
The Post Office's letters division, Royal Mail, has a monopoly on delivering
all letters with postage costs of less than Pounds 1. Business Post, an
express delivery service company which submitted the proposal, would like to
offer a comprehensive letter service in part of the UK.
Because of the size of the Post Office - it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
247m for the year to March 29 this year - Business Post believes that
private operators should be given the opportunity to compete in different
parts of the UK. Under its plan, private operators would bid for the
franchise to compete exclusively with the Post Office in northern England,
for example. No private postal operator would set up a rival service in an
area where another private company was operating.
Mr Michael Kane, managing director of Business Post, said: 'No private
postal operator can compete effectively with the Post Office throughout the
UK. But there would be plenty of companies which could compete with the Post
Office in certain regional areas.'
He has already had talks with officials from the Department of Trade and
Industry and plans further meetings. He said: 'The DTI appear very keen on
our idea and are scheduled to come to our offices to see how it could work.'
The DTI says it is considering all proposals.
Business Post's plan also envisages the creation of an independent regulator
that would introduce competition progressively.
Mr Kane proposes the gradual introduction of competition along the same
lines as the telecommunications industry, where licences are issued for an
initial period to private operators who satisfy certain conditions.
He says he realises that the conditions would have to include compulsory
services to rural areas, but that would present no obstacle to those already
operating parcel-delivery services to such areas.
Since the Post Office cross-subsidises deliveries to these non-profitable
regions with the surplus from the profitable urban areas, Mr Kane says he
believes there is no reason why private operators should not be able to do
the same.

The object is to enable claimants to apply for a range of benefits in the
same place. It is also designed to make it more difficult to defraud the
system - fraud costs the department millions of pounds a year.
Mr Lilley has also been considering allowing the Benefits Agency staff to
offer clear advice on which benefits to claim to ensure that maximum
entitlements are known to the claimants.
At present, claimants have to fill out different forms for different
benefits, often repeatedly having to give the same details.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Copyright fears for address database
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Mail is worried that draft legislation approved earlier this year
by the European Commission will strip its Postal Address File - the official
list of UK postcodes - of its copyright protection, David Owen writes.
Ironically, the draft directive is intended to provide protection for
producers of databases. It would outlaw unfair copying of the contents of
databases such as computerised address lists for 10 years.
But lists such as the file, which have been in existence for more than 10
years, would not benefit from this protection. Meanwhile, UK regulations -
which unusually already give copyright protection to the type of database
covered by the directive - would cease to apply.
The Royal Mail is concerned that adoption of the directive - part of a
growing body of agreed or draft EC legislation on intellectual property  -
would undermine Britain's position of having arguably the best protection
for databases among EC states.
It has been advised that the proposed legislation may actually put British
database owners in a worse position than their European counterparts because
of the strength of the laws on unfair competition that apply in other
countries.
In the year to March, the list generated some Pounds 2m of revenue for Royal
Mail, whose pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 266m. The organisation, which the
government is considering selling, handles 61m letters a day.

FT  10 AUG 92 / London homes boost expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of homes to be provided by housing associations for London's
growing population of homeless, needy, disadvantaged and disabled is
expected to rise by a third in 1993-94, according to plans due to be
announced today by the Housing Corporation.
Increased spending by housing associations has provided one of the few
bright spots in an otherwise depressed UK housing scene. During the three
months to the end of April, associations in Britain started work on 7,600
homes - 55 per cent more than during the corresponding period last year.
Grants to associations have risen sharply, as part of government plans for
them to take over the local authorities' role as the main providers of
social housing.
There have been fears, however, that housing association budgets might be
restricted as the government seeks to exert greater control over rising
public expenditure generally.
A great deal of attention, therefore, is expected to be paid to minimum
spending targets for 1993-94 for London and the Home Counties. Those are due
to be announced today by the Housing Corporation, which administers
public-sector grants to housing associations.
The corporation is expected to set a provisional target of 12,000 new homes
for the region. That compares with a target of 9,000 in the current
financial year.
To cover the costs, the corporation is expected to announce that it will
invest a minimum of Pounds 635m, of which Pounds 463m will be spent in the
London boroughs.
Housing associations will be expected to raise additional finance from
private investors. About 20 per cent of the associations' funds in London
and the Home Counties comes from private investors, mostly from building
societies and the mortgage-lending arms of banks.
The majority of the new homes will go to homeless families. About 12 per
cent of funds will be set aside to support associations representing black
and other ethnic minorities. Black families are four times as likely to be
homeless as their white counterparts, according to the London boroughs.
Funds will also be set aside to help the elderly and disabled, as well as
for special schemes to assist people to buy their own homes under
shared-ownership arrangements.
The number of homes built by housing associations in Britain as a whole is
expected to rise from 27,000 to more than 40,000 during the 12 months to the
end of March next year.
The estimated cost of the homes is Pounds 8bn, of which Pounds 1.5bn is
expected to come from private investors.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Cruise liners steer clear of recession reefs: It is mainly
plain sailing in a buoyant industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QE2 may have been holed at the weekend but the cruising holiday industry
shows no signs of coming to grief.
On Friday the ship hit an unidentified underwater obstacle off the US east
coast and was last night heading under its own power to a dry dock in Boston
for repairs.
The QE2 is due for a complete refit in November so the stay in Boston will
only be for emergency 'patching up' work.
Members of the Department of Transport's Marine Accident Investigation
Branch have flown out to join the US investigators into the incident. They
will try to discover how the vessel hit a submerged object and began taking
on water 10 miles off the Massachusetts coast late on Friday, at the end of
a five-day round-trip cruise from New York to Nova Scotia.
US Coastguards said there was a gash in the side of the ship three to six
inches wide and 74ft long.
The accident has meant the cancellation of two transatlantic crossings for
the QE2, but Cunard said yesterday that the crossing scheduled for August 18
was expected to go ahead.
The QE2 is the largest of seven cruise ships operated by Cunard, a
subsidiary of Trafalgar House.
The Trafalgar House share price has come under increased pressure in recent
weeks. The QE2's mishap is not likely to make the market any happier about
Trafalgar House, but any impact on the share price should be fleeting, as
the liner will be out of service only for a short time.
During the past few months there has been strong speculation that Trafalgar
House would be happy to dispose of the Cunard shipping and hotel business,
including the Ritz Hotel, if a satisfactory price could be achieved.
Cunard has benefited from the increasing popularity in Britain of cruises as
the market has expanded to take in a wider range of customers. The QE2 does
well out of being the best known British cruise liner, and the only one to
provide a more leisurely alternative to transatlantic flights.
Lunn Poly, the tour operator, last week predicted that cruises would
continue to increase in popularity, with fly-cruises dominating the market.
It said: 'The introduction of more modern ships combined with huge
investment in facilities on board means that cruising now appeals to a far
wider age group than ever before.'
Prices are still high enough to keep cruising mostly in the luxury holiday
category, but a growth in shorter cruises of two to five days and some price
cutting have extended cruising's appeal to a slightly younger market than
the traditional wealthy pensioners.
Packaging cruises with a flight or a few days on land has also broadened
their appeal. The majority now start with a flight to a Mediterranean or
Caribbean island so that holidaymakers take advantage of sunshine from the
first day. A 14-day package including a Caribbean cruise and a week's car
hire in Florida can cost as little as Pounds 795.
The UK cruise market grew at about 5 per cent a year during the 1980s, and
in 1990 about 186,000 Britons went on a cruise. North Americans are the core
customers for most lines but about two thirds of Cunard passengers on
Caribbean cruises are British.
The Gulf war had a temporarily depressing effect on the market as Americans
stayed away from Europe and the Mediterranean, but recovery now seems
complete. Industry experts say there is still enormous potential for further
growth and describe the cruise market, without a hint of irony, as
'buoyant'.
In January P&amp;O, one of the largest cruise operators, indicated its optimism
by ordering a new 'superliner' to be based in Europe. The Pounds 200m
contract went to the German shipbuilders Meyer Werft, in Papenburg, and the
ship is due to be delivered in April 1995.
The exact appeal of a cruise holiday is hard to define. Since the 1920s a
cruise has always been associated with luxury, and that remains valid for
most ships today.
Some travel industry insiders say the attraction is in the opportunity for
complete relaxation, with no need to move from a deckchair to get a change
of scene. Younger customers like being able to visit a number of islands in
the course of a holiday without the hassle of getting from one to another.
The security of a liner, where no strange food, unfamiliar currencies or
beach pickpockets can disturb a holidaymaker, is also part of the appeal.
Mr George Law, Cunard's marketing director for the UK and Europe, said the
new, younger type of customer being targeted was likely to be aged about 45
and travelling without children.
A large proportion of cruise passengers still tend to be retired, which has
the effect of making cruising more recession-proof than other sectors of the
tourist industry.
Mr Keith Betton, of the Association of British Travel Agents, says that
cruise operators might actually have benefited from the period of high
interest rates, which tended to restrict spending on standard package
holidays.
He said: 'The sort of people who particularly like going on a cruise are
maybe pensioners, very often people who have not got a mortgage, so they
benefit from having interest earned rather than interest to pay.'
The amount of repeat business has also been good news for operators. Once
customers have tried a cruise holiday, they tend to come back.
About half of the passengers on Cunard's two three-star ships, the Countess
and the Princess, are new to cruising, but on the more luxurious ships the
proportion drops to about 30 per cent.

FT  10 AUG 92 / TV soccer deal fails to trigger sales surge: FT Satellite
Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE dish installations rose by 58,000 in July, almost identical to the
June figure, according to the latest FT satellite monitor.
The figure represents modest underlying growth because sales usually drop in
July compared with June. So far, however, the forthcoming exclusive
satellite television coverage of Premier League football has not translated
into a surge in dish sales.
Although intentions by consumers to install a dish initially rose after the
Premier League deal with the Sky Sports channel, 'the small rate of change
in new installations does not, as yet, show any great conversion of this
interest into sales,' said Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental
Research, which produces the FT monitor.
A big promotional campaign, however, is due to begin later this week.
The 58,000 increase in July takes the total of installations, including BSB
and community aerials but excluding cable networks, to slightly more than
2.6m homes. In July there was a drop in the size of the potential market.
The number of households saying they are in the market for a dish -
definitely or probably - was 2.37m, compared with 2.53m in June and 2.26m in
May.
July's monitor also shows that the interest of the ABC1 social group in
satellite TV at its highest level so far. The core market is still the C2s -
skilled workers with children. The monitor is based on monthly interviews
with more than 4,000 adults.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB,
which broadcasts Sky Sports.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Building societies' performance praised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth-largest building society by asset size,
kept its place last year as the industry's star performer in the UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew building society league table.
The report by the securities house says that in spite of wide variations in
their profitability last year, the top 20 UK building societies are still
performing well in the worst housing market recession since the Second World
War.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester easily outperformed the rest of the industry on 10
out of 12 financial indicators selected for the report.
They included an extremely low cost base, with management expenses running
at only 26 per cent of its total income; a much higher than average return
on assets; and a rapid growth in its asset size.
The only two indicators on which the society was below the industry average
were measures of capital strength.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's main rival for the top place in the industry was
Leeds Permanent, the fifth-largest society, but Abbey National, the retail
bank that shed building society status three years ago, would rank in second
place if it were still a society. Halifax, the industry giant, came fifth,
an improvement of four places on 1990.
At the other end of the league table, Birmingham Midshires, the 13th-largest
society, and Town &amp; Country, the 19th-largest, which made a Pounds 43m
pre-tax loss last year before merging with Woolwich, got low marks for
almost everything except capital strength.
Other societies that performed badly in the league table this year were
Skipton, which dropped from second position to 17th, and Alliance &amp;
Leicester, the fourth-largest society, down by 11 places to 14th position.
Mr John Wriglesworth, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said he believed that in spite
of its low place in the league table, Birmingham Midshires was in excellent
shape for the future.
He ruled out any prospect at the moment of a top-20 building society getting
into such financial trouble as Town &amp; Country and needing to be rescued by a
larger society.
Mr Wriglesworth singled out National &amp; Provincial, the seventh-largest
society which two years ago was forced to abort its plans for a stock market
flotation, as the most improved society.
There are considerable differences in the degree to which large societies
have been affected by bad debt.
Derbyshire, the 20th society by size, emerged as the one with the fewest bad
debts. Chelsea, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Portman, Birmingham Midshires,
Skipton, and Nationwide have the worst bad-debt experience.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has much better than average bad debt and arrears
experience, although it has absorbed several smaller societies with high
levels of bad debt in their loan books.
Most top-20 societies shed estate agency branches last year. Halifax, the
largest society, cut its estate agency network by 50 branches and Nationwide
dropped 35 branches.
Only one society, Alliance &amp; Leicester, says it is still considering
following Abbey National with a stock market flotation.
Four other societies, Halifax, Nationwide, Leeds Permanent and National &amp;
Provincial, still retain merchant banks to advise them on whether to convert
to plc status.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Jury still out on influence of ANC action: A week of protest
which came to a quiet end, overshadowed by other issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest came to a subdued conclusion over the
weekend, overtaken by the prospect of a United Nations observer mission to
the country and a call for a thorough investigation of the security forces.
The disclosure that Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National
Congress (ANC), spoke to President FW de Klerk by telephone on Friday, the
first direct communication between the two men for weeks, fuelled
speculation that an early resumption of the stalled constitutional
negotiations was likely.
Whether the week of protest played a significant part in bringing the two
parties together is debatable. An ANC official said yesterday the two-day
general strike on Monday and Tuesday and marches during the rest of the week
had strengthened the ANC's hand.
But if the objective was to force Mr de Klerk to concede to the early
implementation of measures leading to majority rule, there is little
evidence of success. Government ministers continue to talk in terms of power
sharing - a concept which envisages guaranteed minority representation at
all levels of government.
In the meantime, the need to curb political violence remains a critical
issue. The judge leading South Africa's official inquiry into township
killings has called for a full-scale investigation of the country's security
forces and the military wings of political organisations.
In a weekend statement Mr Justice Goldstone urged the government to act on
recommendations made by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in
his report to the Security Council on Friday. Mr Boutros Ghali proposed that
about 30 UN observers be stationed in South Africa to help curb political
violence.
For some years, said Justice Goldstone, 'there had been widespread and
serious allegations' about the unlawful activities of the South African army
and police, as well as the guerrilla wing of the ANC and the police force of
the KwaZulu homeland.
Piecemeal investigations will do no more than 'scratch the surface of the
widespread perceptions which make all of these agencies the object of
mistrust, distrust and suspicion'.
Turning specifically to the South African Defence Force (SADF) and police
force (SAP), the judge said unless they were 'fully investigated by a
neutral and reliable body, they will have no prospect of receiving the
trust, confidence and co-operation of the South African public.'
The police investigation of the Boipatong massacre in June was criticised
last month by a British criminal expert attached to the Goldstone
commission. This was followed by allegations from a prominent pathologist
that police brutality had been responsible for scores of the deaths in
custody that he had investigated.
The judge also noted that the continued existence of the ANC's guerrilla
wing had been a cause of complaint, especially from Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party (IFP).
At the same time, commented the judge, the activities of the KwaZulu police
force had come under question. 'It is widely perceived to be a force acting
as the arm of the IFP.'
In short, he concluded, 'the commission believes that if it is not able to
investigate fully the operations of these agencies, it will not be able to
carry out its mandate of making recommendations for curbing the violence'.
The judge also raised the possibility of offering an amnesty to all members
of organisations allegedly involved in violence, saying 'such an amnesty
would make the work of the commission more efficient and searching'.
The grudging response of the police to criticism of their Boipatong
investigation, and the truculent conduct of SADF counsel at the Goldstone
commission, suggests that both parties remain reluctant to open their
activities to detailed scrutiny.
Indeed, observers believe that without amnesty provisions, their
co-operation will be difficult to obtain.
The government's formal response to Mr Boutros Ghali's recommendation
concerning UN observers is not expected until after the regular cabinet
meeting on Wednesday. Mr de Klerk has already made clear, however, that he
supports such a proposal in principle.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Settlers and army back off from clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLASH yesterday between militant Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers over
construction of a house ended in a brittle compromise after the army agreed
not to demolish the structure for two weeks, while a building permit is
sought.
It was the first serious incident involving settlers and the military since
Israel's new government imposed a settlement curb last month, and came on
the eve of a crucial meeting in the US between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli
prime minister, and President George Bush.
Some 200 activists had confronted soldiers seeking to stop the building of a
new house in the militant settler stronghold of Kiryat Arba near the Arab
West Bank town of Hebron.
Mr Eliakim Haetzni, a fiercely nationalist settlers' leader and former
member of parliament, said defiantly: 'We'll build in 500 sites. We are the
locals here, not the Arabs. . . There aren't so many units in the army to
run after all of us.'
Yesterday's clash at Kiryat Arba and the move by Jewish settler activists
into a number of houses in the Moslem quarter of Jeusalem's Old City
underline domestic pressures on Mr Rabin in his efforts to satisfy
international demands for a halt to settlements.
The US has welcomed the steps taken by the new Israeli government to curb
settlements in territories captured in the 1967 war.
US officials had charged repeatedly that such settlements were 'an obstacle'
to peace.
The Kiryat Arba confrontation may mark the beginning of a right-wing
backlash against efforts of the Rabin government to stop the continued
spread of settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Since its heavy defeat in the June election, the Israeli right has been
uncharacteristically subdued, but in the past few days it appears to have
regained its voice and is clearly intent on sounding a discordant note to
accompany Mr Rabin's visit to the US.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Privatisation testifies to Amato's resolve: The Italian
government has launched itself boldly on the path of reform
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY HAIG SIMONIAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government's efforts to kick-start a privatisation programme,
promised for years but barely delivered until last Friday's upheavals, have
revealed a rich mixture of drama and political manoeuvring.
Now, the four biggest public-sector groups, IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA, are to
be transformed into joint stock companies, and their bloated, politicised
boards of directors slimmed to just three members.
Only last month, sceptics still doubted whether the government of Mr
Giuliano Amato would be willing, or able, to adopt unpopular measures to cut
the budget deficit by reducing spending and raising revenue through such
unorthodox methods as big privatisations.
Mr Amato's key economics team - Mr Piero Barucci at the Treasury, Mr Franco
Reviglio at the Budget Ministry and Mr Giovanni Goria at Finance  - smacked
too much of political placemen. Though Mr Barucci and Mr Reviglio were
presented as apolitical 'technicians', both owed their recent careers to
Christian Democrat and Socialist links respectively.
But instead of maintaining the status quo, the government has surprised
Italians by initiating a string of innovations within its first month of
office. Efim, the heavily loss-making and disastrously managed state holding
company, is being liquidated; the scala mobile wage indexation system is
being laid to rest; pensions are set for reform; and privatisation is now
under way.
Observers are right to remain cautious. The speed of change has been partly
dictated by a foreign exchange crisis, which saw the lira plummet against
the D-Mark last month and obliged Mr Amato to demonstrate firm action on the
deficit. Moreover some mistakes have been made: The Efim closure was poorly
presented and creditor banks may still have some nasty surprises in store.
Details of the system to replace the scala mobile will not be discussed
until September, when workers may take to the streets in protest. Changes to
the pension system, too tame for many economists, are in danger of being
watered down. And some politicians are still fighting a rearguard action to
limit privatisation.
That ingrained resistance to change may explain why so many of the
government's policies have appeared hurried and been badly presented, or, in
the case of the original privatisation plan, overturned.
With widespread opposition to change among the Socialists and especially the
Christian Democrats, Mr Amato has had to use surprise. The original concept
of two 'superholdings' is believed to have been deliberately tossed into the
closing minutes of a Friday night cabinet meeting virtually as an
afterthought. Scribbled on a couple of scraps of paper just before the
meeting, the superholdings were given the go-ahead before many ministers
knew quite how much was at stake. Although the format has been scrapped, it
is now too late to stop the privatisation ball rolling.
The proposal to close Efim, which has debts of almost twice its annual
revenues, was also presented to the cabinet as a surprise. 'Do you really
think that, after so many false starts, it would have got through this time
if it had been presented formally, discussed in the cabinet and passed on to
the parties for comment?' asks one senior official.
Even Friday's shareholders' meetings of the big four state companies verged
on farce, as the assemblies were convened, postponed until the afternoon,
then re-opened and put off once more as the four chairmen were summoned to
the Industry Ministry.
Some ministers admit the government is walking a tightrope in taking
controversial measures which could provoke a defeat in parliament. However,
Mr Amato, whose government is based on a wafer-thin 16-seat majority in the
lower house of parliament, has deftly played the card of new elections to
strengthen his hand.
Bringing down Mr Amato would probably lead to a new, interim government,
headed by an institutional figure such as Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the veteran
leader of the Senate, followed by new elections in a few months. Few MPs
relish the prospect of new polls. In northern Italy, the populist Leagues
are poised to increase their share of the vote at the expense of the
Christian Democrats and Socialists, who have been tainted by revelations of
political corruption in Milan and other cities. The scandal has also closed
illegal sources of funds which many politicians have come to rely on.
'I appreciate the government may not last until Christmas,' one minister
said last week. 'But don't you think we've achieved a lot already? We've
done more in four weeks than others in years.'
The process has already shed light on corners of the public sector where
transparency has been lacking. Transforming IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA into
joint stock companies has revealed many anomalies.
IRI's consolidated debt, exposed by its change in legal status, is now so
high as to threaten its ability under Italian law to issue further bonds.
The problem should be overcome by a revaluation of its portfolio of
subsidiaries and possibly by the transfer of some debt to the Treasury, but
the blow to IRI's prestige has been severe.
The transformations also require salaries to be set for the chairmen. The
big state holding companies are wary of disclosing how much chairmen earn.
Publication of the salaries of IRI's Mr Franco Nobili and ENI's Mr Gabriele
Cagliari in the Official Gazette reveals only a modest income. However, the
official figures reflect only part of the total packages, with the remainder
made up of a variety of benefits, including expenses.
Preliminary inquiries by the Treasury before setting the new levels were
frostily received by the state-sector groups. It is rumoured that only when
the Treasury threatened to take the official figures for adoption in the
companies' new statutes were the full packages revealed.
Such vignettes give a taste of the problems facing Mr Amato and his team.
Last week's changes to the public-sector groups shows that, slowly, some are
being resolved.

PRESIDENT George Bush's chances of re-election in November would be
significantly improved only by an economic turnround, according to a
national opinion poll published yesterday, Reuter reports from Boston.
The poll, conducted for the Boston Globe newspaper, found that if the US
presidential election were held today, Democratic nominee Bill Clinton and
his running-mate, Senator Al Gore, would beat Mr Bush and Vice-President Dan
Quayle by 56 to 32 per cent of the vote.
But almost a third of those polled said they would be more likely to vote
for Mr Bush if the economy improved.
The survey found that one in five Republican voters would like Mr Bush to
step down. His overall job-approval rating was 31 per cent; at the Gulf
war's end last year this soared to 90 per cent. But even ousting Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein would now have no effect on 76 per cent of
respondents.
A second opinion poll, conducted by the University of Houston Centre for
Public Policy, also found that Mr Clinton had a 43-29 per cent lead over the
president in Mr Bush's adopted home state of Texas.

US, CANADIAN and Mexican negotiators at the weekend were still winding up
discussions on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
American negotiators are racing to complete the pact before next week's
Republican party convention. For President George Bush, the ideal time to
reach agreement would be a weekday, presenting him with the opportunity of
appearing on the evening news to claim a foreign and economic policy
victory.
Instead of seeming passive while the US economy stutters, he could emerge at
his party's convention as something of a visionary.
Nafta is designed to liberalise trade largely by eliminating tariff barriers
over a 15-year period for a range of US, Mexican and Canadian goods and
services. However, reports indicate that Mexican officials have become
stubborn about sharing government procurement contracts in the state-owned
oil sector with Canadian and US companies.
The energy trade negotiations have been limited by protective Mexican laws
and Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, has said the pact should
offer opportunities for companies servicing the oil industry.
Despite many unresolved issues, the negotiations have broken new ground on
environmental issues. One provision sets up a Nafta arbitration panel for
environmental disputes; this panel would take precedence over the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade dispute settlement mechanism, which has been
faulted for ignoring environmental considerations.
The provision was in response to lobbying from many environmental groups
which opposed the pact, fearing it would increase environmental problems
along the US-Mexican border where some 2,000 maquiladoras - foreign-owned
Mexican manufacturing and assembly plants - have sprung up since 1965.
Nafta also creates a customs area for both external as well as internal
purposes. It is expected not only to boost trade within the continent but to
link Mexico's young, cheap labour with US and Canadian innovation and
technology.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Detention camps distract the world: While Serbs try to save
face, the sieges go on and Bosnia's Moslems are still suffering
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINCE television pictures of Serb-controlled detention camps flashed across
the world last week, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, has been
engaged in an apparent face-saving exercise.
He has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to inspect the
camps and suggested they be placed under international supervision. Western
diplomats said at the weekend that all camps - Croat, Serb, and Moslem -
should be opened and put under international control.
But this could play into the hands of the Bosnian Serb leaders. If they are
set free, the thousands of people held in the camps will become the problem
of the international community.
'They will become refugees. Their homes have been destroyed. They have
nothing left to go home to. They will have to seek refuge in some other
European country. That is exactly what Mr Karadzic and his friends want,' a
diplomat in Belgrade said yesterday.
Moreover, in focusing on the camps, Serb leaders in Bosnia hope to deflect
western governments' attention from what is taking place elsewhere.
The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo is entering its fifth month of siege by Serb
irregulars. In north-west Bosnia, the same forces are besieging Bihac, where
Moslems make up 67 per cent of the population of 70,800. The town could be
another Sarajevo, said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at
the weekend.
In the east of the republic, Serb irregulars have kept the town of Gorazde
under constant bombardment for four months. They continue to prevent food
and medicine from reaching the 37,000 inhabitants, 70 per cent of them
Moslem. Yesterday they threatened a final assault to capture the town.
Also in eastern Bosnia, Tuzla, whose Moslem population makes up 47 per cent
of the 131,000 inhabitants, has been repeatedly attacked by Serb irregulars
over the past three months.
'What we must not lose sight of is the land-grab being undertaken by Serbia
in the east, and in the north-west of Bosnia, and by Croatia in the west of
the republic, in Hercegovina,' according to a US diplomat in Belgrade
yesterday.
'However terrible the camps are, we must not forget that Bosnia is being
divided by Croatia and Serbia, and that the Moslems are the victims of this
aggression. Serbia will stop bombarding these towns once they have got what
they want.'
For this reason, the Bosnian leadership - which is not exclusively Moslem -
continues to call for international military intervention to prevent further
destruction of the republic and deportation of the Moslem community.
Moslems make up 43 per cent of the 4.3m population of Bosnia, where Serbs,
who account for 31 per cent, now control 70 per cent of the territory.
Bosnians believe even military force to back up the international
humanitarian aid effort will not stop the deportations, or the wholesale
destruction of their towns and cities.
'Take the siege of Sarajevo. The Serbs want to draw a green line through our
city,' said Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's foreign minister. 'They want to
create ethnically pure cantons throughout Bosnia. What will the Moslems be
left with? What will become of the kind of centuries-old co-existence of
Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Sarajevo?'
A senior UN official in Belgrade said: 'The war has radicalised the Moslems.
They feel betrayed by the slow, indecisive, and late response by western
governments.
'Why should they believe in a ceasefire when they see it only consolidates
the gains made by the Serbs - and the Croats?'
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is to address an
emergency meeting of MEPs in Brussels today about the crisis in Bosnia,
Andrew Hill reports from Brussels.
The deputies are expected to voice concerns about the plight of refugees
from Bosnia and the detention camps in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Paul Grossrieder, deputy director of the International Committee of the
Red Cross, will tell the meeting about the detention camps, following last
week's graphic descriptions of the suffering of Moslem captives.
The meeting will also be attended by representatives of the UN High
Commission for Refugees.
Mr Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament, has called together
up to 130 members of a number of parliamentary committees - including those
on foreign affairs and security, and on civil liberties  - to discuss the
crisis.
The parliament is expected to issue at least a declaration on the refugee
problem, but it is likely to have only symbolic value, as the principal EC
policy decisions on the crisis are in the hands of the member states, under
the British presidency.

<TEXT>
THE International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) yesterday welcomed the
invitation to its officials by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's
insurgent Serbs, to visit more Serb-controlled detention centres. But it
ruled out taking control of the centres itself.
Mr Karadzic also said he would free detainees over the age of 60.
'We feel these are moves in the right direction,' Mr Pierre Gauthier, ICRC
spokesman, said yesterday. He added that the ICRC had been demanding for
some time access to all detention centres, as well as the unconditional
liberation of all detainees not involved in the conflict.
He said the ICRC had been active in Bosnia for a month, and its 25 officials
there had visited 10 detention centres, among them centres controlled by
each of the three groups in the conflict.
It was drawing up a new list of centres to visit. 'Omarska is one of our
priorities,' he said, referring to the camp in northern Bosnia where
journalists last week found emaciated and terrified men behind barbed wire
in a situation reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps.
However, Mr Gauthier dismissed suggestions that the ICRC itself take control
of some centres.
ICRC procedure is to report its findings in confidence to the responsible
government authority.
If nothing is done to eliminate abuses, it then reports, also in confidence,
to the countries that have signed the Geneva convention, urging them to put
pressure on the offending government.
If that fails to produce results, it condemns the offending government
publicly.

FOUR Moslem women arriving in Sarajevo yesterday spoke of gang rapes,
beatings, looting and arson by Serbs, many of whom were their friends and
neighbours before war engulfed Bosnia-Hercegovina, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
Three of the women, aged 15-20, said they were among more than 100 women
repeatedly gang-raped over seven days in late July and early August after
being rounded up at a school in their home town, Rogatica. They said they
were victims of a Serb 'ethnic cleansing' campaign to drive non-Serbs out of
the town, where 12,000 Moslems once lived.
'I know the people who burned my house and stole my things and took me
prisoner. They were my friends and neighbours,' Saida Ajanovic, 42, said.
She said the Serbs sent her and her 20-year-old daughter Samira by bus to
Sarajevo four days ago with about 300 other people held for a week at the
school in Rogatica.
Samira said she was taken from the school by armed men on the night of
August 1, driven around with a knife at her throat for three hours and then
taken to the flat of a Serbian neighbour she named.
'First he raped me and then the others came - two men I didn't know - and
they raped me too,' she said. 'He is married, he has two children, but he
did this terrible thing to me.' Samira said she was raped four nights out of
the seven she was held at the school, always at gunpoint around midnight.
Two of Samira's friends who arrived with her in Sarajevo also said they were
gang-raped.
Edina Zimic, aged 15, said she was taken by armed men from the school on
July 30 and hauled to the headquarters of a local Serbian military
commander.
'He asked me questions about where Bosnian units were around the town and
wanted to know if I would take a Serbian name,' she said. 'Then he took me
to a flat and raped me.'
She said she was raped on two other nights during the week at the school,
once by three Serbian men she knew.
Edina's 17-year-old sister Elvira said she was gang-raped on three
occasions, twice on the floor of the school and once in a flat where five
Serbian men assaulted her.
She said she was also made drunk on wine and then forced to sit on a mine.
'Now that we think about it we know there was no danger because the Chetniks
(Serbian extremists) stayed in the room too. But at the time I was
terrified,' she said.
Saida Ajanovic, a widow whose husband died in the fighting, said all the
young women held at the school, over 100 in all, were raped, including
mothers with children.
'My cousin, Dzananovic Safa, died at the school,' she said. 'She was a
diabetic but the Serbs would not let her take her medicine.'
The four women said the Moslem section of Rogatica had been devastated, much
of it by fire. They said they were robbed of gold and jewellery at gunpoint
and their possessions looted. The only Moslems now left in the town were
about 30 young men doing forced labour for the Serbs.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Flying with Ashdown to stronghold of Bosnia's Serbs: Laura
Silber dons her flak jacket for a helicopter journey in the wake of the

BOSNIAN Serb soldiers flying in a helicopter from Belgrade to their
stronghold of Pale, east of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, yesterday faced
the choice of transporting supplies of blood plasma, or a party of
journalists.
Influenced, perhaps by the need to improve their image, they chose the
latter.
We took off in a Russian military helicopter from Belgrade's military
heliport in the wake of another helicopter carrying Mr Paddy Ashdown, the
leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, who is visiting Bosnia this week to
inspect the Serb-controlled detention centres in northern Bosnia.
Mr Ashdown, who last week criticised the British government's slow response
to the crisis in the former Yugoslav republic, was invited by Mr Radovan
Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, to visit any detention camps.
There were 13 journalists in my helicopter - the overspill from Mr Ashdown's
aircraft - and a three-man crew. The pilots were obviously professionals
trained in the Yugoslav federal army. They said that they were from Serbia.
After flying for some time, we stopped to refuel somewhere in a mountain
clearing in south-western Serbia. There was an efficient ground crew
operating from a huge cement camouflaged bunker.
Our route was to take us over Serbia and up to Pale, Mr Karadzic's
stronghold, 10km east of the republic's capital of Sarajevo. We climbed into
the helicopter and were told to put on flak jackets just in case. There has
been heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia between Serbs and Moslems and there
are still pockets of Moslem resistance, particularly the town of Gorazde.
Gorazde, a Moslem town, has in fact been besieged by Serb irregulars for the
past three months. UN-backed aid convoys have already failed to get through
to relieve the city and deliver badly needed medicine and food supplies.
We nearly brushed tops of trees and appeared to graze against the side of
the mountain. The pilot swooped above electric wire cables and immediately
descended. We crossed the river Drina, which marks the frontier between
Serbia and Bosnia, the helicopter hugging the field, bringing damaged and
bombed-out houses into view.
When we arrived at Pale, Mr Karadzic told me: 'We are ready to show the
whole world that we have nothing to hide in the camps.'
He said that yesterday morning near Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo which has
been bombarded and besieged by Serb irregulars for the past five months, he
had freed 10 Moslem prisoners. He said that nine had been sick, and one had
promised not to fight against Serbia again.
Today our journey to the camps with Mr Ashdown continues - at first by
helicopter to Bjelina, in the north-east of Bosnia, and then by road west to
Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia.
Earlier, Mr Ashdown had talks in a Belgrade hotel with Mr Dobrica Cosic, the
president of the so-called Yugoslav Federation, PA reports.
Mr Ashdown said he told Mr Cosic the International Committee of the Red
Cross could not run detention camps but having permanent ICRC monitors there
would be useful.
The Liberal Democrat leader is due to return to London on Wednesday.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Kohl cannot win on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOTHER knows best. Chancellor Helmut Kohl may well have reflected on the old
saw as he contemplated last week's interim injunction from the
constitutional court in Karlsruhe, which blocked the introduction of
Germany's new abortion laws.
A long time ago, the story goes, young Helmut came home congratulating
himself on a powerful anti-abortion speech in the state parliament of the
Rhineland Palatinate. His mother, the story continues, warned him then:
'Son, better hold your tongue. You don't understand anything about it'.
While the fire may have faded in his later interventions, Mr Kohl held his
ground during sporadic liberalisation debates throughout his career.
But the issue emerged again, uncomfortable as ever and this time
unavoidable, after unification, when it became essential to end the conflict
between laws in east and west Germany. In essence, the decision on whether a
woman was allowed an abortion lay with the woman in the GDR, and with her
doctor in the west.
Mr Kohl was consistent during the following two years of tormented political
and moral debate. With one eye on his Christian Democrats' closest allies,
the catholic Christian Social Union of Bavaria, and one hand on the
constitution, which states 'everyone shall have the right to life and to
inviolability of his person', he maintained his opposition to relaxation.
But a free parliamentary vote on an amendment in June, granting a woman the
right to abortion up to 12 weeks provided she accepted counselling, swept
him and his allies aside as eastern CDU members and Liberal Democrats joined
the opposition for the day.
An appeal for an injunction went immediately to Karlsruhe, supported by 247
centre-right Bundestag members and the entire Bavarian government.
As the muted reaction from CDU ranks demonstrated, last week's interim
decision was not counted as a victory. It was more a defeat for the
chancellor's efforts to restore faith in his ability both to govern and his
government's capacity to reflect popular concerns.
Mr Kohl's popularity, hit by economic troubles, the failure of the east to
develop into his promised 'blooming landscape', the flood of refugees and
doubts over the Maastricht treaties on European unity, is already at a level
which could cost him power if an election were held now.
Opinion polls have consistently shown an increasing desire for easing of
Germany's restrictive abortion laws.
The Social Democrat opposition can be counted on to continue the debate
outside the court and the confines of the Bundestag, until the court
delivers its definitive judgment at the end of the year. One aim will be to
deepen further the rifts between the CDU core, its disenchanted membership
in the east, and its Bavarian colleagues.
The Karlsruhe ruling, a masterpiece of technical talk from a panel of seven
male judges and one woman, resolved nothing. The constitutional issue, the
heart of the plaintiffs' case, was not even addressed.
Whatever the final outcome, Mr Kohl cannot win. A verdict for the amendment
will be read as a clear defeat for his government while a vote against will
mean the defeat of a clear majority of the electorate.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Olympic Games prove a runaway success for Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   BARCELONA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RIGHT DOWN to yesterday's agonisingly close water polo final between Spain
and Italy, nothing in recent Spanish history has done more to bring the
nation's people together than the Barcelona Olympic Games.
Brilliantly organised, executed and hosted by Barcelona, the Games ended
with last night's victory in the men's marathon by Hwang Young-cho of South
Korea, followed by the closing ceremony and a pyrotechnic show designed to
symbolise the creation of the world.
It seemed from the start that Barcelona's Games would finally bury the
bitter nationalist rivalries that have emerged in post-Franco Spain.
National and regional leaders, uniting to celebrate an unexpected success
for Spanish athletes, have ignored old differences to hail an Olympiad which
saw Spain win 13 gold medals.
Even Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the nationalist Catalan government, has
embraced the Iberian cause. He has spent most of the Games biting his nails
and whooping for Spanish victories in the company of King Juan Carlos and
Queen Sofia.
These are images that might bury forever Madrid's fear that he represents
anything more than a proud regional tradition content to embrace the Spanish
crown.
The spirit of unity reached its climax when thousands of red and yellow
Catalan flags rose to salute Fermin Cacho of Soria, in the Castillian
heartland, when he burst through the leaders to win the men's 1,500m gold
medal on Saturday night. His victory marked the culmination of a series of
home victories that ensured Barcelona became not a platform for extremists,
but the place where all of Spain enjoyed some of its finest hours.
Spanish success, which included golds in athletics, swimming, hockey,
football and cycling, has been greeted with delirium by the home fans.
Spain, however, is not the only emerging nation to break the tape ahead of
sporting giants. South Korea, which won 33 medals in Seoul, continued its
success in Barcelona with 29.
Amateur sportsmen and women from amateur nations have also performed well.
Of the 64 nations to win medals in Barcelona, the three Baltic states,
Croatia and Slovenia have all scored victories.
Winning opportunities for smaller countries have improved with the demise of
big players such as East Germany (112 medals in Seoul), Romania (down seven
medals) and Bulgaria(down 20). The Unified Team won the most medals, but
some 20 fewer than last time.
The end of the eastern bloc has also allowed western nations to win medals.
Every western European country increased its tally except Britain (down
five), Germany (down 74 from the joint totals of the two German teams) and
Portugal (down one to zero).
The triumphs of fledgling nations have reinforced the message of opportunity
and optimism touted at the opening ceremony two weeks ago.
Bickering within Spain over the financing of the Olympics has also been
overshadowed. About Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) was spent on revitalising
Barcelona and ticket sales have been so high the organisers were yesterday
predicting a possible Dollars 6m profit.
But the entire country knew before the flame atop Montjuic was lit that the
next two years are going to demand great sacrifices as Madrid struggles to
keep growth above 2 per cent and curb its runaway public deficits.
Although Spain will bask in the afterglow of the Olympiad for some time, the
end of the 1992 Games marks the end of Spain's honeymoon as a democracy and
as an economic sprinter.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Hurd wary of sending ground troops to war zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of force to deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting in
Bosnia may well be necessary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
acknowledged yesterday.
He emphasised, however, that the identity of the forces who might provide
this protection had 'not yet been worked out'.
As public pressure on the government to do something to end the suffering of
the region's inhabitants continued to mount, Mr Hurd again underlined the
reluctance of Britain, the US and Germany to commit ground troops to the
former Yugoslavia.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, he said talks between
Britain, the US and others were focusing on ways of affording better
protection 'with the UN agencies and the humanitarian effort already on the
ground rather than replacing it'.
As the likelihood of a UN resolution on protecting the flow of aid to the
region appeared to be growing, Mr Hurd said 'a certain amount' of Nato
contingency planning had been going on. But he ruled out exerting military
force to separate the combatants.
Speaking on the eve of a visit to Brussels by Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign
office minister, to discuss the proposed London conference later this month
on the region's problems, Mr Hurd said he hoped the UN would pass a separate
resolution on conditions in the notorious Serb-run camps.
Conditions in the camps are to be inspected this week by Mr Paddy Ashdown,
the Liberal Democrat leader, on a visit to Bosnia. Mr Ashdown yesterday
called for action by the west to ensure the conflict 'is brought to a lower
level of intensity'.
Mr Hogg's meeting with the European Commission today will include
discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of economic sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro - which together make up what remains of
Yugoslavia - after concerns about oil traffic on the Danube.

Sterling started the week even more firmly entrenched at the bottom of the
European Monetary System's grid. Its differential against the Italian lira,
the next weakest currency, has widened to 3.2 percentage points after the
pound closed against the D-Mark at DM2.8250 on Friday night. The pound's
differential against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo, has also
widened and is still outside the permitted differential of 6.18 percentage
points. Currencies, Page 25
The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent
fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise
more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the
system. Sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo operate with
6 per cent fluctuation bands.

FT  10 AUG 92 / UN may back force in Bosnia: Western governments strive to
resolve differences over scale of military involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments were struggling yesterday to agree on the scope of
military involvement in Bosnia-Hercegovina as the United Nations Security
Council prepared to sanction some form of armed intervention.
Despite mounting pressure from public opinion and opposition political
parties for the UN and Nato to stop the fighting in the former Yugoslav
republic, the UK and US remain determined not to become bogged down in what
President George Bush called a 'quagmire'.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US deputy secretary of state, said the
situation in Bosnia was 'a civil war based on 500 to 1,000 years of history.
. . These ethnic groups are intermixed in ways you cannot separate.' But he
was confident the Security Council would reach agreement early this week on
a resolution to use 'all necessary means' to ensure safe passage for
humanitarian relief.
He added, however, that the US was not prepared to go beyond the provision
of aid. To do so could require use of force.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, claimed that
the US was 'leading the way' and differences with the UK and France over the
role and command structure of forces protecting aid convoys would be
resolved.
There are differences over which countries should commit ground forces if
they are used. The US has ruled out such a course - although it would
provide air cover for convoys - while European governments still have to
agree on levels of commitment.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said he hoped there would be an
agreement on a UN resolution 'which will put the emphasis on the escorting,
the protection of humanitarian help so that it can be stepped up.'
In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would endorse the use of force
under a UN mandate to protect convoys. He also demanded more concerted
European Community action to stop the ethnic fighting.
The European parliament will today hear from Mr Paul Grossrieder, deputy
director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, about the fate of
refugees, and the existence of detention camps in Bosnia.
The soul-searching by western governments over how to respond to public
pressure was reflected in President Bush's press conference on Saturday. He
insisted that not one US soldier would be committed without the
administration being confident that he would get out again.
The president's aides have warned of the US getting into a quagmire of
Vietnam proportions. 'We're not going to get bogged down in some guerrilla
warfare,' Mr Bush said at his Kennebunkport holiday home.
He rejected accusations, particularly from Governor Bill Clinton, his
Democrat presidential opponent, that he was reacting too cautiously in the
face of a human tragedy.
'If informing the American people step-by-step is not good enough, well, I'm
guilty,' said Mr Bush. 'I'm getting sniped at politically, but I will not
make one decision based on American politics.'
However, with the television networks constantly replaying film of the
emaciated prisoners in Serbian detention camps - evocations of the Holocaust
in the second world war - and the weight of opinion in newspapers coming
down in favour of US action, Mr Bush is in increasing danger of looking as
inept internationally as his opponents claim that he is domestically.
Further pressure came in the form of a public opinion poll published by
Newsweek showing that 53 per cent of Americans would favour a US lead in
seeking UN-backed air strikes against Serbian positions.
Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister and erstwhile ally of Mr
Bush, added to the pressure in a televised appeal for direct military
intervention against the 'Serbian aggressors'.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Industry pay deals remain stuck above 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRY pay settlements have remained above 4 per cent for three
consecutive quarters, suggesting that wage inflation remains a threat to UK
competitiveness.
Manufacturing wage settlements averaged 4.3 per cent in the second quarter
of 1992, according to the latest Confederation of British Industry pay
databank, unchanged from the final quarter of 1991.
The news comes a week after calls for a freeze on public sector wages from
some Tory MPs and a proposal from Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's new
director-general, that the government pay bill should not increase in cash
terms. Any rises in pay rates should be financed, he said, through
'improvements in efficiency or reductions in government activity'.
The CBI said the settlements data were evidence that pay behaviour had
settled into the non-inflationary patterns of Britain's European
competitors.
Separate CBI figures showed that settlements paid by service sector
companies have fallen to 4.3 per cent in the first half of 1992, from 7.1
per cent a year ago.
'If that pattern can be maintained into the upturn, the wage-price spiral
will be broken to the permanent benefit of UK competitiveness and jobs,'
said Mr Ronnie Gilbert, director of employment affairs at the CBI.
But economists expressed surprise that the fall in wage settlements had
ground to a halt.
'The behaviour of wage settlements has been mystifying,' said Mr John
Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities. 'These figures suggest that
the adjustment within the European exchange rate mechanism has a long way to
go.'
Pay settlements had to fall to 3 per cent if UK exporters were to hold their
own in Europe, said Dr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy
Institute, the employment think tank.
'We need to see considerably more progress if we are to be optimistic about
maintaining Britain's competitiveness when the recovery comes,' he said.
'The question is how much more pain we have to endure to get settlements
down to a competitive level, let alone to a level consistent with Mr Major's
target of zero inflation.'
Unemployment in July is expected to have risen by 25,000, the 27th
consecutive monthly increase following an unexpectedly low rise of 7,000 in
June.
The figures will be released on Thursday, with average earnings data
expected to show wage inflation still well above 6 per cent a year.
Further evidence that the government faces mounting pressure to restrict
public sector pay emerged yesterday as the 6.5 per cent pay increase
recommended for top policemen was attacked.
Two Tory MPs - Mr John Townend, chairman of the backbench finance committee,
and Sir John Wheeler, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee -
called for a smaller deal.
