FT  10 AUG 92 / Michael Prowse on America: The David Owen of US politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a cheeky editorial, The Economist recently drew a parallel between Mr
Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, and Mr Neil Kinnock,
the former opposition leader in the UK. Mr Kinnock led a new-look Labour
party to resounding defeat in the British general election despite having
enjoyed a consistent lead in the opinion polls. The Economist suggested the
same fate might await Mr Clinton and his exuberant Democratic supporters.
Scepticism about Mr Clinton's chances is advisable, despite his warm welcome
in America's farm belt last week. President George Bush, a gritty fighter,
is beginning to make combative speeches and will be lifted next week by the
Republican party convention in Houston.
The analogy between the US Democrats and Labour, however, seems rather
far-fetched. A better way to understand the choice facing Americans would be
to imagine that the Conservatives had not dumped Margaret Thatcher and that
the opposition parties had united under an articulate, personable leader
such as Lord (formerly Dr David) Owen.
Britain, as in the US today, would then have faced a choice between an old,
tired leader who could not escape responsibility for economic and social
ills and a younger, more caring opponent whose commitment to market
principles was not in doubt. If you think Dr Owen, at the helm of a merged
Labour and Liberal Democratic party, could have won that contest, you should
take Mr Clinton seriously.
The Republicans will try to discredit Mr Clinton by depicting him as an
old-fashioned 'liberal' (that is, left-wing) Democrat. Yet everybody knows
he has been badgering his party to adopt more conservative policies for
years. Broadly speaking, he favours the Germanic 'social market' policies
that Dr Owen and friends espoused in Britain in the early 1980s. (Mr Clinton
even cites Germany in speeches on topics such as education and training.)
His remarkable climb in the highly unreliable opinion polls is fuelled by
pessimism about the economy. The marginal decline in unemployment last month
will do little or nothing to restore faith in Mr Bush's economic
stewardship, which some regard as the worst since Herbert Hoover's
disastrous pre-war presidency.
Mr Clinton also profits from Mr Bush's legendary difficulties with the
English language. A master of rhetoric such as Gladstone was able to make a
virtue out of social inaction; when Mr Bush tries to explain his urban or
welfare policies, his contorted syntax merely prompts speculation that he
suffers from aphasia.
At the Democratic convention in New York, Mr Clinton appeared to achieve a
breakthrough on several levels. Like former president Ronald Reagan, he
successfully projected himself as a product of small- town America. By
talking not of his education at Yale and Oxford but rather of his
grandfather's shop in Hope, Arkansas, his widowed mother and his upbringing
in a home without an indoor toilet, he has made plausible his claim to
understand the hopes and aspirations of the 'forgotten' mass of middle and
working class families. By contrast, Mr Bush, a product of New England prep
schools, remains aloof and out of touch.
Equally important, Mr Clinton's has begun the task of articulating an
economic and social philosophy that seems both broader and more relevant to
America's modern needs than Mr Bush's. Mr Clinton has no quarrel with free
enterprise, market forces or low taxes. Along with European social
democrats, he merely believes these good things should be part of a more
ambitious compact between government and the people.
The first item in his proposed 'New Covenant' is improved incentives for
enterprise. But he then moves on to tackle problems largely unaddressed in
the past 12 years. Why, he asks, is America the only advanced nation without
universally guaranteed health care? Why does the US provide virtually no
skills training for non-college bound youngsters? Why has it allowed urban
problems to fester to the point where cities such as Los Angeles explode in
anger? In his stump speeches, Mr Clinton outlines his solutions and ends
with a simple plea: give us a chance to show we can do better than the
Republicans.
Mr Bush's challenge is to convince Americans not to give Mr Clinton that
chance. In the unlikely event that Mr Bush sticks to his promise to fight
the election on policy rather than character issues, he faces a tricky task.
His own record is poor while Mr Clinton's social market philosophy has an
innate appeal. At root Mr Clinton's argument is that other countries are
gaining ground on the US because they are investing more effectively in
their people. His emphasis on long-term structural reforms to raise the
quality of America's workforce - its 'human capital' - represents a new and
exciting departure for the US where economic debate has usually had a
shorter-term focus.
The right message for the times, sadly, is no guarantee of victory - as
British social democrats can confirm. A united Democratic party led by Mr
Clinton ought to have a better chance of unseating Mr Bush than Britain's
disunited opposition had of toppling Mr John Major. However, with Mr Bush's
offensive yet to begin, the Clinton lead could still evaporate like morning
mist.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Justinian: Cloud over the legal system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lurid life and times of Ms Jani Allan, as portrayed at the Royal Courts
of Justice during her unsuccessful libel action against Channel 4, may have
been a piece of pure theatre, thanks in part to some colourful jury advocacy
from fashionable Queen's Counsel. The case undoubtedly titillated the public
palate, if the tabloid coverage is anything to go by. However, it possessed
little of legal or public interest, as opposed to its interest to the
newspaper reading public.
The case will slip into the record books purely as a rare contemporary
success by the media defending their right to inform the public of the
private antics of public figures. Yet, even though the case provides welcome
relief to the media, which has been wailing consistently at being mulcted
with every award of heavy damages for libel, it has done nothing to dispel
the pervading cloud of costly libel litigation.
Reports that Miss Allan now faces a bill for legal costs of Pounds 300,000,
whatever else, will not astonish the cognoscenti of the libel world. Those
few cases of libel which survive the process of writ-serving and
negotiations for settlements inevitably bring the high cost of legal
assistance and representation.
The Lord Chief Justice is on record recently as saying that 'legal fees in
the private sector have gone too high' and that those who brief barristers
should insist on moderating the fees paid. But even if the fees of the
lawyers in the Jani Allan case appeared inordinately rapacious, there is not
much prospect of cutting the costs of libel actions significantly.
In any event, should there be a cheaper service, both for those defamed and
for those who publish defamatory matter, in pursuing and resisting legal
action? Is this form of legal service really necessary at all?
Those who feel the need to redeem their unjustly tarnished reputation by a
claim to damages are invited, but not actively encouraged, by the legal
system. The system demonstrates the uniqueness of libel actions by declining
to apply the legal aid scheme. Thus only the well-to-do can sensibly afford
to take on the might of wealthy newspapers.
It is the public figure mainly who is the object of media attention with
potential for defamatory treatment. Often public figures actually use and
enjoy media coverage for their activities, but squeal the moment the
publicity turns nasty. In general terms, might it be that they should take
the rough with the smooth, and desist from going to law on the one occasion?
If the damages awardable by juries were to be severely reduced by the factor
of ongoing and otherwise favourable publicity, that might temper the
temptation to sue. And if there is a genuine desire to restore publicly
one's proper reputation, should not the Press Complaints Commission proclaim
much more vigorously its availability to adjudicate on libel cases, with an
obligation on the part of publishers to publish prominently any adverse
rulings as an alternative to expensive litigation?
However, so long as society desires to compensate the defamed for loss of
reputation - not easily measurable in money terms - there will remain the
opportunity for juries to use the occasion for punishing the worst defamers,
even if the juries are constrained by judicial pleas for moderation.
There are numerous examples of libel damages being awarded as a deterrent -
when a newspaper has behaved intentionally and inexcusably, abused its
journalistic powers, distorted information or published material
scandalously. In the past, courts have not curbed jury awards of exemplary
damages, although there are some welcome signs of the courts putting a brake
on jury awards.
The not so well-to-do and the poor are palpably discriminated against by the
legal system. They simply cannot afford to do more than threaten
proceedings, in the hope that a modest payment coupled with an apology may
be forthcoming. The prospect of the day in court is daunting, to say the
least. The absence of legal aid for libel actions is, on the face of it,
socially unjust.
For 30 years successive committees, both official and unofficial, have urged
the government to remedy the apparent unfairness. The Royal Commission on
Legal Services, under the chairmanship of Lord Benson, was in 1979 the
latest voice raised in support of applying legal aid to libel. Yet the
Treasury has stoutly resisted all blandishments, for fear of burdening the
public purse.
If there were methods for guaranteeing the grant of a legal aid certificate
only to those cases in which the plaintiff was almost bound to succeed -
something more than a reasonable cause of action - there would be less worry
over the public expense. The legal aid fund would almost invariably be
reimbursed out of recovered damages.
A limited form of legal aid in libel would redress the balance of unequal
treatment among those defamed. It could also lead to a tighter control over
the costs of those few cases that were fully litigated.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Monday Interview: Premier Democrat on Wall St - Robert
Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, speaks to Martin Dickson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The name Robert Rubin has suddenly become one to bandy about on the
Washington dinner party circuit.
Bob Rubin is co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, one of America's leading
investment banks, and he is that rare (though not unique) phenomenon on
overwhelmingly Republican Wall Street - an industry leader who is also a
lifelong supporter of the Democratic party.
His new-found celebrity beyond the canyons of lower Manhattan stems from the
significant behind-the-scenes role he is playing in the election campaign of
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.
It was Mr Rubin, a New Yorker born and bred, who chaired a city committee
which persuaded the (initially reluctant) Democratic party to stage its
national convention in the Big Apple. The same committee then worked to
insure that last month's convention took place in a suitably upbeat civic
atmosphere. Given New York's volatile nature, it could have been a disaster.
In the event, it was a triumphant affirmation of the power of planning,
positive thinking and good luck.
Mr Rubin has a continuing role in the Clinton campaign. He is one of a
handful of academics and financiers advising Mr Clinton's staff on economic
policy issues and preparing the nominee for the autumn's important
face-to-face debates with President George Bush.
All this means that Mr Rubin, who pinned his colours to the Clinton mast
long before the presidential primaries began, is being quietly tipped as a
leading contender for Treasury secretary if the Democrats win in November.
He dismisses such tattle as 'media discussion which is probably irrelevant
to what ultimately happens'. But even in his present capacity he would have
some influence on the financial policies of a Democratic administration.
Mr Rubin is 53, but looks much younger - a neat fit with the youthful
Clinton-Gore image. He has a manner both more cerebral and informal than
often found on Wall Street. Lean, quietly spoken and with a rather sad-eyed
look, he inhabits a modest office notable mainly for its untidy clutter of
papers.
When Mr Rubin was recently in hospital having a back operation, his wife
Judith, an adviser to New York Mayor David Dinkins on protocol matters, took
charge of his office and cleaned it up. Mr Rubin jokes that he was 'not
exactly wild' about the change.
So why is he a Democrat? He cites two main factors, one of the heart and one
of the head. The first is his family background. His father was a successful
and socially concerned New York lawyer, while a grandfather was a Democratic
leader in the city's Brooklyn borough, back in the days when local
politicians wielded immense powers of patronage.
'When I was a kid,' he recalls, 'my mother used to tell me these stories
about him - how the mayor would come over and they would all meet in the
basement and decide who the judges were.'
The second factor is his set of political beliefs. He describes himself as
'very pragmatic' on most economic policy issues, while on social affairs he
tends to be a centrist. 'But I'm a lot more comfortable trying to work out a
compromise position between there and people who are more liberal than I am
than between there and people who are more conservative.'
But how does he square the fact that Wall Street lives and breathes by the
interplay of free and transparent markets, while the Democrats have
traditionally been seen as the party of intervention and regulation?
Mr Rubin is not sure he would accept this description of the Democrats,
maintaining that President Jimmy Carter initiated airline deregulation and
talked of 'sunsetting' all regulations, though he did not act on this. Wall
Street's self-interest, he adds, lies in having policies which will lay the
foundations for long-term US economic success.
This is what he sees as the central electoral issue in a country which 'has
been very self-confident for a long time, but is now a country with a lot of
doubt and anxiety'.
'All the polls show there is a broad-based perception among the American
people that this country has serious, long-term structural issues which, if
not faced, are going to result in our continuing to have unsatisfactory
economic performance. I think the campaign is about who is going to best
recognise and address those issues.'
Naturally, he thinks Mr Clinton is that person. But how does Mr Rubin
respond to the widespread belief on Wall Street that the numbers do not add
up in the centrepiece of the Democrats' economic plans - a huge investment
in the nation's human and infrastructural capital while gradually reducing
the federal budget deficit. Sceptics say the investments cannot be achieved
without increasing the deficit, or raising taxes on the middle class, or
both.
He acknowledges that people can argue with the numbers, but adds that 'as
long as you have a trend down (in the deficit) and you're also engaged in a
lot of other constructive programmes, I think you're going to be doing a lot
that's very good for the economy.'
This guardedly bland response contrasts with the sudden, and unexpected,
passion with which he addresses what he thinks is 'absolutely one of the
most critical domestic issues' facing America - how to 'break the cycle of
poverty and disaffection' in the nation's urban ghettoes. It is, he says,
'an issue a lot of people just don't want to face'.
His response may seem a little surprising. Compassion for society's
underdogs would not seem to be a big Wall Street pre-occupation. That said,
a number of Wall Street firms run programmes which encourage employees to
act as mentors for the urban poor, providing help and advice to young
people, and Goldman is prominent in the movement.
Mr Rubin says that, apart from the obvious benefits of the scheme, 'it also
gives our people a sense of life beyond Wall Street, which I think is a
very, very healthy thing'.
By any measure Goldman has for years been one of Wall Street's most
successful investment banks. So what makes Goldman tick?
He thought that the most important factor was a strong corporate culture
which laid a heavy emphasis on teamwork and eschewed personal
aggrandisement. He says this matter-of-factly, without boy-scoutish airs,
and many analysts say it reflects a truth about the firm, the last big Wall
Street house to remain a private partnership.
Goldman's teamwork even extends to its unique practice of having two
chairmen for the group. Mr Rubin shares the job with Mr Stephen Friedman (a
Republican, incidentally) and says it is an 'extraordinary source of
strength. If a co-chairmanship works, one plus one equals far more than
two.'
It works in Goldman's case, he explains, because the two men have both been
with the partnership for about 25 years and share similar views on policy
matters. 'Neither of us,' he adds, 'has an ego structure that is invested in
the notion of being a chief executive officer.'
There are a fair number on Wall Street, jealous of Goldman's success, who
would enjoy seeing it fall on its face. These are the people who quietly
delighted last year in its embarrassment over its share trading connections
with the late Mr Robert Maxwell - a subject Mr Rubin declines to address for
legal reasons.
Linked to these feelings is the widespread belief that most large securities
houses with a long run of success are likely to succumb eventually to the
sin of hubris - the pride that comes before a tragic fall. Salomon Brothers,
enmeshed last year in a bond trading scandal, is just the latest example.
So how does Goldman guard against such tendencies? Mr Rubin quotes his
co-chairman, Mr Friedman, who once remarked that 'ego was the seminal sin of
the 80s' on Wall Street. That, says Mr Rubin, is 'one hell of a good
phrase'.
He says Goldman will always be prone to individual problems - because that
is the nature of a large organisation. But the firm's culture is designed to
discourage 'people who feel too full of themselves'. The message from top is
that 'when you start to believe in your own infallibility is when you really
are in big trouble'.
It is a message that might also serve the Clinton campaign well in the
run-up to November as it reflects on its remarkable lead in the polls.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Sterling in limelight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING will take the limelight in foreign currency trading this week as a
batch of indicators shows whether there are any signs of an economic upturn
in the UK, writes James Blitz.
Analysts believe that there are significant risks that the pound will break
new ground in its descent against the D-Mark in forthcoming days. Last
week's cut in interest rates on certain National Savings products unnerved
sterling investors because it suggested to them that the government will not
tighten monetary policy. July's fall in UK house prices also helped to bring
sterling down to DM2.8247, its lowest point against the D-Mark since Britain
joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990.
A host of economic indicators this week may underline sterling's fundamental
weakness. Thursday will be the most important day, bringing the unemployment
figures for July and the industrial production number for June, both of
which are likely to show the economy slowing down. Friday's Retail Prices
Index for July may bring some relief, showing that inflation is under
control.
Two factors may help save the pound's fall. The first is the threat of
intervention by the Bank of England, and many analysts believe that the
authorities will be waiting in the wings iof the piund falls below DM2.80.
Wednesday's weekly intervention by the Bundesbank in the German money market
is also important. Although the threat of a Lombard rate rise has been put
off, German call money is virtually at the Lombard rate level of 9.75 per
cent. If the Bundesbank adds liquidity to the market, this may slow
sterling's descent.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Economics: Few signs yet of UK upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC news in the UK gathers pace this week with data on inflation,
manufacturing output, unemployment, and credit business. The figures are not
expected to be particularly encouraging, so pressure on the government to
find a way of easing conditions looks set to continue.
Official figures on Thursday are forecast to show that output was flat in
June. This follows the latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly
survey, which indicated that the number of firms expecting higher output
over the next four months fell sharply in July compared with May.
The Central Statistical Office's index of manufacturing output rose for
three consecutive months at the beginning of the year - leading to
suggestions that manufacturing output had 'bottomed out' in the first
quarter - but disappointed expectations by falling in April and May.
Unemployment figures are expected to show another rise, although in June the
jobless total rose by a smaller than expected 7,000. The small drop was
probably erratic, as there are few signs in the real economy to suggest that
such a slowdown in unemployment growth is sustainable.
The following include some of the other economic highlights of the week,
with the median of economists' forecasts in brackets from MMS International,
a financial information company.
Today: UK, June credit business (Pounds 23m net repayment). Canada, June car
sales (up 0.5 per cent).
Tomorrow: UK, July producer prices index, input (flat on month, down 1.4 per
cent on year), output (up 0.1 per cent on month, up 3.5 per cent on year).
US, preliminary productivity. Canada, June unadjusted department store sales
(down 1 per cent on year), July housing starts (175,000). Japan, June
machinery orders. Australia, July retail trade (up 1.1 per cent on month, up
1.8 per cent Q2 on Q1).
Wednesday: US, July producer prices index (up 0.1 per cent), excluding food
and energy (up 0.2 per cent), June home completions. UK, Confederation of
British Industry regional industrial trends survey.
Thursday: US, July retail sales (up 0.3 per cent), excluding cars (up 0.5
per cent), July CPI (up 0.3 per cent), excluding food and energy (up 0.3 per
cent), initial claims for week ended August 1 (450,000), car sales August
1-10 (6.5m), July real earnings, money supply data for week ended August 3,
July M1 (up Dollars 8.6bn), July M2 (down Dollars 4.2bn), July M3 (down
Dollars 7.2bn). UK, July unemployment (up 25,000), June average earnings (up
6.25 per cent), June unit wage costs (up 2.1 per cent), June industrial
production (down 0.2 per cent), June manufacturing output (flat on month,
down 1.3 per cent on year). Spain, July CPI (up 1 per cent on month, up 5.9
per cent on year). Japan, July trade balance (Dollars 9.2bn surplus).
Australia, Q2 GDP (up 0.5 per cent on quarter).
Friday: US, July industrial production (up 0.2 per cent), July capacity
utilisation (78.5 per cent), June business inventories (up 0.3 per cent).
Canada, July advance department store sales. UK, July retail prices index
(flat on month, up 4.1 per cent on year), excluding mortgage interest
payments (up 4.8 per cent on year). Japan, June industrial production.
During the week: Germany, June capital account, July wholesale prices index
(down 0.1 per cent). Australia, June money supply data. Japan, July WPI (up
0.1 per cent on month, down 1.2 per cent on year).

Results Due
THREE of the biggest UK insurance companies will still be in the red when
they report pre-tax losses for the first half of 1992 this week. But with
rate increases in the home, motor and commercial insurance markets taking
hold and companies avoiding the weather losses of recent years, there are
some glints of light on the horizon.
General Accident, which reports tomorrow, is widely expected to do best with
pre-tax losses cut to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m compared to a
deficit of Pounds 105.2m at the same stage in 1991. GA may even have made a
small profit in the second quarter, according to some analysts.
Commercial Union, the most successful and aggressive UK insurer, is on
Wednesday expected to report losses of around Pounds 30m, a deterioration on
last year's Pounds 26.3m.
Royal Insurance, whose balance sheet is weakest, is on Thursday expected to
register losses of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m, compared to a deficit
of Pounds 97m last year.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report a significant
fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June when it announces its
results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen from Pounds
967m to around Pounds 760m. However, last year's results were boosted by
acquisition benefits. Net debt, which is US dollar denominated, is expected
to have fallen to Pounds 1.1bn because of the weakness of the dollar.
British Airways' first quarter figures tomorrow should reveal pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 90m compared Pounds 9m a year earlier. The market
will also be looking for news of progress on cost cutting, the recent deal
to take a Dollars 750m stake in USAir and clues over the impact of price
wars in the airline industry.

FT  10 AUG 92 / European Bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S government bond markets have two concerns: the prospect of higher
German interest rates and the risk that the French vote against ratification
of the Maastricht treaty, writes Sara Webb.
The fact that the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged after Thursday's
council meeting was greeted with relief in the bond markets. For although
the Bundesbank raised its discount rate as recently as July 16 - to 8.75 per
cent from 8.0 per cent - the markets have continued to fret about whether it
will raise the Lombard rate as well.
The bank remains concerned about German M3 growth, and is determined to pull
it back from 8.7 per cent to its target of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent.
However, the markets were relieved when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's
president, said on Thursday it saw no reason to raise the Lombard rate.
The other favourable news for the European bond markets was French opinion
polls showing firm support for ratifying Maastricht. Although the French
referendum on EMU is not until September 20, the European markets are likely
to remain hostage to the opinion polls. Wednesday's poll in Paris-Match
magazine showed 56 per cent favoured Maastricht, with 44 per cent against.
This boosted French and other European bonds.
However, while the main bond markets were encouraged by the news in Germany
and France, the Nordic markets were hit by a sudden rise in Finnish interest
rates. The Bank of Finland announced on Thursday it would raise its key
tender rate to 16 per cent from 14.62 per cent from today in an attempt to
stem the recent outflow of capital.
The news lifted Finnish yields immediately: that on the 11 per cent,
seven-year government bond climbed to 12.7 per cent on Thursday, against
12.3 per cent the previous Friday. Swedish bond yields were also pushed up.
However, after Finland announced economic measures on Thursday night to calm
the markets, Nordic yields fell and the seven-year Finnish bond yield
dropped to 12.52 per cent on Friday.

FT  10 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs figures fail to indicate firm
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL WEEK the US bond market waited for the July jobs numbers. After they
arrived on Friday morning, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to
just 7.39 per cent, the lowest since early January.
The market's gloomy assessment of the economy's prospects came in sharp
contrast to President Bush's rallying words from the White House. Where the
president saw a nation 'poised for a strong recovery', bond traders saw
employment numbers inflated by temporary summer jobs. And where the
president saw growth - 'albeit anaemic' - the bond market saw only the
inklings of any improvement.
The question then remains: will the Federal Reserve step in with yet another
interest rate cut, and if so, when.
The jobs numbers looked acceptable at first glance. The unemployment rate
edged down to 7.7 per cent last month from 7.8 per cent in June, and
non-farm payrolls climbed by 198,000 jobs - the largest monthly rise in two
years.
As anticipated, payroll employment was lifted by 75,000, thanks to the
federally funded summer jobs programme. The programme formed part of
emergency legislation passed after the Los Angeles riots, and is designed to
provide summer employment for economically disadvantaged people in their
late teens and early twenties.
So most pundits expect the 75,000 jobs which showed up in the July
employment report to fall out of the September figures. That did leave a
more genuine 123,000 increase in employment last month. However, closer
inspection of the figures also showed that this was concentrated exclusively
in the service sector.
Any improvement is modest. As one analyst was quick to point out, the
increase in private sector jobs during the past two months has numbered less
than 30,000. That is not the sort of advance which suggests a firm recovery
is under way. Accordingly, bond prices, which had been yo-yoing for most of
the week, rose fairly sharply on Friday. The long bond gained almost  7/8 of
a point, and the yield dropped from Thursday's 7.45 per cent.
Whether such gloomy data prompts a new interest rate cut is a moot point.
The corporate reporting season was presentable. Only certain problem sectors
threw up bad numbers. Even General Motors last week announced reduced
second-quarter losses, although it warned that the second half of 1992 would
be tough.
Given the distortions to the July jobs figures and the limited signs of
progress, it seems unlikely that anything will happen in a hurry.
'We do not expect any major monetary policy changes to be implemented
between now and year-end,' suggested Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall
Street brokerage, in the wake of Friday's data. 'This will leave the
discount rate and funds rate in December at 3 per cent and 3.25 per cent
respectively.'
With these considerations in mind, the market's main focus this week will be
on inflation numbers and July retail sales figures. There seems little cause
for concern on the first score: there is plainly no evidence of inflationary
steam and the producer price index is expected to show a rise of about 0.1
per cent for the month, with the consumer price index gaining an equally
modest 0.2 per cent. Retail sales during July are thought to have worsened,
but largely due to car sales. With auto sales excluded, the market is
anticipating a modest advance, in the order of 0.5 per cent.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Italian Bonds: Amato still has a long way to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR GIULIANO Amato, Italy's premier, were a film star, he would be
gloating over the rave reviews which greeted his latest venture. But for Mr
Amato, this is just the beginning: he still has a long way to go before the
markets are convinced he has the stomach - and political backing - to take
on Italy's debt burden and win.
The enthusiasm that rippled through the markets last week followed agreement
between trades unions, industrialists and the government to scrap Italy's
scala mobile, which has linked wages to inflation for nearly half a century.
The deal has yet to be concluded, and a backlash from the more militant
Italian unions is possible - though the risk is ruled out in most quarters.
The ending of inflation-linked wage rises could wipe 1 per cent off the
country's inflation rate in the medium term. The rate could be down to 3 per
cent by end-1995, compared with 3.9 per cent if the scala mobile had been
retained.
The rise in Italian government bonds last week was nearly as extravagant as
the praise from the pundits. The gross yield on 10-year BTPs fell to 13.45
per cent from 14.14 per cent a week before. The advance was spurred by the
Bank of Italy's 0.5 point cut in the discount rate to 13.25 per cent,
reversing in part two recent rises made to defend the lira. With public debt
the size of Italy's though, every cut in interest rates helps. A full point
off rates would save the Italian Treasury nearly L15,000bn a year  - or
around 10 per cent of this year's budget deficit. Mr Amato's credibility
rests on his battle against that deficit. His emergency budget may have
calmed fears about this year's deficit, but far more important will be the
budget for 1993, due this autumn. This is one of the two factors
overshadowing Italian bonds. The other is Maastricht. Whatever the
administration's successes in tackling domestic problems, foreign investors
are unlikely to return in any numbers until the road to monetary union is
cleared opening the way for the convergence of European bond yields.

FT  10 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Ecu dealers seek agreement on trading
practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOOM and gloom which had descended on the Ecu bond market, after weeks
of price declines and evaporating liquidity, was partially lifted last week,
as the market staged a 1 1/2 point recovery.
However, traders are still adjusting to a new environment, following
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty on June 2, which signalled the
loss of the Ecu bond market's status as a government bond market. The 44
marketmakers in Ecu bonds recognised by the International Securities Market
Association are meeting tonight in an effort to find a consensus on trading
practices.
Although market conditions have stabilised since marketmakers suspended
trading for a day two weeks ago, the impressive liquidity once boasted by
the Ecu bond market has not returned.
It is 'clearly functioning as a market again', said Mr David Ovenden, Ecu
product manager at JP Morgan, who chairs ISMA's Ecu sub-committee. 'But we
need to work out what (bid/offer) spreads to trade on in the next few
months.'
In the wake of the suspension of marketmaking, forced by chaotic selling,
marketmakers widened the spread between bid (buy) and offer (sell) prices to
20 basis points for the most liquid issues. Last week, the spread was
successfully cut to 10 basis points. However, some deals (by the European
Investment Bank and Italy) were removed from the list of most liquid
benchmarks and the 15 basis point spread set for the next tier of bonds was
not adhered to systematically.
'We have to strike a balance between the aggressive risk-takers and those
who would prefer to see wider spreads,' Mr Ovenden said. 'But we have to be
mindful of the technical realities - that is, the underlying business
flows,' when setting spreads, he added. The fact is that in spite of the
market's return from the brink, most analysts remain sceptical about the
extent of buying by end-investors. Short positions in specific issues, or
systematic support by sponsors of the market may account for at least part
of the recovery, traders reckon.
Indeed, many traders say that the former liquidity of the market - equal to
some European government bond markets - was never justified by investor
demand, but was artificially generated by the bullish stance of banks and
securities houses, keen to establish a foothold in the European bond market
of the future. Then, strategic motivation outweighed costs; now that the
future of European monetary union is less than assured, banks' willingness
to commit resources to the market is on the wane.
Marketmakers have decided to find out what proportion of trading volume is
generated by inter-professional dealing, by monitoring figures provided by
Trax, ISMA's trade-matching system. By comparing these figures with the
volume recorded by Euroclear and Cedel, the market's clearing houses, the
ratio between investor-driven and inter-dealer business can be established.
Many traders expect it will show the sector is still overbroked.
Today's meeting could also herald the departure of at least a couple of
firms from the throng of 44 marketmakers (Credit Suisse Luxembourg has
already thrown in the towel). At least half the number of nominal
marketmakers were not performing their intended function, according to
dealers, with accusations of 'not picking up phones' still rife.
In spite of the decline in liquidity, the market is still more liquid than
any other sector of the Eurobond market, including the Eurodollar bond
market.
There are other positive signs. As the market rallied last week, the spread
between Ecu bonds and the theoretical yield curve (based on the yields of
the Ecu's component currencies) narrowed to about 15 basis points. Prior to
the Danish referendum, Ecu bond yields were substantially lower than the
theoretical yield curve, but during the panic selling of recent weeks, the
pick-up of Ecu bonds over the theoretical curve rose to 35 basis points.
Long-dated Ecu bonds - 15-year, 20-year and 30-year bonds - which
substantially underperformed the rest of the market on the way down, also
picked up lost ground last week. Dealers said that very long-dated Ecu bonds
had undoubtedly been oversold, amid speculation that some might not be
repaid.
It is hard to fathom how strong support for the market is at current levels.
(The 10-year OAT is yielding about 9.4 per cent, compared with 9.65 per cent
a week ago.)
Last week's rally was generated by a more buoyant mood in other European
markets. In particular, the agreement on wages in Italy and two French
opinion polls predicting majority votes for Maastricht in the September
referendum.
Neither piece of news marks a change of outlook for the Ecu market. Any
potential setback, such as a rate hike by the Bundesbank, could generate an
exaggerated response in the Ecu market.
The Matif has increased the daily price fluctuation limit on its Ecu bond
future contract from 150 basis points to 250 basis points, to take account
of the market's increasing volatility. The exchange has increased the
initial margin requirement from Ecu1,500 to Ecu3,000. The margin for a
straddle, which consists of two opposite positions in the same futures
contract with different delivery months, has been raised to Ecu6,000. These
changes take effect on Wednesday.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has decided
not to change its Bund futures contract to include bonds issued by Germany's
Treuhandanstalt or the European Recovery Programme, the government agencies
charged with funding the regeneration of the former East Germany.
The Treuhand is due to make its debut in the bond market in the autumn,
raising up to DM10bn. However, while the December and March contracts will
not be altered, the Liffe board reserved the right to include the agencies'
issues for the June 1993 contract.
Germany's Deutsche Terminborse has announced that Treuhand bonds will be
included under its rival Bund contract. Deliverability into the Liffe
contract would have provided a further lift to demand.

FT  10 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Backing into a grim future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HOWEVER much Mr Lamont may hope that he can prove Bellman's Law
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'What I say three times is true' - the slump draws visibly nearer every
week. For what he and the prime minister have said three times (and it must
be 30 times by now) is not true; and his obedient echoes in the more
thuggish parts of the gilt and currency markets are equally misguided.
They are all living in the recent past; but it is not like the present,
which resembles a nastier and more distant past. You don't believe it?
Compare their key assertions against the facts.
On the strategy: the French strong-currency route is the only way. 'And
there is absolutely no reason why we cannot do the same,' says Mr Lamont.
Fact: we are not following the French route at all. The franc was devalued
several times after the policy change of 1983. In spite of this, it took
nearly a decade of sub-normal growth in a world boom, topped off by a German
inflation, to make the franc half-credible; and French unemployment is still
rising.
We are trying to repeat the experiment with no devaluation, no boom, and no
hope. There is every reason why we cannot follow the French route, even if
it might have been the right one 10 years ago.
On the alternatives: a devaluation would raise inflation (this assertion is
simply built into the model which has got everything else wrong), and so
have no effect.
Again, it sounds half plausible if you are insular enough; but it is wrong.
Devaluing in a depressed economy does not have this effect. The French
devaluations did not raise inflation, nor did the massive US devaluation
since 1986, or the 10 per cent Irish devaluation of that year. Nor, for that
matter, did the much larger British devaluation after the 1981 Budget. And
after all of them, even within the ERM, interest rates soon resumed a
falling trend.
About the objective: fast reliable growth requires low inflation. Look at
Japan, for example.
Well, look at Japan. Through its most dynamic period, inflation averaged
more than 7 per cent a year. But this did not undermine competitiveness, for
the prices of traded goods made in Japan did not rise at all. The inflation
was an internal adjustment to a productivity explosion in manufacturing.
This is a path Britain actually could follow, thanks to the genuine Thatcher
productivity revolution. But not if the economy remains in slump.
On the constraints: all the alternatives are ruled out, because the markets
would never permit them.
I hear similar nonsense from arrogant young puppies in the gilts market
every day; and US bond dealers used to make similar threats about funding
the Dollars 400bn US deficit. They are all guilty of closed-market thinking.
Nowadays we work in a world capital market, in which a few billion more or
less on British government borrowing is barely noticeable. And we have
indexed gilts. Crowding out in the London market, if it ever existed (the
term 'buyers' market' is much more accurate), it ended a decade ago.
And worst of all, what they don't say: that at some stage, and it could be a
matter of weeks rather than months, the markets will wake up before the
government does, conclude that the present policy will break down anyway,
and plunge us into a sterling crisis that really could close most of the
sensible options.
This scenario is beginning to appear in some of the more thoughtful brokers'
circulars (especially the more monetarist ones). Is anyone in the Treasury
even thinking about the pre-emptive action which could be needed if this
threatens to become the majority view?
If not, they should be thinking about the past; not the dead days of the
1970s, but the last financial slump in the 1930s. The path Mr Major is
treading is not that of President Mitterand, but that of the pre-war Labour
government, which wrecked the party for three Parliaments; or that of the
equally anti-inflationary Chancellor Bruning of the Weimar republic, which
wrecked German democracy. If policies must be borrowed from the past, choose
the relevant past.

KEMPER Corporation, the large Chicago-based insurance and financial services
group, continued to be battered by investment losses in property and junk
bonds during the second quarter.
For the three months to June, it recorded net losses of Dollars 10m, or 20
cents per share, compared with net profits of Dollars 53.1m, or Dollars 1.10
per share, a year earlier.
The results for the second quarter included after-tax investment losses of
Dollars 30.8m, or 63 cents per share, compared with after-tax investment
gains of Dollars 800,000, or 2 cents.
The company also took an after-tax charge of Dollars 14.8m for provisions
against losses on property.
Adding to the company's woes, Kemper Securities, its securities brokerage,
had to take Dollars 13.2m out of operating earnings for an after-tax
increase in its legal reserves.
While Mr David Mathias, Kemper Corp's chairman, said margins in the group's
life insurance business improved over the first quarter, life insurance
recorded net losses of Dollars 11.5m down from net profits of Dollars 3.5m.

FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Smith New Court survey shows enthusiasm
remains for bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT managers remain more enthusiastic about bonds than equities,
according to a survey by Gallup, the research group for Smith New Court, the
broker.
The survey of 97 institutions, which manage funds worth Pounds 547bn, found
that confidence in most equity markets' prospects over the coming year has
slackened.
Fund managers are also cautious about the short-term prospects for equities,
with the exception of the UK market.
On balance, fund managers intend to reduce their exposure to US equities and
increase their weightings of UK, other European and Japanese shares,
although their enthusiasm for UK and other European equities has fallen.
Investors' enthusiasm for bonds is particularly directed towards overseas
markets. UK gilts generally remain in favour, but support for index-linked
gilts has waned.
The institutions are cautious about the UK economy's prospects of recovery
in 1993. Almost one in five managers expect no improvement in the economic
conditions by this time next year, and one in ten expect economic conditions
to worsen.
Investors have downgraded their expectations of earnings per share growth to
5 per cent in 1992 and 9 per cent in 1993.
They expect base rates to fall by only 1 per cent to 9 per cent and gilt
yields to 8.7 per cent in 12 months time.
However, investors' expectations about inflation have improved. Their
forecast of 3.1 per cent growth in the retail price index in 1993, compares
with 3.5 per cent in the last survey in July.
The survey found that support for the UK's membership of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism has not changed over the last 18 months, with 72 per cent of
respondents in favour and 22 per cent against.

<TEXT>
ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, has reduced first-half
pre-tax losses, before extraordinary items, to NKr189m (Dollars 32.4m), down
from NKr195m a year earlier.
It also announced the sale of its Elkem Eiendom property business, for
NKr222.5m cash to Gjelsten &amp; Roekke Eiendom, an Oslo property developer.
Elkem said the disposal of the subsidiary with properties valued at NKr400m
would produce a net gain of NKr50m in the third quarter.
The sale, together with the recent disposal of a 50 per cent stake in
Elkem-Rockwool will reduce group debt of NKr6.36bn by between NKr500m and
NKr600m.
However, group first-half pre-tax losses increased to NKr189m from NKr16m.
Elkem said that last year's figure included a NKr179m gain from the disposal
of Alcoa Nederland, in which it held 50 per cent.
Elkem, nevertheless, reversed last year's first-half operating losses of
NKr44m to operating profits of NKr30m.
Group sales dipped 2 per cent to NKr3.818bn from NKr3.897bn and operating
costs were reduced by 4.5 per cent to NKr3.590bn from NKr3.747bn.
Elkem saw a big improvement in the second quarter, achieving operating
profits of NKr37m, a turnround from losses of NKr7m in the first quarter and
losses of NKr20m in last year's second quarter.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the
long-term debt of Skandinaviska-Enskilda Banken (S-E Banken), Sweden's
leading private commercial bank, to A plus from AA minus. This is the second
time in less than four months that S-E Banken's debt has been downgraded.
S&amp;P said the decision reflected the continuing deterioration of SEB's asset
quality, together with the increased pressure on earnings caused by the
rapid build-up of non-performing loans, especially in the sharply declining
Swedish real estate sector.
The 'large build-up of non-performing loans and renegotiated loans' meant 'a
more rapid decline of the bank's underlying core profitability than was
anticipated'. S&amp;P also pointed out that the bank's 'historically strong
level of core earnings' had come 'under considerable pressure' and this had
reduced its ability to absorb higher credit losses.
S&amp;P had placed the bank on credit watch on June 23.

THE future of the New York Daily News, the cash-strapped tabloid newspaper,
could become clearer this week as the intricate negotiations over its future
ownership come to a head.
Last week, the judge overseeing the paper's bankruptcy proceedings, set a
deadline of August 17 as the time by which the paper must submit a
reorganisation plan. In reality, however, this means there is intense
pressure on management and unions to select one of three suitors in the next
few days and move to close a deal next week.
Over the weekend, there were unconfirmed reports that the bidders were asked
to have final offers on the table by this afternoon, an extension from
Saturday night. The bidders include Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News
and World Report magazine, Mr Conrad Black, publisher of the Daily Telegraph
in London, and a so-called 'stand-alone' plan under which Silver Screen, a
group of film financiers would join forces with the management.
The Daily News filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of
the US Bankruptcy Code in November, following the sudden death of Mr Robert
Maxwell, the British publisher and its owner.

FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Ewart launches attack on challenger's
motives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Ewart, the Belfast-based property company where the largest
shareholder has challenged the position of four directors, yesterday accused
it of trying to gain effective control without making an offer.
The shareholder is Monarch Properties, a private Dublin-based property
concern owning 29.2 per cent of Ewart.
It has requisitioned an egm for September 4 in Belfast seeking the removal
of four Ewart directors and the appointment of two of its nominees.
Mr Philip Monahan, who heads Monarch and is already on Ewart's board, would
become its deputy chairman if the changes went ahead.
In rejecting the proposals, Mr Derek Tughan, chairman of Ewart, alleged that
Monarch was heavily borrowed, had a high-risk strategy and would try to push
its assets into Ewart.
According to Mr Tughan, past attempts to get Ewart to buy Monarch assets
included a stud farm near Mr Monahan's residence.
Mr Monahan also wrote to Ewart shareholders at the weekend. He said the
company was misguided 'to eschew all involvement in Southern Ireland'.
He also strongly defended Monarch's record - stressing the avoidance of
speculative development - and described its financial position as robust. He
said Monarch had no plans to switch assets between the two companies, but
this would not be ruled out. Any such moves would have to comply with the
takeover code and stock exchange rules.

FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Aberfoyle into administration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberfoyle Holdings, the agriculture and security products group, is being
placed into administration and had its shares suspended at 2 1/2 p last
Friday.
The majority of operations are in Zimbabwe. The company said its financial
position had 'deteriorated to the point where it had insufficient sterling
funds to enable it to continue to trade'.
Last November a group of dissident shareholders won control of the board,
and promised to put the company back on its feet.
But Mr Kojo Owusu-Nyantekyi, one of the dissidents and now a member of the
board, and whose private company Crescent Africa holds a 26 per cent stake
said at the week-end: 'This was all foreseen last year. The cost cutting
exercise was not enough. I am very disappointed'.

FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Forte's review likely to include board
reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotels and restaurant group whose shares have recently been under
pressure in the stock market, is reviewing the make-up of its board,
including the position of its octogenarian chairman Lord Forte.
Although the City has been concerned about the poor performance of the hotel
business during the recession and the failure to sell the contract catering
arm, it is understood that the review stems from the group's efforts to
refocus its activities and the age profile of the directors.
Options include the possible elevation of Lord Forte to the position of
president, a post now held by former chairman Lord Thorneycroft. Lord
Forte's son Rocco, who runs the business as chief executive, would then
either become chairman or the role would be made non-executive.
If he complies with the trend towards separating the roles of chairman and
chief executive, a new number two position of chief operating officer may be
created. Mr Alan Hearn, managing director of the hotels division, is one of
the potential internal candidates.
The management review, which also penetrates below board level to tackle
such questions as whether each division needs its own headquarters,
coincides with Forte's effort to focus on hotels, restaurants and
continental expansion. It also fits in with measures to reduce gearing and
cut costs.
The downgrading of profit forecasts and the diminishing of the group's
previously high stock market rating have sent the share price to less than
140p, compared with a 12-month high of 262p.
One of the themes of the review would be to replace the old guard with new
blood, particularly at the non-executive level. The current four include Mr
Eric Hartwell and Mr Donald Durban, both of whom are retired executives of
the group whose careers with Forte go back to the late 1930s.
Sir Charles Hardie, deputy chairman, has been a director since 1970, and the
latest addition on the non-executive side is Sir David McNee, who has served
nine years.
Among the 10 executive directors, a couple of approaching retirements and
the proposed sale of the Gardner Merchant contract catering business will
offer scope for streamlining the structure under Rocco. One possible new
appointment might be Mr Tony Monnickendam, head of the restaurant division.

sale of Percs
</HEADLINE>

   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest US commercial bank, is planning to raise Dollars 650m
of new capital via the sale of preferred equity redemption cumulative stock
(Percs).
Percs are a form of quasi-equity devised by Morgan Stanley, and offer a
higher yield to investors than ordinary shares.
They gained popularity last year, with previous issuers including the likes
of K mart, Sears, Roebuck and General Motors.
Under the terms of the Citicorp stock sale, which will take the form of a
public offering of 32.5m depositary shares, buyers of the Percs will receive
a dividend on their stock for up to three years.
At this point, each share of preferred stock would convert into one Citicorp
common share.
Citicorp would have the option of converting the preferred stock to common
shares at an earlier date, and the terms of the conversion could vary
depending on the price of the bank's common shares.

FT  10 AUG 92 / London's role in forex threatened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S position as the foreign exchange capital of the world is under
threat because of the changing nature of foreign currency trading in Europe,
according to a report by Greenwich Associates, an influential US think tank.
The report says the volume of cross-border currency trading in Europe has
doubled in the last two years with an increasing focus on bilateral currency
trading between individual European countries.
The researchers also discovered a growing debate over whether Europe should
have a single centre for foreign exchange or several centres, in which
London would be a first among equals.
The report says cross-border trading has developed as protectionist barriers
have fallen in the EC. Companies are trading more actively in the
D-Mark/peseta cross, for example, because the amount of bilateral trade
between Spain and Germany creates large currency flows.
But there is also growing unease in Europe about London's role as foreign
exchange centre.
European corporate treasurers were concerned at the handling of the default
of some local authorities on their swap obligations; the BCCI affair; and
the number of large corporations running into financial difficulties.
The study also discovered that UK companies are far more conservative than
their European counterparts in the use of currency hedging techniques for
profit. Of the UK corporate treasurers that were interviewed for the report,
only 6 per cent said that they actively use risk management products such as
swaps and options, compared with 22 per cent of European treasurers.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Employers cannot make law on disabled work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report ('Most employers found to flout disabled quotas law',
August 3) misses the point. Employers cannot make this law work. The quota
system is unsatisfactory and there is no obvious way of making it effective,
as the Department of Employment's 1990 Consultative Document 'Employment and
Training for People with Disabilities' clearly stated.
According to a study by Social and Community Planning Research carried out
for the government in 1990, if all people with disabilities in work were
registered, the likelihood is that the 3 per cent quota level would be
exceeded. But there is no compulsion to register and many people with
disabilities object strongly to such categorisation.
People with disabilities can be exceptionally valuable employees. More
employers need to be aware of what they can offer and how they can be
developed - many managers, for example, remain unaware of their generally
favourable sickness records.
For that reason the CBI has urged the government to replace the outmoded and
inoperable quota system with a strengthened and improved code of good
practice and to create a more effective framework of encouragement, training
and support. Until such a change in policy is effected, studies will
inevitably show the quota system failing to work.

Sir, One of the many questions not even raised in the recent Government
White Paper on the future of the education service, 'Choice and Diversity',
is the relationship of the council tax to expenditure on education. The

Who will then be responsible for raising the council tax to finance its part

FT  10 AUG 92 / New scripts for Bush and Clinton: The end of the cold war
has recast the foreign policy debate in this year's US presidential campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign policy has a way of inserting itself into presidential elections.
The confrontation with Iraq and the tragedy in what was Yugoslavia may have
been boiling for months, but neither had quite thrust themselves into the
forefront of an election supposedly to be determined principally on domestic
issues. Yet, when either George Bush or Bill Clinton wakes up on the morning
of November 4, the loser may well find the names of both countries written
in the political obituaries. This was not in the pre-ordained script.
In the good old days of the cold war, the playing of the foreign policy card
in presidential elections was predictable. The Republican candidate would
accuse his Democratic opponent of being soft on communism, weak on defence
and, if pushed to the partisan extreme, would point out that US
participation in this century's three big wars (two global and Vietnam) was
initiated by Democratic presidents.
The Democrat would preach the virtues of an enlightened approach to the rest
of the world, based on humanitarian values, shared international
responsibilities and a leaner military establishment. Republicans used to
hold the United Nations in contempt and the Democrats half-heartedly would
extol it.
There have been variations on the basic theme, mostly from the Democrats. In
1960 John Kennedy sought to be 'tougher' than Richard Nixon over Cuba and
China, and in 1964 Lyndon Johnson got away with portraying Barry Goldwater
as a nuclear adventurist (which was not difficult). Jimmy Carter's
successful campaign of 1976 was probably the closest to the Democratic norm,
but he was swamped four years later by his own Iranian albatross and by
Ronald Reagan's equally classical Republican slogan of 'peace through
strength'. This was enough to carry George Bush to victory in 1988 even
though the 'evil empire' had become quite emollient. It still features in
his speeches today.
There are two quantum differences this year. First, the cold war is dead and
buried alongside the corpse of the Soviet Union, presenting a different set
of challenges to the presentation of foreign policy by the two candidates.
Second, as recent events merely confirmed, Mr Clinton does not fit the
Democratic type; indeed, he sometimes seems to have lifted a lot, with
nuances, from the Republican handbook.
The Clinton logic is to accept that the cold war is over, not to quibble
over why, but instead to try and solve new problems. Anthony Lake, his
foreign policy adviser, says: 'At a moment when history has turned,
experience is not necessarily the first qualification.' The Bush premise is
to explain why it was won, his role in the victory and to argue that the
experience gained is too invaluable to discard in still tricky times,
exemplified by Iraq and Bosnia.
This could make for a fascinating general dialectic if the country was
listening. As Mr Bush likes to point out with scorn, the Democratic nominee
devoted precisely 143 words - or one minute - of his 54-minute acceptance
speech to his convention to foreign policy. But Mr Clinton is probably
closer to the public ear than is Mr Bush, insulated in the White House
cocoon.
The president will make much of his Gulf war victory when he speaks to his
convention in Houston next week and is wheeling out Mr Reagan for an opening
night keynote address on foreign policy. But Mr Bush's own advisers concede
that things have changed to the point that military involvement between now
and election day, especially in a Balkan quagmire that few understand, might
produce little political profit. That credit, the argument goes, was used up
by the Gulf war and could only be restored by the removal, by whatever
mysterious hand, of Saddam Hussein.
Still, Mr Bush would be politically dumb not to capitalise on the fact that
only in foreign policy is he considered the more competent. If he can catch
Mr Clinton with his formal inexperience showing, he might be on to
something. Gerald Ford's silly mistake in the 1976 debate, when he asserted
there was no Soviet military subjection of Poland, knocked his campaign off
track for a fateful couple of weeks.
The problem is that many of Mr Clinton's positions differ little from his
own. Mr Clinton has always supported financial aid to Russia, even when his
party wanted it switched to US cities. He might be a little tougher on
China, a little gentler on Israel and, again recently, a little bolder on
Bosnia, but mostly he has supported whatever Mr Bush has said, including
over the latest confrontation with Saddam Hussein.
More than this, as in domestic policy, the Clinton foreign team has been
phenomenally quick with its responses, so that no allegation appears on the
evening news without an appropriate answer. When accused by the White House
of being 'reckless' for advocating selective, UN-sanctioned bombing to
relieve Sarajevo, there was Mr Clinton instantly citing an administration
source (Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, no less) for having said
exactly the same thing. He now has Mr Bush himself to adduce in evidence.
When charged with equivocal support for the Gulf war, the immediate counter
was that Mr Bush's 'coddling' of the Iraqi president in the 1980s had not
done much good either.
This does make for entertaining verbal chess, demonstrating at least that Mr
Clinton is no Michael Dukakis, who had no foreign policy at all. But it
hardly amounts to the presentation of an alternative vision to set against
the Bush record, and it does not take account of the advantages from foreign
policy that any incumbent president can bring to bear on a domestic
electorate. Some of them may be more apparent than real, but in Mr Bush's
case this year these potentially include:
The Middle East. The axiomatic Republican target is to get 30 per cent of
the traditionally Democratic Jewish vote. Mr Clinton has been most
solicitous towards Jewish constituencies, not least by keeping the Rev Jesse
Jackson at arm's length, as well as by standing four-square behind Israel
even when Yitzhak Shamir was prime minister.
But that still looks thin compared with some of the achievements of the Bush
administration. Not for political nothing is Mr Yitzhak Rabin coming here
this week, with peace talks resuming in Washington on August 24. It is
likely that the Arab and Palestinian representatives would prefer a
continuation of the Bush approach to the uncertainties of a new US
administration.
Eastern Europe. There are, according to the 1990 census, 9.4m Americans of
Polish ancestry, 3.5m Czechs and Slovaks, 2.9m Russians, 1.6m Hungarians,
810,000 Lithuanians and 740,000 Ukrainians. Many are working-class Reagan
Democrats and many approve of Mr Bush's role in facilitating the transition
of their countries of origin to democracy. The Poles will take particular
note of the endorsement Mr Bush received in Warsaw last month from President
Lech Walesa.
Hispanics. More than 17m Americans speak Spanish as a first language. The
Cubans, concentrated in Florida, wholeheartedly approved of Mr Bush's
refusal to shake hands with Fidel Castro in Rio in June. The US-Mexican
business community supports the North American Free Trade Agreement, of
which Mr Clinton is increasingly critical, and may be influential in getting
out what is normally a low but Democratic-leaning Hispanic vote.
Western Europe. Mr Bush may try to call in some Euro-chips. He virtually
endorsed John Major before the UK elections, while previous German
chancellors have publicly preferred a Republican. But no post-Thatcher
European leader has much of a following in the US and Lady Thatcher's recent
column in The New York Times on Bosnia was not complimentary to Mr Bush. Mr
Clinton, neither an isolationist nor a protectionist, is also, for Europe,
probably the least threatening Democratic candidate in years.
But the political calculations must also be placed in a broader context.
Whatever Mr Bush and Mr Clinton say and hope, neither has succeeded yet in
laying out what might be described as anything other than the chapter
headings for their new world orders.
The sceptical foreign policy establishment view was very well put recently
by Winston Lord, the former US ambassador to China and chairman of a recent
commission sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to
examine the US place in a changing world. 'Leaders and aspiring leaders have
taken two actions with respect to foreign policy - run away or run it down.
We see no coherent vision at home or abroad to guide us towards the next
century - not from the executive and not from Congress, not from the
president and not from his opponents,' he said.
Certainly neither talks much about the perennial issue of US military
presence overseas, though both accept it will be cut, more deeply by Mr
Clinton. Both support Nato as an article of faith, though they differ on the
edges of its role, and neither has broached the balance of the security
treaty with Japan. Mr Bush says Mr Clinton has already relegated the US to
the status of a second-class power, but the president has himself disowned
the Pentagon strategic blueprint which sought to preserve US military
hegemony. Both support the UN, with Mr Clinton recommending that Japan and
Germany be admitted to the Security Council.
Other foreign policy experts complain that the Republican administration
after 12 years in power has finally run out of steam and ideas, as witnessed
at the Munich summit and again by its recent hesitancy on both the Balkan
and Iraqi counts. James Baker, the secretary of state, may be good at
'fixing things' but he is presumably about to move back to manage the
troubled re-election campaign, itself, as Mr Clinton points out, a
reflection of Mr Bush's current priorities.
Mr Baker also has his critics. They cite his invisibility immediately after
the Kuwait invasion and his long disinterest in Yugoslavia and in the
Uruguay Round trade talks, in both cases only belatedly re-awakened. They
point to a lack of US clarity towards the faltering process of European
integration with the new democracies to its east. Mr Clinton sums it up by
describing an administration which has become 'rudderless and reactive'.
Neither candidate disagrees with the general proposition that for the US to
retain its pre-eminence, it must revitalise itself at home. But differences
over how best to accomplish this brings the election debate full circle to
where it started - with foreign policy on the margins and both candidates
saying 'trust me'. The debate was certainly more distinct when the cold war
was raging and, if push comes to shove in either the Balkans or Iraq, it may
become more distinct again.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Using force in the Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFRONTED with the escalating conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the
mounting evidence of barbaric behaviour by the parties, it is hard to avoid
an overwhelming sense of helplessness. Understandably, western public
opinion clamours for military intervention to halt the fighting, or to
mitigate its worst excesses. Equally understandably, western governments
approach that idea with the utmost caution, seeking ways to avoid exposing
their own soldiers to mortal danger on the ground.
Yet events have developed a logic that poses a stark choice for political
leaders in western Europe and the US: either they can seize the initiative
now and start making a clear-headed calculation of how they might sensibly
use force; or they will face the danger of being sucked into the conflict in
an ill-planned and ineffective fashion.
Which way will they go? So far, the signs are not encouraging. President
George Bush, gripped by pre-election paralysis, says he will go along with
any course of action agreed in the United Nations Security Council but
states flatly that he will not succumb to political pressure to send troops
no matter what the circumstances. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, proposes enhancing the UN relief effort by setting up armed aid
convoys, but on a basis so modest as to be almost irrelevant. Meanwhile, the
voices urging direct military intervention on one side of the conflict - to
punish Serbia and its Bosnian proxies, to 'take out' their heavy weaponry,
or even, as Lady Thatcher has proposed, to arm their Moslem enemies - grow
louder all the time.
Misguided voices
Those voices are misguided. True, offensive action against the Serbs might
serve to suppress the worst of the fighting for a while - for example, by
destroying artillery emplacements or tanks. But to have such an impact force
would have to be used on a massive scale and over a protracted period; given
the highly localised nature of much of the fighting, it would almost
certainly entail bloodshed among civilians as well as among the foreign
troops reminiscent of the Lebanese civil war. Nor, although the Serbs bear a
disproportionate share of the blame for the conflict, are they by any means
the only guilty party.
Doing nothing, however, is no longer an option. The Serbs' deliberate
strategy of grabbing land and driving Bosnian Moslems from their homes is so
morally repugnant as to cry out for a response. It is creating a refugee
problem that will haunt the rest of Europe for years, if not decades. And
there is a constant danger that unless the west is seen to act, the conflict
will spread, dragging in neighbouring and Middle Eastern countries and
setting a precedent that will be noted by would-be dictators all over the
former Soviet empire.
No guarantee
These problems are vast and intractable; no strategy to confront or contain
them is assured of success. But there are practical ways in which the
application of western force might help.
First, European countries and the US - perhaps working through Nato, under
authorisation from the UN Security Council - could undertake a significant
expansion of the humanitarian relief effort, backed by military force on a
scale sufficient to ensure its reliability. The mission would be to
establish permanent relief corridors from the Adriatic and from Sarajevo
airport to besieged Bosnian cities; any violent attempt to interfere with it
would be met with equivalent force. Second, air and sea power might be
deployed to tighten and strengthen sanctions on Serbia, establishing a
blockade on its borders, its airspace, on trade routes such as the Danube
and on its supply lines to its surrogates in Bosnia. Third, military
assistance could be provided for the establishment and protection of 'safe
zones' for displaced persons close to their homes. This needs to be
accompanied by the provision of adequate refugee facilities further afield -
including in Britain.
All these forms of action must now be explored in practical detail, at the
same time as the diplomacy continues in yet another international conference
in London. From now on, western governments will have to consider force as
an inescapable complement to diplomacy. It is time to weigh the scale and
purpose of military intervention rather than to debate its need.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Personal View: Hard lessons of Somalia's suffering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The violence and famine unfolding in Somalia have left many people - both
inside and outside the international relief agencies - shocked and shamed by
their inability to prevent one of the world's most dire humanitarian
disasters.
Few participants in the relief effort will emerge from the catastrophe with
their reputations unscathed. Some courageous non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) stand out for special praise, however. The Red Cross, Doctors Without
Borders and SOS Kinderdorf have kept their flags flying in one of the most
dangerous situations ever faced by aid workers. But the United Nations, the
organisation which should have provided the lead, has failed to respond
adequately to the crisis.
Citing issues of sovereignty and the great danger of operating in the
country, the UN has dithered. Only in the last few months has a big
humanitarian effort begun to take shape. With every day of delay, the task
of recovery has become harder as Somalia slips further into anarchy.
Mr Mohamed Sahnoun, the UN special envoy to Somalia, summed it up last week
in a remarkably candid and self-critical press conference in Nairobi. 'If
only we had intervened before November,' he said. 'Because of that delay, we
now pay the price.'
Belated efforts are now being made to tackle the humanitarian disaster, but
in the meantime the lessons that have been learned in Somalia need to be put
into action if further Somalias are to be averted in Africa. An early
response to an unfolding disaster, better funding of NGOs and a
re-examination of the concept of sovereignty are critical.
For Somalia itself, the international community urgently needs to make
high-level assessment visits; provide the right type of food in bigger
quantities; fund efforts to get supplies into the interior; begin creating
self-sufficiency rather than food-aid dependency; and, for the long term,
undertake a massive development aid programme.
For several years there has been a suggestion that a well-funded disaster
relief office be set up at the UN. It should have the power to act swiftly
and effectively without bureaucratic delay. The west should support such an
initiative and provide it with ample resources.
Governments must also massively increase funds to the NGOs which often prove
very effective at moving swiftly and reaching those most severely in need.
Last week Mr Sahnoun paid tribute to the NGOs which remained in Somalia
despite fears for the safety of aid workers.
The west must also stop dealing with local warlords who have no popular
mandate as sovereign governments. For months protracted negotiations were
undertaken between the UN and Somali warlords who control parts of the
country. Thousands died during these diplomatic exchanges.
Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, one of those warlords, continues to oppose the UN
sending in blue-berets to safeguard humanitarian personnel and operations
which most aid workers believe are vital to prevent many more deaths. This
type of obstruction must stop. The humanitarian imperative should take
priority over such sovereignty issues.
There are many practical measures which the west could take immediately to
help ease the suffering in Somalia. The first is to send a senior team of
officials to see the situation for themselves. Last week's visit to Somalia
by Mr Bernard Kouchner, the French health and humanitarian action minister,
has done much to publicise the plight of Somalia and spur the world into
action.
Experts working in Somalia say it is critical for governments to increase
their food pledges. However, governments should be selective in their
donations of food - sending wheat, maize, and sorghum while avoiding
high-value commodities such as rice and vegetable oil, which often attract
violence and looting. Whenever high-value commodities are distributed, such
as a recent Saudi Arabian shipment of food packages, the death toll rises as
gunmen battle to grab the valued goods.
In the short term, it is vital to get food distributed outside of Mogadishu
to prevent starving people abandoning their homesteads and walking to the
city in a desperate search for food. Ten of thousands of people have already
flooded into the city and their presence has increased the violent
squabbling over scarce resources. Getting food to the interior of the
country would prevent Mogadishu swelling even further and thus would reduce
the security problem.
Widespread banditry currently rules out moving food by road, so a massive
and costly airlift needs to be undertaken. The UN is presently studying the
logistics of an airlift operation but so far the funding for it has not been
pledged.
Sending in food alone, however, is merely a short-term measure. Food aid
traditionally creates dependency. It takes people off the land and brings
them to feeding centres, making them reliant of handouts. It is important
from the very beginning that seeds and tools are distributed alongside food
aid to make sure that next year Somalis will be able to feed themselves.
Reviving the rural veterinary service, which is now non-existent, is also
critical to the self-sufficiency of Somalis, because livestock will be the
only significant export and source of revenue for the foreseeable future.
Finally, it is important to remember that much of the present crisis in
Somalia is the result of dire poverty which reflects the lack of an
effective western-funded development programme.
For years development resources were poured into ill-conceived projects in
Mogadishu at the expense of the impoverished countryside. The
disenfranchised rural population became intent on redistributing the
centralised wealth of the country by force and settling old scores. When law
and order breaks down, it is the fighting over scarce resources as much as
any ideological or tribal rivalry that fuels the conflict. In Somalia,
looting has become a means of wealth redistribution.
The west is going to have to aid Somalia massively for years to come. But
more importantly it must put into place effective programmes which spread
wealth equitably if poverty and the cycle of violence that it breeds are to
be eradicated.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Leading Article: County Hall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS difficult to conceive that the government could have worse handled the
disposal of London's County Hall.
Through its quango, the London Residuary Body, it needlessly rushed into a
pre-election deal with the Shirayama Corporation to convert the prime-site
building into a luxury hotel. Then it spent more than three months dithering
as to whether or not to allow the London School of Economics, which had been
campaigning for the site for over a year, to submit a rival bid. Finally, at
the end of July, it gave the LSE six working days to submit a fully-costed,
unconditional bid for the site.
The government apparently intimated to the LSE that its bid should be a fair
commercial proposition. Hence the LSE, which five months ago proposed to pay
Pounds 20m, with a partner, for the hall and surrounding site, is now
offering Pounds 65m on its own.
Hitherto the FT has supported the LSE's designs. County Hall is London's
foremost vacant public building: it should be used to house one of its
foremost public institutions, and none seemed - or seem - more appropriate
than the LSE, Britain's leading social science university. However, it is
not merely ridiculous, but positively dangerous, to require the LSE to
behave like a commercial property developer. To raise the Pounds 130m-odd it
now needs to buy and refurbish County Hall, the LSE is banking on an early,
highly optimistic return from its current site, plus a huge overdraft and a
doubling of postgraduate numbers in four years. Even if all goes according
to plan - a big 'if' - such rapid transformation could undermine the very
reputation which justifies the move.
If the government believes the national interest is best served by
relocating the LSE to County Hall, it ought to forget about a commercial
return. If it continues to demand one, the LSE should think hard before
gambling its future on a building.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST Angola, and now Mozambique, are within reach of lasting peace for the
first time in three decades. The agreement in Rome last Friday to end the
civil war in Mozambique suggests that patient mediation, honest brokers and
international monitoring can end conflicts in southern Africa. If so, then
there may be hope even for the Somalias of the continent. Of course, the
causes of Africa's wars vary widely. In Mozambique, as in Angola, South
Africa was critical to the peace process. Only when Pretoria ended its
military support for the opposition movements Renamo and Unita was mediation
possible.
But as in Angola - due to hold UN-monitored elections next month - a
settlement in Mozambique was unattainable without outside help, given the
enmity between the two sides and the need for third party monitoring of the
proposed ceasefire. Hence the extraordinary guest list at the ceremony in
Rome last week, when President Joaquim Chissano and Mr Afonso Dhlakama,
leader of Renamo, committed themselves to cease hostilities by October 1 and
to hold multi-party elections under UN-led international supervision in the
presence of a range of intermediaries including Italian government
officials, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, whose
company, Lonrho, has business interests in Mozambique.
Even this remarkable combination might have failed were it not for the new
realities to which Africa is adapting, and which helped create the blueprint
for Mozambique's treaty. The era of the one-party state and the centrally
controlled economy is over, as are the days when African governments and
rebel movements could play on superpower rivalries. Economic policy, as
nearly every African government has discovered, must win the approval of the
IMF and the World Bank.
These realities will shape the terms of other peace initiatives in Africa.
The task of intermediaries remains difficult, but southern Africa shows it
can be done.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: Formality over personality - Serious Fun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS FUN is the annual festival that brings contemporary dance, music,
and performance art to Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Centre - alternative
summer fare to the Mostly Mozart concerts in Avery Fisher Hall.
This sixth season began with Robert Wilson's production of Gertrude Stein's
Dr Faustus Lights the Lights from the Hebbel-Theater in Berlin. Like all
Wilson's work, it was visually striking and the actors' movement and make-up
were stylised to a fare-thee-well. That was the problem - the piece lacked
any spontaneity.
Returning towards the end of the festival, I caught the two clowns, or New
Vaudevillians, David Shiner and Bill Irwin, in a show whose spontaneity was
infectious. Shiner is a star of the Canadian Cirque du Soleil, while Irwin
is the only baggy-pants comedian to have received a MacArthur Fellowship,
sometimes called 'genius' award. Irwin is in continual danger of being
dragged into the wings by an unseen force; Shiner, for his part, seems on
the point of being carried into the air by his umbrella, like Alain in
Ashton's La Fille mal gardaae.
The festival usually culminates in an evening called 'Megadance'. This year,
in tacit recognition, perhaps, of the fact that only a handful of American
choreographers are making work that would justify such a prefix, the concert
consisted of revivals of avant-garde works of the fifties, sixties, and
seventies, assembled by the dance historian Sally Banes. Dancemakers of that
generation wanted to wipe the slate clean: in the words of Yvonne Rainer's
famous manifesto, they said: 'No to spectacle, no to virtuosity . . . no to
the glamour and transcendency of the star image.'
Rainer's almost legendary Trio A (1966) exemplified her injunction. But,
paradoxically, its original performers, Rainer herself, David Gordon and
Steve Paxton, had a kind of authority that undeniably added up to star
quality. Here, Clarinda Mac Low went through the motions, though with proper
clarity and sense of weight.
Paul Taylor's first concert in 1957 had an experimental audacity that he
soon deliberately abandoned. Deadpan, wearing a business suit, he assumed a
series of nonchalant poses, accompanied by the telephone time signal, in a
solo called Epic. Restaged as a duet what was once audacious now seemed
harmless enough.
The programme proved that, in experimental dance, just as in ballet, works
with strong formal content have a better chance of survival than those that
depend on the personality of the performers. Formal values were strongest in
James Waring's Rose and Lucinda Childs's Interior Drama. Rose, made for a
student company at the University of Maryland, in Baltimore County, just
before Waring died in 1975, does not call for virtuosity, but it does call
for conviction. The present group realised the dance in all its grave
austerity.
Interior Drama (1977) marks a transition between the extreme minimalism of
Childs's previous work and the greater theatricality of Dance two years
later. At that, there are only four steps in it, and one marvels at the
dancers' ability to keep variations and permutations in their heads.
Simone Forti was among those who replaced formal structure with game- or
task-based instructions to the performers. Slantboard/Huddle (1961), in
which they clamber up a sloping board or over each other, is possibly more
fun to do than it is to watch. Meredith Monk's solo Break (1964) must have
depended to a great extent on her personality; Lutz Forster, from Pina
Bausch's company, gave it a sinister edge that was surely quite different
but still powerful. Gus Solomons Jr's solo Kinesia No. 5 (1967), which he
performed himself, has some fascinating movement.
Rudy Perez's solo Countdown (1965), in which he slowly smokes a cigarette to
two of the 'Songs of the Auvergne,' reminds us that experimentalism is no
guarantee against sentimentality.

We are promised the sight of dog eating dog in the last of the present

other journalists for the way in which they present stories about science.
He argues that we are becoming increasingly distrustful of science because
we are misled by newspapers which make claims such as 'British breakthrough
likely to end asthma suffering'.
It doesn't help the cause of science too much, of course, when scientists go
around claiming to have achieved cold fusion at room temperature, but it is
always easier to kick the messenger in the teeth.
Smith is editor of the doctors' magazine, the British Medical Journal.
Doctors emerge rather badly by all accounts from the C4 programme Secret

thought they were being treated for syphilis but actually the doctors were
merely observing the development of the disease.
ITV screens the first of three documentaries, China Rising (10.40), about
the development of Chinese cities, beginning with Shanghai, once a

FT  10 AUG 92 / Arts: London's self-esteem 'rediscovered' - Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUNTER KOWA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUTHORS of a recent report draw a disturbing picture of London as a
capital in decline. Despite its title, London: World City, they remark:
'Somewhere along the line, London appears to have lost . . . a sense of its
worth.' If this is so, the missing self-esteem can be rediscovered in the
German city of Essen, where the former residence of the Krupp dynasty, Villa
Hugel, plays host to the exhibition 'Metropole London 1800-1840'.
It is a sumptuous show with more than 500 exhibits from 100 public and
private collections, mainly British. It is not just the wealth and breadth
of the display which impress. It has also been put together with gusto.
This is not the first occasion that the Villa Hugel has proved to be an
ideal venue for such an ambitious show. The memorable evocation of 'Baroque
in Dresden', mounted in 1986, was followed by exhibitions on Prague and St
Petersburg. These portraits of cities focused on epochs of out-standing
cultural achievement.
Villa Hugel, situated in rambling parkland high over the river Ruhr, is the
mildly tasteless extravagance of a steel-magnate craving aristocratic
status, the product of German industrial might at its height. But the
neo-baroque pomposity and the sheer scale of its rooms lend period character
to a jumble of artefacts chosen to represent both the best and the worst
aspects of a city's most creative epoch.
As on the previous occasions, the Krupp-initiated Kulturstiftung Ruhr has
organised the London exhibition as part of its investment in cultural
activities.
And once again, the foundation has managed to persuade lenders to part with
the gems of their collections.
Unlike the golden ages of cities like Dresden and St. Petersburg, which
flourished and were then superseded, the impetus behind the rise of the
metropolitan London between 1800 and 1840 was economic vigour - the rapid
development of trade, commerce and industry - which in turn sparked off
advances in science and reactions in art.
The past frequently serves to illustrate the present. The exhibition begins
and ends with the entry into a new era, whose legacy is, at present,
undergoing rejuvenation with as yet uncertain success.
There are, on the one hand, the new docks in all their glory, recorded in
coloured aquatints, maps and construction drawings. Trading ships, decked in
flags, proudly sail into St Katherine's Dock on the opening day, watched by
a festive crowd. The first railway coaches, on the other hand, look very
much like an experiment, which did not stop the city planners from digging
vast trenches across town ready for the new London &amp; Birmingham Railway.
In between the dawn of the overseas trade and the outbreak of the railway
mania, the exhibition paints a picture of the city throbbing with activity:
from the elated Roman fantasies of John Soane, architect of the Bank of
England, to the vagaries of daily life as told by the scurrilous
caricaturists.
It is also a time of inventions both practical (if untried, such as gas
lighting) and exclusive (such as pottery from Wedgwood and others).
Painting, on display in the magnificent grand room, leaves its aristocratic
origins behind and turns to the taste of a new breed of connoisseurs, such
as the Barings, the powerful bankers memorably portrayed by Thomas Lawrence.
There is also the unsuccessful attempt by David Wilkie and Benjamin Robert
Haydon to elevate contemporary subject matter to grand historic pieces, as
well as the animal sentimentality of Landseer. Other sections cover literary
and scientific developments.
London certainly had 'a sense of its worth' in these years - a sense, it
seems, which extended throughout all walks of life.
A sumptuous catalogue in English has been published by Yale. It is London -
World City 1800-1840, edited by Celina Fox, containing 624 pages and selling
at Pounds 45.
Villa Hugel, Essen, daily until 8 November.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 71m Avonmouth development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A joint venture between BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL ENGINEERING and BIRTLEY
ENGINEERING, the Taylor Woodrow materials handling specialist, has been
awarded the Pounds 71m design and construct contract, by National Power, for
the bulk handling facility, as part of the ongoing redevelopment of the
Royal Portbury Dock near Bristol. The total package comprises an offloading
facility at the Royal Portbury Dock and a train loading facility at
Avonmouth.
The work entails installation of continuous ship unloaders and a conveyor
system from the ships and quayside to a stockyard. These will be linked, via
a tunnel, to the other side of the River Avon estuary where the Avonmouth
railhead is located by a series of conveyor and transfer stations. Two 2,600
tonne bunkers are to be built at the railhead with facilities for loading
and dispatching of trains each carrying 1,500 tonnes in total weight at
hourly intervals.
Prior to works operation, part of the Portbury Dock will need to be deepened
by the dredging of 200,000 cu metres of material in order to accommodate
bulk carrier ships up to 120,000 dwt.
Another aspect of the contract involves extending and upgrading the existing
quay structure at the Royal Portbury Dock. This is to facilitate the two
continuous ship unloaders, which stand 40 metres high, weigh 1,200 tonnes
and are capable of unloading material at 1,750 tonnes per hour.
The 3.35 metre internal diameter tunnel is to be constructed using a full
face Lovat tunnel boring machine, which has to go through varying strata
from soft silt and clay to very hard conglomerate rock. Work has already
commenced and the project is intended to be fully operational by July 1993.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Therapy provides a counsel of hope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheila Lyons lost her mid-level job at a top business travel company last
November. As the months have worn on, she has not only doggedly chased every
possible job lead but fought to keep up her spirits.
'Some days I just can't make a call,' says Lyons, normally an upbeat person,
'It's a self-esteem thing.' For middle- and upper-level executives,
unemployment can be devastating. Accustomed to being in charge, busy,
purposeful, they feel adrift and ashamed. So debilitating are these feelings
that many have now sought psychological counselling and, in the process,
spawned a new type of group therapy. Across the US, unemployment therapy
groups for executives have been organised. Most are in churches, such as the
one lead by Sonia Sukenick in Chicago.
Sukenick says: 'As people are unemployed for longer periods, they become
more desperate. Expectations don't pan out and they don't know how to plan
new ones. There's a lot of pain involved.' She tries to guide the jobless
'to work through their feelings of abandonment and betrayal.' She also
counsels them to adjust their expectations and re-think their self-images.
'Some will never know work as they did before, especially investment
bankers,' she said. The groups not only offer the unemployed relief from
their sense of secrecy and isolation, but they also help at the practical
level of providing a networks of contacts.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Starting all over again - The army of unemployed
American executives seeking new careers as consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many, it was living the American dream. They had a management job with a
top US company, good pay and benefits, a house in the suburbs, two cars and
a sense of security. But for many of these executives, the American dream
has turned to a nightmare during the recession.
Hundreds of thousands of middle- and upper-level executives have found
themselves out on the street and discovered that they have little chance of
finding their way back to similar positions.
From January 1989 to June this year, 1.2m jobs have been eliminated by
leading American corporations. Some 70 per cent of those cuts have come not
in assembly line jobs, but in management, engineering and administration,
according to Dan Lacey, editor of 'Workplace Trends', a newsletter that
tracks firings. 'It's a dramatic and traumatic thing that's going on out
there,' says Lacey.
What is worse for many sacked executives is that they face a shrunken market
for their skills, as lay-offs have affected whole industries. Among the
hardest hit have been the computer, motor, aerospace and defence industries.
Redundancies are part of how American companies are grappling with tougher
international competition, says Stephen Carter, manager of the Kansas City
office of Right Associates, the world's leading publicly-held outplacement
company.
The litany of lay-offs by American corporate icons, such IBM, AT&amp;T, Alcoa
and GM, seems endless. In the last 12 years, 5m jobs have been pared by the
Fortune 500 and the contraction shows no sign of let up.
Paul Foask, managing director in Chicago of Korn/Ferry International, the
largest US executive recruitment firm, says: 'I don't have the salesman's
optimism that things are going to get any better.'
The situation is new to American executives. This is the first recession in
which white collar employees are bearing the brunt of unemployment, says
Richard Belous, economist with the National Planning Society, a
Washington-based public policy group. 'In the last two recessions, in 1982
and 1975, white collar unemployment was roughly 20-33 per cent of the total.
Now, it's up to 59 per cent.'
Moreover, long-term unemployment, little known to the white collar brigade,
is becoming increasingly common. While managers used to be able to find a
new position in a month, six months is now a minimum and many wait a year or
more. Some are even falling out of the labour market altogether.
'What makes it bad is people feel they've been mislead. Generally, there's a
great feeling of bitterness,' says Jack Hackman, who lost his job two years
ago as art department chief in Chicago for NBC, the broadcasting group.
Many of those laid off feel that their hard work and loyalty have largely
not been rewarded, puncturing one of corporate America's sturdiest myths.
But Hackman has taken the path that increasing numbers of unemployed
executives are choosing. He has become a consultant. He now does design work
for restaurants, hotels and performing arts groups.
Job market experts believe that 15-20 per cent of redundant managers become
consultants. Only a tiny percentage turn to franchising, creating their own
company or acquiring an existing one, because all these options require
start-up capital.
New consultants frequently begin by returning to perform subcontracting
services for their old employers. A 1989 study by the National Planning
Association showed that about half of those laid off were taken back on
consultancy work. For some, the former employer becomes the prime client for
as much as two years, says John Poynton, a partner of the Chicago
outplacement company, Clarke Poynton Associates.
Many companies are finding that they can farm out work that was once done
in-house at a considerably lower cost. Indeed, as healthcare benefit costs
have soared, companies have struggled to employ outsiders rather than staff
wherever possible. If those outsiders have worked for the company, so much
the better.
Yet, while there is more work for consultants, their growing numbers means
competition is fierce. For most, it is an insecure business. While a
consultant works on one job it is difficult to spend time hunting for others
to keep the diary full. And employers can pull work away on a whim.
To reduce their sense of isolation and uncertainty, many consultants join
professional associations, says Tom Germuska, who lost his public relations
job after 19 years with United Airlines. He is now president of the Midwest
Society for Professional Consultants.
About half of those who attempt consulting fail simply because they do not
have the temperament, says Glenn Van Doren, president of the Association of
Executive Search Consultants. Like other entrepreneurial activities,
consulting takes 'people skills', and many who have been ensconced in
corporate management positions do not have those abilities, he says.
Consulting has had such an influx of jobless executives during the last few
years that it has almost become a code word for being unemployed. Many just
put consulting on their CVs to fill in for a jobless period, though they
have done little or no consulting work.
These people generally return to regular jobs. But with the wealth of
managerial talent on the street these days, most face having to take jobs
below their previous levels of salary, benefits and responsibility. And even
those willing to do so must be flexible enough to consider changing
industries and acquiring new skills.
The good news is that small- and medium-sized companies, traditionally the
biggest generators of US jobs, are inheriting a vast pool of highly
qualified managers to choose from.
One study by Right Associates even found that executives who went to work
for small- and medium-sized companies are finding greater satisfaction in
shaping and building up their new companies, despite the lower pay.

The project is part of a Science Museum initiative to improve the

technical specifications will ensure that its contents are kept in the best
possible condition, whilst a high-technology racking system will make it
easy to locate and access individual objects.
The building will be divided into two separate stores by a central access,

frame covered with a composite wall cladding system and metal deck roof.
Completion of the project is scheduled for the summer of 1993.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Mandarins peel away from the corridors of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until recently, the public sector was a world apart. The odd ex-headmaster
might surface in the Department of Education or an academic economist in the
Treasury. But they were highly exceptional breaches of a monastic order. For
the rest, civil servants were recruited young, initiated into the mysteries
of administration by apprenticeship, and only those sufficiently imbued by
Whitehall were judged suitable for senior office.
All that is changing. The monasteries are far from dissolved, and are never
likely to be while Sir Robin Butler and his ilk preside. But fraternisation
is now positively encouraged, not just between the various branches of state
administration, but between the public and private sectors. As yet, it is
more talked about than happening, but a few of the chief executives of the
'next steps' Whitehall agencies have come from local government, the NHS,
even the private sector, and interchange at other levels is increasing. The
Environment Department is even running a secondment scheme to encourage
'co-operation and the cross-fertilisation of fresh ideas' between officials
in Whitehall and local government.
What are the outsiders making of Whitehall, and the Mandarins of life
outside? According to a report* by Saxton Bampfylde, the executive
recruitment consultants, based on the 'touristic perceptions' gained from
interviews with numerous high-flyers who have moved between the two of late,
the cultural divide between Britain's public and private sectors is a
'Berlin Wall' which has barely started to crumble.
'Culture' is the word to stress: some of those who moved out to the private
sector found the experience considerably less dramatic than they expected.
One former civil servant, now working with a leading consultant, said: 'I
haven't made that much of a move: in consultancy I work in a similar way
with similar people. It's more agreeable and I earn more money. In industry
it would have been different.'
'Industry' recurs as the deepest part of the Divide. 'It sounds appalling
now,' recalled one civil servant, 'but we thought 'industry', whatever it
was, was for northern chemists. People like us went for the Treasury or the
BBC.'
The interviews revealed ignorance and mistrust to be deep-seated. 'Stated
baldly,' says the report, the prejudices came down to two: 'the public
sector views the private as venal, vulgar and narrow', while the private
sector sees the other as 'timeserving, slow, fixated with process,
inefficient, naive and opposed to change'.
Far from having bridged the gulf, Saxton Bampfylde believe the 1980s
probably widened it further 'by endorsing defensiveness in the public sector
and populist - 'less government' - views in the private.'
In the words of one senior civil servant they quote: 'I was talking to an
otherwise perfectly sensible industrialist about the council and he said
'privatise it'. It was simply idiotic - a knee-jerk reaction - but he was an
ardent Thatcherite and that was the rhetoric of the 1980s.'
On a less crude level, the Whitehall emphasis on 'process' as against the
private sector stress on 'results', and the cultivation of different skills
in the two spheres, were found to be key factors. It was not just
'competitiveness' versus 'elegance of expression': in the public service,
precedent and a sense of history and continuity matter - but not much in the
private sector.
Rival dress senses also featured prominently. 'When I left the Treasury,'
said one senior banker, 'I gave up my Hush Puppies and bought a proper pair
of black Oxfords. Everyone assumed that if you had been in the Civil Service
you would be wearing cheap shoes, have a bad haircut, live in Surbiton and
only be interested in your pension rights.'
This Berlin Wall, it seems, is littered with shoes.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 21m Devon hospital rebuilding
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The phase two redevelopment scheme, worth Pounds 21m, for Royal Devon and
Exeter Hospital at Wonford has been awarded to WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION SOUTH
WEST.
In a 38-month project which gets underway this month, the contractor will
create clinical support departments at the hospital. It is the second and
largest phase of a scheme to rebuild the 450-bed hospital for the South
Western Regional Health Authority, which is affected by concrete cancer.
The development features five linked cruciform structures which will provide
24,000 sq metres of hospital accommodation on two and three storeys.
Almost half of Wimpey's work involves the installation of complex mechanical
and electrical facilities in the new departments. Overall, the hospital will
house a total of eight theatres, 11 X-ray rooms, an accident and emergency
unit, an intensive care unit as well as various outpatient clinics, two
acute awards and catering facilities.
Apart from the support services in the main hospital, Wimpey will also
construct and fit out a power generation centre as well undertake the
fitting out of two wards built in the first phase.
Enveloping the concrete-frame scheme will be a pattern coloured brickwork.
The hospital will be topped with a steel framed roof and timber rafters clad
with interlocking concrete tiles.
The development is planned in such a way that further phases can be added
later.

FT  10 AUG 92 / People: Dare creams off the top job at MMB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the Milk Marketing Board's more vocal critics is to take over as its
chief executive to prepare the 60-year old milk monopoly for privatisation
in the next two years.
As a former president of the Dairy Trade Federation, which represents
dairies and producers, and with nearly 20 years at Unigate, 50-year-old
Andrew Dare has been well immersed in the milk business. A farmer's son, he
became managing director of St Ivel in 1979, joined the main Unigate board
in 1988 and became head of its British food interests.
Apparently disappointed at not securing the top job at Unigate, he resigned
in March of last year shortly after the new boss Ross Buckland arrived from
Kellogg's. Dare then set up his own consultancy; by the end of the year MMB
was a principal client.
'They wanted to change fundamentally and I suppose they thought a critic had
more to offer,' he says of his appointment as special adviser to the board.
'Later they suggested I had better come and implement my proposals.'
His aim is the creation of 'a totally free market in milk'. Dairy Crest, a
subsidiary of the Milk Marketing Board, will be floated on the stock
exchange 'in roughly two years' time'. Meanwhile the board itself will be
replaced by a single voluntary co-operative - 'a market-oriented and slick
organisation' which Dare says should be a viable competitor to the giant
continental European dairy co-operatives.
Charles Runge, MMB boss until the end of last year, resigned shortly before
Dare arrived as a consultant. Finance director George Wright was promoted
into his position, and retires at the end of this month aged 60.
But Dare's move does nothing to quiet the critics who have seen the MMB and
DTF as an established, cosy cartel whose differences were not as great as
they were sometimes made to seem. Dare now has to prove he is not replacing
a statutory monopoly with a voluntary monopoly - the very danger he warned
incessantly of from his seat at the DTF.
*****
KEMBREY, the Slough-based electrical components manufacturer beset by
boardroom rows last year, has parted with its finance director Philip
MacDermott, who is leaving after two years at the company.
Chief executive Michael Cleary says he had worked with MacDermott, who is
now 46, at Allders Department Stores, when they were respectively finance
director and financial controller there in the early 1980s.
'After the hiatus at Kembrey,' during which Cleary was ousted in a boardroom
coup, but then clambered back into the chief executive seat at the beginning
of this year, 'we decided we wanted to restructure, which means an increased
emphasis on financial control. The day-to-day nuts and bolts of financial
control are not (MacDermott's) strong suit, and we both agreed he would be
better seeking his career elsewhere.'
His replacement, Justin Whitehorn, 43, was finance director of a private
company, British Hartford Fairmont, which is involved in refractory
materials, one of Kembrey's key businesses.
*****
Howard MacDonald (above right), who resigned as chief executive of County
NatWest in April 1991, has resurfaced in the City. He has been made an
adviser to The Phoenix Development Capital Fund, a new venture capital
operation.
MacDonald, who made his name in the oil industry with Shell, is one of three
non-executive directors of the new fund's advisory board. Sir Eric Parker,
chief executive of Trafalgar House, and Sir Malcolm Field, group managing
director of W H Smith, have also been appointed to the advisory board.
Phoenix Development Capital is managed by Phoenix Fund Managers and has
already committed Pounds 7m in four investments which range from VCH,
Germany's second largest scientific publisher, to the recently privatised
Medway Ports. It has raised Pounds 35.5m from investors and hopes to raise
another Pounds 40m by the autumn. Mitsubishi Corporation, one of Japan's
biggest companies, has a substantial stake in the fund and has a
representative, H Nonomiya, on its advisory board. Michael Lay of the
Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board is also an adviser.
*****
Allan Alpin, of MARSTON, THOMPSON &amp; EVERSHED who was promoted from head
brewer to production director and became a non-executive director on his
retirement in 1991, died on July 31.
*****
Brian Brooks is appointed director of human resources and senior
vice-president of WPP, and will be based in New York; he joins from Towers
Perrin where he specialised in career development and compensation.
*****
Terry Best is appointed finance director of TRAVIS PERKINS on the retirement
of John Wilson.
*****
Brian Thompson has been appointed executive chairman of the DOMINICK HUNTER
GROUP in succession to Robin Hodgson who remains on the board as a
non-executive.
*****
Marie Bukowski has been appointed medical director of Duphar Laboratories,
the pharmaceutical division of SOLVAY, in the UK. She was formerly director
of medical operations at Boehringer Ingelhiem.

RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON has won a contract to project the expansion of the
port of Mombasa in Kenya over the next 10 years, together with the
development of an inland container transport network. The two studies are
being funded by the World Bank on behalf of the Kenya Ports Authority.
The 10-month study of Kenya's principal port has a wide ranging brief
covering the port's layout, operational equipment, land use, traffic
forecasts, manpower planning, management efficiency, computer applications
for improving efficiency of port operations and a review of throughput
costs.
Container handling at the port is particularly important to the second part
of the contract, a six-month study into the strategic development of inland
container depots.

LATEST company policies on redundancies seek to preserve workforce morale
and retain the most gifted employees, according to a report published today.
The report from Incomes Data Services, the employment research service,
examines how recent large-scale redundancies have been managed in large
organisations such as Midland Bank, Royal Ordnance, and Federal Express.
It says traditional methods of avoiding compulsory redundancies, such as
natural wastage, have lost much of their effectiveness during the recession.
Policies now, according to the report, are intended to minimise ill-feeling
and to ensure that it is not the most able employees who leave. For those
made redundant, numerous services are being increasingly offered, including
help with job hunting.
The report states: 'If compulsory redundancies are unavoidable, there are
still steps companies can take to manage them efficiently and thereby avoid
ill-feeling and loss of morale.'
If the redundancies are only partial, it says, selection criteria can be
used to avoid losing the most efficient and highly qualified employees.
Some companies consider ability, experience or health. Bolton Metropolitan
Council based its criteria on employees' attendance records. Federal Express
used length of service for manual workers, but with other employees
considered performance, skills, expertise and attainment of targets.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Unequal burdens and benefits of German unification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN unification could hardly have come at a worse time for the UK
economy. The Bundesbank's subsequent struggle to contain German inflation
has depressed economic growth across Europe and prolonged recession in
debt-burdened Britain. But few complaints about the economic effects of
unification are heard from either the US or Japan, where it has delivered
net economic gains rather than pain.
Unification has had two contrasting economic effects outside Germany. Within
Europe it has meant persistently high real interest rates as Bonn's tight
monetary policy has been transmitted by the exchange rate mechanism. But the
effects of higher east German spending have also spilled outside German
borders. Germany's current account surplus has swung into deficit as imports
have grown and west German exporters have redirected their sales eastward.
Germany has bucked the trend among the six largest industrialised countries
over the past three years. In every other country, domestic activity has
grown progressively more slowly, as the chart shows. But unification has
fuelled the growth of German domestic demand: the sum of the growth rates of
consumption, investment and government spending in west Germany increased
from 2.6 per cent in 1989 to 4.5 per cent in 1990. Domestic demand in the
unified Germany grew by 4.1 per cent in 1991.
The German statistics in this week's national accounts table cover west
Germany only. They show exports growing by 12.1 per cent in 1991. But the
bulk of these exports were moving from west to east Germany. The IMF
figures, on which the chart is based, cover the unified Germany in 1991 and
1992. They show that the fall in net external demand for German goods - the
combination of falling pan-German exports and rising imports - reduced
Germany's overall growth rate by 2.7 percentage points in 1991.
The US and Japan have escaped the direct effect of Germany's monetary
contraction. Both have been able to cut interest rates in the face of
relatively sharp falls in domestic consumption and investment compared to
most European countries, the result of tight domestic monetary policies in
the late 1980s. Yet both have benefited from the growth in export
opportunities. The value of US exports to Germany has grown by 32 per cent
between the first quarter of 1990 and 1992. The value of Japanese exports
grew by 42 per cent over the same period.
US exports have grown faster than imports in each of the last three years,
raising the rate of growth of gross domestic product in 1989 and 1990 and
partially offsetting last year's contraction in domestic demand. US total
export volumes grew by 5.8 per cent last year, propelled by the boost to US
export competitiveness from the slide in the value of the dollar. In Japan,
despite US moans, the external sector of the economy actually depressed the
overall GDP growth rate in 1989 and 1990. Only in 1991 did the external
sector add to, rather than subtract from, GDP growth.
Within Europe the negative effect of high interest rates has more than
outweighed the positive effect of higher German demand for European goods.
Economic growth in Europe, excluding Germany, was only  1/2 per cent last
year. But French growth would have been slower had it not been for the 4.2
per cent growth in its export volumes. The fall in UK domestic demand was
also cushioned by the external sector, but mainly because imports were
falling as the sluggish 0.5 per cent growth in export volumes confirms.
The economic impact of unification is becoming increasingly one-sided. The
boost to European demand is diminishing swiftly as German spending slows,
but interest rates remain high. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development expects European economic growth, excluding Germany, to rise
to 1 1/2 per cent this year, driven by a pick-up in domestic demand. But
both this and the IMF forecasts in the chart are based on the increasingly
unlikely assumption that European interest rates will fall this year.

Seasonally adjusted data used in all cases. Statistics for Germany apply
only to western Germany. GNP/GDP is broken down into private consumption
expenditure, investment (the sum of gross fixed capital formation and
the change in stocks), general government final consumption, and net
exports (exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and
services). The US includes investment by government in the government
series rather than under investment. Quarterly GNP/GDP totals are
annualised. The growth rates are the percentage change over the
corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless
otherwise stated. The figures in the fifth column of each set of growth
rates refer only to exports, rather than to net exports. Data supplied

FT  10 AUG 92 / China's budding capitalists trigger chaos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG, BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was chaos in the streets of Shenzhen, southern China's most affluent
city, over the weekend as hundreds of thousands of investors flocked there
to apply for the right to buy shares.
Chinese citizens - who have been told by the country's senior leaders, that
it is 'a glorious thing to be rich' - travelled to the city, which borders
Hong Kong, from as far away as Beijing and Sichuan in the hope of taking
part in a lottery for warrants.
Success will give them the right to participate in 14 company flotations
later this year.
Company shares are one of the few assets the Chinese are allowed to own,
aside from household items such as televisions and refrigerators. To date
there has been only a limited experimentation with home ownership.
With an estimated Yn1,000bn (Pounds 94bn) of household savings - but with
negative rates of interest - it is not surprising the Chinese turn to shares
as a hedge against inflation.
The market capitalisation of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange has increased
elevenfold this year; turnover in the first six months of the year rose
sixfold against the same period of 1991.
The authorities yesterday began issuing 5m application forms, each costing
Yn100 (Pounds 9.40). But only 500,000 applications - to be determined by a
lottery - will be issued with warrants to participate in the 14 flotations
forecast to raise Yn500m.
On Saturday night city officials called in armed police to maintain order.
One person was killed in the crush and another was reported to have died.
The police used cattle prods and batons to keep order.
A state-level foreign exchange dealing centre began operating in Beijing at
the weekend, in a move to reform China's cumbersome foreign exchange trading
system, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The National Foreign Exchange Swap Market is part of government plans to
unify exchange rates quoted on similar regional markets, official media
said. The new centre will pave the way for trading in currency futures and a
variety of foreign currencies.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Israeli pledge to legalise PLO contact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S new government has indicated it will legalise contact with the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, in a controversial step certain to draw
strong criticism from the right.
Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, yesterday described the
law forbidding contact with the PLO as 'stupid', and said the government had
a 'deep obligation' to change it.
'Everyone thinks this law is idiotic, that you cannot meet someone connected
to the Palestine National Council (Palestinian parliament in exile) even if
he is a professor in a Washington university,' Mr Beilin said.
He was amplifying remarks made earlier by Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign
minister, who had told an Italian newspaper that the government planned to
amend the 1986 law.
Successive Israeli governments have described the PLO as a terrorist gang
and have rejected any dealings with it.
Mr Peres insisted he had no intention of meeting Mr Arafat, saying that such
an event would be a media circus without consequence.
The PLO has urged Israel to go beyond its plans simply to legalise contacts,
by allowing Palestinians from outside the occupied territories to join
Middle East peace talks, which resume in Washington later this month.
Mr Suleiman Najjab, a member of the PLO executive committee, said: 'What is
needed now from the Israeli government is a clear and public declaration
that it recognises the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.'
Under the terms of last October's Madrid conference the PLO was excluded
from formal participation in direct talks aimed at ending the Arab-Israel
dispute. But the new Israeli government has indicated flexibility about
allowing Palestinians from the diaspora to take part in multilateral
discussions on such issues as regional disarmament, economic assistance,
water and the environment.
The 1986 law had embarrassed the previous government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir.
Israel had, under Mr Shamir, proved reluctant to implement the law in spite
of its being flouted by Palestinian peace delegates from the occupied
territories.

FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Gilts: Auction statement ends speculation on full funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's announcement last week that it is to hold a gilts
auction on August 26 came as little surprise to the market.
It was in line with the bank's unofficial schedule of an auction every two
months. It did, however, end recent speculation that it may abandon the full
fund rule as a means of easing monetary conditions. The rule obliges the
authorities to fund the government deficit in full by sales of debt outside
the banking and building society sectors.
The market reacted favourably to the bank's decision to issue long-dated
stock with a 15-year maturity. This was both what traders expected and
wanted, and they expect an auction of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury 2017.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The reason for
issuing at the long end is that is where most of the demand has been
recently. It has been the UK institutions - life assurance and pension funds
 -that have been the big buyers.'
The bank said the amount and terms of the auction would be announced on
August 18 at 2.30 pm.
Although the latest monetary figures from the bank show overseas demand for
UK government stock picked up in June, the big increase this year in the
amount of gilts issues has been absorbed mainly by domestic investors.
The long end remains attractive. The inflation outlook is encouraging and
domestic investors have more faith than overseas investors in the
government's ability to withstand the clamour for devaluation.
Last week, the spectre of a no vote in the French referendum on ratifying
the Maastricht treaty cast a pall over all European bond markets. Gilt
prices were also affected by sterling's weakness, although they ended mostly
unchanged on the week.
This week traders expect prices to drift lower ahead of the auction on
August 26, in spite of more good news on inflation. A string of statistics
this week on the UK are forecast to show the real economy remains in
recession, but that the battle against inflation continues to be successful.
The producer prices and retail prices indices are expected to show a further
fall in the rate of inflation, as is a forecast drop in May's rise in annual
average earnings to 6.25 per cent from 6.5 per cent. The gilts market paused
for thought last week when the Treasury announced it was cutting National
Savings interest rates, to avoid mortgage rate rises by building societies.
Although this means the government will have to sell more bonds to fund
fully the public sector borrowing requirement, the decision had little
impact on gilts.
This is because the contribution of National Savings to funding is well
ahead of the government's unofficial target of about Pounds 6bn for the
year. Last month National Savings contributed Pounds 600m, bringing the
total for the first four months of the financial year to about Pounds 2.1bn.
Analysts believe gilts sales will therefore have to be higher, but not
significantly so.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Bombay scandal claims another senior figure

INDIA'S Rs35bn (Pounds 625m) financial scandal deepened at the weekend with
the arrest of Mr V. Krishnamurthy, a former leading public-sector
industrialist and member of the government's Planning Commission.
Mr Krishnamurthy was charged with offences under the Prevention of
Corruption Act following raids on his home and offices.
The Central Bureau of Investigation alleged he had received a cheque for
Rs3.2m from Mr Harshad Mehta, the former stockbroker who is also under
arrest. They said the cheque was paid to KJ Investments, a company
controlled by Mr Krishnamurthy's two sons, one of whom was also charged on
Saturday.
Separately, the bureau alleged Mr Krishnamurthy senior had stood personal
guarantee for a loan to KJ Investments from the Delhi branch of Sanwa Bank
of Japan, while he was a member of the Planning Commission and chairman of
the committee overseeing disinvestment from public-sector industry.
Mr Krishnamurthy, a former head of public-sector concerns in the electrical,
steel and motor industries, resigned from the commission last month when it
was revealed he was associated with Mr Mehta and had introduced him to key
politicians and bureaucrats, including Mr KP Geethakrishnan, the top civil
servant at the Finance Ministry.
In an interview with the Economic Times newspaper given before his arrest
and published yesterday, Mr Krishnamurthy said his business involvement was
well known when he was appointed to the commission, and that he should not
be held responsible for the actions of his sons.
The arrest of such a senior establishment figure with important political
connections has raised expectations that the scandal's net will widen
further when a joint parliamentary committee begins its investigations this
week.
A report by Mr R. Janakiraman, head of a central bank committee
investigating banks' securities activities, is expected shortly and a
special audit of four foreign banks - Standard Chartered, ANZ Grindlays,
Citibank and Bank of America - is under way.
However, the head of the Central Bureau of Investigation's inquiries into
the scandal, Mr K. Madhavan, has had his request for early retirement
accepted following suggestions of government interference in the probe.
Meanwhile, the authorities are continuing to tighten regulation of banks'
activities following the scandal.
The Reserve Bank has issued guidelines on discounting of bills, one of the
means used to divert funds from banks to brokers in the scandal. It has
barred banks from re-discounting bills already discounted by non-banking
financial companies. A Reserve Bank committee recommended on Saturday
restrictions on the money market activities of public-sector banks and rules
for trading bonds.

ABOUT 20,000 demonstrators gathered in the centre of Sao Paulo at the

de Mello, Reuter reports from Sao Paulo.
They carried banners reading 'Impeachment Now' and 'Collor Out', in what was
the first large demonstration against Mr Collor since a government scandal
erupted in May.
The president is fending off corruption charges after some of his top aides
were accused of running an influence peddling ring, from which Mr Collor
allegedly profited.
The demonstration was led by Mr Luis Ignacio 'Lula' da Silva, head of the
radical Workers' party (PT), one of the main opposition groups, Senator
Eduardo Suplicy, also of the PT, members of other opposition parties and
union heads.

A UNITED Nations inspection team, barred by Iraq from entering government

a new stand-off with Iraq, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
'It was an inspection day, the first one. That is all it was,' Mr Nikita
Smidovich, head of the 22-member team, said when the inspectors returned to
their Baghdad hotel. 'We went where we planned to go.' He also said that the
team saw what it wanted to see.
He declined to say whether the team tried to inspect any government
ministries, designated as 'off-limits' to UN arms inspectors by Baghdad.
Mr Smidovich declined to say whether the inspectors found anything
unexpected but said Iraqi officials treated US experts no differently from
other members. Mr Smidovich, the first Russian to head a UN team in Iraq,
said he expected no problems. The arms experts continue their mission today.
The team, which arrived on Friday, was the first to enter Iraq since UN
inspectors searched the agriculture ministry on July 28 after a three-week
stand-off that drew threats of force from the US.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Swiss go border-hopping in search of food bargains:
Subsidies for Alpine farming are producing high prices and more 'consumer
tourists'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN consumers appear to be much more savvy and less inhibited than they
used to be about crossing borders in search of lower prices.
A recent study in Switzerland estimates that Swiss food retailers could lose
about SFr1bn (Pounds 400m) in custom this year - or about Pounds 60 per
Swiss resident - to supermarkets in neighbouring EC countries.
To those unfamiliar with Swiss agricultural policy, it may seem odd that
anyone would want to buy food in the European Community, where the notorious
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) keeps market prices for most farm products
far above international market levels.
But Switzerland's farm supports are much more generous than even those
provided by the CAP, reflecting the higher costs of production in small
mountainside farms and a national consensus that preservation of the Alpine
way of life is a good thing.
Food prices are on average 50 per cent lower in Germany and France than in
Switzerland.
As most Swiss live close to a border with an EC country, the practice of
shopping in the neighbouring country has long existed. However, it used to
be on a modest scale, partly because people were less mobile and partly
because the Swiss border guards were thorough in inspecting incoming
motorists to see if, for example, they were breaching the severe limit of
0.5kg of meat per person.
According to a University of Basle study sponsored by Coop Schweiz*, the
amount of such shopping has soared in the past couple of years, with the
value of foreign purchases up roughly 40 per cent.
Coop, the second largest Swiss food retailer, says that most of it is
concentrated in only a few products. It estimates that Swiss consumers this
year will spend in neighbouring countries SFr100m on butter and oils,
SFr200m on milk and cheese products, SFr250m on wines and spirits and
SFr300m on meat.
While the study attributes this spending mainly to the excessive prices of
agricultural products in Switzerland, it mentions several new factors.
For example, German and French supermarket companies have become much more
aggressive in appealing to Swiss consumers. Their advertisements in Swiss
media stress that there is not even any need to change currency. Swiss
francs are welcome.
Also, trans-border consumers have found that as their numbers have
increased, weary Swiss customs officers have become increasingly nonchalant
over inspections. That in turn has encouraged many more to play the game.
Until recently, it was mainly the 1.8m Swiss who live close to the German
and French borders who participated, but now even those living in the middle
of the country are joining in. According to the study, one in 10 residents
of Lucerne goes across the borders at least once a year to buy food.
Obviously, this is having a significant effect on the trade of Swiss
retailers. Coop points out that SFr1bn is equivalent to one third of its
annual sales. It also means lost sales for Swiss farmers. Sales of Swiss
meat and dairy products are flat in spite of a growing population.
The growth of consumer tourism is also working in the other direction.
A surging flow of Italian motorists from adjacent Lombardy seeking cheap
petrol has forced the cantonal government in Ticino to close access roads at
night. A year ago, following a petrol tax increase in Germany, business in
the forecourts of north Switzerland surged.
According to Erdol-Vereinigung, the Swiss petroleum industry association,
about 13 per cent of all petrol sold in Switzerland is bought by visitors
from neighbouring countries. That represents a retail value of about SFr700m
a year.
The tax take from this is sufficiently large to make the Swiss tax collector
worry about how much much he can raise petrol taxes in Switzerland without
jeopardising his windfall gain.
German, French and Italian consumers also like to buy cigarettes in
Switzerland, as tax there represents only 50 per cent of the retail price.
The Swiss Tobacco Merchants Association says its members in border areas do
brisker business than those elsewhere, but it has no clear idea of how
significant the cross-border trade is or how fast it is growing.
In the capital markets these days, differences in prices for identical
securities on different bourses tend to be eliminated in seconds by
arbitrageurs. But governments have hitherto been able to block effective
arbitrage in the retail trade of consumer products even when differentials
have been very large.
The Swiss experience suggests that this is becoming more difficult. If so,
the creation of the single EC market is well timed. Switzerland, of course,
is not an EC member and even if it approves the creation of an expanded free
trade area, the European Economic Area, next year, nothing much will change
because trade in food products is excluded from the pact.
Presumably the Swiss government could reduce the haemorrhage on its food
account by stiffening border controls. But as Coop points out, at a time
when Bern is promoting liberalisation of markets and increased harmony with
the EC, this would be a strange response.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Germans brace for holiday price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German travel industry is braced for a package holiday price war with
British and Dutch tour operators next year.
It expects hostilities to break out next summer, following the opening of
the European single market on January 1. The low-price sector on routes to
Spain, Greece and Italy will be the first affected, according to officials
of ITS, one of Germany's leading tour operators.
There were 'clear signs' the competition was preparing to move in, with
packages up to DM120 (Pounds 42.50) cheaper than those now on offer.
UK and Dutch prices were lower, the officials said, because their pilots and
cabin staff were paid less than German workers, and they made greater use of
their transport capacity. 'A German aircraft flies 3,300 hours a year and an
English one 4,200. Obviously greater capacity use reduces costs,' ITS said.
The company, part of the Kaufhof department store group and fourth biggest
travel agent in Germany, expects total industry sales to increase by between
5 and 10 per cent next year.
Deutsche Bank estimates Germans will spend about DM56bn on travel during
1992.
ITS, which announced on Friday average price increases of 1.5 per cent for
the 1993 summer season, expects its domestic sales to rise 23 per cent this
year to almost DM1bn.

STORMS swept across France at the weekend, killing a tourist, overturning

Bordeaux.
In the worst-hit southwest region, lightning started some 30 fires in the
Landes forest and several people suffered head injuries as hailstones the
size of eggs fell on Bayonne, smashing glass and punching holes through
roofs.
High winds blew off the roofs of several hundred homes and felled trees,
wrecking cars, caravans and tents in camping grounds.
Farmers said a hailstorm rolled through several kilometres of Bordeaux's
Medoc vineyards, only a few weeks before the harvest.
They estimated some farms around Margaux could lose up to 40 per cent of the
crop. But the area's best-known vineyard, Chateau-Margaux, was spared.

FT  10 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Awaiting Sid's return to
market - The argument for flexibility in the listing rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a dismal summer for companies seeking a stock exchange listing.
Many of those that have come have seen their hopes of a good price and a
well-received issue dashed, while some planned for the autumn have already
been postponed.
The blame has been laid on the lack of interest from private investors -
collectively known as 'Sid' ever since the British Gas privatisation
marketing campaign in 1986.
Once a regular feature of new issues, the small investor who 'stagged'
issues, applying in the hope of making a quick profit, appears to have gone.
Has Sid vanished for ever or is he simply avoiding new issues because of the
gloomy stock market background?
If Sid has gone for good then the exchange might as well change the rules
for new issues so that they can be sold directly to the final holders. But
it would be politically difficult for the exchange to abandon the private
investor given the Government's policy of widening share ownership.
Ironically the privatisation programme, which was used to promote share
ownership through low pricing and incentives to buy shares, is partly blamed
for Sid's lack of interest in recent issues.
'Privatisations have spoiled the public,' says one broker. While a quick
profit was built into privatisation issues, other companies are trying to
price their shares to match demand so that there is not too much for the
stags to go for.
This summer many issues have been labelled flops, as large proportions of
shares aimed at the public were left with underwriters. Meanwhile, shares
were placed with institutions, apparently without too much difficulty
although not always at the price the sellers would have liked.
A director of one of the leading issuing banks says:'In the old days the
excitement of the stags helped the selling exercise. Now the tail is wagging
the dog. You have to price an issue so it is not a total flop with the
public, though the institutions might pay more.'
Arguably, if a company obtains a listing, sells shares and raises capital, a
flotation ought to be called a success. But the ingredients of a successful
issue should also include a share register with a high proportion of
long-term holders and a share price which does not slump below the issue
price in the immediate after-market.
Many bankers and brokers involved in recent issues believe they would have
more nearly achieved these goals if they had not been required under the
exchange's listing rules to make offers to the public.
Without the requirement for a public offer, the whole process of an issue
could be speeded up, cutting out the market risk and allowing much finer
pricing. Says one broker involved in some of this summer's deals:'In an
ideal world we would book-build on Monday, price on Tuesday and start
dealings on Thursday.'
This would be closer to the US system where pricing is conducted after the
close of business one day and the shares are all sold before trading opens
the next. Buyers having been lined up in advance.
Mr David Barclay, of County NatWest, which sponsored MFI Furniture Group's
flotation, says that the best way of selling shares is by directing them
towards the pockets of demand. Trying to force shares on unwilling buyers
will not work, he claims.
At present, the exchange's starting point is that half the shares being sold
in an issue of over Pounds 30m must be offered to the public. This looks
high against the latest estimate of private ownership of shares of about 19
per cent, a figure falling by 1 percentage point a year despite the
Government's efforts.
One broker prominent in the new issue market says:'If the exchange insisted
on 50 per cent now it would stop some companies from coming to the market.'
The exchange itself has recognised the problem by indicating that it will
take a more flexible attitude when applying rules for listings.
Advisers to MFI asked to reduce the public offer on the basis that demand
was weak. The exchange agreed that it could be limited to 25 per cent,
although MFI's advisers argued for an even lower limit.
In the end the public applied for only 15 per cent of the 137m shares
available through that offer, although sub-underwriters applied for another
29 per cent. Although labelled a flop the shares went to a premium in first
day dealings.
The exchange is now suggesting that in certain circumstances it would
countenance a placing of an entire issue, so long as the public could
subscribe to shares clawed back from the placees.
Institutions which underwrite issues are not keen on the idea. They would
lose their sub-underwriting commissions - 1 1/4 per cent - but risk having
the shares taken from them by private investors if the issue looked
attractive. A limit would have to be set on the amount available under the
clawback or they would not take the placing at all.
Corporate financiers also fear that an issue would still be called a flop if
the clawback was not fully triggered. It might, however, help the
aftermarket by removing the perception that there was an overhang of
underwritten stock.
An alternative they put forward is the so-called 'green shoe' option which
has been developed in the US. Under this the entire issue is sold, but the
company can increase the offer size if extra demand comes in. This requires
the company, or its existing shareholders, having flexibility over the
number of shares they wish to sell.
Another idea is to approach Sid in a different way. In public offers
investors apply for shares 'off the page' - by clipping application forms
from newspapers or copies of the prospectus.
Issuers are now experimenting with offers through financial intermediaries,
although this met with little success in the MFI float. Under this
arrangement firms such as regional stockbrokers, or possibly banks and
building societies, sell shares to clients, taking a commission for doing
so.
This would be a step towards US style offers where shares are only sold
through such intermediaries. The drawback is that to give the brokers the
incentive to sell US commissions are much higher than those in the UK.
US brokers have built extensive distribution networks on the back of these
commissions, but in the UK this channel would only reach relatively high net
worth individuals - Sydney not Sid.
Perhaps Sid will reappear when the market recovers. But if not, and while
the market background is dull, companies may be better served if flotations
are targetted at buyers more likely to pay up for the shares than at Sid.

FT  10 AUG 92 / International Company News: Airline workers in a spin over
merger - The proposed link between two troubled Canadian carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes a lot for unionised workers in Canada to admit that they would
rather see their employer fall into the arms of a US company than another
Canadian one. But the crew on a Canadian Airlines international flight from
Vancouver to Toronto last week had no doubt that they would have preferred
the deal which their carrier had just aborted with American Airlines than
the merger which it is negotiating with its arch-rival, Air Canada.
'It's just terrible,' was the comment of one stewardess. The crew on that
flight are not alone in fearing that the proposed merger of Canada's two
main airlines will exact a high price. For the two carriers' entire
35,000-strong workforce, thousands of lay-offs are almost certain as a
single airline moves to eliminate overlap and chop operating costs.
Consumer groups are worried that a single national airline - which has been
nicknamed Mapleflot - will result in stiffer fares and slacker service. Even
shopkeepers at the country's main airports are nervous that fewer flights
through fewer terminals could mean less business for them. The proposed
merger, which in practice is likely to amount to a takeover by Air Canada,
shows signs of inflaming ever-smouldering regional jealousies between
western Canada and Quebec. Residents of Calgary, where PWA Corp, Canadian
Airlines' parent company, has its head office, fret that their city will end
up having to make a much bigger sacrifice in jobs than Montreal, Air
Canada's home town. With such a variety of constituencies involved, the
merger of two of the country's best-known businesses is turning into a
highly charged political issue for prime minister Mr Brian Mulroney's
government.
Mr Jean Corbeil, the transport minister, blithely insisted earlier this week
that Ottawa would not interfere in the negotiations. But whatever deal is
struck will need to be approved by regulatory agencies, and the government
is likely to end up taking much of the credit or blame for its consequences.
The government nudged PWA into Air Canada's embrace last month when it
refused to provide the financial backing which the Calgary company claimed
that it needed to consumate the deal with American Airlines, or to continue
flying on its own. The requests ranged from lower fuel taxes, a perennial
complaint of Canadian carriers, to loan guarantees.
It has been obvious since the recession started that Air Canada and Canadian
Airlines could not survive in their present form. Although both have
valuable domestic and international routes, neither is big enough to compete
against the emerging behemoths of world aviation.
Their costs, especially Air Canada's, are well above those of US airlines.
Between the two of them, they ran up combined losses of CDollars 618m
(USDollars 523.7m) in the 15 months to March 31 1992. PWA hoped to fly out
of the clouds by forging an alliance with American Airlines. The US airline
would have acquired a 25 per cent equity stake and, equally important, would
have shared many of its facilities and funnelled Canadian's passengers into
its US routes.
Air Canada strenuously objected to its rival's strategy on the grounds that
it would open the door of the domestic airline industry to a powerful, and
unstoppable, US carrier.
The Montreal-based airline vowed to do everything possible to block the
Canadian-American link, even though it was having talks with US Air of
Pittsburgh. (US Air last month agreed to a far more ambitious partnership
with British Airways, which includes BA taking a 44 per cent shareholding.)
Having failed to cement their proposed alliances with US carriers, both Air
Canada and PWA are under the gun to cut a deal with each other. Canadian is
losing an estimated CDollars 800,000 a day; at Air Canada, the losses are
piling up at CDollars 1.8m a day.
'There's only so long you can continue sustaining this kind of loss,' says
Mr Jack Lawless, PWA's chief spokesman. Air Canada, which was privatised at
CDollars 12 a share three years ago, was trading at CDollars 5 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange this week. PWA's share price has sunk in less than a
year from almost CDollars 7 to CDollars 2.60.
Analysts are advising investors to give both companies a wide berth for the
time being. One reason is that the creation of Mapleflot will almost
certainly not mark the end of the restructuring of the Canadian airline
industry.
Public opinion is expected to force the government to hold the new monopoly
in check either by re-regulating the industry or encouraging the emergence
of new competitors. The latter could include allowing foreigners to take a
bigger stake than the current 25 per cent limit in smaller charter or
regional airlines.
Airline experts are virtually unanimous that the new national carrier will
prosper only by participating in either a North American or international
partnership. It would be a rich irony if the new airline, born of Air
Canada's and PWA's frustrated deals with US carriers, finds itself falling
into the lap of one of them.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Stock exchange to relax rules on flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE stock exchange in London is relaxing its rules on flotations following
the series of poorly-received public offers this summer.
Corporate financiers are being told that the exchange's rules for obtaining
listings will be interpreted flexibly in the light of current market
circumstances.
The exchange is understood to be concerned by the lack of demand from the
public for flotations such as MFI Furniture Group, The Telegraph, Taunton
Cider and Anglian Group. In each case most of the shares offered to the
public were left with underwriters.
New issues usually attract large numbers of private investors and shares are
many times over-subscribed. This has led to sharp rises in the share price
of the company when trading started.
The exchange is also thought to be worried by the effect the low level of
demand for flotations has on the after-market. An offer is usually only
considered a success if the shares start trading at a premium to their offer
price.
The exchange's rules state that new applicants for a listing involving the
sale of shares worth more than Pounds 30m must make a public offer. However,
the exchange allows issuers to place up to half the shares with institutions
on a firm basis.
It has shown a willingness to go beyond that for large issues. In MFI's
case, for example, three-quarters of the shares were placed in firm hands
with only a quarter offered to the public.
Now the exchange has said 'it has no objection to firm placing of up to 100
per cent of a marketing subject to there being sufficient clawback
arrangements to satisfy public demand'.
This would mean that a company's banks and brokers could place all of a
share offer with institutions, as long as there were provisions for shares
to be taken back from these buyers if members of the public applied for
shares.
However, institutions do not like such open-ended arrangements, fearing that
if an issue is a success they will lose a lot of shares to the public and
will be left with shares in less attractive issues.

FT  10 AUG 92 / A definition of Richness: Kenneth Gooding talks to Marc Rich
about departures at the trading group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The departure of three very senior executives at the Marc Rich international
trading organisation has prompted talk about a power struggle at the very
top.
Those who recently decided to quit one of the world's biggest oil traders
and almost certainly the biggest metals and minerals trader, include:
Mr Willy Strothotte, 47, widely perceived as the right-hand man and heir of
Mr Marc Rich, chairman; Mr Claud Dauphin, head of the Rich organisation's
oil trading operations, probably the biggest part of the business;
Mr Manny Weiss, 40, managing director of Rich's London office and its
formidable aluminium trading boss.
These departures raise questions about whether the organisation, renowned
for its aggressive approach to trading, might change its direction. Also,
because trading relies so heavily on personal contacts and mutual trust,
just how serious a blow is the removal of three main members from its
corporate line-up?
Some observers also wonder if the upheaval was caused by a big deal or deals
going badly wrong, a common occurrence in the world of commodity trading.
Mr Rich dismissed the idea of financial problems. He said the organisation
had 'an annual turnover of Dollars 30bn (Pounds 15.7bn) and a net worth in
excess of Dollars 1bn - and this after the departure over the last years of
a number of senior people, even very senior people and founding partners.
'We reinvest profits and do not pay dividends so we have a capital base
which is quite a bit higher than necessary for a trading business today. By
reinvesting our profits we have had funds available to participate in
certain industrial projects that support our trading business.'
He says Rich's profitability remains strong. 'We do not publish our figures
since we are a private company, but our profit in the last years has been
good and this year, in spite of the more difficult economic climate, our
results are good. We may make an occasional reserve, but our actual trading
profit is very good. In general, we find our oil, metals and minerals and
grain business growing and we hope that will continue.'
Marc Rich was not a speculative organisation, he insisted. 'If our business
was based on speculation we could take a hotel room with a few telephones
and we would not need a worldwide organisation with 40 offices and 1,300
people in contact with consumers and producers and doing physical business
every day.'
Figures about the Swiss-based, privately-owned group are hard to come by,
but Rich's UK company, reputed to be among the four most important in the
organisation, reported a 1991 net profit of Dollars 13.8m, after Dollars
7.8m of tax, on a turnover of Dollars 2.67bn.
Mr Rich has built up his group since 1974 after leaving Philipp Brothers, a
large commodity trader, because of a dispute about his annual bonus. Today
the Rich organisation is second only to Cargill, the US group, among the
world's diversified trading houses. The group trades about 1.5m barrels a
day of crude oil and petroleum products and about 2.5m tonnes of aluminium a
year.
Mr Rich's partner until recently was Mr Pincus 'Pinky' Green who left
Philipp Brothers at the same time for the same reason. Mr Green and two more
of Mr Rich's close colleagues - Mr Alex Hackel and Mr Felix Posen  - retired
recently. Now three of the people who stepped into these gaps have also
gone.
Mr Rich saw no cause for concern.
'If one looks back at the history of our company, many people in very senior
positions, partners and so on, have left. But, because from the very start
we followed a policy of taking on young people and training them, there has
always been a supply of people to take the place of whoever has departed and
the company has gone from strength to strength.'
As for the loss of personal contacts along with the departing executives, he
said: 'In general our group has always worked in teams and therefore
personal contacts which individuals have are generally shared with others in
their group. This gives us greater strength. In other words, we feel a
customer is best served if he has contact not only with one executive but
with two or three. In this way the customer gets the benefit of different
views. We try to do a good job for our customers and suppliers and also for
our people.'
Mr Rich went on to describe his own management approach: 'I have always
worked as a member of a team and I like to delegate but, at the same time,
on major decisions and special (financial) exposures, I have the final say.'
There has been speculation among Rich's staff that Mr Strot-hotte, a German
who had been with the group 15 years, left after losing a battle with Mr
Rich for control of the group. Discussing the departures, Mr Rich said Mr
Strothotte left 'because of difference in management approach with me. It
was because of a philosophical difference in management and nothing else.'
Mr Dauphin left to take over the family business in France after the death
of his father. Mr Weiss, he pointed out, 'for some time has talked about
spending more time with his family, doing charitable work and studies'.
That will not stop rival traders guessing about the the 'philosophical
disagreement' with Mr Strothotte or Mr Weiss's departure. Some suggest there
might have been problems with the group's aluminium trade with Russia - it
sends in alumina, the raw material, and takes out primary metal. Others
point to the year-long dispute at Ravenswood Aluminium in the US where Mr
Strothotte was president. This resulted in a United Steelworkers Union of
America campaign which concentrated on the fact that Mr Rich faced tax
evasion and other charges in the US dating back to 1984. That successful
campaign had embarrassing international consequences for the Rich
organisation. Mr Rich said: 'We did not like the strike which we ended
earlier this year. The last thing in the world which our company wants is to
be involved in labour disputes.'
Mr Rich is known for his relentless drive and calculating mind. 'I guess I
am a business machine, yet I have been doing this for 40 years. I believe I
have the knack for it.'
Yet he is now 58 and surely thinking about retirement. Not so.
'When my original partners retired two years ago the thought went through my
mind should I retire as well. But it did not take me long to decide that I
love the business and this is what I want to continue to do.'

FT  10 AUG 92 / O&amp;Y's banks may seize US property cashflow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BANKING group led by JP Morgan and Bank of Montreal has threatened legal
action to seize the cashflow - rental income - from six Olympia &amp; York
office buildings in New York and Los Angeles amid signs of mounting creditor
impatience with the troubled Canadian property developer. The buildings,
which include two towers of the World Financial Centre, were pledged as
collateral for a Dollars 160m (Pounds 84m) loan provided by the group to
O&amp;Y.
O&amp;Y's operations in Canada and the UK have been under bankruptcy protection
since May, but the company has so far kept creditors of its US buildings at
bay. Lenders have been dissuaded from legal action fearing that they stand
to lose more through bankruptcy proceedings than an orderly debt
restructuring.
The JP Morgan-led move is seen as the most serious threat so far. The
dispute stems from a decision by O&amp;Y earlier this year to pledge a portion
of the World Financial Centre's cashflow to Japanese institutional lenders
in return for an agreement to defer interest payments on their Dollars 800m
loan. The Morgan group has urged O&amp;Y to make principal payments on its loan,
or to segregate cashflow from the six buildings in bank accounts supervised
by the lenders.
O&amp;Y remains confident it can restructure the debt of its US operations
without seeking court protection.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Economics Notebook: No need to rush through Ecu timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Democracies are notoriously bad at making long-term plans.
So it is not surprising that between the Danish 'no' vote in June and the
French referendum on September 20, few policymakers seem to be thinking hard
about more distant issues relating to European economic and monetary union.
Admittedly, the Maastricht Treaty is heavy going. But while last week's
opinion polls in France showed a slip in support for Maastricht, the odds
must still be in favour of a French 'yes' vote.
In these circumstances, European finance ministries and central banks should
be thinking hard about the many difficult issues still to be solved along
the route to a single European Currency Unit and central bank. And arguably,
no nation should be giving more thought to the minutiae of Emu than Britain.
The Maastricht Treaty determined that the Ecu should be the eventual
European currency but left much else unclear about the final shape of Emu
and about how much responsibility for managing it will be left to the
individual European Community states.
Since Maastricht, much attention has focused on the need for governments to
agree a home for the proposed European Central Bank and its forerunner, the
European Monetary Institute. As the EMI is due to start preparing the
community for Emu from 1994, the timetable is looking tight. The showdown on
this issue is due at the next European summit in Edinburgh in December.
But there are other big problems. The contours of Europe's future monetary
policy are still unclear, including the amount of responsibility to be left
to national central banks under the principle of subsidiarity, which calls
for decisions to be taken at the lowest possible level of government.
These questions at least are being considered by experts reporting to the
EC's committee of central bank governors. The governors have also asked a
committee to start considering the potentially emotive issue of the design
of future EC-wide bank notes.
Other matters concerning the Ecu seem to be in limbo. EC states will have to
agree on names for the 10th or 100th parts of the Ecu, a matter ignored in
the Maastricht Treaty.
Computers and accounting systems will need to be adapted to Ecu.
Each EC country will need a full legislative framework defining the Ecu and
making it legal tender.
A recent report from the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe and
Barclays Bank gives an idea of what the change to the Ecu could entail for
companies. 'Thinking and planning for the single currency needs to start
now,' it said.
No wonder. The report urged each company to set up an internal working group
to address the change. Such groups, reporting to the main board, should
include people involved in 'purchasing, marketing, pricing and sales;
borrowing, investing, lending, treasury management, accounting; contracts
and legal affairs and information systems'. Banks would have to review the
impact of Emu on matters ranging from foreign exchange, capital markets to
automatic cash dispensers. Retailers would have to examine stock management
and point of sales systems.
While the treaty envisages 1997 as the earliest deadline for monetary union,
1999 appears a more likely date. But 1999 is not so far away in view of the
complex problems to be solved. British decimalisation, a relatively easy
affair, took five years' planning. Some officials believe it could take 10
years to complete the technical work to implement Emu. Even then, there
would be no guarantee that abandonment of national currencies such as the
D-Mark or sterling in favour of the Ecu would be politically acceptable to
the peoples of Europe.
These factors are prompting some monetary officials to question the present
plans for stage three of Emu, which envisage irrevocably locking parities
and then moving as quickly as possible to the Ecu as the EC's single
currency. Instead, they believe that the community should not rush to leave
stage '3A' in which a European system of central banks would operate a
single monetary policy but retain national currencies at permanently fixed
exchange rates.
One obvious loss from not moving to a single currency would be the continued
need for travellers to change bank notes at national frontiers. But truely
fixed parities would reduce transaction costs to a minimum. Most travellers
would pay costs abroad with credit or cash cards. Big businesses could
behave as if the Ecu were already the European currency.
The big advantage of an extended stage 3A would be political. EC countries
could wait for companies to adapt and popular support to grow in favour of
the Ecu and so avoid the tensions and backlashes - possibly amounting to the
rejection of governments by their electorates  - that imposing a strange,
unfamiliar money might produce if the D-Mark, sterling or French franc were
to be removed overnight.
For Mr John Major such an approach would have the attraction of taking on
some of the spirit of the UK government's earlier evolutionary approach to
Emu which he espoused when chancellor.
But an extended stage 3A would have to be negotiated. The EC Commission and
the 'Club Med' nations led by Italy and France could be expected to oppose
the idea.
A useful start for Britain would be to recognise that the battle to base the
EMI and the ECB is London is lost and that the bank will go to Bonn just as
soon as the German government decides to drop its formal support for
Frankfurt.
If Mr Major is really serious about placing Britain at the 'heart of Europe'
he could then start pressing for an extended stage 3A in an economic and
monetary union that would stand a better chance of gaining support in the
Tory Party and parliament.

FT  10 AUG 92 / Paper recycling undermined by cheap German imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's capacity to recycle waste paper is being severely eroded by German
environmental initiatives, making it unlikely that the industry will ever
meet government targets, according to senior industry figures.
A glut of cheap recycled cardboard boxes from Germany, stemming from its
massive national recycling initiative, has undercut UK prices by as much as
15 per cent, rendering many recycling programmes unprofitable and leading to
the collapse of several waste collection companies.
Recycling rates for UK paper are dropping from last year's high of 34 per
cent. This year, recycling capacity for corrugated board has been cut by
157,000 tonnes, 10 per cent of the sector's total. The newsprint sector has
also come under pressure as a result of cheap Canadian imports. Overall, the
UK recycles 3m tonnes of waste paper a year.
The British Paper and Board Industry Federation said: 'The increase in
consumption of waste paper has been at a lower rate than the overall
increase in paper and board consumption in the first two quarters of 1992.
'This is the first time that such a trend has occurred for many, many years.
It is an alarming statistic.'
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of David S Smith, the UK's biggest waste
paper collector and recycler, said the situation in the paper packaging
sector had now reached 'crisis proportions'.
He said that without government intervention the UK paper industry would
never achieve the recycling targets in the 1990 environment white paper, let
alone those in last month's European Commission directive on packaging
waste. This said that 60 per cent of every class of packaging material
should be recycled within 10 years of the directive's implementation.
The UK government is studying a consultant's report into the most effective
means of applying economic incentives to stimulate greater rates of
recycling.
But, unless such measures are introduced quickly, the paper industry fears
it will become increasingly difficult to recover ground lost to other
European countries.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The long, hard road to peace in Mozambique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TO suffer one war can be disastrous. To experience four in less than three
decades accounts for the catastrophe that is Mozambique.
But if this week's peace accord - a belated consequence of the complex peace
process under way in southern Africa - is put into effect, recovery can at
last begin. Behind it lie the end of superpower rivalry and the proxy
battles it led to, and the South African government's decision to negotiate
a post-apartheid constitution.
For Mozambique, however, the benefits have been a long time coming, and its
tribulations go back many years.
The guerrilla campaign that won independence from Portugal in 1975 proved a
pyrrhic victory, triggering an exodus of hundreds of thousands of whites,
many of whom sabotaged what they were forced to leave behind, leaving the
country bereft of skills.
Ill equipped for independence after centuries of Portuguese misrule,
Mozambique's plight deepened when it took the part of rebels in the conflict
in neighbouring Rhodesia.
Rhodesian retaliation took two forms: attacking guerrilla bases and economic
targets such as power stations and bridges, and creating Renamo, the rebel
group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, co-signatory to yesterday's agreement.
Rhodesia's emergence as independent Zimbabwe in 1980 brought no respite.
South Africa took over its role as the backer of Renamo, training and
supplying a loosely organised army of local war lords, renegades and
defectors from the ruling Frelimo party.
By then Mozambique was playing a frontline role once more, providing a
secure base for the military wing of the African National Congress (ANC) of
South Africa.
But by 1984, enervated by civil conflict and Pretoria's attacks, Mozambique
submitted to her powerful neighbour. In May 1984 the late President Samora
Machel and the then South African president, Mr PW Botha, signed the Nkomati
non-aggression pact.
Unconsulted and unprepared, the ANC was bundled out of Mozambique. In
return, South African assistance to Renamo was to end.
It never did. Covert aid to the rebels continued at least until President FW
de Klerk took office in South Africa in 1989, and there is some doubt
whether it ended then.
The seeds of Renamo were the black soldiers who had served Portugal's cause
in the run-up to independence, many of whom took sanctuary in Rhodesia. But
they fell on fertile ground. Popular at first, Frelimo steadily alienated
many of its supporters, by mismanagement of the economy, its authoritarian
style, or by ignoring or overriding the wishes of traditional community
leaders.
Renamo, tutored by US and South African advisers, refined its ideology,
portraying itself as a movement that stood for multiparty democracy and a
market economy.
And although it is renowned for its brutality, in recent years its claim to
grass-roots support has gained credibility. But whoever wins the promised
elections that lie ahead will inherit an impoverished nation deeply scarred
by war.

FT  08 AUG 92 / China to open banking market in Guangdong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA plans to open the banking market of the country's most prosperous
province, Guangdong, to foreign banks, the Beijing-controlled China News
Service (CNS) reported yesterday.
CNS said the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, had
decided to allow six foreign banks to set up branches in Guangzhou (Canton),
Guangdong's capital.
Foreign banks may now operate only in special economic zones in the south
and in Shanghai. They are not, however, permitted to raise deposits or lend
in renminbi, China's national currency.
The six banks have not been named, but CNS said the Guangdong provincial
branch of the central bank was completing the procedures for the approval.
The decision was made at a recent branch meeting in the province, it said.
'PBC has said that financial supervision should be strengthened in Guangdong
to allow financial markets to develop healthily,' said CNS.
Guangdong provincial authorities have been lobbying the central government
for some time to allow foreign banks to operate in the province. Guangdong
is the richest region in China and it has been estimated that residents have
unofficial US dollar holdings of more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn).

FT  08 AUG 92 / Greek reshuffle paves way for austerity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Papaconstantinou, the Greek justice minister, yesterday took over
as foreign minister in a cabinet reshuffle. For the past four months, Mr
Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, has been handling foreign
affairs himself.
The prime minister also appointed his daughter, Mrs Dora Bakoyannis, as
under-secretary to the premier's office with responsibility for
co-ordinating government activity.
Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, was given the Finance Ministry as
well, in a move intended to speed economic reform.
In a first statement, Mr Manos announced a tough package of measures
designed to increase revenues and bring the country in line with its
European Community partners. He announced sharp tax increases on bank
deposits and fuel and the abolition of Greece's 36 per cent value added tax.
'Parliament last week approved the Maastricht treaty. We said yes to Europe.
. . the ticket for Maastricht must be paid now,' Mr Manos said.
The ticket, he said, was an economic convergence plan designed to bring the
country's economy in line with its 11 EC partners. The new measures will set
the stage for the plan, to be submitted for parliamentary approval in
October.
They include raising taxes on bank deposits from 10 to 15 per cent from
September and a 33 per cent rise in fuel prices from today. VAT on raw
materials and industrial equipment is to be raised, from 8 to 18 per cent,
while the top rate of 36 per cent on items such as electronic consumer
goods, tobacco and alcohol was abolished in line with new EC VAT levels. An
8 per cent VAT will also be added to water bills for the first time.
Mr Manos said the price increases were expected to bring in revenues of
about Drs650bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1992. He said the price increases would
halt the declining trend in inflation, which is currently around 15 per
cent. The government's target was 13.5 per cent for 1992.
The Greek parliament yesterday passed a bill privatising the strike-bound
state-owned Athens bus company.
The bill dissolved the Urban Transport Company (EAS) and gave its buses to a
group of private owners. Some 6,000 EAS employees have been on strike for
two weeks protesting against a decision to cut 1,200 jobs to reduce the
company's debt.

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER senior manager of Rothschild Bank, the Swiss private banking
subsidiary of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, has been arrested in Zurich for banking
irregularities.
The Zurich public prosecutor, Mr Marco Ruggli, said the charges against Mr
Jurg Heer, formerly in charge of the bank's credit department, involved
several million Swiss francs.
Rothschild Bank announced last month it would need to transfer SFr63.5m
(Pounds 25.22m) from hidden reserves to cover depreciation, provisions and
loan losses which quadrupled to SFr99.8m in the year ended March 31, 1992.
Yesterday, a lawyer for the bank said that following the arrest Mr Heer had
been dismissed. He also said there was no indication that Mr Heer's arrest
would lead to any losses for the bank's clients, who tend to be wealthy
individuals.
The lawyer said irregularities were discovered when the bank reviewed its
credit exposure earlier this year. Private banks are not normally in the
lending business, except as an occasional service to their clients, and then
only on a fully secured basis.
Cases of inside irregularities in international private banking rarely come
to light because banks fear that the publicity will hurt their image among
their sensitive customers. Rothschild's lawyer emphasised that the good
standing of the bank was unaffected by this case.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Bundesbank firm on goals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank has no immediate plans to raise its Lombard rate as part of
the drive to curb inflation and money supply growth, but remains concerned
about domestic price trends, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German
central bank, said.
He admitted that the Bundesbank had been taken aback by the criticism of its
decision to raise the discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 8.75 per
cent last month.
It left the more important Lombard rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent.
Talking to journalists on Thursday night, he said some analysts had raised
unrealistic expectations that the bank might ease monetary policy soon.
But the reaction among foreign governments showed respect for the bank's
determination to damp down inflation and money supply expansion.
M3 has grown at an annualised rate of some 9 per cent, reflecting a rapid
rise in bank lending as investment, much of it subsidised, is stepped up in
east Germany.
At this week's Bundesbank council meeting, interest rates were left
unchanged. There had been mild speculation that the Lombard rate, the
ceiling for money market rates, would be raised. But Mr Schlesinger said the
bank saw 'no reason for rates to rise'.
Mr Schlesinger said the Bundesbank was sticking to its goals of 2 per cent
inflation and a growth range for the M3 monetary measure of between 3.5 per
cent and 5.5 per cent, though neither would be met this year. 'We are not
operating an anti-cyclical policy, but a stabilisation policy with a
longer-term horizon. We have to accept any criticism'.
He said inflation rose at an annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 4 per
cent over the last six months. The official rate was down to 3.3 per cent in
July from 4.3 per cent in June, but this was because consumer tax rises had
now been in effect for a full year.
He was concerned about wage trends, especially the fact that public sector
wages in east Germany would rise to 80 per cent of levels in the west next
July. In addition, next year's rise in value-added tax from 14 to 15 per
cent could push up inflation again.

THE US House of Representatives has followed the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank in backing substantial aid to Russia and the former
republics of the Soviet Union.
Despite increased public opposition this year to foreign aid, the House
followed the Senate late on Thursday in approving by 255 votes to 164 some
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m) in bilateral aid and an increase of Dollars 12bn
in the US commitment to the IMF.
Opponents of the bill, which now goes to a House-Senate conference, insisted
that the administration had a greater duty to provide funds to alleviate US
problems, in particular unemployment and inner city deprivation.
The vote came shortly after a statement of support for Russian economic
reform efforts from Mr Michael Camdessus, the IMF managing director. Mr
Camdessus said the approval of a Dollars 1bn first-tranche credit on
Wednesday was the first step in what should be a full IMF standby agreement
with Moscow.
The World Bank on Thursday approved a Dollars 600m loan to purchase imports.
It will get directly involved in Moscow's fledgling foreign exchange market
by distributing some Dollars 250m of its loan via the Russian central bank,
the Bank said in Moscow yesterday.
Mr Ardy Stoutjesdijk, director of the World Bank's Moscow operations, said
he expected the central bank to sell an extra Dollars 25m a week on the
inter-bank currency exchange, where commercial banks buy and sell currency
for enterprises and other clients. The World Bank will disburse the money to
the central bank in return for documents showing that currency has been sold
for the purpose of importing goods other than tobacco, jewellery and
alcohol.
The remaining Dollars 350m of the World Bank loan is intended to finance
crucial imports of medicines, agricultural supplies, and spare parts for
public transport systems and St Petersburg's port, which handles most
humanitarian aid.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BONN'S economy drive is on course for success this year, but there are still
signs of over-spending among state governments and local authorities,
according to Mr Manfred Carstens, junior finance minister.
Government spending so far matched forecasts and there were no detectable
big risks on the income side, he said yesterday.
Claiming that Bonn expected to be able to meet its target of a DM40.5bn
(Pounds 14.3bn) federal budget deficit for 1992, compared with DM52bn in
1991, he announced plans to raise around DM33bn on capital markets during
the current year.
Credit raising so far had proceeded smoothly and on relatively good terms,
Mr Carstens added.
However, he reflected concern about over-spending among state governments
and local authorities, with a warning that they should now play their part
in the consolidation process.
While the federal government seems to be holding to its undertaking to clamp
down on spending increases, appeals to the states to limit annual increases
to 3 per cent appear to have gone unheard.
According to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, state and
local authority spending is likely to rise 5 per cent in 1992.
Meanwhile, trade figures published yesterday underlined the uncertain state
of the German economy. The DM2bn visible trade surplus in June was almost
double the May figure and four times as high as a year earlier.
But both imports and exports fell: imports of DM49.5bn were down almost 3
per cent on May, while exports were more than 1 per cent lower at DM51.5bn.
The pan-German deficit on the current account, which includes services and
other invisible elements, rose to DM4.3bn, compared with DM4bn in May and
also in June last year.

Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the former foreign minister who helped guide
Spain's integration into the European Community, died yesterday after a long
illness, AP reports from Madrid. He was 62.
Mr Fernandez Ordonez had asked to be relieved from his post as foreign
minister in June. He had suffered from cancer of the liver and gall bladder
problems and was also operated on for an intestinal ailment in 1989.
Formerly known as the untiring workhorse of the Socialist government of Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, Mr Fernandez Ordonez took over at the
Foreign Ministry in 1985, three years after the Socialists took office. One
of the most popular and respected figures in the Gonzalez government, he was
replaced on June 26 by Mr Javier Solana.
News reports said Mr Gonzalez interrupted his summer holidays on Thursday to
visit Mr Fernandez Ordonez early yesterday.
A tax lawyer by training, Mr Fernandez Ordonez was outspoken in his advocacy
of EC unity - and Spain's controversial efforts to rise to the challenge.

Scandinavian Airlines yesterday cancelled nearly all flights from Norway and

Reuter reports from Stockholm.
The airline was able to operate only a handful of international flights from
Oslo and Copenhagen using non-striking Swedish crew. SAS's Norwegian and
Danish cabin crew members had walked off their jobs on Thursday in a protest
over planned job reductions at the airline. However, Norwegian cabin crew
yesterday agreed to return to work after their union agreed to call a legal
strike if their demands for SAS to change its job-reduction plans were not
met.
Their strikes followed a two-day stoppage by Swedish cabin and ground crew
which also disrupted operations.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Paris Opera acts out off-stage drama: Lengthy union
negotiations and an accidental death in the chorus have split management at
L'Opera de Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW crisis has erupted in the Paris opera world following the dramatic
resignation of Mr Philippe Belaval as director general of L'Opera de Paris,
after weeks of conflict with Mr Pierre Berge, the controversial president.
The immediate cause of Mr Belaval's resignation was last month's accident in
Seville, when a set collapsed during an Opera de Paris production of Verdi's
Otello, killing one member of the chorus and injuring 30 others.
Mr Belaval has since clashed with Mr Myung Whun Chung, artistic director and
a protege of Mr Berge, over who should bear responsibility for the tragedy.
The Seville disaster followed a tense period of industrial disputes at
L'Opera de Paris, which operates the opulent new Opera Bastille, as well as
the Opera Comique and Palais Garnier. This tension came to a head late last
month in a row between Mr Belaval and Mr Berge over the conduct of their
long-running negotiations with the trade unions.
Mr Berge, known as Pierre la Panthere because of his fiery temperament, made
a fortune by founding Yves Saint Laurent, the famous French fashion house
and is a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand.
Mr Belaval's resignation is the latest in a series of dramas to have hit
L'Opera de Paris in the four temptestuous years of his presidency.
Mr Berge first hit the headlines at L'Opera de Paris by firing Mr Daniel
Barenboim, the world-renowned German conductor, as artistic director. There
has since been the controversy over the two-year-old Opera Bastille, the
Pounds 70m showcase of the French government's ambitious arts investment
programme.
President Mitterrand saw Opera Bastille as a 'people's opera' with a
state-of-the-art auditorium and cheap seats.
But while the new opera has won praise for its productions, it has been
burdened by the old L'Opera de Paris union agreements resulting in
intermittent strikes and high ticket prices.
Mr Belaval has for the past 20 months been locked in negotiations with the
unions to amend those agreements.
The original deadline for the negotiations was set for next Saturday, but
last month Mr Berge, to Mr Belaval's fury, agreed to extend it until
November.
Mr Belaval resigned in a letter which was fiercely critical of L'Opera de
Paris' management.
Three other senior executives left last week amid rumours of more
departures.
So far the crisis has not affected the programme, since the opera house has
closed for the summer, but the Opera Bastille may have to delay the premiere
of Arthur Honegger's Marriage of Figaro which was intended to be its first
production in the autumn.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE OF the biggest UK insurance companies will still be in the red when
they report pre-tax losses for the first half of 1992 next week.
But with rate increases in the home, motor and commercial insurance markets
taking hold, and companies avoiding the weather losses which have bedevilled
them in recent years, there are some glints of light on the horizon.
General Accident, which reports on Tuesday, is expected widely to do best
with pre-tax losses cut to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m compared with a
deficit of Pounds 105.2m at the same stage in 1991. GA might even have made
a small profit in the second quarter, according to some analysts.
Commercial Union, the most successful and aggressive UK insurer, is on
Wednesday expected to report losses of around Pounds 30m, a deterioration on
last year's Pounds 26.3m.
Royal Insurance, which has the weakest balance sheet, is on Thursday
expected to register losses of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 100m, compared
with a deficit of Pounds 97m last year.
Royal, a market leader in domestic mortgage indemnity insurance, continues
to be affected badly by the slump in the housing market.
Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is expected to report a significant
fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to June when it announces its
results on Thursday.
Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen from Pounds 967m to around Pounds
760m. Last year's results were, however, boosted by acquisition benefits.
Net debt, which is US dollar denominated, is expected to have fallen to
Pounds 1.1bn because of the weakness of the currency.
British Airways' first-quarter figures, on Tuesday, should reveal pre-tax
profits of around Pounds 90m compared with Pounds 9m a year earlier. The
market will also be looking for news of progress on cost cutting, the recent
deal to take a Dollars 750m stake in USAir, and clues over the impact of
price wars in the airline industry.
BA appears to be gaining market share, but this might be at the expense of a
lower turnover per seat.

FT  08 AUG 92 / An everyday story of BBC folk: Raymond Snoddy explains the
drama behind the drama of Eldorado
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST there is a 50-year old called Bunny who goes to a funeral in England
and brings a teenage bride called Fizz back to the Costa del Sol. Fizz is
about to go missing, unlikely to return, although it is unclear whether this
is because of the needs of the plot or the quality of her acting. Certainly
Fizz's fate seemed to be a surprise to the actress portraying her, Kathy
Pitkin.
Then there is 40-something Trish Valentine and her toy-boy German lover
Dieter, as well as many more characters, marooned on the mythical Costa
Eldorado, who are about to be introduced have relationships and disappear.
'Everyone has a secret, and everybody is running away from something,' says
Tony Holland, one of the creators of the BBC's Pounds 10m soap, or popular
drama, in which 30 characters act out their tale of 'sun, sand, sangria -
and of course sex' in an urbanisation in the mountains near Malaga.
Right now it could be the bad ratings and unflattering things that have been
said about some of the acting that some of the characters are running away
from. Rumours that a serious coach crash will be written into the series
soon have been vigorously denied.
It is more difficult to deny that the three times a week drama, and Sunday
omnibus edition, is having a tough time. It was supposed to shore up BBC1's
ratings and even add maybe 1.5 per cent to the Corporation's audience share
in the increasingly bitter battle with ITV.
It started with an audience of 10m, but fell to between 4.4m and 5.7m in the
week ending July 26. Even more ominously, the unofficial figure for last
Friday's main showing was only 2.8m.
So, just as interesting as the problems of Bunny and Fizz are the growing
torments of three middle aged, talented and strong-minded characters called
Julia, Jonathan and Verity. All three have much to lose.
At stake for Julia Smith, a determined lady of a certain age, is her
reputation as a creator of successful soaps. Her credits include EastEnders
 -a more down-to-earth gritty soap which last week attracted an audience of
more than 16m. Julia Smith has now retired from Eldorado suffering from
exhaustion, after getting the drama on air. There are no plans for her to
return within the next six months to the real Spanish village, which cost
the BBC Pounds 1.5m. Corinne Hollingworth has been rushed out to Spain from
Albert Square, the set of EastEnders, to be series producer.
Jonathan Powell, the suave, charming controller of BBC 1, has even more to
lose. Some say Jonathan could be in trouble even if Eldorado is a success.
Big viewing figures for something as obviously populist as Eldorado could
embarrass John Birt, who takes over as BBC director general in April with a
mission to emphasise the Corporation's distinctiveness and public service
broadcasting role.
Jonathan, a stout fellow, is standing fully behind Eldorado and has little
fault to find. He flew out to the set to tell the cast and the assembled
tabloid journalists so on Wednesday. An acting coach is, however, being sent
out in case help is needed with the more difficult scenes.
For Verity Lambert, the powerful creator of Cinema Verity, the stakes are
even higher than her three-year contract. Eldorado is the largest commission
ever given to the UK's independent production sector. A flop would cause
anguish in Charlotte Street in London where independents perch and hope.
Luckily Verity has experience of turning programmes round. One of her
previous creations, Minder, failed to set the world alight on its first
outing. It is now one of the most popular drama series.
It is too early to write off or write out Bunny, Trish and Dieter, Jonathan,
Verity or even Julia. The sound of crashing soaps is not unusual at the
beginning. Coronation Street was voted a disaster 32 years ago. EastEnders'
audience dipped to 5m before starting its climb. Last week's ratings were
particularly unrepresentative because of the competing attractions of the
Olympics.
Jonathan deliberately started Eldorado in the summer, when many of its
potential viewers are on holiday in Spain so that it would have time to
settle down in time for the autumn viewing season. Then, he hopes, Eldorado
will come into its own. Jonathan had better be right, for besides giving the
actors more coaching, killing off a few characters or doing more filming off
the set, little can can be done to change the drama. To an unusual degree
Eldorado is locked into its locale and format. And maybe audiences will just
not be interested in the doings of rootless expats of various nationalities.
Eldorado's fate should be clear from the mid-November ratings. Meanwhile the
best chance of avoiding disaster is all the publicity generated by those who
think it should be axed immediately.

WHAT A lot of Capulets and Montagues there are in London.
At the Barbican, the RSC is doing Shakespeare's play, English National
Ballet returns Ashton's ballet to the Royal Festival Hall next week, and
tonight the Royal Ballet brings its Covent Garden season to a close with the
last of a dozen performances of MacMillan's version. In the latter, there
have been six pairs of star crossed lovers, with two Juliets and one Romeo
making their debuts on Thursday.
For Altynai Asylmuratova, this was her second version of Juliet within seven
weeks, for she was also dancing the Lavrovsky version with her native Kirov
on that company's recent American tour; I saw her dance it in New York. In
both, she is a stellar, picturesque heroine, unusually sweet and
over-inclined to present the role as a string of shining
photo-opportunities. Lavrovsky's and MacMillan's steps and interpretations
are different but, to her, the differences are not significant.
No doubt she will relax further into the detailed verismo of MacMillan's
version and perhaps she will come to grasp the fact that his Juliet should
sweep the whole ballet along on the wave of her will.
Her Romeo, Zoltan Solymosi, gained more from the ballet, and this role is
the high water mark of his period with the Royal. The liveliness of
MacMillan's story telling and the dark brightness of Asylmuratova stirred
him to a new ardour and intensity. At first, with Rosaline, this was Romeo
as smoothie, an unusually practised young elegant - but, with Juliet and the
many marketplace scenes, he became more exuberant and artless.
These were both very guest-star performances, sometimes reminiscent of the
famous Fonteyn-Nureyev account of this ballet. Bonnie Moore's first Juliet
on Thursday afternoon was a far less striking affair. She is slight, but her
view of Juliet amounted to little more than a certain open-mouthed
petulance. Also, like too many young Royal women, her dancing is not truly
coordinated.
She was fortunate in the exemplary partnering and dancing of her Romeo,
Bruce Sansom. No one today shows this role's difficult steps with such
lucidity. His acting, too, is vivid.
Of the two conductors, Barry Wordsworth has provided competent and vivacious
routine, but Philip Ellis, the first-rate young maestro from the Birmingham
Royal Ballet, is something more. He shapes every incident with distinction.
One hopes to hear him lead a full-length Tchaikovsky at Covent Garden before
long.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Eden in downtown Paris - Alice Rawsthorn leaves her
shoes behind and loses herself inher imagination in an urban adult playpen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few things that are quite so soothing as walking barefoot over
fine, silver sand on a steamy summer day. But you usually expect to find the
sand on a seaside beach, not in an art gallery in the bustling streets of
central Paris.
One of the ground floor galleries at the Jeu de Paume in the Tuileries
Gardens has been turned into a giant sandpit for the summer. The sandpit,
otherwise known as Eden, is a replica of an installation created in 1969 by
Helio Oiticica, the Brazilian artist.
Oiticica saw Eden as a place where people would be tempted away from reality
to lose themselves in their imagination. He built it as an adult playpen
with brightly coloured tents and tepees pitched on the sand. There is even a
wooden shelf where gallery goers can leave their shoes to walk inside. It is
a masterstroke. The tactile experience of walking on the sand is such a
shock to the senses that it makes you forget you are in an inner-urban art
gallery and whisks you into Oiticica's world.
Oiticica was one of the leading lights in the Brazilian avant garde until
his death, at the age of 43, in 1980. He was one of a group of artists
working in Rio de Janiero during the 1960s and 1970s who were trying to
define a Brazilian form of modernism.
He was influenced by European artists, Mondrian and Malevitch in painting,
and Godard in video and installation. But he also experimented with
Brazilian themes, the collective ritual of feasting and the visual rhetoric
of kitsch, which he parodied in his Tropicalia installations of caged
parrots and gaudy carnival costumes.
At times the show verges on a hippy nostalgia trip back to groovy Rio good
life, with Stockhausen and the Rolling Stones blaring out of the sound
system. There is even a reconstruction of Cosmacoca, an installation where
you lie on mattresses to watch slide projections of Luis Bunuel, the Spanish
film maker, his face latticed with cocaine lines, to the strains of Jimi
Hendrix.
The overwhelming impression is Oiticica's sense of fun. The sounds, the
sandpit and carnival costumes, all evoke the theatricality of Rio street
life. Even his formal work, the Spatial Relief mobiles and minimalist
paintings, turn the gallery into a blaze of his favourite colours of white,
yellow, orange and red - so much so that it comes as a surprise when you
glance out of the Jeu de Paume windows to see the splendour of Paris, the
Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries Gardens.
* * *
Michel Verjux, like Helio Oiticica, is obsessed with trying to find a new
artistic language for his era. There the similarity ends. The contrast
between the gaudy gaiety of the Oiticica show at the Jeu de Paume and the
cool restraint of Verjux's exhibition at the Musee de l'Art Moderne de la
Ville de Paris could not be greater.
Verjux, a French artist in his early 40s, sees art as a means of
communication and a forum for exploring the ideas of the linguistic
theorists, Ferdinand de Saussure and Karl Budieresisher, who are so
influential in contemporary French thought. His chosen medium is electric
light. Verjux chose it partly because he sees it as a pure, irreducible form
and partly because of the linguistic associations between l'illumination,
the French word for light, and the power of art in communication and as a
force for enlightenment.
He has taken over the whole top floor of the MAM for Au Milieu, his latest
installation. It consists of 16 projectors throwing perfect circular pools
of light onto the white walls. The circles are eerily beautiful. Their
similarity in shape and size prompts you to peer closely at the colour
contrasts in the white and at the blue rims around the edge.
Verjux's electric circles are also peculiarly appropriate to MAM itself.
Electricity is a common theme in the work of the early 20th century artists
in the MAM permanent collection, such as Robert Delaunay and Raoul Dufy,
both of whom saw electric power as a force for progress. The circles also
complement the Art Deco curves and geometrics of MAM's architecture and
accentuate its nautical feel by evoking the portholes of 1930s luxury
liners.
It is brave of a publicly funded arts institution to give over an entire
floor to a single installation. But MAM, under Suzanne Page's directorship,
has established itself as one of Paris's most imaginative museums. Au Milieu
is at its best when the gallery is quiet. Go early in the morning before the
crowds arrive.
* * *
Another publicly funded Paris arts institution is under scrutiny at
L'Institut de l'Architecture. It is exhibiting the work of Dominique
Perrault, the 39-year-old French architect who has been clouded by
controversy over the giant glass towers he has designed for the new national
French library, the Tres Grand Bibiliotheque.
Perrault, like most of the new generation of French architects reared on an
era of publicly sponsored competitions, has designed many more buildings
than he has built. The exhibition offers a timely opportunity to trace the
development of his ideas from his first building, the Someloir factory at
Chateaudun, to the library itself.
Helio Oiticica at the Jeu de Paume, Place de la Concorde until August 23.
(Closed Monday) Michel Verjux at Musee de l'Art Moderne de la Ville de
Paris, 11 Avenue du President Wilson until October 4. (Closed Monday)
Dominique Perrault at L'Institut de l'Architecture, 6 bis rue de Tournon,
until September 27. (Closed Monday and Tuesday).

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Parsimony paints a poor picture - Companies find
collections raise more than spirits / Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOWLY, oh so very slowly, companies are improving the quality of the art on
their office walls. If they want any encouragement it is perhaps significant
that some of the most successful British companies - Unilever, ICI, NatWest
 -have the best art collections, while connoisseurs among the banks, such as
Flemings, with its Scottish art, have collections they regard as among their
better investments.
But you can still visit boardrooms where the walls are covered with abject
hunting prints, or even the portraits of former directors. It is
inexcusable. Art can stimulate the work force; project a positive image for
a company; provide patronage for British artists; and perhaps show a good
investment. Some might even be tax deductible. There is no excuse, when
companies invest many millions in a new HQ, for skimping on interior design.
The word is getting through. Pearl Assurance last month moved into a Pounds
100m HQ near Peterborough which is brimming with modern art. It asked the
Contemporary Art Society to select most of it, and its Pounds 700,000
purchased over 120 pieces. The commission is the largest handled by the CAS,
a charitable organisation which helps galleries and museums acquire
contemporary art.
The CAS has worked for ICI, Unilever, Nat West, De Beers, and for Stuart
Lipton, one of the few developers convinced that art improves the
marketability of projects. At Pearl, there is a Michael Sandle sculpture in
the courtyard and a tapestry by Joanna Buxton at the entrance. The paintings
were the responsibility of the CAS. From its contacts it supplied works by
new graduates - like Peter Doig, Zoe Benbow and Jenny Franklin - as well as
established names like Maggi Hambling and John Keane. Many of the paintings
are large and bold and are used to unify and individualise open plan
offices. Artists and dealers are usually happy to sell to CAS at the keenest
prices.
Pearl spent a derisory sum on art compared with the cost of the building. It
raised almost Pounds 600,000 of its investment by selling the traditional
furnishings of its old HQ in Holborn.
In the recessionary future, the CAS, and other corporate art advisers - like
Coode-Adams Martin, Art for Offices and Unicorn - will be employed more on
refurbishing than on new projects. But the best new buildings are still
those improved by artist and craftsman. Lipton's office block on London's
Ludgate Hill is embellished with 40,000 hand made tiles by Rupert Spira; the
new ITV HQ in Gray's Inn Road is enhanced with work by John Loker; and the
National Power offices in Swindon have attractive floating sails in the
atrium, created by Sue Ridge.
And the most expensive new building in the UK this century, the Pounds 450m
British Library, will not look quite as austere as feared. The government,
in an act of amazing parsimony, refused to provide its promised Pounds
500,000 for works of art to set off the piazza. Now the Foundation for Sport
and the Arts has come up with Pounds 175,000 to enable Eduardo Paolozzi to
complete his mammoth statue based on Blake's drawing of Newton.
* * *
At one level, the links between property developers and the arts have never
been stronger. To attract potential tenants to view unlet office blocks,
developers have held concerts, encouraged galleries or art schools to
display paintings and sculptures and even, in the case of Imry Merchant,
owners of Rose Court on the site of the Elizabethan theatre, held a
performance of The Merchant of Venice.
Now, LMS, owners of Angel Square in Islington, have come up with the
ultimate arts event. In September, Artangel, the avant-garde performance
group, will take over the unlet block to perform 'soundscapes' by Hans Peter
Kush, who specialises in creating unique audio environments. Visitors,
limited to groups of 80, will ascend in the lift through a multi-layered
arts happening.
On each of the five floors they will be confronted by a different
environment, ranging from a threatening dark space with flashing lights on
floor one to a peaceful nautical atmosphere on floor five. On two nights,
dancers will perform a fresh routine on each floor. Can the time be far off
when an unlettable office block is permanently converted into a performing
arts centre?
* * *
The Edinburgh Festival opens next weekend, and the auguries are good.
Advance ticket sales have brought in Pounds 800,000, down Pounds 100,000 on
forecast. But, at a time when late bookings are the norm, the new Festival
director, Brian MacMaster, is not too desperate.
The big surprise is that one of the events with vacant seats is the Pina
Bausch dance troupe, making its first UK visit for 10 years. Most amazed by
the unsold tickets is Pina Bausch herself who has not played to an empty
seat in 15 years. She has volunteered to bring over a jet load of fans if
bookings do not pick up.
The Fringe this year is the biggest ever, with over 1,100 different shows.
One seems essential. Miles Kingston is offering a 'Rough Guide to the
Fringe' at which he will advise on how to react when heckled by comedians;
what to do if you are the only person in the audience; and how to avoid
audience participation.

Remember all that hoo-hah a month or so back about the death of the West
End: shows closing; theatres dark; Angels in extremis? Well, as predicted,
it was just a summer newspaper space filler. Attendances in June were
actually racing ahead, up 7 per cent on last June, helping 1992 attendances
rise 5 per cent, to date, over last year. Indeed, audiences are only 2 per
cent down on the record levels of 1990.
Not that everything is bliss. The profusion of West End theatres, with three
more - the Criterion, the Donmar, and the Savoy - set to re-open soon, means
there is greater competition than ever for the custom of the 11m
theatregoers each year. Impressarios are offering more and more cut price
incentives to draw in punters, so postponing that wonderful day when they
cover their production costs and start to make a profit.
But the real threat to the West End this summer comes not from the recession
but from Camden and Westminster Councils, who have the theatres within their
boundaries. Camden has extended daytime parking restrictions to 8.30pm and
Westminster is planning the same. This makes theatre going much more
troublesome for the 2m-odd who take their cars to shows.

Anyone disillusioned with the slide in equity prices, might be interested in
a memorabilia sale at Knebworth House tomorrow. Among the lots on offer is
'The Little Stockbroker' slot machine, which provided some diversion in the
1930s. Investing a penny (old coinage) can provide a remarkable return. If
the spin turns up 'textiles', you get five pennies back. 'Sterling' delivers
a copper bottomed sixpence. Even 'coal' offers a fair gamble - a two penny
dividend. But don't invest in trusts, bonds, or loans: they just swallow up
your money.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Plot saved from a pillow case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS Chesterton who called Othello the 'Dangerous Pillow Case',
criticising a plot which turned on a handkerchief. The danger with staging
Othello lies in its tendency to slope away into farce. This is just avoided
in a plucky production from The Court Theatre Company in London's King's
Cross.
The Company was formed in 1980 and moved to its present venue in 1990. It is
the professional wing of the Court Theatre Training Company; the cast
includes recently graduated trainees making their professional debuts. The
productions offer an opportunity to see new acting talent: work in progress
and actors in progress.
This Othello is a case in point. Seeing actors at this moment of their
careers can be highly instructive. Shakespearean verse is never easy and,
throughout the evening, the cast grapples honestly to stay on terms with the
sense and music in the language. Brabantio's 'Who would be a father?' is a
throwaway instead of the key to his character. And Othello's 'Yet she must
die lest she betray more men' misses the point - 'Yet she must die lest she
betray more men' catches the feeling better.
The play avoids props, usually a way of concentrating the action in a
minimal setting. But inexperienced actors without props can lose their way.
Here, Othello and Iago act the central scene 'Ha, I like not that', which
turns the play, over a set of battle plans; they looked more at home with
something to do.
Props can be a guide to character. Trevor Nunn's superlative 1989 Othello
(Willard White and Ian McKellan) at Stratford showed how intimate and nervy
the play could be; the action was an imprint of Iago's mind. McKellan's
brilliance was to find in Iago's 'I am that I am' a man obsessed with order.
An over-meticulous, precise Iago was forever adjusting, rearranging or
deploying things.
This production (directed by June Abbott) takes Nunn's closet-studio route
into the play: all gloomy interiors and whispered confidences. Abbot makes
this more claustrophobic by hanging a low blue canopy and focusing the
lights through it. Two performances emerge with great credit: David Bliss as
Iago and Alison Williams as Emilia find subtleties and strengths in the
verse, creating energy from what they do on stage. Gary Lawrence as Othello
is convincing but needs to find calmer depths. Nicholas de Carlo, on his
professional debut, turns in a good Cassio.
The delight of the evening is to find new actors tackling a classic. The
performance is honest (as befits the play), serious, thoughtful and
thought-provoking.
The Courtyard, King's Cross, until August 16 (071-833-0870).

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: An Irish month in the country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALANNAH HOPKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIAN FRIEL adapted Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons for the stage in 1987,
and now turns his hand to the master's five-act classic. Although written in
1850, 10 years before Chekhov was born, A Month in the Country is, in
essence, a Chekhovian drama, and its merits were not fully recognised until
Stanislasky's production in 1909.
Friel's starting point was a literal translation especially commissioned
from Christopher Heaney, and he has remained broadly faithful to the
original, retaining its Russian setting and leisurely pace but rendering the
text in Irish idiom and adding a few jokes.
The theatre-going world divides into those who thrive on five-act Chekhovian
'comedies', and those who do not. I admit to being among the latter. I had
hoped that Brian Friel might take a brisk approach to Turgenev. Instead, he
displays the reverence of the true devotee, giving us too much Turgenev and
not enough Friel.
The problem is the central drama of Natalya's infatuation with her young
son's tutor, the penniless student, Aleksey. In her confusion at this sudden
strong emotion, she alienates her long-standing admirer Rakitin,
precipitates her ward, Vera, into a loveless marriage, and very nearly loses
the devotion of her mild, ineffectual husband.
Friel has chosen to take Natalya very seriously indeed, while heightening
the comedy of the other three couples' courtships. The result is a play that
works brilliantly around the edges. But it lacks the ironic approach to the
rather ridiculous Natalya which would make the central predicament
sympathetic to the modern mind.
It must be said that, in spite of the rather grey set, the cast works so
hard that a long evening's theatre holds hardly a dull moment. Catherine
Byrne does her best to make the infuriating Natalya convincing, and Lorcan
Cranitch plays her admirer Rakitin with suitable dignity. But it is the rest
of the characters that supply the laughs or engage the emotions: Karen
Ardiss's Vera, forced to grow up overnight and accept the proposal of the
buffoon-like neighbour, Bolshintsov; J D Kellerher's energetic and boyish
Aleksey; the engaging young Anoine Byrne as the servant Katya; and John
Kavanagh as the lecherous German tutor whose every utterance is a
malapropism.
But the great hit of the evening was Donal McCann's doctor - one minute, as
he says himself, 'the laughing, fawning, ingratiating Shpigelsky', the next
'the bitter, angry, cunning peasant'. Not only does he have all the best
lines, he delivers them with exactly the right amount of brio.
It did not seem strange that the Russian cast were speaking with Irish
accents, and using Irish idioms, but a perhaps unintended side effect was to
highlight the similarities between the Russian and Irish peasantry. The
result was that the audience immediately felt at home with the lower orders,
making the play's minor characters more successful than its more serious
central ones.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Rimsky's rescue of Musorgsky
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THURSDAY'S Prom at London's Royal Albert Hall interestingly, discreetly
offered a northern view of music. Russian, Polish and Finnish works were
played by an excellent northern orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony, under
its principal conductor, the Pole Jerzy Maksymiuk. Musorgsky's Night on the
Bare Mountain was given in its original 1867 version, as a tone-poem
completely of Musorgsky's own composition; and one realised how much of
Rimsky-Korsakov's own composition there is in his, the received version of
the work.
Maksymiuk's reading was lively and sympathetic, but could not conceal a
tameness about Musorgsky's piece, a dourness and artificial danciness. It is
clearly not, unlike the spellbinding Rimsky recension, a masterpiece.
Rakhmaninov's quite rare fourth piano concerto (1927), a fine product of his
later, brittler compositional period, was played with metallic brilliance
and, on occasion, touching delicacy, by Nikolai Demidenko, making his debut
at the Proms.
The concert ended with the Finn Sibelius's seventh symphony, and its modern
element was the Pole, Witold Lutoslawski's Livre pour orchestre, a work of
1968. This assured performance brought back keen memories of the clear,
hard-hitting dissonant sounds natural to those avant-garde days.
Lutoslawski has compared the conducting of his works to tending a garden.
Maksymiuk was suitably green-fingered.
*****
The latest in this year's Proms series of BBC commissions - Augury for
chorus and orchestra by the Russian-born, British-based Elena Firsova - made
a cloudy impression at its premiere on Tuesday. The work is a slowish and
somewhat meandering orchestral rhapsody which closes with a choral setting
of Blake's 'To see a World in a grain of sand'; the manner is late-Romantic,
all-purpose poetic, a fusion of Delius and Mahler. Committed execution by
the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus under Andrew Davis could not disguise
a vacuousness at the heart of the inspiration and invention.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Minnows vs big spenders - Tonight's
athletics relay finals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the
four relay finals. Tonight it is nation versus nation.
What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is
that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries -
or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the
former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won
before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands
(nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa). The Dutch, with
one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South
America (nil) combined. The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and
1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay
medals.
With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays
always require a little luck - the developing countries will continue the
gentle redistribution of medals. But although they have talent, few can
match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers.
The US 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett. Even
so they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night's
semi-finals. In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis
ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his
eighth Olympic gold.
One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh gold
with victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics may
bring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores the
experience.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the
women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she
had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the
other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to
overhaul him in the long jump. Even though the long jump had not finished
and even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewis
began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.
He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave. This is a man who derives immense
pleasure from winning in front of a packed house. Lewis will be difficult to
suppress tonight.
Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m.
Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their
continent's tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.
Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside Community
College in California, to hone his running on good tracks.
On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after
the gentlest push on the accelerator. The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followed
him down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellow
Arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard. Morcelli has not been
beaten in the 1,500m since 1990.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Marathon a 'sell-out to
commercialism' - Tomorrow's runners face daunting heat and a wicked finish,
just for TV ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one
of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held. It is also without
doubt the most gruelling. Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution
levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's
marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run. There are
lots of figures to show why. It is estimated that when the race begins in
Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an
already-uncomfortable 25`C. Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant
heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a
temperature of up to 30`C. More debilitating still, relative humidity in
Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent. With more than 10
kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run. The last 4.6km,
which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of
the hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, and
includes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep
'red' run. But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary
difficulty of tomorrow's race. Last Saturday, in the Olympic stadium, I
watched the final moments and aftermath of the women's marathon, begun at
the same time of day and run in similar conditions. Never in any event
voluntarily entered into, sporting or otherwise, have I seen such signs of
physical and mental distress. The race was won by the Unified Team's
Valentina Yegorova in 2 hours 32 minutes, a time considerably slower than
that achieved by women on less demanding Olympic marathon courses in Los
Angeles and Seoul. After her nearest competitor, Japan's Yuko Arimori, came
in eight seconds later, they had the energy - between bouts of grimacing and
lowering their heads to their knees - to embrace each other and smile for
the cameras.
It was a different story in the 'mixed zone,' the area under the stadium
where athletes recover after their events. As runner after runner stumbled
and limped into the room - several were brought in senseless on stretchers -
the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued after
weeks of exposure and deprivation at sea.
As a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face,
Manuela Machado of Mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a
potted palm. Several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as
water was poured over them; others stood hunched over, grasping their
abdomens.
If anyone moved at all, it was with agonised faces and the slowest of
hobbles. These are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm for
marathon running or for the ideals of Olympic competition.
Chris Brasher, organiser of the London marathon, was on hand to witness the
suffering, and was incensed. Male marathon runners will face the same kind
of problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.
In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the
event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was
unjustified and a 'sell-out to commercialism.
'To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing in
the morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hill
is just criminal in my opinion,' said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medal
athlete and noted sportswriter.
I spoke to Britain's Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and
1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.
He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards
Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about
tomorrow's slog.
Like almost all the athletes running tomorrow, Brace is a professional
runner who specialises in marathons. He takes an objective, long-term view
of his profession. As an income-earner, marathon running is an activity with
liabilities and limitations, and requires business management as well as
physical ability.
The winner of the London marathon earns a tidy Dollars 50,000 and the New
York, Boston and Japanese runs are all in the same prize-winning category.
But these and less financially-rewarding events are physically debilitating,
and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape.
With their careers and financial prospects in mind, top-level runners
normally only run two marathons a year. As Brace says, when you have only
two pay-days out of 365, you choose, plan and train for them with great
care.
Brace trains extremely carefully indeed. 'Running a marathon is the easy
part,' he says. 'The hard part is the lead-up to achieving the performance
level required.' He starts training three months before an event by running
80 miles a week and then building progressively. For the last six weeks he
runs 120 miles a week.
Normally he would hope that such a routine brings a pay-off. But the Olympic
marathon is an exception: the only top-level marathon that carries no prize
money. Brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial
spin-offs involved, 'it does not necessarily make sense to run to win.'
Given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve
physical condition for races that do bring in money, he says, many runners
will give less than their best effort.
Nonetheless, there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely
financial. Italian Gelindo Bordin, who came first in the 1988 Seoul Olympic
marathon, is a strong contender. So is Djibouti's Ahmed Salah, who came
third in Seoul. Ibrahim Hussein of Kenya and Hiromi Taniguchi of Japan are
also possible winners.
None of them, though, will make a molehill out of the steep and formidable
ascent of Montjuic.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Atlanta prepares itself for a tidal
wave - The 1996 hosts are promising to avoid cuteness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHISPER it not in Georgia but the lowest Nielsen TV audience ratings for the
Barcelona Olympics in any US city have been in - Atlanta. The capital of the
New South and host for the 1996 Olympics appears to have switched off in a
big way.
'We have an explanation for that,' confided Billy Payne, without apparent
embarrassment. Payne heads Atlanta's organising committee.
'During the opening few days our baseball team, the Braves, were in the
middle of the longest winning streak in their history. If I'd been home I'd
be watching them too.' Payne is the kind of warm southerner who can use
words like shucks without difficulty.
In the past month, Atlanta has sent close to 120 personnel to Barcelona to
observe how to run the Games. Every Spanish venue manager has had a Georgian
behind him with a stopwatch and clipboard. Transport co-ordinators have been
telling the Americans what is going on.
Since the '96 Games were awarded to Atlanta two years ago, Barcelona has
been the first chance to see how things work in real life. And there will
not be another opportunity for hands-on experience. The knowledge is both
vital but possibly misleading.
'The ultimate lesson is that you don't want to copy anybody. Each Games is
unique,' said Payne. 'We're enormously impressed with things here in
Barcelona but we know that we'll do it differently in Atlanta. The cultural
differences get in the way, and in any case you're not comparing apples with
apples.'
Atlanta's Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) knows well that the world
will expect the mechanics of the 1996 Games - TV facilities, computers,
accommodation and so on - to function with invisible American efficiency.
'Heaven help us if we get the hardware wrong,' says Payne.
Everyone concerned with Olympic planning agrees that in many ways it is a
frustrating business. One senior Atlanta aide likens it to building a
Dollars 1.5bn corporation, running on roller bearings - and then dismantling
it after 16 days of efficient, powerful life.
Since Georgia's capital already has almost all the roads, sports venues and
hotels it requires, its position is very different from Barcelona's.
'We are determined to have trained our volunteers and service providers well
in advance of when Barcelona has done it,' said Payne. The number of people
involved is likely to be close to 50,000.
Those who have observed Americans in Europe will know that 'cultural cringe'
is not a phenomenon confined to Australasia. A large team of journalists
sent to Catalonia by the Atlanta Constitution newspaper have been telling
the folks back home that nothing Georgia has to offer can compare with the
cultural depth, architecural riches and general elan of Barcelona.
'I thought we'd climbed the inferiority mountain once,' sighed Billy Payne.
'When we bid for the Games so many people asked: 'Against Athens] How can
you?' Of course Barcelona is marvellous and the architectural backdrop is
marvellous, but they have been at it 600 years longer than us.'
Payne is anxious to reassure the world that it will not have a large helping
of apple pie and cuteness forced down its throat.
'We are very definitely not aiming for a statement about America,' said
Payne. 'Our focus will be the emotions and traditions of the Olympic
movement.'
Meanwhile, Robert Brennan, communications head for ACOG, will have the task
of taking home slides, videotapes and written material from Barcelona to
brief and train the growing staff back in the US. He is only partly
optimistic about its impact.
'I can describe a tidal wave to you. I can show you photos of it coming up
the beach. But until you've been hit by one you have no idea in the world
what it's like.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Dream homes - nightmare scenarios -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Emma Tucker add up the human costs - and benefits
 -of the property market collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE steep fall in British house prices has forced some people to make
painful decisions. Others have been able to profit from distress. Here four
people tell remarkably different stories of how the collapse of the market
affected their lives and decisions. James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, a
financial adviser, gives his assessment of each case.
THE FIRST TIME BUYER . . .
Michael Fitzgerald, a London banker in his early 30s, this week exchanged
contracts on his first home - a flat in Islington, north London. 'I've been
in a position to buy for a number of years,' he said. 'But I haven't done so
both because of market conditions and personal reasons.'
He has been renting since he left university in Ireland and moved to London.
By the time he joined the bank, he felt he could afford to buy a flat for
about Pounds 90,000, particularly since the bank would subsidise his
mortgage as a perk.
Like many others, he was tempted to buy in 1988 when the imminent abolition
of double mortgage tax relief sent the housing market into a frenzy. He held
off, partly because he could not find the right place and partly because of
the additional costs of owning a own home, beyond the mortgage payments.
'At that time I would have bought a place as an investment,' he said, but
this idea was undermined as house prices began to fall.
He decided to buy now because he expected monthly mortgage payments would be
down to about the same level as his monthly rent of Pounds 300. 'In the
medium-term interest rates will probably drop so I think it is a reasonable
time to buy,' he says. As a first-time buyer he had the advantage of being
able to react quickly once he had chosen the flat he wanted.
The three bedroomed flat he has bought, a repossession, is exactly what he
was looking for. He believes that for the same amount of money, he would
only have been able to afford a two bedroom flat in the same area in 1988.
. . . picks a bargain
JH: Michael is very fortunate. He is buying at the right sort of time - the
London property market might not yet have reached its nadir but it should
improve in due course. He has been able to take advantage of other people's
desperation to sell and the general slump in prices. He is also able to
match interest payments to present rents.
Most of the current problems were created in the mid-1980s, when interest
rates were low and when people grossly over-extended themselves in the rush
to buy the biggest and best house they could possibly afford. They took no
account of the fact that interest rates might rise - and this is precisely
what happened.
People will therefore be more aware of the pitfalls in future, and buyers
and lenders will be more cautious - and realistic.
There should therefore be slower but more sustainable growth in the property
market. Whatever happens, Michael should be wary that he does not regard his
home as an investment.
THE GROUP OF FOUR . . .
In October 1988 Sarah Cranfield, now in her late 20s, clubbed together with
four friends to take out a 100 per cent mortgage on a house in Lewisham,
south London. 'At the time everyone was saying we couldn't lose on the
property boom,' she said. The four young professionals - two journalists, an
accountant and a personnel officer - were each responsible for a mortgage of
about Pounds 25,000, plus extra charges because of the supposedly greater
risk of lending to four people.
Within a year, higher interest rates had pushed their monthly payments from
about Pounds 240 per month to Pounds 340 each - more than each would have
paid to rent a similar house.
Three years later the friends decided it was time to sell; they had all
moved on, found partners and generally felt they had outgrown the property.
But the house was valued at some Pounds 20,000 less than the value of the
mortgage. Sarah and her friends decided to let the house but found that the
rent did not cover the mortgage payments.
Meanwhile, Sarah became pregnant and moved in with her husband, who was also
sitting on a loss in his one-bedroomed flat in Brixton. They are now trying
to sell it, desperate to move somewhere bigger as the baby grows up. But in
the two months that the Brixton flat has been on the market, only six people
have been to look at it - and none has shown an interest.
Sarah and her husband hope that they will be able to transfer their joint
debts to a new mortgage. But at Christmas she will be made redundant from
her job. Her husband's job is also at risk and with both out of work, they
are unlikely to find a lender willing to meet their needs.
. . . trapped by debt
JH: Sarah and her friends managed to get into the housing market at the top
of the boom.
Given that the first flat had a 100 per cent mortgage, there should have
been a mortgage indemnity insurance taken out. These only have limited
benefit for the borrowers, but if the property were to be repossessed, the
insurance should cover the balance. The danger is that the insurance company
might pursue the borrowers for the balance and they (the borrowers) would
have difficulty raising new finance in the future.
If the rent on the first property is only a little short of the costs of the
building, the borrowers should try to service the loan until a buyer can be
found at a reasonable price. Interest rates should fall over the course of
the next year. The costs of the loan will decrease - it will also stimulate
the market.
THE PRUDENT RENTER . . .
For almost a year David Kauders, an independent financial adviser in
Taunton, Somerset, has been renting a four bedroomed detached house close to
the town centre. The rent of Pounds 400 per month includes the water rates
and a gardener.
Kauders, who sold his last house, a small country cottage, for Pounds 33,000
in 1986, says: 'I am now renting a house I couldn't afford to buy'.
The house he is renting last changed hands for about Pounds 160,000 three
years ago. Kauders has calculated that if he had taken out a 20-year
mortgage of Pounds 150,000 on the house, he would be paying around Pounds
18,000 in interest alone. On top of this, he would have to spend around
Pounds 7,500 a year to repay the capital. This compares with a mere Pounds
4,800 a year in rent.
'Over 20 years I would spend something like half a million pounds to acquire
a property which could well be worth less than Pounds 100,000 by the end,'
he says. Meanwhile, it would take only a small level of savings a year to
accumulate Pounds 100,000 over 20 years.
'People are still making false assumptions about future rates of inflation
and house prices when it comes to buying homes,' Kauders believes. An
oversupply of property and a low inflationary economy means that house
prices will continue to fall for a long time yet. 'People should rent
somewhere now and gather their cash - in time they will be laughing,' he
says.
. . . bides his time
JH: There is a lot to be said for renting - David's experience demonstrates
the comparatively low costs involved. The problem is that the property is
not one's own. The time can always come when the owner either wants to sell
or to change the use of the property. Also, David's experience could be
limited to the south west of England and might not apply across the UK
property market - certainly not to London.
If the house was worth Pounds 160,000 three years ago, it would probably not
sell for more than Pounds 125,000 now. The current climate means that some
very good deals can be had.
There is also the question of comparative investments. David has measured
his situation over three years - possibly a rather unusual three years and
certainly too short a term over which to measure growth in investments. Over
the last two decades the overall return on property has outstripped most
equity indices.
However, those who put all their money into property can end up being 'asset
rich but cash poor'. David is probably maximising his potential retirement
income by building up a portfolio of cash/liquid assets on which to call
when income is required. A balance between the two forms of investment is
what is needed.
THE UNEMPLOYED DEBTOR . . .
Raymond Fender's problems began when the business for which he worked in
Tyneside went into liquidation last year. Monthly payments on his Pounds
50,000 mortgage were Pounds 465.
At first, he managed to meet the commitments by dipping into his building
society savings. After several months, however: 'I realised there was no
work for me and that our savings were being depleted quickly.' Raymond, 46,
and his wife, Pamela, decided reluctantly in November to put their
much-loved house, set in the countryside 10 miles west of Newcastle, on the
market.
'It was valued at Pounds 81,000 a year and a half back,' says Raymond. 'But
even though it is on the market for Pounds 67,950, we've had just one couple
coming to see it.'
As paying the mortgage became more and more difficult, Raymond decided to
talk to his lender. It agreed to a temporary reprieve by allowing him to
halve his monthly payments. That was nearly six months ago. Now, with
savings depleted, no prospect of a job and no buyer, the Fenders live in
fear of repossession.
'There will come a day when they will have to repossess,' said Raymond. 'The
worst thing is the uncertainty. You go to bed not knowing if, in the
morning, you are going to get a repossession order or a letter from the
lenders saying we've given you enough time.'
. . . waits in fear
JH: This is another sad tale - a very common one at the moment. No income
because job prospects are poor, and the inability to sell a property when
either capital is required or when a debt and debt servicing need to be
reduced.
Raymond will need to talk again to his lender to reassure them that he can
provide them with at least some flow of income until times improve. They
will prefer that to the alternative of repossession, which is costly to
them.
There is still some equity in the property. By halving his payments for six
months, his arrears have been increased by only Pounds 1,500 approximately.
This suggests that his lenders should be prepared to let matters run for at
least a further year - perhaps longer if property prices pick up.
Building societies are developing new strategies to offer a pragmatic
solution which will be in everyone's favour. There are likely to be some
sale and leaseback arrangements which may either involve housing
associations (someone buying the property and renting it to the owner), or
some form of reduction of interest payments for a period of time in return
for a percentage of any overall "profit' (sale price above loan value) on
final sale.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Houses: the myths and the reality: John Authers explains why
the market has sagged. He says houses look good value against past trends,
but buyers should forget about making big profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE medieval quacks around an ailing body, British building societies are
suggesting their cures for the sickly housing market. But why should anyone
believe that the market needs special medicine to aid recovery? Since house
prices have fallen on average by about a quarter in real terms since July
1989, some properties are beginning to seem good value.
As the charts on this page show, if you strip out inflation, houses are no
longer expensive judged against the trend of the past quarter-century.
Moreover, house prices as a proportion of average earnings - a measure of
what buyers can afford - are now close to their lowest for 25 years.
As in any other market, activity can be expected to revive when demand and
supply are brought into balance by a mutually convenient price; and present
prices appear, by historical criteria, to be not far from this point. But
the alarm is still easy to understand.
Weakness in the housing market hits British consumers more forcibly than
most other economic ills assailing the world - for example, exchange rate
fluctuations. This is partly because of the large debts incurred to buy
houses, and partly because of a deeply ingrained belief among the British
public that house prices would surf comfortably ahead of inflation for ever.
This 'bubble mentality' developed particularly strongly during the 1980s -
the decade of Thatcherism which produced a property-owning democracy and
bull markets in everything. House-buying was then endowed with an
unjustified illusion of grandeur. Houses were not only somewhere to live.
They became investments - and, with hindsight, unfortunately speculative
ones. Now, although house prices may seem ready to recover, buyers and
sellers must first attain a more realistic view of the market. It is no
longer, as a generation came to believe, a perpetual motion machine which
will carry every house owner effortlessly from debt to high prosperity.
It is not surprising that people were gripped by this idea. The graph of
actual prices shows that Pounds 10,000 invested in housing in 1955 was worth
Pounds 300,000 25 years later. It is the kind of comparison which inspires
feelings of pride and security among many householders, But these telephone
number figures are partly an illusion. Most of the rise represents
inflation. The line below shows that, in the real world, house prices
outstripped the rise in the retail prices index by only 2.2 percentage
points a year on average during the 1970s and 1980s.
In that period, house prices grew hardly faster than average earnings (if
both are adjusted for price inflation). Real earnings rose by an average of
1.7 per cent a year. These figures may inspire comfort, but nothing more.
But the 'boom' periods of the early 1970s, late 1970s and late 1980s
provided opportunities for big profits. These helped establish the myth that
borrowing to buy a house would always be a good investment.
Examined more closely, the figures tell a rather different story. Increases
in average earnings usually cause an increase in house prices. Earnings have
grown faster than inflation since the Second World War, helping housing
prices to inflate more quickly than most other products. But the phenomenon
is complex. The most important measure of whether it will be worthwhile to
buy a house is 'affordability,' generally measured as the ratio of average
house prices to average earnings.
This ratio varies widely and reveals a lot about the present state of the
housing market. Historically, the average house normally is worth about 3.5
times the average salary. If this ratio gets much above 4.0, prices come
under pressure because houses are hard to afford. In 1973, the ratio hit
4.95. The next year it was 4.25, and the following year 3.65. But this was
during an era when inflation topped 20 per cent. So affordability could
improve without big reductions in nominal house prices.
In the 1990s, with wages rising more slowly, affordability could be achieved
only by price cuts.
In 1988, the ratio was 4.25. This rose to 4.43 the following year, and moved
to 4.34 in 1990. According to the Building Societies' Association (BSA),
this fell to 3.90 last year and to 3.55 in the first quarter of this year.
That ratio now is probably below 3.5. Judging by the Nationwide house price
index figures recently released, and not shown in the lower graph, houses
are roughly as affordable as they have been for two decades - a good sign.
But it does not tell the whole story.
Prices on their own do not reflect the true cost to a consumer of buying
their house. Homes are usually bought with the help of a mortgage, on which
interest rates vary. And while house prices have come down from the
unrealistic peaks of 1989, real interest rates (compared with inflation)
have risen. The last housing boom was propelled by interest rates which were
lower than the inflation rate, so mortgage debts were being eroded by
inflation while the value of the asset on which they were secured was rising
steeply. In the 1990s, the opposite has been happening.
The BSA's figures for average initial mortgage repayments as a percentage of
average earnings and income show that 1990 was a truly excessive year. Then,
repayments took up 26.3 per cent of average income. In 1989, this figure was
22.8 per cent. In 1988, it was 17.9 per cent. This ratio began to fall after
the base rate cut in October 1990 which accompanied the decision to join the
European exchange rate mechanism. It dropped to 25 per cent by the beginning
of last year and had reached 19 per cent in the first quarter of '92.
The BSA says this extended measure of affordability is almost exactly equal
to its level in 1980, and a third lower than its peak only two years ago.
But this measure still gives rise to concern because it never reached
similar heights during the domestic property boom of the early 1970s - it
stood at 15 per cent in 1973-74 having stood below 13 per cent from 1969 to
1972. To make houses truly cheap to buy, then, either prices must come down
further or mortgage rates must fall. Thus, the building societies' clamour
for lower base rates begins to look understandable.
So, on a long-term perspective, houses look cheap but debt is expensive. In
the short term, though, prices could well dip below their historic trend,
just as three years ago they surged above it. Do any special features of
supply and demand suggest a change to this trend?
The market for housing is 'sticky,' with supply constricted by several
factors which helped to produce the modest house price inflation of the past
50 years. Most obviously, homes take time to build (usually about 20
months), so supply will not always be able to keep up with a sudden increase
in demand. This opens the prospect of periodic house price inflation
'bubbles.'
Planning restrictions imposed by local authorities help further to constrict
supply. Councils tend to be strictest in overcrowded areas where housing
demand is highest.
Then, as Barry Riley discusses in his column on this page, there are
repossessions. A few years ago, nobody would have regarded them as a
separate source of supply. Things are different now. Lenders repossessed
35,750 homes in the first half of this year, mainly because householders
could not afford to keep up their repayments. Attempts usually are made to
sell them quickly, increasing the downward pressure on prices. The market
also is affected by the need of elderly people to sell their houses to pay
for expensive medical care. In the longer term, this could help to increase
supply and so to depress prices.
The effect of demographic changes on demand is also likely to weaken prices.
After the Second World War and up to 1964, the birth rate grew; then it fell
considerably. People born in 1964 are only 28 this year. So demand from
first-time buyers, who tend to be between 20 and 35, is likely to be
maintained for a few years - but it will drop by the end of this decade.
This often is described over-emotively as a 'time bomb'. But the figures do
suggest that the market cannot pick up at the end of the 1990s in the way it
did at the end of the 1980s.
The post-war growth in owner-occupation suggests a further negative
influence in the long term. The higher the proportion of the population
which already owns a house, then, theoretically, the lower the potential for
growth in demand. Roughly a quarter of Britain's housing stock was
owner-occupied in 1945. This rose to 42.3 per cent in 1960, 50 per cent in
1970 and 55.5 per cent in 1980. It now stands at around 67.5 per cent. The
BSA's research suggests that unmet demand for owner-occupation has remained
fairly static over the past few years, but it is hard to see any scope for
continued significant increases.
So is this the time to buy? The question should not be imbued with a spirit
of speculation. There is no reason to expect a take-off in property prices,
or a return to the Thatcher era illusion of housing as a high-return
investment. But all the fundamentals, with the arguable exception of the
cost of buying houses, do point to the market offering fair value at
present. Homes are no longer overpriced, if past trends are a guide, and
there is little reason to fear a repeat of the horrors which hit those who
bought at the peak in 1987 and 1988.
Thus, the next two years should be a good time to buy - although not a good
time to make a killing. Indeed, those buying now could see the value of
their purchase decline somewhat for a year or two if prices fall under the
trend line.
The fundamentals do not seem to justify any attempted miracle cure along the
lines suggested this week by the building societies. The ultimate cure,
which depends on many external factors, will be lower interest rates.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Long View: Number 29, your time is up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DADDY, WHY do we have to leave home to live at granny's next week? Will I
have to sleep in that tiny room? Where will I put my computer? Well, son,
I'm afraid it's what people call repossession. At least, everybody except
the officials at the Bank of England, who call it possession. I suppose
instead of the repo man they talk about the po man. Anyway, our building
society has the right to take over the house because we've fallen behind
with the mortgage payments. Why can't you sell it and pay them back? It's
because we bought the house in 1988 on a 90 per cent mortgage. Since then
house prices have fallen, by about 25 per cent in these parts. So the house
is now worth less than the loan, especially because we have fallen a few
months behind with the monthly instalments.
But you could pay most of it back, couldn't you? Then perhaps you could pay
the rest later.
Yes, but it isn't as simple as that. You see, when I bought the house the
building society made me pay for an insurance policy called a mortgage
indemnity plan. When the house is sold for less than the money owed the
insurance company will pay the difference. But the policy only pays out when
the house is repossessed by the building society and sold.
But that's good, isn't it, Daddy? If you bought an insurance policy you
won't be made to pay for the losses. It's like when Mummy crashed the car
last year.
I'm afraid you don't know much about the way insurance works, son. Although
we paid the premium, the benefits only go to the building society. Then the
insurance company will make a claim on us for whatever it has paid out,
which could easily be Pounds 20,000. Of course, we don't have any money. So
I have no idea what we will do.
Will it take ages to sell our house? Number twenty-nine was empty for ever
and you could hardly see it for grass and weeds. The Avenue Gang kept going
in there and breaking the windows until they were boarded up. They said they
found twenty pounds under a carpet, and they sold some lead pipe to a man
with a cart. And in the kitchen there was the biggest wasps' nest you ever
saw. Mr Higgins next door kept saying it was a disgrace and a danger to the
public.
I know, that house was repossessed too. It's what I'm afraid of. As soon as
the house is repossessed it will start deteriorating and it will be worth a
lot less than I could sell it for now if the building society would only let
me. So our losses will be greatly increased.
Doesn't that mean that the building societies are making things worse by
taking homes over? Why can't we stay here until this house is sold? They
don't sound very nice. And they don't seem to care if prices go down and
down. They sound really stupid.
Yes, it seems like that to me sometimes. But I suppose they are following
their own rules. You see, they never expected a crisis like this. Until a
few years ago there were hardly any repossessions at all, and only because
the people in those houses had run away or died or something. But now there
are hundreds of thousands of homes at risk up and down the country.
Daddy, you said once that the house would be worth a lot of money and it
would come to me one day. Was that wrong? And you talked about some kind of
housing ladder. What happened to that?
I'm afraid that like a lot of dreams it has all come to nothing. For a long
time it seemed that a house was the best investment anybody in Britain could
possible make. Once you managed your first step on the housing ladder you
could move upwards and make more and more money. House prices would rise
while debts would be more affordable because your income was always rising.
But it has all gone horribly wrong. Debts have become more expensive, but
house prices have gone down. The ladder has lost its rungs.
So when you make your will and die, you won't be able to leave me a house.
Where will I live? Will I still be in the little back bedroom at granny's?
Maybe it won't be so bad for you. Many years ago people thought that buying
houses was a mug's game and they rented their homes instead. Later it became
almost impossible to rent, but there were big profits for those who bought.
I suppose it was my bad luck to come along at a time when the cycle had run
its course and prices had finally stopped rising.
But won't the government do something, Daddy? On the Radio One news they
said the government was being asked to kickstart the housing market. People
would be given incendiaries so they could buy houses.
Well, incentives, actually, although sometimes I think I would be better off
setting off a few incendiaries in this place. Then I really would get the
benefit of the insurance payments.
But seriously, the incentives would have to be extremely expensive if they
were to do any good. I think that your generation will need to have a very
different attitude to owning houses - more like they have in Germany, for
instance. It may be better to rent, at any rate unless you are quite old, or
very wealthy. You won't be able to expect rising house prices to pay off
your mortgage painlessly. You will do better to put your life savings into
other kinds of investments.
So who will own the houses then, Daddy?
I expect the banks and building societies will still have them on their
books, son. Perhaps, if you have a bit of money, you will be able to buy
this house back again really cheaply.
But then you will have to start cutting the grass.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK deficit revised up to Pounds 6.3bn: British net debt in
1990 believed to be first in almost 50 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S current account defi-cit last year was Pounds 1.1bn greater than
previously estimated, according to revised government statistics which also
suggest the UK was a net debtor to the rest of the world in 1990.
New figures showing worse-than-expected invisible trade results prompted the
Central Statistical Office to revise upwards Britain's 1991 current account
deficit to Pounds 6.32bn from the Pounds 5.2bn figure published in June and
an earlier estimate of Pounds 4.4bn.
More surprising was the CSO's disclosure that in 1990 the UK's net assets
abroad were Pounds 407m less than its foreign liabilities. Although the CSO
said valuation problems and omissions meant its figures could not be an
exact measure of the UK's external debtor or creditor position, 1990 was the
first year since records began in 1966 in which the UK recorded a net debt
position.
It probably marked the first time since immediately after the second world
war that Britain had been a debtor nation. The disappearance of overseas
assets reflects a remarkable change since the mid-1980s, when the UK was a
large oil producer and investing its surpluses abroad.
As recently as March 1987, Mr Nigel Lawson, the then chancellor, boasted in
his Budget speech that UK net overseas assets were 'well over Pounds 100bn'
(a claim not supported by the latest data) and 'second only to those of
Japan'. These, he said, would 'provide a continuing support to the current
account in the years ahead'.
Last year, the government's annual balance of payments Pink Book estimated
the UK had net overseas assets of nearly Pounds 29.6bn in 1990, a figure
revised down to Pounds 20bn in the 1992-93 Budget. Yesterday's CSO release
suggested that, by the end of 1991, the UK was back in the black with net
overseas assets of Pounds 16.07bn.
The latest data - released before publication of the Pink Book - also show
previous figures painted too positive a picture. The deficit, which measures
UK trade in goods and invisibles, such as services and dividend payments, is
now put at Pounds 17.03bn in 1990 against Pounds 16.08bn previously.
Ironically, the revisions reflect the government's efforts to improve
official statistics. One effect has been to reduce the contribution
investments and services make. The services surplus for last year is now put
at Pounds 4.99bn against Pounds 5.37bn previously, while the contribution
from interest, profits and dividends was revised to Pounds 328m from Pounds
898m.

FT  08 AUG 92 / NTT share fall pulls down Tokyo market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE ANGUISH of the Japanese government and the ire of individual
shareholders intensified yesterday as stock in the semi-privatised Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone dropped 7.6 per cent to a record low.
This left NTT, Japan's most widely held share, down 13.4 per cent on the
week - even though the issue was opened from last Saturday to ownership by
foreign investors.
Its decline dragged down the market, with a 408.17 fall to 15,518.27 in the
Nikkei average of the country's 225 leading quoted companies, of which NTT
is a crucial component.
Shares in the company have been sliding for more than five years as profit
expectations for the domestic telecommunications utility went unmet. From an
original flotation price of Y1.197m each in early 1987 and an ascent to a
peak Y3.18m that spring, NTT closed yesterday at just Y509,000 (Pounds
2,100), down Y42,000 on the day.
NTT has 1.6m separate shareholders, many of whom have only one share each
because of its high offer price.
Mrs Nobuko Otake, a metropolitan housewife and one of the NTT's army of
shareholders, said: 'The price right now is below half the price I paid. I
can't see it ever getting back to the original price, because a second
release of the shares is on the way.'
The proposed sale is part of the problem for the government, which still
owns two-thirds of NTT and is scheduled to sell a further tranche in the
current fiscal year, which ends in March.
Mr Tsutomo Hata, the finance minister, under pressure to prop up the market,
yesterday stalled investors by saying he would decide on any sale only after
'closely monitoring stock market developments and other conditions for some
more time'.
The government wants to offload only another 3.2 per cent of NTT but the
company's size means that, even if priced at yesterday's trough level, the
sale would raise Y254.5bn.
This, with the planned stock market launch of JR East, the first of the
regional companies created in the breakup of the national Japan Railways,
would help to finance promised measures to stimulate the economy.
A supplementary budget due next month is expected to inject Y5,000bn to
Y8,000bn into Japan's sagging economy. But in the face of dwindling growth
in tax revenues, the government's funding plans are being thwarted.
Mr Shimichi Kawamoto, a Tokyo office worker who bought two shares in the
initial NTT sale, said he had sold one. Government moves to break up the
company - a profitable unit in mobile telecommunications has already been
spun off from the parent - had caused distress, he said.
Shareholder Mrs Otake said she wanted to sell out by next year. 'I thought
this share was different from the others, guaranteed by the government.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Filings for personal bankruptcy soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of individuals filing for personal bankruptcy jumped 80 per cent
to more than 8,000 in the first six months of 1992 compared with the same
period last year.
As the recession continued to bite, the number of companies petitioning to
be wound up rose by 6 per cent to more than 11,000 during the same period,
according to figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department.
While the government reaffirmed its determination to keep a tight grip on
the economy in a speech by Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the
Treasury, the new figures were used by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and
industry secretary, to attack chancellor Mr Norman Lamont.
'How many more personal bankruptcies does the chancellor think is a price
well worth paying?' Mr Cook asked. 'How many companies have to go under
before this government changes direction?'
Mr John McQueen, chief executive of the Bankruptcy Association, which
represents individual bankrupts, said the figures were 'absolutely
disgraceful'.
In a further indication of the effects of the recession, separate figures
released by the Department of Trade and Industry show the number of company
insolvencies - businesses officially deregistered - 8 per cent up over the
same period, and individual bankruptcies approved by the courts up by 49 per
cent.
Mr Steve Hill, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, the accountancy firm, said that much of the increase in filings was
the result of the recession.
However, he stressed that over the past two years it had also become far
easier for people to file for bankruptcy, as the government's insolvency
service had reduced the level of investigation it conducted before approving
petitions.
Debtors' bankruptcy petitions in the English and Welsh courts were 8,225 to
the end of June, compared with 4,564 in the first half of 1991. There was
some evidence, however, that the rate was beginning to slow, with the number
of bankruptcy petitions dropping slightly between the first and second
quarters of this year - from a total of 4,395 to 3,830.
Seasonally adjusted statistics from the DTI, which are published by the
British Chambers of Commerce, showed that 5,816 companies became insolvent
in the second quarter this year, compared with 5,835 in the first.
Ms Fiona Johnson, from the Chambers' policy office, said at best there was a
levelling-off in the insolvency trend. 'There are no grounds for
complacency. We can't say this constitutes a new downward trend. The
increase on last year is very worrying.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Gains reversed by computer
sell programs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A LATE wave of computer sell programs sent US stock markets into reverse
yesterday, wiping out gains earned earlier on the back of a big fall in
long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 8.38 at 3,332.18, fallen more
than 30 points in the last hour of trading. The more broadly-based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 also turned lower in late trading, losing 1.28 to 419.31, while
the Amex composite closed 0.36 higher at 390.13 and the Nasdaq composite
ended down 0.28 at 573.74. Turnover on the New York SE was 189m shares.
The eagerly-awaited July employment figures, released before the market
opened, showed a 198,000 rise in non-farm payrolls and a small decline in
the national unemployment rate to 7.7 per cent.
The payroll number, however, was distorted by a federal summer jobs
programme for teenagers, which added 75,000 to the jobs list. The jobs
situation was further confused by a revision in the June figures, which show
a 63,000 fall in payrolls, and not the estimated 117,000 drop.
The jobs data appeared to have little impact on the market, and share prices
spent the first hour and a half of trading in a 5-point range. Computer buy
programs and a big drop in bond yields then powered the market to a near
30-point gain, until late program selling sent prices into sharp retreat.
Among individual stocks, disappointment at a profits warning from
Hewlett-Packard was the feature of the day. The big computer group warned
late on Thursday that its quarterly earnings would come in below analysts'
expectations. By the time trading opened, the sellers had lined up and amid
heavy trading Hewlett plunged Dollars 12 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 on turnover
of 6.3m shares. Several other computer stocks fell in sympathy. IBM, which
suffered from brokers' downgrades this week, fell another Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 87 1/8 on turnover of 2.2m shares, Digital Equipment eased Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 , and Motorola slipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 84 5/8
. The exception was Compaq, which firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 1/8 .
Among the leading stocks that fuelled the Dow's mid-morning rise and that
held on to their gains were Exxon, up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 63 1/2 ,
Disney, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 35 5/8 , and Procter &amp; Gamble, Dollars
1/4 higher at Dollars 49 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Ben &amp; Jerry's climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 30 1/2
after the ice-cream company posted second quarter profits of 39 cents a
share, up from 23 cents a share a year ago.
Canada
TORONTO share prices posted a slight gain in quiet trading, the composite
index gaining 7.65 points to 3,406.30, as advances led declines by 291 to
192. Volume fell to 19.686m shares from 25.212m, and value was CDollars
242.6m against CDollars 285.8m.
Sub-indices showed little movement, 10 finishing on the upside. Golds,
banking and energy were somewhat higher and industrials, mining and consumer
products were steady.
Placer Dome reported higher earnings for the second quarter and six months,
and the stock was up CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 13.
George Weston, which reported lower second-quarter and six-month earnings,
fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 35.

FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Third day's fall in NTT
shares hits Nikkei
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER drop in Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone (NTT) dampened sentiment,
prompting selling in other leading blue chips, and the Nikkei average closed
sharply lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 408.17 to 15,518.27, down 2.5 per cent on both the day and
the week. It opened at the day's high of 15,882.08 and fell steadily as
dealers unloaded speculative stocks, slipping to a low of 15,451.32 just
before the close.
Activity remained dull, with 180m shares changing hands against 185m.
Declines led advances by 897 to 58, with 88 unchanged, the Topix index of
all first section stocks lost 26.09 points to 1,181.23 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.76 to 959.52.
NTT posted its third consecutive fall, losing Y42,000, or 7.6 per cent to a
new all-time low of Y509,000. Traders said that individual investors who had
bought NTT on margin were liquidating holdings due to margin calls.
Short-selling by investors who expect a further fall in NTT has also driven
the shares lower. Many investors hoped that the government's lifting of the
ban on foreign ownership of NTT shares would prompt foreign buying, but they
have been disappointed by the lack of response. 'The stock is still too
expensive, and the yield is too low to be attractive to foreigners,' said Mr
Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Traders added that speculators, who faced margin calls on positions in
'theme' stocks, were liquidating high-priced NTT shares to generate cash.
Meanwhile, dealers sold off holdings in speculative issues. Meiji Milk
Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y31 to Y765 and Okamoto
Industries, lost Y39 to Y901.
High-technology blue chips were lower on small-lot selling. Hitachi fell Y18
to Y740 and Fujitsu lost Y8 to Y557. Meanwhile, large capital issues lost
ground on institutional selling, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries falling Y21 to
Y504 and Nippon Steel down Y2 at Y264.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 532.43 to 16,947.11, below 17,000 for the
first time since October 1986. Volume rose to 18.6m shares from 17.3m.
Roundup
DECLINES in cautious trading were the general rule of thumb in the Asia
Pacific region yesterday.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index lost 42.9 at one stage on an interim loss at
Hutchison Whampoa, but it finished well off the day's lows on
bargain-hunting in selected blue chips. It closed 14.34 lower on the day,
and 0.5 per cent down on the week, at 5,850.93.
Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 55.50 ahead of next Thursday's
interims. Turnover improved from HKDollars 1.87bn to HKDollars 2.19bn.
AUSTRALIA also closed above its lows, as weekend bargain-hunting left the
All Ordinaries index only 1.9 down at 1,586.7, 1.9 per cent lower on the
week. Golds rose 4.1 to 1,154.3 after bullion held above its resistance
level of USDollars 348 an ounce in Hong Kong.
NEW ZEALAND felt the weight of the share price slump at Fletcher Challenge,
which ended another 14 cents lower at a six year low of NZDollars 2.82. The
NZSE-40 index ended 11.97 lower at 1,543.35.
SEOUL fell back below the 500 mark despite a government announcement of
market-boosting measures which boosted prices. The composite index shed 4.82
to 495.22, down 2.9 per cent on the week, in turnover of Won133.3bn.
TAIWAN fell in cautious trading, as the weighted index closed 39.88 down at
4,082.90, down 0.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was thin at TDollars
19.2bn.
SINGAPORE regained some lost ground after its recent losing streak. The
Straits Times Industrial Index rose 7.76 to 1,424.59 in volume of 40.94m
shares. KUALA LUMPUR's composite fell 1.16 to 597.11, down 0.7 per cent on
the week.
BOMBAY rebounded 61.09 or 2.4 per cent to 2,590.68 on institutional buying.

FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses depressed by
disappointing first-half results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REALITY, or the anticipation of disappointing first-half results pulled
most bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was depressed by the release of further, poor first-half results and
the CAC 40 index closed 1.59 lower at 1,777.27, up 1.3 per cent on the week,
in turnover of FFr1.34bn.
Saint-Gobain dropped FFr28 or 5.1 per cent to FFr520 in response to news
late on Thursday that the glass and building materials group's turnover rose
3.9 per cent in the first half to FFr38.9bn.
Peugeot fell another FFr7 to FFr642 as its poor first-half results earlier
this week prompted analysts to downgrade their full-year forecasts.
Accor dropped FFr19 to FFr619 following the previous day's news that it will
have to compensate minority shareholders in Wagons-Lits as a result of its
takeover of the Belgian company.
Elf fell a further FFr7.30 to FFr326 while Euro Disney lost FFr2.75 to FFr90
on news that it had decided to close one of its top-of-the-line resort
hotels from hotel October to Easter, 1993.
FRANKFURT slowed down, as turnover fell from DM6.1bn to DM3.4bn. After a
fall of 3.19 to 635.66 in the FAZ at midsession, the DAX closed 11.65 lower
at 1,609.50; falls on the week were 0.2, and 0.4 per cent respectively.
Allianz, with a fall of DM30 to DM1,805, took its decline to 18.5 per cent
since the Bundesbank lifted the German discount rate in mid-July. The
intervening period has seen poor results from the insurer and sell notes
from brokers.
Dealers reacted badly to flat results from Veba, the big utility, leaving
the shares DM8.10 lower at DM374.80. However, Mr Michael Crawshaw at County
NatWest said that the provisions which had flattened profits had been
forecast last May and that, without them, profits would have been a little
better than expected, with an underlying gain of 7 per cent.
Bilfinger &amp; Berger led constructions down with a fall of DM21 to DM902. Mr
Michael Geiger, also of County, said that UK holders were nervous about
Bilfinger's 15 per cent stake in the UK contractor, Birse, and the bad news
from the UK construction sector.
BRUSSELS was pulled lower by Petrofina, which announced a
bigger-than-expected 56 per cent drop in first half profit after the close
on Thursday. The Bel-20 Index fell 9.91 to 1,133.28, a fall of 1 per cent on
the week.
Petrofina closed down BFr475 or 4.3 per cent at BFr10,475 in heavy volume of
48,060 shares. Analysts cut their full-year earnings forecasts for the oil
company and warned that it might have to cut its 1992 dividend.
Wagons-Lits returned from suspension with a BFr610 leap to BFr6,710.
MILAN fell back in thin trading ahead of the close of the August trading
account next week. Dealers were disappointed that the prime minister, Mr
Giuliano Amato, had failed to make any concrete commitment to support the
stock market at a meeting with Milan stockbrokers on Thursday. Rumours of a
further cut in interest rates, which put the lira under pressure, also
weighed on equities. The Comit index fell 4.48 to 416.89, up 3.8 per cent on
the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L70.7bn.
STOCKHOLM declined following an unexpected six-month loss from the
ball-bearing group, SKF. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 8.5 to 850.9,
down 1.3 per cent on the week, in thin turnover of SKr190m. SKF fell SKr3.50
to SKr94 after reporting a pre-tax loss of SKr194m after a pre-tax profit of
SKr63m a year earlier.
AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens drop 6.7 per cent on fears of disappointing
half-year results, losing Fl 2.90 to Fl 40.10. The results are due on
Tuesday. The CBS Tendency Index fell 1.0 to 115.9, down 0.5 per cent on the
week.
COPENHAGEN was supported by sharp gains in Den Danske Bank following its
release of better-than-expected six-month results. The shares gained DKr11
to DKr262, lifting the all-share index by 0.32 to 305.40.
ZURICH maintained its relative strength, a fall of 10.0 to 1,819.6 in the
SMI index leaving it still 0.6 per cent higher on the week. Roche advanced
SFr70 to SFr5,080 on UK and US interest, the latter related to its ADR
programme.
ISTANBUL fell 3.4 per cent to a six-week low on heavy selling as the index
dropped 136.72 to 3,932.55, the lowest since 3,840.34 on June 23. The loss
on the week was 7.8 per cent.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed in late dollar intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL RESERVE intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prop up
the dollar yesterday after disappointing employment figures had pushed the
currency down by around two pfennigs against the D-Mark, writes James Blitz.
The Fed bought dollars shortly after the European close as the currency
dipped below DM1.47. The US central bank later bought the currency at
DM1.4725 and DM1.4735 in its second intervention in the market in less than
three weeks. Shortly after the Fed's move, the dollar was trading up at
DM1.4750, having risen about one pfennig in 10 minutes. But by the end of
New York trading it dropped back to DM1.4668 despite further apparent
intervention by the Fed and the Bank of Canada.
The fall in the dollar followed the release of the much-awaited non-farm
payroll figure for July. This showed an increase of 198,000, confirming the
generally sluggish growth of the US economy. It was a disappointing figure
because dealers had been expecting a rise of anything up to 300,000 for
July.
One analyst said that when the summer jobs creation scheme and the fall in
June employment by 63,000 were taken into account, the figures looked a good
deal worse. 'Employment is growing by an average of around 30,000 a month,'
he said. 'That's far too slow for an economy that is supposed to be climbing
out of recession.'
Another London-based analyst said the market had been adversely affected by
overnight comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President. His
suggestion that the concerted central bank intervention to prop up the
dollar on July 20 had been undertaken to counter disorderly market
conditions may have given traders the impression that it was a one-off
event. 'We had disorderly conditions,' said Mr Schlesinger. ' and I am not
aware of any exact target level for dollar-mark.'
Analysts believe that the dollar could test new lows next week, especially
if the retail sales figures for July come in lower than expected.
The D-Mark's stronger performance against the dollar fed through to cross
trading. The pound fell to a DM2.8250 close compared to a previous close of
DM2.8280. At one stage it had dipped to DM2.8232 against the D-Mark, a new
low since sterling joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990.
The Italian lira closed down at L757.2 against the D-Mark, compared to a
previous finish of L756.00. The Bank of Italy's recent cut in its discount
rate may have had an adverse effect on the currency. The Bank's repurchase
agreements in the lira money market were at a rate of 14.20 per cent
yesterday, compared to a recent peak of 17.56 per cent.

FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Kerkorian expresses concern over
Iacocca's leadership at Chrysler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIRK Kerkorian, the septuagenarian US investor, is finally rattling his
sabre at Chrysler by indicating that he is no longer content to remain a
passive investor.
This move comes nearly two years after Mr Kerkorian baffled Wall Street by
paying Dollars 270m for a 9.8 per cent stake in the third biggest US car
maker.
In a letter attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Mr Kerkorian said recent events 'have made me concerned about Mr
Iacocca's continued leadership role in the company and led me to question
whether the interests of the shareholders now require strengthened
representation on the board of directors. I have reluctantly concluded they
do'.
Mr Lee Iacocca, the company's high-profile chairman, recently announced his
intention to step down at the end of this year. Mr Kerkorian said he had
made his investment after being assured that Mr Iacocca would remain as
chairman through 1994.
Mr Kerkorian has called for a prompt meeting between his representatives and
a group of board members to 'resolve these important issues'.
Mr Iacocca yesterday said a meeting between Mr Kerkorian's representatives
and Chryler would be held shortly, but he added that his plans to step down
at the end of the year were unchanged.
'I have complete confidence in the management team at Chrysler, and Mr
Kerkorian told me that he shares that confidence,' he said. When Mr
Kerkorian made his unsolicited investment in December 1990, Chrysler
fortified its 'poison pill' anti-takeover defences by reducing the
proportion of Chrysler shares one party has to buy to trigger its poison
pill to 10 per cent from 20 per cent. Shareholders, other than the 10 per
cent holder, also have the right to buy Chrysler stock at half price.
Mr Kerkorian's options at Chrysler are limited. The poison pill prevents him
from launching a bid, but he could press for some form of board
representation and he could also embark on a proxy fight.
Certainly, Chrysler's financial picture has improved substantially since Mr
Kerkorian made his investment. The company recently reported surprisingly

SWISS VOLKSBANK, Switzerland's fourth largest bank, has reported an 8 per
cent slide in its pre-tax profits to SFr172m (Dollars 130.3m) in the first
half.
The bank shied away from a forecast for the full year, observing that its
first-half result had been 'positively influenced partly by volatile
earnings factors'.
'Our overall result will be decisively influenced by the future development
of interest rates as well as by our provisioning requirements,' Volksbank
said.
Gross revenue fell 2.7 per cent to SFr581m because of an 11 per cent slump
in interest income to SFr323m. Commission business was up 10 per cent to
SFr121m and trading gained 8.3 per cent to SFr117m.
The bank has announced a programme involving eliminating 500 jobs by the end
of 1993.
Holvis Holzstoff, the Swiss distribution and nonwoven fabrics group, said
sales advanced 5.5 per cent in the first half to SFr428.3m. It forecast
turnover growth of about 8 per cent for the full year and expected the
profit margin to be equal to or slightly better than that achieved last
year.

CREDITOR banks were yesterday divided in their response to debt repayment
proposals made this week by Prima Inmobiliaria, one of the Kuwait Investment
Office's troubled Spanish holdings, Reuter reports from Madrid.
Two of the company's largest creditors, Banco Central Hispano and the
state-owned Argentaria group, have declined to give written acceptance of
the proposals and will hold further negotiations next week. Other creditors,
among the 60 banks attending a meeting called by Prima, have accepted the
deal which involves delaying principal payments for two months until a more
comprehensive debt restructuring plan can be worked out.
The KIO has undertaken to provide Pta3.5bn (Dollars 37.2m) to service
interest during the period on the loans, the bulk of which are covered by
mortgage guarantees.

<TEXT>
CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier which is trying to emerge from Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection, yesterday confirmed it had received an investment
proposal from Houston Air, a new company owned by Mr Alfredo Brener of
Houston.
Continental said Houston Air would invest Dollars 385m in cash in exchange
for Dollars 325m in notes and Dollars 60m of equity secu rities.
Continental, the fifth biggest airline in the US, has been seeking an
outside investor in order to emerge from Chapter 11 which it filed for in
Decem ber 1990.
The bid follows an offer of Dollars 350m last month by Maxxam, conglomerate
led by Mr Charles Hurwitz, a Houston financier. His group signed a
preliminary agreement with Continental to buy 72 per cent of the airline.
A bankruptcy court judge in Delaware approved the deal but gave other
interested par ties 10 days to make bids. That period ended on August 2.
Continental said yesterday the Houston proposal meets the minimum
requirements under its overbid agreement with Maxxam. But the carrier said
it remains committed under its agreement with Maxair and added it will
continue to work towards reorganising under the terms of the Maxair
agreement unless it receives a firm commitment deemed higher and better than
the Maxair offer.
Air Canada, led by Mr Hollis Harris, the former Continental chief executive
officer has expressed interested but the Montreal-based carrier has not yet
made an offer.
Mr Brener's family is the largest independent share holder in Mexico
City-based Mexicana Airlines, once the largest carrier in Mexico that has
fallen behind rival Aero mexico in market share.
Maxxam has indicated it does not currently plan to increase its offer price
of Dollars 350m, since the Houston offer is neither firm nor binding.

A CLASS action lawsuit was filed against British Petroleum and its directors
in a New York federal court yesterday by US shareholders upset at the
company's decision to halve its second quarter dividend.
It charges that BP directors failed to state, or misrepresented, material
facts concerning the company's financial performance.
The suit cites a BP news release of June 25 that said BP's policy of
dividend payments to holders of the company's American Depositary Receipts
would remain unaltered, and that management changes would not result in any
'significant' changes.
Lawsuits of this sort are extremely common in the US.
BP, from its US headquarters in Cleveland, said it could not comment on the
lawsuit because it did not have any details. 'We have not had a chance to
read the lawsuit.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Little prospect of an early recovery in
Vienna - A strong economy cannot offset high interest rates and a poor
corporate performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCUSSION about the Austrian stock market these days tends to resemble that
about the British economy - few commentators can see any recovery taking
form in the near future.
Worse, as the ATX index of 18 leading shares plumbed new depths this week,
analysts were groping for ways to understand and explain what is happening.
'The market seems heavily oversold, but we have no support levels any more,'
says Mr Lukas Stipkovich, an analyst at GiroCredit Bank in Vienna.
The feeling is that only a showy, positive event - a drop in German interest
rates, a clear end to the war in the former Yugoslavia or a resolution of
the uncertainties over the Austrian government's messy privatisation
programme - would be enough to overcome the strong negative sentiment. But
few see such a watershed event coming soon.
'I do not think the market is going to collapse another 10 per cent, but it
is not going to go up in the near future either,' says Mr Andrew Thomson, an
analyst with Kleinwort Benson in London.
For those familiar with the Austrian economy, all this is more than a little
surprising. The economy has grownrapidly in recent years and remains one of
the best performers among the industrialised countries, with real growth of
between 2 and 3 per cent expected this year. The problem, analysts say, is
that the two most dynamic sectors, retailing and tourism, are scarcely
represented in the stock market, whereas banking and cyclical industries
dominate.
After a dizzying rise in 1989, the all-share index peaked in March, 1990 at
739.21. Since then, it has been all downhill, more or less, and by this week
it had shed more than 50 per cent of its value. The index ended at 354.14
yesterday, as the introduction of ATX stock index futures and options
trading unsettled the market.
No doubt a significant portion of the fall should be considered a correction
from excessive valuations at its peak. The average share was trading then at
more than 30 times prospective earnings. Now the average price-earnings
ratio is about 17. 'That is very close to the level in Germany and much
cheaper than in the US and in several other European markets,' Mr Stipkovich
says.
Since last summer, the war in the former Yugoslavia has driven away many
foreign investors who, apparently, fear that it will spill over into
Austria. Mr Joseph Oswald, head of research at Creditanstalt, says that he
was startled recently to find this view still prevalent among some German
investors. 'If Germans think like this, what must other foreigners think?,'
he asks. He estimates that foreigners now account for only a fifth of
trading volume compared with about 50 per cent in 1989 and 1990.
The downward trend stopped briefly in the first quarter of this year, but
then resumed in the spring when it became apparent that many leading
Austrian companies' profits would be affected adversely by the recessionary
economic conditions in other countries. Mr Stipkovich says that earnings of
quoted companies are likely to decline by 4 to 5 per cent this year on
average.
Some first-half results have indeed been disappointing. Z-Landerbank Bank
Austria, the largest, reported a 15.7 per cent slump in partial operating
profits to Sch867m (Dollars 83.4m) while those at Creditanstalt were off 9.5
per cent to Sch845m. Austrian Airlines' loss more than doubled and the group
is likely to cut its dividend.
OMV, the state-controlled oil group whose shares are one of the most
actively traded on the bourse, lost Sch500m in the first half and saw its
chairman resign. As if these developments were not shocking enough, the
shares dropped significantly in heavy trading in the days before the
announcement, prompting investigations of insider dealing.
OMV is also involved in the government's privatisation plans. Its troubled
parent, Austrian Industries, has proposed selling a large block of its OMV
holding to raise capital, but the prospect of such a sale in the current
anaemic market raises fears of further downward pressure on share prices in
general.
The latest blow to confidence has been the rise in German interest rates and
the warning by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank chairman, that no
easing of rates should be expected this year.
With the deterioration of sentiment has come a collapse in trading volume,
which now runs at only Sch150m a day compared with Sch1bn two years ago. 'In
these conditions, there is a severe reaction to even small sell orders. So
no one is willing to build up positions,' Mr Oswald says. 'Austrians still
have to learn that stocks rise again after falling,' he adds.
Slightly more optimistic opinions exist, depending on the timing of German
recovery or an end to bad domestic news. But for the moment, no one sees any
urgency to start buying Austrian shares. 'I do not think you are going to
miss anything. The risk of losing 10 per cent is greater than that of
gaining 5 per cent,' says Mr Stipkovich.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Aegis refinances as profits fall to Pounds
13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the European media buyer which last month saw the sudden departure of
Mr Peter Scott, chairman, yesterday announced a refinancing which will
further increase the control of the company's two main shareholders, Mr
Gilbert Gross and Warburg, Pincus, the US investment bank.
Aegis is rescheduling outstanding payments due on the purchase of Carat
Espace, the French media buyer which it bought from Mr Gross and its
management. This will allow an extension of Aegis' banking facilities,
provided by Samuel Montagu.
Aegis will then launch a rights issue of convertible unsecured loan stock to
raise Pounds 19.75m, net of expenses. The issue is fully underwritten by
Warburg, Pincus, which holds 14.8 per cent of Aegis.
Aegis has also been told by the Takeover Panel that following its decision
to shift headquarters to Paris, the official reason given for Mr Scott's
departure, it will not fall under the takeover code since it will no longer
be considered resident in the UK.
Under the debt rescheduling, SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gross, will
receive Pounds 18.75m in new shares and Pounds 25m in cash. The new
structure differs from the original payment plan by accelerating the share
element but reducing the cash portion. As a result SFEC's holding will
increase from 26.8 per cent to 42.4 per cent. The transaction received a
waiver from the Panel because the shares are a form of payment.
SFEC will transfer its rights to the convertible loan stock to Warburg,
Pincus. As a result, and assuming the rest of the rights are taken up,
Warburg Pincus' voting rights will increase from 14.8 per cent to 16.4 per
cent, while SFEC will hold 33.8 per cent of the voting rights.
Under the rights, Aegis is issuing 22.5m units at Pounds 1. Each unit
includes a deferred share of 1p and a 9.875 per cent convertible unsecured
loan stock, redeemable in 2002 and with a conversion price of 55p.
The company's shares, which more than halved in value following Mr Scott's
resignation, fell a further 7p to 39p.
Aegis also announced a slump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds
13.5m in the six months to June 31. Turnover increased 42 per cent to Pounds
1.39bn due to acquisitions and new business.
Operating margins were affected by competition and the move to Paris
incurred exceptional costs of nearly Pounds 14m.
Losses per share were 2.1p, against earnings of 13.97p or 11.77p fully
diluted. The interim dividend is cut to 1.375p (2.75p).
Mr Charles Hochman will replace Mr Scott as chief executive in September. Mr
Frank Law, the deputy chairman, has been appointed non-executive chairman
from the same date.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Major's crisis of confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market's Duke of York march in the past 10 days, which
began with a sharp rally, and then wearily jolted back to its starting
point, has a wider message. In a period when the chairman of Barclays Bank
warned of at least another year of recession, in which the voters showed
their first poll majority for Labour, and in which the Washington Post wrote
what amounted to an obituary of the whole of British society, nobody any
longer expects good news in the foreseeable future. This mood is itself a
crisis: confidence will not recover until the economy shows some sign of
bounce, but the economy will find it hard to progress as long as the mood
persists.
The Washington Post views Britain as a society in terminal decline,
throttled by its own class system which is hardly novel; but there is no
need for such a fatalistic diagnosis. The present crisis has clear and
immediate causes in the economic and financial cycle, in the operation of
the ERM, and in British politics. These are intractable problems, but not as
intractable as the British class system. The government might take a first
step towards restoring confidence in its judgment, if not in its policies,
by admitting the facts, as Sir John Quinton did, rather than inviting satire
by proclaiming yet again that recovery is just round the corner. It isn't.
Sir John did not denounce the government, and indeed supported its present
policies; his warning amounted to a well-merited mea culpa. The wave of
bankruptcies which is making most employees feel unsafe in their jobs, and
the high borrowing costs of which industry complains so loudly, are almost
entirely the result of reckless lending in the 1980s. In this respect
Barclays is simply the first among British banking equals, and all of them
could point to far worse examples in the US, where whole regions have lost
all their independent banks, in Australia, and above all in Japan.
Mass hysteria
Financial crises of this kind, the result of a kind of mass hysteria, are
hard to explain, for the warnings - in London in 1973-74, in third world
lending in the later 1970s, in Texas in the early 1980s and in New England
at the end of the decade - were loud and insistent. This is supposed to be
the information age; but as James Grant, the New York credit analyst, has
remarked, the banks do not seem to have joined in. They lent regardlessly to
over-extended companies, on the supposed security of unsustainable
collateral values, and we have yet to get the measure of their losses.
This is one reason why a downturn of this kind is so obstinate, and so
unlike the normal cyclical economic models which have misled the British
Treasury. Banks, once they have woken up to their own past follies, do not
immediately make provision for all their doubtful claims; they cannot afford
to. Instead, they try to recoup their ravaged capital through higher charges
and wider margins - the main reason why borrowing costs remain high.
As fast as their balance sheet will bear, they allow the truth to emerge;
but this is only the visible tip of the iceberg which will keep the economy
chilled until the whole mass has melted. Other terminal risks are kept,
sometimes for years, on financial life support to avoid fatally embarrassing
write-downs (which explains why the normal sign of a recovery is a sudden
climax in bankruptcies). Meanwhile lending costs remain high, and lending
confidence low; and no analyst has yet been able to put a term on the
'meanwhile'. Further, as long as depressed conditions drive down profits and
prices, the stock market will find it hard to rally, and even those
consumers who feel safe in their jobs will have good reason to defer
purchases. Reducing inflation is not all joy.
Unusually mild
Compared with these deep-seated problems, the difficulties of holding
sterling within the ERM are a temporary embarrassment. The slowdown in
Germany, which inspired an unusually mild briefing from the Bundesbank
president last week, offers some hope of relief. But the hesitant recovery
in the US, which provoked the usual complaints from an embattled President
Bush yesterday, shows how long it takes even low interest rates and a
super-competitive exchange rate to overcome financial gloom.
Meanwhile, confidence is largely in the hands of the politicians; and it is
here that Mr Major is failing at present. He does a little good by stealth -
for example, by trimming rates on National Savings to take the pressure off
building societies, a sensible step despite the usual grumbles from foreign
exchange dealers. An open season on motorway stops may provoke some
activity. But he risks looking helpless, whether in the face of recession or
of Bosnian atrocities, and calling it a virtue.
He could try harder: through the British presidency of the EC, urging more
action to address a deepening international recession; at home, through even
a modest programme of public investment, financed perhaps through public
sector pay restraint. The economic impact would be small, but the
psychological effect could be large.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance minister attacks critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government went on the offensive over the economy yesterday. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, attacked those in favour of
devaluation who 'hanker after a quick fix', and contrasted them with
supporters of sound money, low inflation and sustainable growth rates.
A speech by Mr Dorrell suggested that criticism of the government voiced by
businessmen this week has rattled ministers.
Last month Treasury officials indicated that comments from Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, insisting there would be no change in strategy, were the
government's last word on the economy.
The wide distribution of Mr Dorrell's speech to his Loughborough
constituency signals that the government now believes more must be done to
counter the growing lobby for devaluation or sterling's removal from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Making the case that low inflation would generate confidence, Mr Dorrell
said that sound money helped savers, allowed businesses to plan ahead and
meant release from 'stop, go, boom and bust'. He added: 'The alternatives .
. . such as devaluation or leaving the ERM, would wreck that framework and
undermine confidence in the future of the British economy.'
He argued that countries that had devalued found confidence in their
anti-inflation policy collapsed. 'The end result . . . is higher inflation
or higher interest rates or both,' Mr Dorrell said, adding that even outside
the ERM the UK could not escape its influence.
He said that since joining the ERM in 1990, a family on average earnings
with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage had seen real disposable income rise 18.5 per
cent or Pounds 35 a week.

FT  08 AUG 92 / 'New age' claims face benefit curb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to clamp down on unemployed income support claimants who
do not actively look for work, in a move intended to curb abuse by so-called
'new age' travellers.
Mr Nicholas Scott, social security minister, said yesterday that he intended
to stop lower-rate 'hardship' payments of income support to most single
people and childless couples unless they were actively looking for work.
Many of those who flouted the rules were 'quite happy' to rely on the
hardship payments and showed 'no interest' in advice on how they could find
work.
Labour accused the government of using the 'new age' issue as a cover for a
change that would apply to all claimants.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said the change would
'leave those affected with no income whatsoever'. He added: 'It cannot be
right to withdraw benefit without warning and leave people with no income at
all.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Tackling blight in the garden of England: Depressed east
Kent is perceived as part of the prosperous south-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE abandoned colliery buildings, unoccupied factories and dole queues could
be anywhere in the industrial north or the Midlands during the last
recession, a decade ago. But this is east Kent and it is 1992.
A drive around the Isle of Sheppey, the stranded pit villages and the
down-at-heel resort towns of the north Kent coast can be depressing on the
sunniest of days. Unemployment is running at more than 16 per cent on
Sheppey and more than 13 per cent in Thanet, compared with an average of 9.2
per cent in south-east England - and it shows.
There is a record number of house repossessions as people who moved out of
London to cheaper accommodation find themselves without jobs and in trouble
keeping up mortgage payments. Virtually every car in the industrial parts of
Sheppey lacks the prefix-letter registration introduced more than nine years
ago.
It is difficult to believe that the area is only 70 miles or so from London
and, in theory, part of the affluent south-east.
East Kent, although beautiful and well-heeled in parts, has many of the
troubles of the industrial north - but because of its position it is not
placed in the same category. It is seen as part of prosperous Kent, and that
perception is hard to shift.
That might be about to change, with the start of fierce lobbying by councils
and businesses for assisted-area status. That would provide investment funds
to help stem the unemployment that is set to get worse. A decision is
expected by the end of the year.
In addition to long-term unemployment caused by the contraction or demise of
traditional industries such as engineering, papermaking and coal mining, the
area faces structural change from the opening of the Channel tunnel and the
introduction of the single European market. A study last year on the impact
of the tunnel on jobs forecast a net gain for Kent, but argued that the jobs
were likely to occur mainly outside east Kent, and later than the big job
losses expected over the next few years.
Among the first jobs to go will be 500 Customs &amp; Excise officers and 600
Customs agents, mainly in Dover, Folkestone and Sheerness.
The economic handicaps are spread across east Kent, and not just the area
adjacent to Dover, Folkestone and the tunnel. North of the corridor of
prosperity the tunnel might bring lies the district of Swale - which
includes Sheppey and Sittingbourne - and Thanet, with endemic employment, as
well as the faded glories of Margate, Herne Bay, Whitstable and Broadstairs.
Many small hotels and boarding houses are now occupied by social security
clients rather than holidaymakers.
Among the few pockets of affluence are Canterbury, with its strengths in
tourism and as a regional shopping centre, and Ashford, which still expects
the Channel tunnel international rail passenger station to become a magnet
for jobs.
The six local authorities have joined Kent County Council, four government
departments, and 12 private-sector representatives to fight for more help
and recognition. They have launched East Kent Initiative under the
chairmanship of Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel.
Mr Martin Hemingway, seconded from Eurotunnel to be the initiative's general
manager, says: 'We have got to get more inward investment, but this is very
difficult with the present infrastructure problems. That is where we really
need help.'
A lot is already being done to improve roads, particularly the M20 from
London to Folkestone and the tunnel terminus. However, a big blow to the
area's hopes came this week when the government rejected a Pounds 500m
development plan for Sheppey, including a new road and tunnel.
Sheppey is the worst blackspot of all, with regeneration hampered by the
bottleneck of a narrow access road and a lifting bridge over the River
Swale.
For an average of five minutes an hour the bridge closes to let boats
through, leading to hold-ups for the 22,000 vehicles a day that cross it and
difficulties for Olau Line, which runs a ferry service from Sheerness to the
Netherlands.
The development plan, which also proposed substantial expansion at
Sheerness, the fifth-largest freight port in the country, and the
construction of factories and more upmarket houses, was turned down largely
on environmental and conservation grounds. The decision left many local
people depressed and frustrated.
Mr Bill Croydon, chief executive of Swale District Council, says the
authority felt that the benefits of the plan far outweighed the penalties,
and were vital for the prosperity of the island. 'This shows there can be a
penalty from putting green issues at the top of the agenda, and the
government must help to deal with the problems this policy creates.'
The rail network, however, is a much bigger handicap than the roads. The
Kent coast service is one of the most notorious in the country, with old
rolling stock and poor timekeeping. Prospective investors are usually asked
to travel by road to prevent them getting too negative an impression. It
takes an hour and 50 minutes from London to Ramsgate, compared with well
under half that time for the same distance from Peterborough.
With better infrastructure, improvements could be rapid. Two potential
development sites are the White Cliffs Business Park at Dover and Kent
International Business Park at Manston.
Just one company, Cohline, a German motor components manufacturer, has moved
in at Manston. It is surrounded by hay and cabbages rather than other
factories, but the operation has been so successful that expansion is
planned.
For much more to happen, Mr Hemingway says, government help is essential.
'Money is available . . . either for inner cities or for underpopulated
rural areas,' he says. 'But there is nothing in be-tween . . . that's our
problem.'

<TEXT>
THE TRIAL of Mr Thomas Ward, the US lawyer and former non-executive director
of Guinness, has been delayed until January 11 next year.
The trial was due to start at the Old Bailey in London in October. However,
Mr Justice Turner, the judge, agreed to allow Mr Ward more time to prepare
his defence. Mr Ward faces charges of theft of Pounds 5.2m and false
accounting in connection with the Pounds 2.7bn Guinness bid for Distillers.
The trial will mark the end of prosecutions in the Guinness affair. However,
Lord Spens, a former corporate finance director at Henry Ansbacher, the
merchant bank, has been granted a judicial review, set for November, of the
decision at the second Guinness trial not to acquit him nor to award him
costs.
That followed the Serious Fraud Office's decision not to proceed against
Lord Spens after the collapse of the trial due to the mental strain placed
upon his co-defendant, Mr Roger Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate
financier.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Three jailed for pension funds fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE MEN were jailed for between two and four years yesterday for
conspiring to defraud pension funds of the engineering company Aveling
Barford of Pounds 6.7m.
Aveling Barford, of Grantham, Lincolnshire, went into liquidation in 1988.
Its assets were subsequently acquired by Mr Duncan Wordsworth, who is
chairman and managing director of the company which now trades as Aveling
Barford (Machines).
Sentencing the men at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Clive Tayler QC said
their extremely serious offences had been committed with a cynical disregard
for the interests of the funds' trustees and beneficiaries.
The case demonstrated a degree of commercial amorality deserving the utmost
condemnation, the judge said. He added that he hoped steps had been, or
would be, taken to give greater protection to pension funds.
The judge said he took into account the fact that two men who had played
leading roles in the fraud - Dr Lee Kin Tat, a Singapore businessman, and Mr
Adrian Eschallier, a US lawyer - had not been brought to trial, and that in
the end the pension funds had not lost any money.
Also there had been evidence suggesting that there might have been a surplus
in the funds from which the convicted men might have believed Aveling
Barford was entitled to benefit.
Sentencing Mr Robin Chapman, who was Aveling Barford's solicitor, to a total
of four years on two conspiracy charges, the judge said he had orchestrated
the fraud and received payments of more than Pounds 90,000.
Mr Graham Severn, a former director of Mildminster, a financial adviser, who
had been 'an essential participant in the conspiracy', was sentenced to
three years for conspiracy and the theft of Pounds 424,525.
Mr David Carter, a trustee director convicted on one conspiracy charge, was
jailed for two years. The judge said he had been a trusted adviser on whom
the honest trustees had relied.
The outcome of the 4 1/2 -month trial will be a welcome boost to the morale
of the Serious Fraud Office, which has recently been strongly criticised,
notably for its handling of the Blue Arrow prosecutions.
The central allegation was that Pounds 6.7m had been taken from the pension
funds and was used as capital for the company and to pay commissions.
Aveling Barford, formerly a subsidiary of British Leyland, was sold in 1983
to a company controlled by Dr Lee and Mr Eschallier.
In 1986 it was lent Pounds 1m by the pension funds by means of a fraud on
the honest trustees.
In 1987-88 a further Pounds 5.7m was removed and reinvested through
Mildminster in a Royal Heritage Life Assurance pension portfolio.
After the fraud came to light, Royal Heritage repaid the Pounds 5.7m.
The SFO alleged that the purpose of the reinvestment had been to create
large commissions to be invested and used as security for bank loans to
Aveling Barford.
The fraud was uncovered in late 1988 when Standard Chartered, Aveling
Barford's bank, put in administrative receivers. It also emerged that the
company had had considerable liquidity shortfalls between 1983 and 1988 and
was owed very large sums by Aveling Barford (World Trade), an international
holding company set up by Dr Lee and Mr Eschallier.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Premier League agonises over its leading player
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Premier League, the new division for the top 22 English football clubs,
is poised to kick off its first season without signing one of its biggest
players - its commercial sponsor.
A meeting of the clubs this week failed to agree on a proposed Pounds 9m
sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewer, or a similar one from Ford, the
motor manufacturer.
Some clubs are thought to have opposed the Bass offer because of fears that
it might jeopardise their own deals with other brewers. Ford's offer might
have caused difficulties for Coventry City, which is sponsored by Peugeot.
Some are also concerned that their financial independence may be at risk if
the league controls marketing.
The main bar to a deal appears to be the unwillingness of some clubs to
surrender control over advertising hoardings at their grounds. Some clubs
apparently believe they can sell advertising space in their own grounds at a
higher rate than the league.
Last year, the clubs in the English First Division - the Premier League's
predecessor - received about Pounds 11m from league television deals and
sponsorship. In the Premier League this season they expect to get some
Pounds 45m.
The wrangle over sponsorship is the latest disagreement to mar the launch of
the division, designed to concentrate England's richest and most talented
clubs in a 'super league'. But its membership is little different from that
of the old First Division; promises of new investment have been slow to
emerge; and, under the terms of a deal with the BBC and BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster, live football from the league will be available only to those
with satellite TV. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake in BSkyB.
Mr Rick Parry, league chief executive, said the situation was 'very
disappointing'. The sponsorship offers showed that 'even in these tough
times there are companies which have faith in football'.
That faith may evaporate if clubs cannot begin to play the sponsorship game
 -sacrificing individual interests for the sake of profits for all.

EXECUTIVES at Portman, the country's 15th-largest building society, were
yesterday trying to discover how a 60-ft computer print-out of its mortgage
customers was found by the roadside in Bournemouth, Dorset, after it had
been sent for shredding.
Portman said yesterday: 'We have been unable to find anything amiss with our
confidential waste disposal unit and its procedures.'
It wanted to know how the list, which contained names, addresses, and
account details of more than 1,000 of its 80,000 mortgage customers, had
come into the possession of a local newspaper and why the document had not
been returned directly to it.
Portman said the list was a computer report which had been produced
unnecessarily and should have been destroyed immediately.
The Data Protection Registrar is investigating to see if guidelines laid
down to protect computer information were followed.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Strikes halt seven BA flights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN British Airways flights to European destinations were cancelled
yesterday after cabin-crew members of the TGWU general union held lightning
strikes at Manchester and Birmingham airports.
BA said all passengers affected by the two-hour early-morning stoppages were
accommodated on other services. There had been some delays.
The TGWU regretted any inconvenience to passengers and said the action
followed the breakdown late on Wednesday night of talks over new pay and
conditions. BA denied that the talks had broken down and said they had been
adjourned indefinitely.
The dispute arose over BA's attempt to improve the profitability of its
European and domestic services by reorganising them in a subsidiary company,
BA Regional.
The reorganisation meant new terms and conditions for staff, including 1,000
cabin crew who face pay cuts of about Pounds 2,000 a year on salaries of
Pounds 14,000. BA said union leaders agreed to the move and that cabin crews
then rejected it. The TGWU said it only agreed to the principle of a new
company.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Building society cuts rate on savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, the UK's second-largest building society, has announced cuts to
its savings rates after the reduction in National Savings returns announced
earlier this week.
The society is cutting gross rates by about 0.4 of a percentage point, with
effect from August 15. Net rates on its CashBuilder account, for example,
range from 3.38 per cent on Pounds 1-Pounds 499 to 6.6 per cent on Pounds
25,000 plus.
Building societies have complained about the competition offered by National
Savings. They have argued that, if their margins are squeezed on the savings
side, they may have to compensate by increasing the mortgage rate, thereby
exacerbating troubles in the housing market. The societies have therefore
welcomed the recent cuts in National Savings rates.
The new rates from Nationwide are generally below the 7.5 per cent net
available on two of the main National Savings products.
However, Mr John Hutchinson, Nationwide's corporate strategy director, said:
'We believe that our new savings rates will be both competitive and
realistic.'
He warned that if competition forced Nationwide to increase its rates again,
the society would be forced to raise mortgage rates in tandem.
Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said yesterday that he had asked each
of the 11 English urban development corporations to sell land for
inexpensive housing.
'Many house builders have spurned the opportunity of building in the inner
cities,' he said. 'They thought they knew better, paying extravagant prices
for 'greenfield' sites beyond the suburbs in the late 1980s . . . Many home
builders have gone bust or are now in dire financial straits for trusting to
conventional wisdom.'

OVERCAPACITY IN the summer travel market will restrict holiday company
profits, but bookings for winter holidays are 12 per cent ahead of the level
at this time last year, a report by Lunn Poly, the travel agent, said
yesterday.
It said companies had overestimated summer demand, leading to discounting
and a probable fall in profits.
It said more than 7m people would take an overseas package holiday this
summer - up 15 per cent from last year and up 6 per cent from 1990.
Lunn Poly said industry sales for the 1992-93 winter season were 12 per cent
ahead of last year. Last winter matched the record winter of 1988-89 with
almost 1.9m taking a winter break.
Tenerife and Florida were the most popular 1992-93 winter destinations.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Mortgage lenders defend checks on solicitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORTGAGE LENDERS yesterday defended the imposition of new controls on
solicitors that are intended to try to stem the rise in mortgage fraud.
The controls are part of a concerted move supported by the Council of
Mortgage Lenders - but they have produced a storm of complaints to the Law
Society, the solicitors' governing body. Solicitors are particularly angry
about terms announced by Abbey National this week.
From September, solicitors and licensed conveyancers handling Abbey National
mortgage work will have to agree to give the bank the right to inspect case
files and monitor the way work is carried out. If they do not agree to the
terms they will be struck off its panel of approved conveyancers.
Mr Andrew Lockley, head of the Law Society's legal practice directorate,
said solicitors were concerned about client confidentiality and a condition
requiring them to guarantee identities of mortgage borrowers.
Abbey National said yesterday that it had had a favourable response to its
letter, sent to 16,000 solicitors. 'Mortgage fraud is not a massive problem,
but there has been a spate of cases recently,' it said. 'What we are seeking
from solicitors is really only a safety net which formalises existing
arrangements.'
Woolwich, the third-largest building society, announced plans yesterday to
follow Abbey National by writing to solicitors on its panel telling them
they must be prepared to hand over some details about customers. Nationwide,
the second-largest society, has not yet decided on which course to follow.
Mr Lockley said the Law Society was concerned about a letter sent this week
by Mr Christopher Jowett, group solicitor for Halifax, the largest society.
It warned members of its conveyancing panel that if the profession caps
compensation payments to financial institutions for fraud by rogue
solicitors, Halifax may impose a levy and more rigorous criteria for
membership of its conveyancing panel. The profession is considering capping
the compensation payments as part of proposals to meet a big increase in
fraud claims. Solicitors already face a special levy of Pounds 1,000 each
this autumn to top up the Law Society's compensation fund by Pounds 30m.
Halifax denied that it was attempting to put pressure on solicitors not to
cap the compensation fund. It said solicitors stole more than Pounds 1m from
the society last year; if the level of compensation fund protection was
limited, the society would have to take other steps to protect itself and
limit its losses.
The exact level of mortgage fraud in England and Wales is not known. Last
year a study by Liverpool University said police forces were investigating
more than 1,000 cases involving Pounds 500m. The Metropolitan Police has
estimated the present level of mortgage fraud at more than Pounds 1bn. Last
year, Mr Michael Learmonth, a solicitor from Mill Hill, north London, was
convicted of defrauding 19 building societies and banks out of Pounds 3.79m.

<TEXT>
FORD, the UK new-car market leader, is raising the prices of its cars and
commercial vehicles by 1.8 per cent with effect from August 17.
In spite of the continuing weakness of new-car sales, Ford is following its
traditional ploy of raising prices in mid August to stimulate orders during
the first half of the month. It said the increases would not affect
remaining stocks of cars not fitted with catalytic converters, which become
mandatory from the end of the year.
Ford last raised prices in January, by an average of 3.7 per cent across the
range. It was forced to cut prices of some models in March in an attempt to
stimulate sales.
In the first seven months of the year, its registrations have fallen 11.7
per cent, compared with an overall fall in new-car sales of 4.3 per cent.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Lloyd's joins battle on its vital statistics: Richard Lapper
reports on how Chatset faces competition for the first time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Lloyd's of London to publish annual syndicate statistics for
the first time in its 306-year history has caused some consternation.
The decision, announced on Thursday, brings the insurance market into direct
competition with Chatset, a small specialist publishing company. Its
compendium of statistics, Lloyd's League Tables, had been regarded as the
most comprehensive available for the 22,000 Names, the individuals who
provide the market's capital.
Mr Charles Sturge and Mr John Rew, Chatset's founders and editors, have
become increasingly outspoken critics of the Lloyd's establishment and their
supporters suggest that the move is deliberately designed to spike their
guns.
Mr Sturge says the new Lloyd's venture is designed to 'stuff' Chatset, which
derives most of its revenues from sales of about 2,000 copies of League
Tables each year.
Since its publication in 1981, the annual 400-page compendium of statistics
has become to Lloyd's what Wisden is to cricket. League Tables are
painstakingly prepared from dozens of syndicate reports.
The new publication, called Limelight, draws directly on the considerable
resources of the Lloyd's Corporation, the body that provides back-up
services to the market.
Lloyd's says that the new venture is 'absolutely commercial'. It aims to
sell 3,000 copies this year and looks well placed to eat into Chatset's
market share. Not only is Limelight, a hefty 600-page manual, cheaper than
League Tables, it also contains more information.
Worse still, the market is declining as the number of Names falls - and
there is more competition around the corner. Next week the Association of
Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names, is set to launch a
much improved version of its own syndicate guides, which members will
receive free as part of their annual Pounds 90 subscription. The guides will
be based on statistical work carried out by Financial Intelligence &amp;
Research, a management company.
Ironically, it is precisely the success of League Tables that has paved the
way for Chatset's difficulties. Mr Sturge and Mr Rew have been pioneers in
promoting the climate of greater openness at Lloyd's that has led directly
to the increase in competition.
Until the 1980s, the operation of syndicates, into which Names are grouped,
was shrouded in secrecy. Names could obtain the results of their own
syndicates. But Mr Sturge, who worked as an underwriter, recalls: 'You could
never find out how other syndicates had peformed. It was strictly not
allowed to swap reports. They were considered confidential documents.'
Chatset's supporters say Lloyd's has been stung by criticism to compete and
angered by Chatset's support for disaffected Names, who have borne the brunt
of recent losses at the market, and by the pessimism of its recent
forecasts.
Mr Oliver Carruthers, a prominent Lloyd's-watcher who edits a monthly
newsletter, Digest of Lloyd's News, and helps compile the League Tables,
says the move by Lloyd's is a 'spoiling tactic'.
Chatset's critics, on the other hand, say that its high profile has been
artificial and that the views of its editors have been unduly influenced by
the large losses they have sustained themselves.
Yesterday Mr Sturge was phlegmatic. Readers will still want Chatset's pithy
commentaries on market and syndicate prospects, he believes. 'We've got to
hope that brand loyalty wins the day. The future is a bit worrying. But you
have to wonder whether there will be a Lloyd's next year, let alone a
Chatset or a Limelight.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Strike shuts Companies House head office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL headquarters of Companies House, the government's company
information agency based in Cardiff, was closed yesterday by a one-day
strike by several hundred employees.
The action followed an announcement last month by Mr David Durham, chief
executive, that the agency would reduce its 1,150-strong workforce by
between 70 and 80 this year in an effort to save Pounds 3m. Mr Kieron Hill,
officer for Wales of the NUCPS Civil Service union, said about 150 staff
picketed the agency.
'We don't want to destroy Companies House but we took this action to show
our lack of confidence in the chief executive and the fact that there is
strong feeling over the cuts,' he said.
Mr Jeff Evans, the regional officer of the CPSA Civil Service union, said:
'Senior management of Companies House do not have the confidence of staff.
Staff will have to be convinced that the chief executive has the best
interests of the agency at heart.'
Members of the two unions had voted by 341 votes to 111 to hold a one-day
strike in a ballot in which 65 per cent voted.
The other regional offices of Companies House remained open during the day,
but services requiring contact with the Cardiff office were severely
curtailed.
Mr Durham said that the cost-cutting was necessary to meet the financial
objectives set down by ministers at a time when Companies House was
experiencing weak demand for its services.
He added that an anticipated upturn in the workload this year had not
materialised.
However, Mr Hill said work had started to increase again since May and that
there was also a substantial backlog of work.
'If there is a recovery, obviously having the staff to meet the services is
important,' he added.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Land Travel Collapse: Customers vent anger on Tjolle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the Land Travel coach company, went to the
Unicorn Hotel in Bristol yesterday to face the people whose holidays he had
ruined and his colleagues in the travel industry whose fingers he had
allegedly burned.
If the gaunt and drawn-looking Mr Tjolle expected to be given credit for his
courage in turning up, he was immediately disappointed.
The hundreds of creditors present, many of whom were elderly, were in an
angry mood which turned uglier as details emerged of the Pounds 400,000 of
company funds paid into Mr Tjolle's bank account.
The procession to the microphone of aggrieved customers and suppliers
included several who called, to cheers, for Mr Tjolle to be locked up.
Mr Robert Buller, of liquidators Grant Thornton, found himself the target of
some of the hostility, particularly when he suggested that television
cameras should be excluded from the meeting.
His warning to creditors that they risked being sued if defamatory
statements were captured on camera was greeted with cries of 'What a bloody
cheek]' The cameras were allowed in.
Mr Tjolle, pale and dressed in a dark suit, told creditors Land Travel had
carried more than 1m travellers and had given them a 'very, very good time'.
He added: 'Land Travel was a very creative travel company and had an
enormous amount of devoted support from its staff, its customers and
suppliers almost up until the end.'
His voice close to breaking, Mr Tjolle said: 'So far as I'm concerned this
is a very sad time. Our staff have lost their jobs, our customers have lost
their holidays and our suppliers have lost their money. I personally feel
that I have let you all down.'
As Mr Tjolle, who filed for personal bankruptcy last Thursday, refused to
answer any questions on the advice of his solicitor, the meeting at times
came close to anarchy. Mr Tjolle sat impassive as creditors threw a jug of
water and papers at him.
Mrs Glenys Dwyer, of Bristol, said that she had paid Land Travel Pounds
3,000 to take 47 deaf people to Paris, a trip that had never taken place.
Mrs Dwyer, who is deaf, spoke through a sign-language interpreter. She
repeated a complaint by many creditors who said they had been pressed into
making payments to the company in the weeks before it collapsed.
Mr Leon Sarkis, general manager of Monde Sans Frontiere, a Paris-based
travel company, said Land Travel owed him Pounds 250,000.
Mr Sarkis said that on one occasion he had lent FFr230,000 in cash to the
company to enable it to buy tickets to the Euro-Disney resort.
He added that he had been told the company could not get any cash as the
banks were closed because it was a Saturday. He said the money had not been
returned.
Mr Buller gave the meeting details of financial transactions between Mr
Tjolle and the Granada Group, which owned Land Travel between 1987 and 1990.
When Mr Tjolle bought the company from Granada he obtained its Pounds 2.2m
loan to Land Travel for a consideration of Pounds 1. He converted it into
loans to Land Travel from himself, Pounds 2m of which was long-term,
repayable in 1996, and Pounds 200,000 of which was short-term.
In the years after Mr Tjolle purchased Land Travel from Granada it made
heavy losses. They totalled Pounds 1.8m in 1990-91 and Pounds 2.7m in
1991-92.
Mr Buller said that Mr Tjolle appeared to have received the Pounds 400,000
in the period before that stipulated in the loan he purchased from Granada
and in preference to the general body of Land Travel creditors.

THE United Nations proposes to station 30 observers in South Africa to help
bring about a peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy, write Michael
Littlejohns and Agencies in New York.
The observer force was recommended by UN secretary general Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali yesterday in a report to the UN Security Council after the
recent visit to South Africa by his envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the observers would draw on the experience of 10
temporary UN observers sent to monitor the two-day strike and protest
rallies in South Africa this week.
'The observers would be stationed in agreed upon locations, in various parts
of South Africa,' he said. They could, if necessary, be joined by personnel
from the Commonwealth, the European Community and the Organisation of
African States.
Mr Boutros Ghali also recommended that 'an eminent and impartial person' -
not necessarily a foreigner - be appointed to give impetus to new talks on
constitutional arrangements in South Africa.
The African National Congress has vowed not to resume constitutional talks
until the government meets a number of demands, including measures to end
violence, which has taken thousands of lives, especially in black townships.
A South African prosecutor said yesterday he was examining new evidence of a
state role in the 1985 killing of prominent black activist Matthew Goniwe,
Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Mr Michael Hodgen said a police team interviewed unidentified witnesses
provided by newspapers including Johannesburg's Weekly Mail.
The Weekly Mail said it had submitted evidence including the names of state
hit-squad members responsible for the murder of Goniwe and colleagues on a
remote highway.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Old clan rivalries fuel bloodshed in Somalia: Julian Ozanne
reports from a land of mistrust and blood feud now threatened with
widespread famine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BITTER clan rivalries, the divisive legacy of a brutal dictator, and a
fiercely individualistic culture of suspicion and revenge have fuelled
Somalia's disintegration into bloodshed, famine and horror.
The country has fragmented into fiefdoms controlled by feuding clans and has
ceased to exist as a nation state.
Many Somalis cannot explain the civil war between clan-families who share
the same language and religion. Most, however, blame Gen Mohamed Siad Barre,
the cold war gladiator who ruled Somalia ruthlessly for 21 years. They also
blame Moscow and Washington, who supported his repressive rule with military
and economic aid as they played cold war politics by proxy on the continent.
Barre destroyed all the political and civic institutions in Somalia. Terror
and fear became widespread as security agencies meted out arbitrary and
brutal punishment.
The other clans, a complex, genealogically based social structure which
evolved historically from family groups, soon began to see violent rebellion
as the only way to seek a share of power and wealth.
An attempted coup led by officers from the Mijeerteen clan was brutally
repressed by Barre in 1978. The Mijeerteen suffered horrifying reprisals and
a year later became the first clan to desert Barre and go into insurrection.
They set up the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, a clan-based movement
which today controls the north-east.
Over the next decade other clans went into armed rebellion. The northern
Isak clan formed the Somali National Movement, the Ogadeni formed the Somali
Patriotic Movement, and the Hawiye, who dominate Mogadishu and central
Somalia, formed the United Somali Congress (USC). Each controls a piece of
what was once Somalia.
Moscow first and then Washington sat by as the country disintegrated,
continuing to pour arms and ammunition into Somalia, then considered a
strategic piece of 'real estate' on the cold war chessboard because of its
Red Sea port at Berbera and its position in the Horn of Africa. Recent
estimates suggest 180,000 Somalis are armed today and there is enough
ammunition left over from arms stockpiling to last another 20 years.
As long as the east-west conflict endured, Barre contained the mounting
clan-based rebellions with increasing human rights atrocities. However, as
his support from abroad ended after the cold war, his fragile power base was
exposed and the oppressed clans stepped up their rebellion.
When Barre shot his way out of the capital in January 1991 after a
victorious assault by the USC, Somalia lay divided and in ruins. Barre took
most of his Marehan clan with him and continued fighting in southern Somalia
by forming the Somali National Front.
All the clan-based armed movements have split into mutually antagonistic
groups. The most destructive of these splits has been in the Hawiye-based
USC which controlled Mogadishu. The Abgal under Ali Mahdi Mohamed now
control the north of the city and the Habir Gidir under Gen Mohamed Farrar
Aideed control the south.
It is difficult to explain why the two sub-clans, who are the most closely
related in Somalia, have followed the warlords who lead them. Somalis say
there have always been clan disputes. These were traditionally contained by
the absence of modern weapons.
They also say Somali culture is steeped in revenge, which has exacerbated
the violence. A well known Somali saying sums it up: 'My clan against the
enemy, my family against the clan, my brother and I against the family, me
against my brother.'
Aid workers, seeking to get food to 1.5m Somalis on the brink of starvation,
are now trying to pick their way through this violent climate of mistrust
and blood feuding.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Italy boardroom reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new government yesterday sent the strongest signal to date of its
determination to shake up and privatise the country's public sector by
pushing through a revolutionary slimming-down of the boards of the country's
four biggest state-owned companies.
IRI, the biggest state holding company, ENI, the energy and chemicals
concern, ENEL, the state electricity authority, and INA, the state insurance
agency, will see their boards shrink to just three members.
Only one member, the chairman, will remain a political appointment. A new
position of chief executive will be created, to be occupied by the
companies' current director-general, a non-political post. The third board
member will be a senior civil servant from one of the key ministries
involved in the privatisation process.
The present chairmen, Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI,
Mr Franco Viezzoli at ENEL and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA, will all retain
their jobs, at least until the next shareholders' meetings in April.
However, at a press conference last night, Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime
minister, indicated the longer-term outlook for IRI and ENI in particular
involved big changes, expecially disposals.
Mr Amato, flanked by Mr Piero Barucci, treasury minister, Mr Franco
Reviglio, budget minister, and Mr Giuseppe Guarino, industry minister, the
chief architects of the privatisation drive, stressed that all four groups
would eventually be sold to the public.
In the case of IRI and ENI, Italy's two biggest public-sector industrial
concerns, reducing losses in some subsidiaries would be a first step. Once
quoted, the companies would be open to foreign alliances to improve their
international coverage and would represent a 'new Italian national
industry', he said.
The new boards will replace the dozens of committees and executive groups,
largely comprising political appointees, which have dominated the four
companies in the past. ENI's main board has 15 members, mainly put forward
by the governing parties; IRI has 14.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Panic orders prison camps to be closed: Yugoslav PM responds
to worldwide anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Milan Panic, prime minister of Yugoslavia, yesterday said he would order
the closure of all Serbian prison camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina following
international condemnation of the existence of detention camps throughout
the independent republic.
'I'm going to order Radovan Karadzic (leader of Bosnia's Serbs) to close
down all the camps. I'm the leader of all the Serbs in the world. If he
doesn't he will have to resign and go away,' said Mr Panic during a visit to
Budapest, the Hungarian capital. However, he admitted he did not have full
control over Mr Karadzic.
Mr Karadzic, who yesterday denied prisoners had been systematically killed
or tortured, said he wanted to investigate 'disobedience' by camp guards.
Speaking to the London-based Independent Television News from Belgrade, Mr
Karadzic repeatedly tried to shake off mounting criticism from western
governments which yesterday insisted that camps be opened up to inspection.
Many Moslems, forced to flee the fighting in Bosnia or forcibly deported
from the republic, have described how Serb gunmen have rounded up thousands
of Moslems, put them in camps, and let them leave once they have signed over
their property and quit the republic.
But Mr Karadzic has repeatedly denied the existence of 'ethnic cleansing', a
policy aimed at creating ethnically pure Serb regions in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
He also said Croats and Moslems had rejected his offer to release prisoners
from the camps.
Mr Panic met Mr Franjo Greguric, prime minister of Croatia. They discussed
the exchange of prisoners captured last year during the Croat-Serb war in
which 10,000 people were killed. Both sides agreed to 1,500 prisoners.
Despite the televised film of Serbian-run detention camps in Bosnia, Mr
Panic yesterday insisted that Yugoslavia had fulfilled the main condition
towards the lifting of United Nations sanctions imposed on May 31 on
Yugoslavia by claiming the Yugoslav army was no longer present in Bosnia.
In the besieged capital of Sarajevo, artillery fire struck the headquarters
of the UN forces, injuring four French peacekeepers.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Bush says Iraq will be forced to comply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush insisted yesterday that Iraq would be forced to comply
with United Nations resolutions despite Baghdad's threat to deny weapons'
inspectors access to government ministries.
At the same time a newly arrived UN weapons inspection team, due to begin
work in Baghdad today, agreed to a one-day postponement because today is a
holiday in Iraq.
Referring to Iraq's recent resistance to weapons inspections, Mr Bush said:
'I can't tell how much of this is bluster. But they are going to comply with
UN resolutions. I am absolutely certain of that.'
The latest team of 22 UN inspectors is headed by a Russian, Mr Nikita
Smidovich. Their visit is the latest attempt to discover remaining Iraqi
stocks of nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.
Previous UN inspectors were barred for 18 days from a ministry of
agriculture building in Baghdad, before Iraq bowed to growing threats of
renewed military intervention.
On Thursday, the Iraqis threw down a further challenge, warning that no more
visits to ministries would be permitted, a condition which a Pentagon
spokesman in Washington described as 'preposterous'.
Mr Smidovich has given no indication whether ministries are on the list of
sites inspectors want to visit on this trip.
But he said before leaving Bahrain: 'We have our orders and our rights are
clear. We can visit any place in Iraq.'
Mr Bush has refused to rule out the use of force if Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein again defies the UN.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Mozambique peace pact promises end to 16-year civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPPOSING leaders in Mozambique's civil war signed an accord yesterday
which could bring peace to the country for the first time in three decades.
At a ceremony in Rome, President Joaquim Chissano and Mr Afonso Dhlakama,
leader of the Renamo rebels, agreed to end hostilities in the 16-year civil
war by October 1. The war, which followed a guerrilla conflict seeking
independence from Portugal, achieved in 1975, has devastated the already
impoverished country.
War and drought have forced a quarter of the 15m population to flee, and
fighting has seriously hindered efforts to avert starvation.
The six-page agreement, the result of nearly two years of intermittent
talks, calls for the international community and the United Nations in
particular to help monitor the agreement, which provides for Mozambique's
first multiparty elections.
Implementation of the pact will be a formidable task, given the destruction
of the infrastructure and fears that Renamo is not so much an organised
movement as a collection of gangs and warlords. Yesterday's news that Renamo
attacks continued during the latest peace talks may be a symptom of this
kind of indiscipline.
Participants in Rome remained optimistic, however. 'This is an historic day
for the people of Mozambique and Africa . . . Please, no more deaths,' said
Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe, who, with church leaders and the Italian
government, helped arrange the pact.
President Mugabe and President Chissano paid tribute at the signing to the
role played in the long peace process by Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of
Lonrho, the British conglomerate. 'Well done, Tiny,' said Mr Mugabe,
embracing Mr Rowland, while Mr Chissano spoke of 'our friend Tiny'.
Lonrho has big commercial, agro-industrial and mining interests in
Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Mr Rowland's involvement in the peace process goes
back over two years, when he arranged the first meeting of the two sides in
Malawi. He has also been trying to mediate in the Sudanese civil war.

FT  08 AUG 92 / US Fed intervenes as dollar nears low against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FEDERAL Reserve bought dollars in foreign exchange markets yesterday as
the US currency threatened to slip to its all-time low against the D-Mark.
Making its first move shortly after the London market closed, the Fed bought
dollars four or five times at levels ranging from DM1.4675 to DM1.473. The
first round of intervention lifted the US currency to DM1.475 but in a
market almost devoid of participants it drifted lower to DM1.4668 by the end
of New York trading.
The Fed's action, the second attempt to prop up the dollar in less than
three weeks, followed the release of disappointing US employment figures for
July. These showed a rise of 198,000 month-on-month, underlining the
sluggish growth of the economy. Dealers had expected a larger overall rise.
The dollar's fall weakened sterling. Dealers said the pound fell at one
stage to DM2.8232, its lowest since sterling joined the Exchange Rate
Mechanism in October 1990. Sterling closed down in Europe at DM2.8250,
although it picked up in New York to DM2.8334, benefiting from the Fed's
intervention.
The pound's poor London performance was mirrored by another bad day for UK
equities, with the FT-SE 100 share index dropping 27.5 to 2,350.1.
The closing level was better than dealers had expected earlier in the day.
After bottoming out at 2,344.9, the index took heart from Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up some 25 points at mid-session. The
Dow eventually succumbed to profit-taking and concerns about the economy,
however, and closed down 8.38 at 3,332.18.
The fall in London rounded off an unhappy week for UK stocks, with the FT-SE
shedding about 2 per cent of its value.

<TEXT>
The 39-nation Conference on Disarmament yesterday produced the final draft
of a treaty to ban chemical weapons, ending 24 years of talks, AP reports
from Geneva.
'This is the end of the substantive talks,' said a senior US negotiator.
'Now it's a question of procedure.' The negotiator, said the first step
would be to see which countries would approve the compromise text
immediately.
Some countries will be able to announce their acceptance when the committee
on chemical weapons meets again on August 26.
Others will have an opportunity to sign the treaty in a Paris ceremony late
this year or early next year. It will go into effect when at least 65
nations have signed. It aims to eliminate chemical weapons over 10 years and
provides for inspections to make sure the treaty is observed.

FT  08 AUG 92 / US reports fall in jobless rate to 7.7%
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US jobless rate fell slightly last month to 7.7 per cent partly as a
result of increased federal funding for a summer jobs programme, the Labour
Department reported yesterday.
The figures were a relief for President George Bush after a sharp rise in
unemployment in June, but were not good enough to give him a significant
economic boost ahead of the Republican party convention in Houston this
month.
At a news conference yesterday, President Bush said: 'I simply cannot be
satisfied until every American who wants a job has one.'
The figures represented the first improvement in the rate of unemployment
since April, when it dipped to 7.2 per cent.
In May and June, unemployment jumped by 0.6 percentage point to an
eight-year high of 7.8 per cent, giving Democrats ammunition for their
charges that the Republicans had mishandled the economy.
In financial markets, the figures were seen as consistent with a raft of
data indicating that the economy is creeping ahead, but at a far slower pace
than in previous recoveries. Foreign exchange dealers were disappointed,
however, and the Fed intervened in the markets during the day.
Officials said employment in non-agricultural sectors rose nearly 200,000
last month to 108.6m, one of the strongest gains in the past two years.
They also sharply revised down estimates of job losses in June - to a net
decline of 60,000 rather than the 117,000 initially reported.
However, the headline figures overstated the economy's underlying strength.
Nearly all the job growth was concentrated in services and local government.
Service sector employment rose 110,000, with much of the gain in health and
social services. Local government employment rose 90,000, with two-thirds of
the increase reflecting increased federal funding for a summer youth jobs
and training programme.
Employment in the goods-producing sectors was flat. Manufacturing employment
held steady at 18.2m after a sharp decline in June. Construction employment
fell slightly for the second month running.
The overall unemployment rate fell to 7.7 per cent compared with 7.8 in June
and about 5.5 when the recession began two years ago.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Row at Land Travel creditors' meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the collapsed coach tour operator Land Travel,
was assailed by angry creditors yesterday at a meeting which heard that he
had received Pounds 400,000 of company money in addition to his salary over
the past 16 months.
The incident came after Mr Robert Buller, of liquidators Grant Thornton,
also told the crowded creditors' meeting in Bristol that he had complaints
that Land Travel had banked cheques on July 23, the day before the collapse,
even though Mr Tjolle had already arranged to see him.
Mr Buller said Pounds 6.6m of Land Travel's total debts of Pounds 12.4m,
more than six times the amount originally estimated, was owed to would-be
travellers. He said Grant Thornton had been able to identify 25,000 such
customers.
Because Land Travel was not bonded by the Association of British Travel
Agents or the Bus and Coach Council, customers have no chance of receiving
any refund unless they paid by credit card, in which case they stand to be
reimbursed by the card issuers under the Consumer Credit Act. Mr Buller said
there was little chance of any creditors receiving anything.
After yesterday's meeting, Mr Buller said Mr Tjolle was owed money by Land
Travel arising from his purchase of the company in 1990. He said Mr Tjolle
appeared to have received the Pounds 400,000 before the period stipulated in
the loan and in preference to the general body of Land Travel creditors.
Mr Buller also said the Pounds 400,000 was in addition to Mr Tjolle's annual
remuneration of Pounds 52,000. He said that from January to July this year,
additional payments to Mr Tjolle were made at the rate of Pounds 14,000 a
week.
Mr Tjolle made a brief statement at the meeting in which he told the
creditors, many of them elderly: 'I personally feel I have let you down.' He
said that although he had nothing to hide he had been advised by his
solicitor, Mr Angus Halden, not to answer any questions.
During the two-hour meeting, an angry creditor threw a jug of water over Mr
Tjolle and threatened him with a walking stick before being led away. Two
creditors tore up pieces of paper and threw them in Mr Tjolle's face.
Mr Buller said it appeared that the company was trading while insolvent for
some time before the liquidators were called in.
He said he had sold the Land Travel database to Shearings Holidays for a net
consideration of Pounds 50,000. The company's furniture and computers were
probably worth a further Pounds 25,000.
Land Travel's cut-price European holidays included three nights in Paris or
Brussels at Pounds 49, and 10 days in Poland at Pounds 159.

FT  08 AUG 92 / West vows to open up Serb camps: Britain and US look for
alternative strategies to military intervention in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments vowed yesterday to take all possible measures to open up
Serb-run detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina after an international
outcry.
However, the US, Britain and other European countries were desperately
seeking ways to avoid being dragged into any kind of military intervention.
Instead, they said they would seek to inspect detention camps holding
Bosnian Moslems. The camps have been graphically depicted on British and US
television in the past 24 hours.
In Geneva, the US was trying to gain support to convene an emergency session
of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to discuss alleged atrocities
in Bosnia. President George Bush called for the conference on Thursday in
response to mounting public pressure for the US to give a stronger lead on
ending the fighting in Bosnia.
In his second public statement on Bosnia in 24 hours, Mr Bush said he 'would
not rest until each and every one of the camps has been visited by
international inspectors'. His main aim appeared to be to deflect
speculation on military action while emphasising his horror at conditions in
the camps. 'The shocking brutality of genocide in World War Two, in those
concentration camps, are burning memories for all of us, and that can't
happen again,' he said.
In London, the government also called for an emergency meeting of the UN
Human Rights Commission to launch an investigation of the Serbian camps,
echoing an earlier US call.
Mr John Major said anyone involved in brutal behaviour in the detention
camps would be brought to justice. 'Nobody who has seen these reports could
be other than greatly concerned about them, and we are,' the prime minister
said in Barcelona, where he is attending the Olympics.
The UK called on Bosnia's Serbs to let qualified independent observers enter
the camps before handing them over to UN control.
Mr Major, who last night discussed the crisis with Mr Bush in a 20-minute
phone call, said Britain had been looking at 'a whole series of options' in
conjunction with European and Nato allies.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Britain and 'our friends' were
putting together a UN Security Council resolution that would include a call
to collect information on abuses. Mr Hurd said if any detention camps
continued, they should be placed under international supervision 'as soon as
possible' and any abuses 'must be stopped'.
In Paris, Mr Georges Kiejman, deputy foreign minister, said France wanted to
increase the numbers and equipment of UN forces in Bosnia, and would try to
alter their mandate to let them control the camps and protect aid convoys.
All three governments continued to resist pressure for military
intervention. Mr Bush warned against becoming embroiled in the Balkans, but
said the US was considering use of force 'very carefully'. He said, in an
apparent reference to the war in Vietnam: 'I do not want to see the US
bogged down in any way into some guerrilla warfare. We've lived through that
once.'
Along with Mr Major, President Bush is reluctant to provide ground troops in
Bosnia, but ultimately both leaders say they are prepared to provide
military back-up for the international humanitarian relief effort.
Humanitarian flights to Sarajevo airport were expected to resume early this
morning after being suspended on Tuesday.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Follow the leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DID YOU happen to see that leader in The Times last Monday entitled Chariots
of Hope and Glory? It was a model of the leader-writer's art: pithy,
uplifting and as fast off the blocks as its subject, British sprinter
Linford Christie, the toast of Barcelona.
'Six hundredths of a second' - it started - 'are an infinitesimally short
time for most sublunary activities . . . But this was the margin by which
Linford Christie won the Olympic 100 metres at the weekend, an apparently
leisurely stride and a half ahead of the other fastest men in the world from
Africa and the Americas, straining and ducking towards the tape behind him
in that far fierce split-second and sweet.'
Sublunary means mundane or terrestrial. I had to look it up. I shall use it
often now, though I doubt I will have the wit to use it as a launch-pad for
the poeticism of 'far fierce split-second and sweet.'
That was the first paragraph. But the writer did not rest on his laurels. He
upped the ante, boosted the pace, showed a flash of character, answered the
big question and was not found wanting.
After 'far fierce split-second and sweet' he threw in a bit of business
about Christie confessing as a child that he wanted to be the 'fastest man
on earth' - a title, wrote The Times' unknown warrior, that derived from
journalistic hyperbole.
It had to be hyperbole because 'in miles per hour, the fastest man in the
world is often the one running 200 metres . . . he is running at top speed
for longer: the record for 200 metres is usually less than twice the time
for the 100. Nevertheless, it the 100 metres that is the cynosure of
athletics . . .'
From there, the leader moved towards its climax with utmost panache: 'To run
faster than all comers' - it concluded - 'glorifies not just the runner and
his country, but humanity itself. That is why those six hundredths of a
second make even the most unathletic walk with a spring in their strides
this morning.'
I don't expect that you know any newspaper leader-writers. They are
invariably quite small men - 5ft 3in is rare - who wear waistcoats and
spectacles and live in pretty suburbs. Most are over-educated. Also
introverted and combative. They are combative because they know that the
only people who read newspaper leaders are the people who write them.
This is not as it should be. The reason I say this is that I am a director
of a small London company that supplies leader-columns to newspapers on a
freelance basis. The work is arduous and ill-paid, but the Olympics are a
god-send. Yesterday, for example, I sat at the word processor and bent my
mind to the Olympic medals table.
'In the fiery cauldron of the Olympic stadium' - I started - 'all men and
nations are equal. Whether you are a pampered American track star with
hand-tooled luggage and a syringe in your pocket, or an uncalculating
tribesman from the ancestral plains of Africa, all are equal before the
judges. This also applies to nations. At the top of the medal list this
morning sit the Unified Team of former communists with 88 medals, followed
by the US (86) and Germany (58). These are big-spending teams with a lust
for winning. But that does not make them greater in spirit or in pride than
little nations with just a bronze medal each: the Bahamas, Columbia,
Ethiopia, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, Surinam.'
That was going well, so I called an assistant to finish it off and sat at
another screen:
'It is a mark of the crumbling of Britain's class system that a golden Essex
Girl like Sally Gunnell should have captured the hearts of the global
billions with a magnificent display of courage in the Olympic women's 400
metres hurdles. Not for Sally Gunnell the lip-gloss contracts of glamorous
rivals like America's Sandra Farmer-Patrick, whom she slew on the burning
track. Sally is the face of John Major's Britain. She is modest yet
determined. Reassuringly plain. In her own word: 'Brilliant']'
I rushed to another screen: 'South Africa could explode at any moment, which
means that the South African Olympic team in Barcelona could be reduced to
the status of refugees. Who will give them sanctuary? Who will offer
succour?'
I called for an assistant. I would not rest on my laurels. It was time to
raise the stakes, to show a flash of character, to answer the big question
and burst through the pain wall.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Private View: An Aussie with a grip on the numbers game -
Bill McLennan, 'a cheery Australian ankle-biter', is shaking up the Central
Statistical Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'G'DAY]' said the director of the Central Statistical Office, and held out a
big paw. He looked like a rugby wing forward as he bounced around the grand
Whitehall office in his shirtsleeves. An Aboriginal bark painting hung above
the polished desk.
Bill McLennan is the result of one of the most unusual - or imaginative -
appointments ever made to the top of the British civil service.
There is nothing of the self-deprecating mandarin about his person. He is a
cheery Australian ankle-biter with a good international reputation who was
recruited to smarten up the service on which the government depends for its
steering of the British economy.
He reportedly told the Whitehall selection panel that UK statistics were
'crook,' a reference to the fact that some vital numbers - the trade figures
and GNP growth, for example - were so late and so approximate as to be
near-useless.
In private, he uses expressions like 'It's a load of crap.' In public, he is
a lot more tactful, but flaunts his Aussie background as boldly as a
kookaburra in a cageful of pigeons. Since taking office in March, he has
once or twice come nearly to blows with Treasury men who objected to his
manner.
I asked him if people commented on his Australian behaviour.
'Yes, they do.'
Do they say it with approval or disapproval?
'When they're talking to me, with approval. When they leave, I don't know
what they say.' He chuckled.
Has anyone said to you: 'Look, old boy, couldn't you calm down and be a bit
more like us?'
'No. I expect that'll happen eventually.'
Did you think about it before you came?
'I realised that things would be different here and I had to be a bit
cautious and not be my normal aggressive self, I suppose. So I've tried, for
me, to be a bit quiet about it.'
Is your language less colourful than it was in Canberra?
'I think the answer's Yes. Until I get cranky.'
McLennan is no fool. He helped make the Australian Bureau of Statistics, of
which he was deputy head, one of the best in the world by vigorous
management, computerisation, and marketing new lines of statistics for
public sale.
He is the son of a dairy farmer in New South Wales who died when the boy was
only 10. The family moved to Wollongong and his brothers went to work in the
steel industry. He considered a career in the air force but instead joined
the statistics bureau as a 17-year-old cadet and was put through the
Australian National University in Canberra, reading pure mathematics. There
he met his wife, Christine, also a statistician, who now has a job in the
operations research division of the British Treasury.
Although wooed by private companies who offered him jobs in corporate
planning or information systems, he did not want to leave Canberra or the
security of the civil service. 'Also, I had got involved in running people,
running organisations, dealing with the management side of things.'
McLennan is very keen on management. He solemnly gave me a copy of his own
profile, one of those quasi-scientific assessments in which consultants tell
managers in suitably ponderous jargon what the managers have already
revealed about themselves in the consultant's questionnaire.
According to this document, McLennan is an 'assessor-developer' in the Team
Management Wheel. He also has a bit of the explorer-promoter in him,
likewise the thruster-organiser. All his senior colleagues have been put
through the same unhappy process.
The new director of the CSO is not afraid to use more old-fashioned methods
of inculcating team spirit. He takes his colleagues away for discussion
weekends or down to the pub for a drink. Being Australian, he cannot escape
the reputation of having hollow legs.
Do you like drinking? I asked him.
'I've had a couple of beers. I don't beat my wife, either.'
You've got a good head, have you?
'What, for figures?'
McLennan likes figures as well as beer. I asked him to describe the appeal
of his ascetic profession.
'I think I like the precision of it. I like the idea of producing numbers
accurately, that people will use. I like the management side of it, working
in an organisation where you try to get all the people to think the same
way.
'It's not everybody likes to work in an organisation where the truth is
paramount. But you can't be a statistician if you don't believe that, I
think.'
Is it creative?
'Oh, certainly. You're creating new collections, new ideas all the time.'
Are you looking for a truth? Or just for one facet of it?
'What's truth, I wonder? I think you might be right. You're actually looking
for the best possible answer to a particular problem. You never get the
perfect answer.'
Is it clear that people know what question they're trying to answer?
'That's one of the difficult things, which is why we spend so much time
testing the questions to see whether people understand them.'
What are you really trying to do?
'To change the collective thinking of senior staff, to think more
corporately, to think more long term.'
How will we, the public, benefit?
'You'll obviously get better statistics. But the name of the game is not
even getting better statistics. It's getting the numbers out that people
will actually use. There's no point me giving you the best statistics in the
world if you never use them. That means providing what they want, when they
want it, at the price they want it.'
McLennan's enthusiasm for selling statistics has led some people to fear
that his appointment exposes a hidden agenda to turn the CSO, the first job
of which is to supply the Treasury, into a sort of business. So far, he has
proposed nothing more outrageous than to build up an electronic subscriber
list, to revamp press releases and sell them directly to the outside.
Will you sell for money what at present you're giving away for nothing?
'Oh, I don't know about that. What I'd be inclined to do is put all our
major releases in deposit libraries round the country, so anyone can get
them free if they want, and charge for personal copies or special
tabulations or figures provided electronically.
'The real thing, though, is this: if I'm charging you a pound and it's not
what you want, you won't pay a pound for it. So there's immediate feedback.
But when you've got it right, you can charge them almost anything.'
McLennan's appointment, coming after the CSO's conversion from a government
department into an agency, is seen as evidence that ministers will tolerate
more openness and independence in its statistical service.
The CSO director is certainly construing things that way; he has already
ruffled feathers by insisting that statisticians at all the other ministries
publish their figures according to a timetable that prevents tactical delays
for political convenience.
As for openness, what other permanent secretary in Whitehall would sit and
talk, on the record for an hour, about his public responsibility and
personal habits? But McLennan knows when not to go too far.
I asked him what struck him most about the British civil service.
'It's got different ways of working - almost working at a different pace.'
Slower or faster?
'Slower, I think. It's more considered, more deliberate. Responsibilities in
Australia are more devolved to department heads than here. It's heading that
way here.'
Would you call the British system antiquated?
'It's different. I don't know if it's antiquated. I wouldn't want to use
such a pejorative word.'
What word would you use?
'It's certainly more formal in some ways. On the surface a lot of things
look the same, but in actual fact they're really not. It's the way people
think.
'It's very difficult for me to make any strong statement because I just
haven't been here long enough. It's certainly very different. But when I've
been in to bat on a couple of issues, the result's been very positive very
quickly.'
I thanked him for talking to me.
'OK', said the director of the Central Statistical Office. 'No worries.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / A rather nasty British disease: Pride in one's country is
fine. Jingoism is something else
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE spent most of the past week in Morocco. It was difficult to sleep,
but I blame neither the heat nor the flies. I blame the Olympic Games. On
the first day Khalid Skah, of Morocco, won the men's 10,000 metres race. All
night there was a strange chanting, which I took to be a celebration.
The next day Skah was disqualified, for reasons which were not altogether
appreciated by the man in the casbah. So the quiet of the night was this
time rent by peculiar ululations which I took to be the Arabic for 'we wuz
robbed.' Then, on the third day, Khalid Skah rose from the dead. His
disqualification was revoked. There followed another night of howling, this
time accompanied by the beating of distant drums.
In England, of course, we are above such primitive and pointless patriotism.
We are above it because the newspapers and television do it for us, beating
the drums which resonate in every home in the land. On my first day back in
England, I turned to the BBC to watch what purported to be the highlights of
that day's events in Barcelona. Virtually the entire programme was given
over to an interview of stupifying banality with Sally Gunnell, the British
winner of the women's 400m hurdles.
The race was shown - I might have lost count - four times, once accompanied
by music, giving it the full Chariots of Fire treatment. How much I would
have preferred it if the BBC had delivered one programme of genuine
highlights of the Olympics and then, for those of a more Moroccan
disposition, a late-night programme consisting of Sally Gunnell's race
replayed endlessly against a soundtrack of Land of Hope and Glory, God Save
the Queen, I Vow to Thee My Country, Rule Britannia, and other suitable
anthems.
The following day, British runner Kriss Akabusi won the bronze medal in the
men's 400m. This was an interesting piece of news for sports fans, but I
cannot be alone in finding it odd that the BBC commentator noticed this fact
before realising that the winner of the race, the American, Kevin Young, had
broken the world record.
I don't suppose the British media are biased uniquely in this respect. I am
even prepared to believe that every country has an equally absurd
concentration on its own athletes' performances, all ignoring completely the
real pattern of success, achievement and failure at the Barcelona Games.
Doubtless, we would laugh if we were able to tune into the television of a
small African country and watch countless repeats of its man coming third in
the steeplechase. But I find the British version of this disease upsetting,
because it seems to me characteristic of a small or inconsequential country
so starved of success that it exaggerates wildly and overplays even the most
minor triumphs.
In Britain's case, this minor state nationalism has been accompanied by an
increasingly boorish attitude to opponents. There was a time when visiting
foreign football teams were applauded at Wembley, partly out of courtesy.
Nowadays, if a visiting team crushed England, as the Hungarians did in the
1950s, rather than simply marvel at the skill of the foreigners the UK press
would demand that the English manager be sacked, as if anything less than
perpetual victory was a national insult.
The biggest danger is that Britons somehow take sporting success as
symbolic, or even proof, of some great national virility - as, in our case,
a triumph of Englishness over foreignness. The old communist regimes of
eastern Europe understood the propaganda value of this very well.
One reason why we in the west believed all the nonsense about the
'showpiece' East German economy was because we found it hard to imagine that
a nation which could produce so much success on the sports track could be,
at the same time, decadent, corrupt and redundant.
There is nothing wrong at all with patriotism. Pride in one's country is an
admirable sentiment and is often the well-spring of heroic acts of altruism,
particularly in times of war. But the achievement of a plain Essex girl in
leaping over hurdles at unbeatable pace tells us nothing about ourselves and
nothing about our country.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Model view of war - Lee Miller saw herself as recorder
rather than artist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD RUSSELL-WALLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEE MILLER is not the first photojournalist whose life was more interesting
than her photojournalism. But then, given the Manonesque range of her
lifestyles and liaisons, this leaves her work a certain amount of scope.
These words and pictures - and a London exhibition of the pictures - record
Miller's brief but wholehearted calling as a war correspondent between 1944
and 1945. For a woman who had been a Vogue model and an intimate of some of
the best-known figures in 1920s Paris, this was just another chapter in a
life at the centre of events. But the events in question were the hottest
photo-thing since solarisation - the Normandy invasion.
By 1944, when Miller managed to wangle accreditation to the US forces, she
was no novice behind the camera. American-born, she had run her own studio
in New York from 1932 to 1934, when she threw it all up to marry a well-born
Egyptian tycoon and moved to Cairo. This did not last. The outbreak of
German hostilities found her back in Paris and married to Roland Penrose.
On the day Hitler invaded Poland she and Penrose left France for London.
There she covered the Blitz for Vogue, but as preparations for the Normandy
landings got under way, she became determined to be part of the story.
The only woman combat photographer to trail the Allied armies across Europe,
Miller's first assignment was in a US evacuation hospital behind Omaha
Beach. From there she moved into the thick of the battle for St Malo (the
town from which, ironically, she had fled France in 1939), covered the
liberation of Paris, and went on to the Haute Savoie front line. She clicked
and jotted her way across Germany, photographing the US-Soviet link-up on
the Elbe and the grisly liberation of Buchenwald and Dachau, and finally
busked her way into Hitler's private apartment in Munich. One of the more
entertaining pictures is of Miller soaping herself in Hitler's bath.
Miller sensibly saw herself as recorder rather than artist. 'I'm busy making
documents and not art,' she snapped at a nervous German guide who suggested
that Munich' s destroyed Hofbrau Haus would not make an 'interesting'
picture. Her pictures and her despatches are descriptive, not probing. The
Allies are the good guys, the 'Krauts' are the bad, and her lack of sympathy
for German civilian refugees and prisoners-of-war predates her appalled
entry to the concentration camps.
Part of the pictures' appeal lies in their novelty, as unfamiliar images of
much-photographed events. Many have not been published before and those that
have were last seen in wartime Vogue. Indeed, the book had its genesis in a
call from Conde Nast to editor Antony Penrose, Miller's son. They had these
boxes of photographs. If he did not want them, they would be binned.
Miller, the human being, was not unobtrusive. Nor was Miller the
photographer. Her subjects are always aware of the camera - one of the
burdens of being a gorgeous war photographer, but you sense she liked it
that way. The best pictures - as pictures - are her portraits, where
photographer and photographed have had time to get each other's measure.
These range from a gently composed Parisian law student in a bullet-riddled
bistro, to the disarmingly direct mug shot of a brutally beaten Buchenwald
guard.
Some of the most historically useful pictures are not military at all, but
of her old and newly liberated Paris chums and connections, Picasso,
Cocteau, Maurice Chevalier, Paul Eluard. The most disturbing are of those
who did not enjoy the luxury of acquaintance - the dead. There is the
arrested menace of an SS corpse beneath the surface of a canal, the still
pathos of a hopeless suicide, daughter of the German burgomeister of
Leipzig.
The pictures, though not the words, are on display at London's Institute of
Contemporary Arts (ICA) until September 6. And here the circle closes. The
ICA was founded by none other than Roland Penrose.

IN THE EYE OF THE SUN
by Ahdaf Soueif
Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 791 pages
THE ARAB novel in English, unlike that in French, is a rarity. This one by
Ahdaf Soueif, an Egyptian who studied English literature in Cairo and
Britain and lives in London, offers some intimate glimpses of Egyptian
society and family life without the sometimes distorting mediation of
translation. Set in Egypt and England, it makes constant reference to the
ways in which the Arab world and the West perceive and misunderstand each
other.
Over 800 pages, In The Eye of the Sun charts the growth to maturity of its
heroine, Asya, from school and student days in Cairo in the late sixties and
seventies, through six years in London and at an unspecified northern
English university, where Asya studies for a grindingly dull PhD, towards a
final homecoming. Punctuating the life of even Asya's privileged circle are
the wars and coups which accompany the reality of political repression.
Meanwhile, the narrative shifts to encompass family members, as well as
poorer Cairenes, from 'Am Salih, a soft-drink kiosk-owner in Giza, to
Sayyida, the family servant.
Despite these - sometimes moving, sometimes dutiful - gestures towards the
social and political concerns characteristic of the Arabic fictional
tradition, the heart of the novel lies in the relationship between Asya and
a fellow-student, Saif. Its propulsion is the long-drawn-out disintegration
of their marriage, which is exacerbated by Asya's own sense of cultural
dislocation in England. Soueif depicts the stifling conservatism of even the
most 'liberal' families with regard to their daughters' freedom: Asya's 7pm
'curfew' as a student in Cairo; her friend's suspension from college by her
father for being seen walking in the street with a man.
The couple conforms with a protracted engagement during which Asya's
virginity is scrupulously - and against her own inclination - preserved. It
is this quelling of spontaneity and passion, in favour of the postponed
'duties' of the marriage bed, to which Asya attributes her resistance to sex
and the failure of her marriage, which remains unconsummated for its
seven-year duration.
From Cairo and Alexandria, to the freedom of Italy and the loneliness of
England, Asya wrestles with the vacuity of her marriage and her desire for
other men. An affair with a ludicrously overbearing and self-pitying English
student, Gerald, both 'liberates' her sexually and precipitates the break
with Saif.
With this in some ways conventional theme of feminist 'awakening', Soueif
joins other Arab women writers, including Nawal El Saadawi, Hanan al-Shaykh
and Alifa Rifaat, in challenging the denial and circumscription of female
sexuality. Saif, at first indulgent and affectionate, emerges as patronising
and violently possessive. Tolerant of Asya's fears when he sees her as a
virginal ingenue, he refuses to allow her to take the sexual initiative,
leading Asya to view herself as trapped in the role of unresponsive statue.
While Asya's 'infidelity' brings out Saif's patriarchal attitudes (to the
extent of his beating and raping her), it is the knowledge that she
initiated her affair that prompts him to leave. Like the fundamentalist
student whom Asya briefly counsels in England, who thinks all women whores
because they are capable of desiring men not their husbands, Saif can
conceive of no woman who expresses desire who is not in his eyes
indiscriminate and 'abnormal' in her lusts.
Yet, for all its insights and the clarity of Soueif's prose, the novel is
flawed by almost obsessive, extraneous detail and a rambling, repetitious
plot, littered with false clues and lost threads. The initial promise of a
broad political canvas seems forgotten until an epilogue revives some of the
concerns of the novel's first 300 pages. This is a pity, since within this
unsuccessfully integrated novel seem to be several more focused ones
struggling for a deserved attention.

CLOCKERS
by Richard Price
Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 599 pages
SAINT MUDD
by Steve Thayer
Viking Pounds 14.99, 383 pages
A RED DEATH
by Walter Mosley
Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99, 284 pages
IF YOU have a vision of a United States that is sinking into an underworld
of murder, drug-peddling and corruption from which it has only half-risen,
here are three texts to confirm your worst fears. Taken together, they would
do nicely as initial set works for a first-year course on the underclass.
Just keep them out of Eng. Lit.
Richard Price's Clockers takes us into the crumbling tenements of what might
be Jersey City, just across from Manhattan. Price is a top screenwriter (The
Colour of Money, Sea of Love) whose ability to move and hustle culminated in
the pre-publication sale of the rights to Clockers for a reported Pounds
1.9m. The book is too long, but there is little difficulty in following his
cinematic dialogue, once you have mastered the idiom. The title is the word
for the doomed children who retail drugs; another street word, one that
should be more widely used, is 'dis', meaning disrespect.
The central characters in Clockers are preoccupied with a need to protect
themselves against dis. Rodney, the Champ's middleman, has survived by being
both merciless and cunning. He is a well-drawn personality, not easily
forgettable. He will murder if he believes someone is dissing him.
Strike, the anguished youth who once nearly won a scholarship and a passport
out, is the corporal who works one of Rodney's street sites. Price enlists
your sympathies on behalf of Strike, but he does it without preaching.
Strike's every thought is recorded; his moves are those of a wild animal,
trapped in the slums, unable to use his moderate talents in a respectable
manner. Rocco, the middle-aged cop who gets it all wrong until the
denouement, longs for the world's approbation.
Clockers has merit as an eyewitness account of a great social tragedy. You
could twist its substance into a metaphor for the hard core of corporate
America. As a thriller, it is almost gripping. It should make a lucrative
screenplay. What it is not is a great novel. Too many characters drift in
and out to no apparent purpose. There are too many set-pieces, clearly
contrived. The obvious comparison is with Bonfire of the Vanities, which
told a not unconnected story from the wealthy side of Manhattan. Tom Wolfe
is an artist; Richard Price a flawed craftsman.
In Saint Mudd Steve Thayer sets out to do the same job on St Paul, Minnesota
in the 1930s. He tells us it was gangster city, its corruption exposed by a
brave newspaper columnist and an eventually courageous editor.
Like Richard Price, who haunted the streets he describes, and Walter Mosley,
who has plainly done his time in the archives, Thayer did much research for
this book. He even offers a set of historical notes at the end, including
the date of the death of the great madam, Nina Clifford, who ran St Paul's
most prominent brothel. You get the feeling that it is all pretty accurate,
without being overwhelmed by its verisimilitude.
A more cleverly crafted insight into life outside the American dream is A
Red Death, which is without pretension, short, and wholly satisfactory. It
is set in and around Watts county, the notorious part of Los Angeles. Walter
Mosley's first crime novel, Devil in a Blue Dress (recently re-issued by
Pan), was set in the Watts of the late 1940s; this one takes the hero, Easy
Rawlins, forward a few years.
Rawlins, who hides the fact that he is a small-time landlord, makes his way
in the overtly segregated world of pre-civil rights America. He duels with
the internal revenue service, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the
FBI, but solves the mystery and outsmarts them all in the end. As a bonus
you get a subliminal picture of how Watts must have been then for it to
become like it is now. This is the best of the trio. If you buy any of them,
get this one first.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: The message of Mellor - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By B A YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS hard luck on Brian Hayes, presenter of Radio 2's monthly scrutiny of
current affairs, Hayes over Britain, that the month's topic was Newspapers,
for the previous week Radio 4 had embarked on a four-part series, The
Message and the Media, on the same subject. Still, there was the David
Mellor case to hang arguments on. Half an hour or so was given to a broad
survey of the Press, comparing newspaper errors and newspaper ethics. Then
the experts were called in, Clive Soley, MP, who is to present a Private
Bill on the Press, and Stewart Steven, the new editor of the Evening
Standard, to instruct us - for the programme is basically a phone-in.
Phone-ins in broadcasting theory give each individual listener the feeling
that he or she might join in the broadcast if they wanted to.
The weakness lies in the questions, which are put by people interested but
not informed in their subjects, so there were sundry personal complaints,
and affirmations of private beliefs. Soley and Steven provided appropriate
comfort, or on general questions agreed that there were wicked as well as
good reporters, who should be sacked. A friendly programme, but I doubt if
listeners came away with many new ideas about the Press.
Exactly where jazz belongs is hard to say. Not on the dance-floor, alas.
Radio 3 has always given it some time, so has Radio 2, more acceptably to
me, as Humphrey Lyttelton has much the same preferences as I have. Radio 3
regards jazz as intellectual, and its new eight-week series Bright as Fire
(Tuesdays, repeated Thursdays) deals with Mike Westbrook as if he were a
classical composer.
In the first programme, much of the music we heard represented Westbrook's
musical influences - Ellington, Mulligan, Lyttelton - but what we heard of
his own, two extracts from Celebration, hardly showed their effects; indeed
were hardly jazz at all as I see it. Perhaps later on we shall hear more of
what he wrote when he was younger, for college gigs and Ronnie Scott's,
which should be less self-conscious.
What if . . ? (Radio 4, Tuesdays) envisages the results of possible events
that might but did not happen. This week, the legalisation of cannabis was
discussed by Griffith Edwards of the National Addiction Centre and Anthony
Henman of the International Anti-Prohibition League.
Professor Edwards made the strongest point at once, that marketing and
sponsorship would take over, pot would be advertised as cigarettes are.
Henman suggested that in time pot would be used less, and in ways other than
smoking. We then veered into talk of hard drugs, something presenter
Christopher Andrew ought to have checked.
For half an hour on Saturday evenings (repeated on Mondays), Radio 1 gives
Songlines - not about Australian aborigines but a modern equivalent of
old-time music-hall. A bunch of entertainers over a studio audience give
unrestrained comic song and comic chat in the intimate style of Collins's or
the Metropolitan in the Edgware Road. Half an hour at a time is about right,
and I enjoyed what I heard.
Stanza (Tuesdays, 11 pm) is like a Radio 4 Songlines, a group of poets under
presenter Andrew McAllister reading poetry and talking informally about
stuff such as sprung rhythm. I am afraid people who say that Sir John
Gielgud reads Shakespeare in 'a clapped-out elocutionary voice' are not for
me.
For duty's sake, I have heard some of the Olympics on Radio 5, where
commentators and athletes all know one another by their Christian names. I
have to say that, much as I hope we (not they) will win gold medals, I find
the personal ambition of the competitors distasteful, and the principles of
what we used to call 'sportsmanship' only modestly observed.

DARK MIRRORS: A NOVEL OF PROVENCE
by Gustaf Sobin
Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 152 pages
THE SINS OF THE MOTHERS
by Frank Delaney
HarperCollins Pounds 14.99, 509 pages
WE KNOW that the central figure of Dark Mirrors is doomed from the opening
line: 'On the last night of his life, Guy Fallows dreamt of pigeons.' The
dream, in a mistral, involves a dovecote, and the stonemason who restored it
about 40 years ago. The rest of the novel traces Fallows' involvement with
that same pigeonnier, and reveals the events that lead to his death.
The author, Gustaf Sobin, has lived in Provence for the last 30 years, and
has published one other novel, Venus Blue, and more than 30 volumes of
poetry. Dark Mirrors is poetic in just the right degree: the precision of
its prose, the unusual way the story is told, and the sparse details given
about its central characters combine to suggest multiple layers of meaning.
There are parallels between the novel that Guy Fallows is writing about the
pigeonnier and the reconstruction work carried out on it years before by
Guido Stampelli. He had an obsessive affair with the woman who owned it,
just as Fallows is involved in a differently obsessive erotic affair with
the owner's daughter. One affair relies for its continuance on an unfinished
dovecote, the other on an unfinished novel, 'stone by stone, syllable by
syllable.'
There are many other resonances, but they never intrude on a thoroughly
convincing story. It helps that Fallows is also concerned with everyday
matters such as good meals, without which no Provenccal novel would be
complete, teenagers, of whom he seems to have a remarkable understanding,
and alcohol: his ex-wife died of it, and he is a heavy drinker himself. Add
to this an authentic account of the local community, and Sobin's concise
evocations of the scents and sights of the Luberon, and one has the perfect
antidote to the ersatz Provence pedelled by Peter Mayle.
The Sins of the Mothers, set in provincial Ireland in 1925, tells the tale
of the new schoolmistress, Ellen, an outsider from the city, and her
marriage to the village schoolmaster, Thomas, a gunman hero of the
'Troubles' and now a pillar of the community. The marriage gets off to a
good start but is soon threatened by Ellen's inability to trust her own
instincts in matters sexual, and her blind obedience to her Jesuit
confessor. Neither is the local parish priest quite what he seems, and she
has also to cope with uncertainties about Thomas's past.
This could have made an interesting short novel but the gold-embossed jacket
and its 509 pages suggest that the publishers were aiming at a Bragg-Binchy
blockbuster leading to a TV mini-series, and, sure enough, the proceedings
are enlivened by a shooting, a hero in coma for months, and a
near-miraculous recovery, thanks to the selfless devotion of his wife,
Ellen.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Arts: Fuller's law of film-making - Nigel Andrews meets a
legendary American film director / Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN PARIS there is an advanced college for education in narrative film. It is
called Sam Fuller's flat and it is tucked away near Les Halles. The only
degree you need to get in is a degree of nerve. The 80-year-old director
barks discouragement over the phone and is not noticeably gentler when you
arrive armed with a box of his favourite Romeo Y Julieta cigars.
Once there, though, you receive an earful about how films should be made:
which is synonymous with how they used to be made in Fuller's day, the 1940s
and 50s. America's most famous independent low-budget film-maker specialised
in slam-bang classics like The Steel Helmet, Run Of The Arrow and Shock
Corridor. Venerated today for their visceral power, they have given Fuller a
passport to every film festival in the world; plus encomia like that in
David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of The Cinema: 'No other American
director has described American experience with such unremitting and
participatory relish for its competitive corruption.'
Though not always B-movies - many topped the bill - the films were made on a
wing, a prayer and a tiny budget, usually in locations far from the studio's
nannyish eye. For the 1955 House Of Bamboo, for example, the first big US
movie shot in postwar Japan, Fuller used real bombs and bullets.
"Oh-h-h YES]' - Fuller's eyes take on a tigerish blaze when I quiz him about
this. 'In America, you unnerstand, you weren't allowed to use real
explosives. But when I heard we could use them in Japan, A-A-A-HHH]' Fuller
recounts the scene where his stars ran an explosion-dodging gauntlet. 'I
asked, what does the range have to be for them to be safe from shrapnel? I
was told 65 yards, so we kept to that. More or less. But it was a dangerous
run.'
Daring was one of Fuller's gifts to cinema. The other, a product of his
pre-movie apprenticeships as a crime reporter and wartime marine, was his
ability to see through smoke screens of hypocrisy and attitudinising to the
core of a dramatic action. A film like Pickup On South Street (1953) is
still shocking today because there is no scrim of piety. Hero Richard
Widmark is a petty crook who spits on patriotism and refuses to surrender an
accidentally stolen Communist microfilm. But he sees right from wrong more
clearly than the Establishment bigwigs who bear down on him, much as their
real-life cousins bore down on Fuller.
'J. Edgar Hoover came to Fox when we were making Pickup and he said to
Zanuck, 'Look, Darryl, we don't like this line where the hero says, Don't
wave that goddam flag at me.' And Zanuck said, 'You're right' and he turned
to me and said, 'Just have him say, Don't wave that flag.' And Hoover was
furious. He said, 'You know I don't mean that Darryl. I don't want him to
say anything unpatriotic about the American flag.' So Zanuck said, 'That's
his character in the film. Sam wrote the story, he knows the people he put
in it. Are you guys out to censor character now?''
'Now' was the McCarthy era and they were. In the early 1950s film-makers
with even faintly Leftward leanings were pushed off the payroll. Fuller
survived because he was never identifiably either left-wing or right-wing.
He was a non-denominational enfant terrible whose moral outlook even today
has a terrifying simplicity.
Listen to his account of how he and fellow soldiers dealt with enemy
confrontations in the war: you discern in embryo the no-nonsense ethics of
Fuller's cinema. 'In war you're not supposed to shoot a POW, but we had a
rule. If an enemy surrendered to us while he still had bullets in his gun,
we took him in. But if he put his hands up after emptying his gun and
killing your friends, we'd shoot him. Because, gee, isn't that cute? He's
out of bullets and now he wants to make peace with us?'
Slap-in-the-face morality vitalises Fuller's films. The cinema's answer to
primitive man, he shocks us into thinking again. Whom should we root for in
House Of Bamboo - the patriotic CIA informer (Stack) or the ex-army rebel
who makes his own moral code (Robert Ryan)? Or in Pickup On South Street -
the crook or the government cabal? 'In most movies,' insists Fuller,
'there's too much good guy/bad guy stuff. Doesn't interest me. Are you
telling me the politician is more honest than the pickpocket? Or that the
businessman who's cheating a little on his expenses is less crooked than the
thief?
'We are so unimaginative that we have to have labels for everything. But
when I was a crime reporter, what I learned was that the criminal has his
own creed. Everything he does is right by the light of the life he has
chosen. And only another criminal will understand that creed and code.'
Likewise, it takes a special kind of sympathetic heretic to understand
Fuller's inspired delinquencies of style: the soaring crane shots, the
whirlwind montage sequences. No wonder today's gifted-loner directors like
Wim Wenders or Aki Kaurismaki give Fuller guest roles in their movies. The
walnut-faced veteran with the rasping voice has played cameos in The
American Friend, The State Of Things and La Vie De Boheme.
Fuller thrived in an age when independent directors were true heroes. He did
his own thing regardless of prevailing caveats, whether related to moral
shibboleths or new screen systems. 'When CinemaScope came in - 1953 with The
Robe - the theatre owners got into a panic because they said there was no
movement. With a screen that wide you can't move the camera too often. So
they felt it was like watching a filmed play.
'But when we say 'movies', the movement isn't in the camera, it's in the
characters. When two people lean towards each other to kiss, that's
movement] You look at Brief Encounter - phenomenal] The violence there isn't
John Wayne shooting up Indians in Monument Valley. It's the terrible flavour
of guilt in two people being afraid to touch each other's hands.'
For Fuller, cinema's elasticity of scope, encompassing the miniaturist and
the majestic, makes it unique. 'It's number one in the arts. Hundreds of
thousands of years from now they'll still be making movies. They'll be
showing them to more people and more planets. It's the universal language.
If I want to show Goya in action, or Liszt, or General Patton, I will see it
and hear it and dramatise it on film. It's the only art form in the world in
which all arts and all life are up there on the screen.'
There will be a tribute to Sam Fuller at this month's Edinburgh Festival.

GERMAN RESISTANCE AGAINST HITLER
by Klemens von Klemperer
Oxford Pounds 40, 587 pages
THE UNNECESSARY WAR
by Patricia Meehan
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 18.99, 441 pages
KLEMENS von Klemperer has produced a superbly-researched study of the
attempts of the German resistance to find allies abroad before and during
the Second World War. It is the product of prodigious work in the archives
of many nations, and of interviews with the families and contacts of the
main protagonists.
The focus is very much on the conservative opposition to Hitler: men such as
Goerdeler, von Moltke, von Trott, Bonhoeffer and other resistors in the
army, foreign office and churches. Little is said about the workers'
resistance or the 'resistance in exile' except where the paths of the
conservatives crossed these other opponents of the regime.
It is a book which fully deserves a place alongside Peter Hoffman's
still-important The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945 (1979). As
the respected historian of German pre-war conservatism, the author brings to
his task a deep understanding of the courage and vision, but also the
weaknesses and limitations, of the conservative Widerstand - a term that
carries a very special meaning within the German context. Von Klemperer's
feelings about the failure of the Allies to respond to the appeals of the
resistance give this book its central thesis, but does so without
compromising its historical purpose.
There was no unified or mass resistance movement in Germany. The burden of
opposition fell on individuals, men and women relying on their consciences,
reinforced through friendships and contacts with other like-minded people.
The patriotic rebels carried a difficult inheritance. Most, especially those
of the older generation, were shaped by the ideas of their country's
Bismarckian and imperial past. Few had been supporters of Weimar and many
had shared Hitler's expansionist goals.
No British government could have accepted the hegemonial claims of this
older opposition generation, but even the younger activists took time to
free themselves of older ideas and assumptions. It was only in 1943 that
Adam von Trott - whose anti-Nazi role von Klemperer fully and convincingly
vindicates in a most balanced assessment of this key figure's controversial
wartime career - began to retreat on the question of Germany's territorial
claims in the east.
It is a tribute to the author's professionalism that he never waivers from
his intention to explain what happened and not what should have happened.
This is a study in failure. The resistors, many in positions of considerable
influence, could not stiffen the British back before the war. Their
attempts, during the 'phoney war,' to arrange the conditions for a coup and
the terms of a post-Nazi territorial settlement came to naught. Their
ceaseless efforts to press their case for Allied recognition of the 'other
Germany' ended in the unsuccessful attempt on Hitler's life in 1944, a
desperate move intended to show that the resistors could take decisive
steps.
One can praise this book highly without agreeing with its conclusions. Much
of the writer's material shows why the British and Americans were chary
about collaborating with representatives of the German opposition. The
ambiguities in their positions, the absence of coherent plans and, above
all, the lack of mass support would have precluded any deal even if the
conspirators had found more persuasive Allied backers.
This study does not prove that the resistors, with some exceptions, really
grasped what had happened in Germany. Even Goerdeler's 1944 paper pointing
to 'a union of all European national states' shows the degree to which the
pre-war conditioning of the old elites persisted. The responsibility of the
western powers for the war can hardly be compared, pace Alan Taylor, with
the 'unscrupulous policies' of the German dictatorship.
Von Klemperer feels that 'unconditional surrender' was a catastrophic war
aim and that the Allies' policy of 'absolute silence' was not only a
personal disaster for the resistors but a costly error of judgment that
prolonged the conflict. Would stronger Allied support have facilitated a
coup before July 1944 and shortened the war? Any answer must be based on
conjecture, but the possibility of success was not high and the kind of
Germany that might have emerged if the war had not been pursued raises
uncomfortable questions.
Patricia Meeham's account should have complemented von Klemperer's study.
She has used UK cabinet and Foreign Office papers to condemn the
indifference of the British authorities in the face of the efforts of the
anti-Nazi opposition. Even allowing for the more general audience for which
this book was written, it cannot compare with the von Klemperer volume,
either in coverage or in depth of insight.
Meeham pays little attention to the reasons why there might have been honest
doubts in London about the German opposition. She repeatedly uses too broad
a brush-stroke in painting the Whitehall scene, ignoring the divisions in
the cabinet after Godesberg.
Such qualifications do not apply to the last chapter of this book and the
post-war Foreign Office attempt to bury the role of the German opposition.
There is no defence for the individual and institutional attempt to
discredit the few who should have been honoured. Even the usually
magnanimous von Klemperer singles out Vansittart for the sharpest
condemnation. What can be said to justify Wheeler-Bennett's comment on the
consequences of the July plot: 'The Gestapo and the SS have done us an
appreciable service in removing a selection of those who would undoubtedly
have posed as 'good Germans' after the war . . ?' No one will doubt, after
reading these two books, that the Foreign Office's effort to suppress the
truth has failed totally.

HARPOLE AND FOXBERROW, GENERAL PUBLISHERS
by J. L. Carr
Quince Tree Press (27 Mill Dale Road, Kettering) pounds 4.95 157 pages
A FORMER Guardian fiction prize-winner (in 1980, for A Month in the Country)
and twice short-listed for the Booker prize (for the same novel and for The
Battle of Pollocks Crossing), JL Carr has solved the problem of dealing with
publishers. Trust your own judgment, ditch them - and publish your own work.
Carr's publishing enterprise, the Quince Tree Press, has been going since
the early 1960s. Now, Carr has brought out his eighth novel, Harpole and
Foxberrow, in the form he calls 'half-hardback.' It is printed with love and
care, with beautiful woodcut illustrations on high-quality paper and at an
affordable price - features which, he feels, most other publishers are
unable to do or are not interested in producing. It is another very funny,
bitter and nostalgic novel. If there can be a successor to Evelyn Waugh,
with a liberal dose of JR Ackerley, Carr might be it.
He is now 80. Averaging one novel a decade might seem slow work. On the
other hand, his first - A Day in Summer - was published in 1963 when he was
already 51. He spent most of his adult working life as a primary school
teacher, living for the past 40 years in the same house in Kettering,
Northamptonshire. He took early retirement in 1967 to see, as he puts it,
'whether I could make a living out of writing.' He could; just about.
His novels have acquired a cultish following but have never quite broken the
barrier into wider reader awareness; that is a castigation of general taste
rather than a condemnation of the writing. Carr has some staunch admirers.
The former education secretary, Kenneth Baker, adores The Harpole Report
(1972), an hilarious novel in journal and letter form about a new school
headmaster whose staff and children all seem in conspiracy against him.
Carr also has had some extra-literary acclaim. A Month in the Country was
turned into a successful feature film, and A Day in Summer into a television
film. And a version of Carr's previous novel - What Hettie Did (1988),
featuring a precocious 18-year-old schoolgirl who reveres Robert Browning -
was first broadcast by the BBC in 1989. But he has some well-known
detractors. One leading British sports journalist, Brian Glanville, was
quoted in the Sunday Times in 1988 as saying: 'I find all of Carr's writing
monumentally arid.' In particular, Glanville reviled Carr's 1975 novel, How
Steeple Sinderby Wanderers Won the FA Cup, a mock-epic depiction of a
village football team's rise to the top. Even Glanville has his aberrations.
His successes have not, however, taken Carr into the kind of general public
awareness enjoyed by, for instance, Margaret Drabble or Kingsley Amis. Part
of the explanation is that Carr's writing is a literary misfit. His novels
defy simple classification. They do not move in a single direction. Often,
they are comic. But they also probe human weakness with a singularly mordant
eye.
Carr's start in life (failing the 11-plus examination twice, Victorian
working class parents who left school at 12) was not auspicious. But they
paid nine guineas a year to send him to Castleford secondary school. 'It was
run quite anarchically - no caning, prizes or prefects; it suited me
perfectly,' says Carr. There, he discovered a love of reading, particularly
Conrad and Browning. Carr took to teaching as a way to earn a secure living.
But he always had a conscious determination to break his career eventually
and do something else. Before retiring, he had dipped a toe into publishing.
'1964 was the 100th anniversary of John Clare's death. I was honorary editor
of a teachers' magazine, and I thought it would be a nice idea to put a
16-page selection of his poetry in the magazine as a free gift.' It was
successful.
When he was 55, he 'asked for two years of unpaid leave of absence to do
research. No one asked me 'what research?' But it was just to see if I could
make a living without teaching.' With Pounds 1,600 saved, he started a small
publishing house. It grew to a 100-strong selection of chapbooks, retailing
for about 50p each, on a wide range of topics and poets. The Dictionary of
English Cricketers is 'a big seller; it will carry on long after I've gone.'
That basis, plus some income from his already-published novels, enabled him
to take a cautious leap into the unknown and publish What Hettie Did.
But why turn away from large, established publishers? Scruples, taste, and
not wishing to cheat readers. Somewhat old-fashioned virtues, rather like
his novels. Carr showed me a couple of early paperback versions of those.
One, The Harpole Report, has a front cover showing a scantily-clad woman
draped across a flustered-looking male teacher wearing academic gown and
mortarboard. A front cover more remote from the book's contents could hardly
be imagined. Publishers have 'got it into their head that blood and sex are
what sells,' says Carr.
In his writing, Carr always has tried to please himself first and hope that
others would be pleased, too. With What Hettie Did, he wrote from the point
of view of a schoolgirl, just for the challenge of seeing if he could do it.
'When I was a boy, one of my favourite occupations was walking along the
tops of fences. Fear of falling off always had a certain charm for me.
'What kept me writing books was trying to do something difficult. For
instance, writing as an 18-year-old intellectual girl - would it be possible
for an old man? Of course, you stack the cards in your favour, you couldn't
write about a moron who listened to Radio 2 all day long . . .'
In Harpole and Foxberrow, two characters from The Harpole Report re-appear
and take over a small, unsuccessful publisher. One of their authors, Edwin
Shutlanger, a schoolteacher, re-writes the Bible in contemporary mores, is
interviewed on television, and becomes an overnight hit. A backlash sets in
against him and he is sacked for the turmoil he causes. Unperturbed,
Shutlanger opens his own school, promising: 'New educational theories
unwelcome.' He is inundated with applicants but turns down anyone he decides
is a 'consumer' rather than a 'person.' Harpole asks how he will tell the
difference. 'Simple] If he whines for what everyone else has, he's a
consumer. If he insists on something different, he's a person.'
JL Carr is a person - definitely not a writer of consumer goods.

new biography of Robert Bridges

ROBERT BRIDGES: A BIOGRAPHY
by Catherine Phillips
Oxford Pounds 25, 363 pages
LARKIN gave Bridges five entries in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century
English Verse and that seems about right compared (say) with Yeats's 20. 'A
Passery-By' and 'April 1885' show Bridges at his solemnly rhetorical best;
the much anthologised 'London Snow' reveals his skill at delineating
landscape and in matching sound to sense; and 'Poor Poll' his humorous
virtuosity with the long syllabic line, incorporating sentences in Latin,
Greek, German, Italian and French into its texture.
Then Larkin ends with 'Ethick,' part of the final section of The Testament
of Beauty containing Bridges' thoughts on prayer. That poem in four parts -
an extended paean as much to Reason as to Beauty, published in 1929 - was
Bridges' swan-song. By then, he was a vigorous 85-year-old poet laureate,
awarded the OM by King George V to whom the Testament is dedicated.
Its sales took the Clarendon Press at Oxford by surprise. They originally
printed around 2,000 copies, but 19,000 had been sold by January 1930 and it
went through edition after edition until the mid-1940s. It went out of
fashion as Eliot's Four Quartets, a similar kind of poem, came in.
The face Bridges presents to us in his work, and in the photographs
contained in this biography, is that of a Georgian man of letters par
excellence. He belonged to the last generation of poets before modernism
took over and subversion of the social order through literary work became
the norm. In Bridges, we have a supreme example of the writer, not as any
kind of rebel, but as a respectable member of society helping to prop up its
foundations.
Bridges combined this with deep concern for the purity of the English tongue
and a zeal to reform our language's illogical spelling. That campaign, which
involved the Oxford Press trotting out several new typographical symbols in
order to print his Society for Pure English pamphlets in his private
alphabet, came to nought.
Ezra Pound, who was a contemporary, admired one or two of Bridges' lyrics.
The two men met and Bridges - of whose charm of manner Catherine Philips
gives examples - went through Pound's Personae and Exultations helpfully,
commenting on the style.
Afterwards, though, Pound could not resist putting in the boot. 'I spose,'
he wrote in a note to TS Eliot, 'I can cite what I once said of Britches? I
managed to dig about 10 lines of Worse Libre out of one of his leetle
bookies.'
It is characteristic Poundage: highly amusing and grossly unfair. Bridges
was not a particular champion of vers libre and his 'leetle bookies' are
full of examples of a consummate use of rhyme and other meticulously
executed metrical forms. As a poet, Bridges was not in the least complacent;
he experimented continually, at one stage taking classical prosody as his
model.
Beginning in 1912, Bridges' reign as poet laureate was long and prestigious,
but he has had bad luck since. He is remembered by the literary world not as
a poet in his own right but as the friend and literary executor of Hopkins,
especially as the individual responsible for preventing Hopkins' work from
seeing the light of day fully until the end of the First World War.
Many years after Hopkins' death. Bridges wrote to Hopkins' mother and
explained that it was because he himself was trying to write poems in sprung
rhythm that he did not wish the poetry-reading public to have - for the
present, at any rate - the confusing example of Hopkins' eccentric use of
it.
Was Bridges merely being self-seeking in this most controversial decision of
his life? Bridges' latest biographer has a foot in both camps, being also
the editor of the Oxford Authors' edition of Hopkins and of his selected
letters. Phillips suggests, somewhat tentatively, that it was more a case of
Bridges being naive and perhaps a little arrogant than of anything else.
Bridges admired the work of his old Oxford contemporary and friend but,
having rescued it from the Jesuits, did not see just what a poetic bombshell
he was sitting on. It was only after the great success of Bridges' wartime
anthology The Spirit of Man (1916) - a fascinating insight into Bridges'
eclectic taste in literature and philosophy, in which he published some of
Hopkins' poems alongside Rimbaud's - that he felt the time was ripe for an
edition of them.
Phillips does not allow the relations with Hopkins to take up a
disproportionate share of this carefully written life. She traces Bridges'
early years - after his education at Eton and Oxford - as a doctor,
including a spell in the casualty department at a top London hospital. There
followed his happy marriage to Monica, daughter of Alfred Waterhouse, the
architect.
Bridges met his wife through living on Waterhouse's estate at Yattendon,
near Newbury. After that came Bridges' decision to give up medicine and
become a full-time poet and essayist. Like Maugham's similar decision, it
eventually paid off.
When Waterhouse died, the couple used some of their inheritance to build a
permanent home they called Chilswell on Boar's Hill. Once they were
established there (surviving a disastrous fire), Oxford welcomed Bridges
back into the academic and musical fold with honorary fellowships, recitals
and dining rights. Bridges' early friendships with late Victorians like
Henry Newbolt, Digby Mackworth Dolben and Canon Richard Watson Dixon are
balanced at the other end of the scale by his exchanges with Bloomsberries
like EM Forster and Clive Bell.
Let us leave him entertaining Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley and Ottoline
Morrell on Boar's Hill. Woolf writes that Bridges 'sprang from a
rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man with a curly grey hat and a
reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very
active, rather hoarse, talking incessantly.' This book serves him well in
the quiet, painstaking, scholarly way he would, surely, have appreciated.

BIOGRAPHY OF A BUICK
by Bill Morris
Granta Books Pounds 8.99, 337 pages
SNAP question: What do you know about David Dunbar Buick? Not a great deal?
You didn't know that he perfected a process for enamelling cast-iron
bathtubs that broke a German monopoly? Or that, by the turn of the century,
this ingenious tinkerer had become fascinated by the internal combustion
engine? Produced his first car in 1904, and called it a Buick? Sold out to
General Motors? Speculated in oil? Ran out of luck? Died penniless in 1929?
Do not worry. You cannot know everything. But perhaps you like fiction? A
well-researched read? Pacily-pitched action? Snip-snappy dialogue?
Enthusiastic sex?
Then journey not on your holiday without picking up Biography of a Buick, a
volume full of zest and zing that can serve as a blessed counterweight to
the posh literary novels that we all pick up in airports and profoundly wish
we hadn't.
Author Bill Morris is a columnist on the Greensboro News and Record. He is
also a Buick fanatic. He bought his first Buick in 1975. Parts of her
survive in a made-up 1954 Buick Special, the colour of lipstick and
anthracite, that he loves with great joy.
This is not an industrial novel. Instead, it concentrates on goings-on
within the Buick division of General Motors in the single year of 1954. What
a year that was. Inflation was low and employment high. Everyone was making
money. Marilyn married Di Maggio. A small hamburger joint was franchised by
the McDonald twins. Jack Kerouac was writing a book about a car ride. A
white boy was starting to sing like a black man. Ike and Mamie were in the
White House. And there was something called the H-bomb materialising from
the folds of space-time to strike a horror-note.
It was also the year that Buick production in Detroit hit 500,000 cars a
year. In the design department at GM, however, something was badly wrong.
The bumper of the new, rival Plymouth was a virtual replica of the Buick
Century's. Somehow, Plymouth had pirated Buick's design work. Was there a
traitor in the camp?
In Detroit in 1954, the rapaciousness of cutting-edge capitalism was
rampant. Cars were sexy. Money was sexy. Sex was sexy. Everyone was grabbing
some.
With enviable skill and energy, Bill Morris shows us what it was like on the
inside of the automobile industry in its raunchiest era.
But the success of his novel lies equally in its numerous sub-plots and his
marshalling of an exotic parade of characters from way beyond Detroit. A
good example is Elvis - 'shifty-eyed and suspicious. White trash all the way
. . . bad skin, bad diet, loud clothes, wild hair, good manners masking
inferiority and resentment.' What do you play? Elvis is asked. 'A little
git-tar. Mostly I sing.' Whom do you sound like? 'I don't sound like anyone
you ever heard before.'
If you have felt, this August, like giving the Booker crowd a shove -
Bloomsbury, too: all those boring, dead folk - you could do far worse than
Biography of a Buick.

THE MIRROR AND THE GLOBE
by Felix Pryor
Handsaw Pounds 38, 253 pages
ANYONE thinking that 'Hawks and Handsaws' is an abstruse coinage belonging
to the Weekend FT please refer to Hamlet II/ii for the line: 'I am but mad
north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.'
Then try the commentaries on this 'pregnant quibble' of Hamlet's. Some say
Hamlet is talking fowl: for handsaw read "hernshaw,' which means a heron.
Others say Hamlet is talking tools, in which case a hawk is deemed to be a
plasterer's mortar board. Either way, Hamlet is reckoned to be warning his
hearers (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) that he knows what is what.
Glossing Hamlet's expression like this assumes that he is making sense. The
commentators are reluctant to take it as a splinter of gibberish in such a
monumental play. But now, Felix Pryor has come up with a new and more
sophisticated reading, which goes like this.
Just across the river Thames from Shakespeare's Globe, there was a theatre
in the cathedral precincts of St Paul's. A troupe of child actors performed
there, known as the Paul's Boys. One of the playwrights attached to the
juvenile company was John Marston, best known (if at all) for his
tragi-comedy The Malcontent. Marston specialised in fabricating lurid
language and - appropriately - puerile innuendoes. He produced some spoofs
of Shakespeare for his lads: the Bard responded with his own send-ups of
Marston's grotesque diction and the ham acting of the Paul's Boys.
Hence the hawk: Shakespeare's own emblem. And the handsaw? Possibly a sneer
at the zig-zig motif on Marston's coat of arms or, more likely, a jibe at
the ludicrous sawing gestures made by boy actors unsure what to do with
their hands on stage. North-north-west? Well: from the site of the Globe, St
Paul's is (you've guessed) due NNW . . .
As an exercise in ingenious glossary, I like this. We know about these
erstwhile choirboys at St Paul's: Ben Jonson described them as 'rascally
tits.' They may well be the baby hawks ('little eyases') who come to play at
Hamlet's Elsinore. There may be more satire of Marston in Hamlet: the
trouble is that Shakespeare out-Marstons Marston so adroitly that we
struggle to recognise the force such satire might once have had.
Pryor's investigation explores the many possibilities. If there is a fault
to his speculations, it is that he makes Shakespeare take the rivalry too
seriously. Certainly, this book does nothing to raise one's opinion of
Marston. He was hardly a rival of Shakespeare: more a bothersome gnat.
Marston's subsequent obsession with Hamlet is not explored by Pryor.
Mediocrity is allowed to drift wittingly into oblivion. So, the Bard is
performed in Azerbaijani and Marston remains for literary specialists.
Books of this sort are always vulnerable to the scepticism of scholars and
the indifference of a wider reading public. But this is an engaging example
of its genre, reflecting nicely the contest between poets and poetasters for
domination of the late Elizabethan theatres. It deserves to be priced more
attractively.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Gardening: Clipped into proper shape - Topiary is undergoing
a revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE visiting gardens recently, I have seen some remarkable examples of
topiary, the art of training and clipping plants into all manner of
artificial shapes. It is an ancient art, used in classical times; and, from
the amount I have seen in gardens this year, it is enjoying a period of
popularity.
There are many ways of approaching the art, one being to buy young specimens
in nurseries or garden centres and continue to clip them according to the
shape, simple or fanciful, which they have been given already. These
ready-made specimens usually will be fairly simple columns, cones or balls,
or perhaps twisted stems with a ball on top, a form that once was highly
popular. Peacocks are still in fashion and can sometimes be bought
ready-made, and so can some stranger creatures.
A catalogue arrived the other day offering wire frames on which topiary
could be trained, either in large pots or other containers or in the open
ground. These frames all were comparatively small, the largest being a
simple cone (it was called an obelisk in the catalogue but cone would seem
to be a more accurate description) 22 in high by 12 1/2 in wide which, when
clothed fully with plant growth, would be about double these dimensions.
Other more fanciful shapes were a lyre, a guitar, and playing-card shapes of
spades, diamonds, hearts and clubs.
In the garden of Schute House near Shaftesbury, Dorset, the owners had made
their own frames on a very much larger and more substantial scale. Several
were about 6 ft high and 4 ft through, shaped like a pawn made for a giant
chess board and each containing several small yew trees which might be
expected to fill them in two to three years.
Yew is one of the best shrubs for topiary because it is fully hardy and
stands clipping well. It has small leaves and a densely-branched habit which
makes it possible to cut quite small detail in it. There are both green and
golden-leaved varieties. Box is also good, for similar reasons, but is less
strong in growth than yew.
In this same garden, there also was one other frame and plant which must
surely have been for an experimental specimen of topiary. The frame,
apparently made of aluminium, was a narrow cone fully 15 ft high and about 5
ft wide at the base. The plant growing in it was a dawn redwood, or
mettasequoia, the very ancient species of conifer which was known only as a
fossil until the early 1940s when it was discovered growing wild in China.
It has finely-divided leaves, very much like those of the swamp cypress
(taxodium), but it grows much faster than that tree - as much as 4 ft a year
when young - and I would expect the plant in the conical frame to cover it
in three to four years. What is problematical is how it will behave after
that. It has a naturally loose habit, totally different from yew, and I have
never seen it clipped. It also loses its leaves in autumn, but they hang on
late and the new leaves come early.
If the experiment comes off and the cone is covered with light green, ferny
foliage, turning yellow in autumn, it will be a remarkable feat of
topiary-making.
Another garden with topiary that I saw recently is Hillbarn House, Great
Bedwyn, Wiltshire. Here, it has all been made on site by the owner, AJ
Buchanan, who has become expert at all kinds of tree and shrub clipping and
training. I have known this garden for some years and, each time I visit it,
there are several new specimens.
As far as I am aware, Buchanan does not rely on frames for most of his
training, but I suppose the occasional support is used to get a peacock's
tail or a dog's legs into exactly the right position. It is the variety and
originality that give special delight at Hillbarn - the topiary includes
chairs, dogs, teddy bears, and a variety of abstract shapes.
Some years ago, Buchanan told me he was expecting a visit from a Chinese
friend and, in honour of him, had made the first cuts for a Chinese dragon,
This has now grown into a formidable monster. And he has a pair of poodles.
They started life as a single dog, but it looked lonely so he gave it a
mate.
On my last visit, I found two teddy bears that were even more amusing. Each
apparently was sitting in the middle of a large garden seat. When I examined
them to discover how this illusion had been created, I found that each bear,
cut in box, had been planted in a container of just the right height to
bring it level with the seat, and that a hole had been cut in the seat to
fit the container exactly. One of the bears was wearing a red bow tie.
Humour is much in evidence in this garden, and so is good design.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Gardening: Breaking rules to baroque effect - Robin Lane Fox
argues the case for a forest fit for giants alongside the dwarfs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENS are still on fast-forward. As we enter August, flowers are already
shaping up for September. Acceleration exposes weakness. In my gardening,
the weak spot is late summer height.
Most nurserymen do not make the problem easier. They assume we all have
smallish gardens and therefore we need smallish plants.
Height is not dependent on length or width. An old rule in gardening-books
says that it is and that the tallest plants in a border should be no more
than twice the height of the bed's width. Like most old rules, it needs to
be broken. The contrast between great height and surrounding flatness has a
bold baroque quality which is all the better for breaking rules.
Notoriously, modern breeders are even less help because they breed for
dwarfs. I cannot think of a plant bred for height as a virtue: on trial
grounds, the virtues of compactness and mounded shape are always emphasised.
It has now become a struggle to find decent plants of the tall milk-blue
Campanula lactiflora, which is such a mainstay at five feet in early July.
Symptomatically, suppliers have replaced it with a shorter, dull variation
and named it Pouffe. Anchusas have shrunk and delphiniums have been named
after pygmies. There may or may not be fairies at the bottom of your garden,
but at the back of it there are unlikely to be giants.
Academic life requires me to find them. One of my jobs is the slow reshaping
of two long borders in my Oxford college, where the soil is very dry against
the old city wall. In August, its main season is over, but interest has to
flicker on among the deadheads. A few answers are emerging, among several
characteristic failures: the answers could apply to any garden, however
small.
The most successful is so obvious that we might forget it: in a tight
corner, go for Hollyhocks, to a height of 10 feet. Breeders have reduced
them, too, but nobody dares to eliminate the giants. They look particularly
dramatic, if you limit their colours to dark maroon-purple and white by
buying named plants in these colours during the spring. They look less
dramatic if you make my mistake and leave the choice to the nurseryman who
sells you indiscriminate pinks and reds. Hollyhocks refute old rules because
their roots go strongly downwards and their lower stems do not require a
great width of flower-bed. Most of their growers know better than to expect
any fresh lower leaves on their plants, anyway. They recognise that
Hollyhocks are victims to the unstoppable disease of rust. They flower well
above its ravages and so I have devised a remedy. In borders, I recommend
hiding their lower stems behind groups of tall Michaelmas daisies, which are
growing healthily with dark-green leaves just as the Hollyhocks' legs are
corroding. There is no point in planting the better-known forms of
Michaelmas daisy, which are usually novi-belgii hybrids. Most are prone to
awful mildew. The lesser-known novae-angliae forms resist disease and are a
better buy.
Height often entails coarse leaves, one reason why we have scrapped our big
Buddleias and given up the thistly Echinops with its big heads, like a
hedgehog's drumstick, in pale violet or white. For elegance, the old plume
poppy, or Macleaya, is a much better bet. The grey leaves are like the ace
of clubs: most of us buy microcarpa, although other forms are possibly
better. The roots run quite widely, and, after two years, the plant is six
feet high. I suppose I should not be surprised to find plants selling for
Pounds 5 each in garden centres in London.
On less familiar ground, I have high hopes of a pale yellow daisy called
Helianthus Lemon Queen. It reaches six feet; it needs no staking; the
flowers really are a pale yellow and a decent size and the plant can be
multiplied easily from summer cuttings. We have packed it in the back row
beside the white spikes of the excellent Veronicastrum, as botanists have
renamed Veronica virginica. This slender plant reaches six feet above
purplish foliage and the white form is charming.
If the soil is not too dry, the options are much wider. In the half-shade of
a town garden, my first choice for emphasis in August would be one of the
Cimicifugas, those plants with tall stems and flowers like white bottle
brushes. The best is a new one called ramosa Brunette, which has very dark
leaves without being sombre. Brunette will cost you an arm and a leg until
it has been more widely propagated, but it is worth the expense because the
contrast of flower and leaf is so good. At even greater height, you might
also try late-flowering clematis trained up tripods of tall bamboo canes.
Grand gardens exploit this trick, but two or three wigwams would lift the
sides of any small garden into a new class in late summer. The long canes
need only be added above a lower frame in July. That method avoids a bare
wigwam of tall stakes in May behind the lupins.
My favourite giant is none of these good plants, and, if I could torture it
for another foot in height, it would be ideal. So many new red crocosmias
have been bred or revived that we have even forgotten the days when we knew
them all as montbretias. Most of us have forgotten the older variety which
nurserymen used to list as a curtonus. It grows five feet high and its fans
of fresh green leaves send up sprays of vivid red flowers, which last for
weeks. It is too good for botanists to leave it in peace: recently, they
have renamed it Crocosmia paniculata, which will probably confuse everybody
for another 10 years. Resist the confusion, because this old variety is
spectacular near the back of any bed: it is a giant among the newer pygmies
and it has not been tamed merely by changing its names.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Property: Second homes: enjoyment or investment? - Just what
do you want out of a second property? asks Audrey Powell.  And will they
keep their value?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS IT worth buying a second home abroad? With so many prices reduced or
negotiable, would it prove an investment as well as a holiday home?
The advice of people long in the business is, get a holiday home for
enjoyment, but not for what capital you hope to make out of it. If, like
early buyers, you do well on a rising market, fine. Of course, those who
purchased at high prices and cannot find buyers now that they need to sell,
see things differently.
Even so, there may be other investment aspects to homes bought for leisure
use.
At Port Grimaud, in the south of France, some have been purchasing canalside
houses simply for the benefit of the moorings that go with them. Moorings
for boats of more than 40 ft have become so difficult to find in that area
that Nicholas Beuttler, who handles marketing, has been negotiating with a
German prepared to pay Pounds 380,000 for a house. The buyer is not
interested in the house. He simply wants its mooring.
There is a selection of new waterside properties available in Port Grimaud
(tel: 94.56.21.82 or, in the UK 0243-572001). Typically a one-bedroom
apartment with mooring is Pounds 148,000; a two-bedroom house with mooring,
Pounds 290,000.
Last year Port Grimaud sold 50 new apartments and houses. 'Not as good as
two years ago but very good in current circumstances,' says Beuttler.
Buyers who purchased the first 'fishermen's houses' on Port Grimaud's
waterside in 1966, when the village was started, have not done badly. They
paid Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 8,000. Resales fetch Pounds 240,000.
There can be several side benefits with golf course properties. Many people
who choose such a setting do not play golf. They buy for the security of
their view and the added value of such a location when they sell.
There are other points. Bovis Abroad (081-422-3488), which has been involved
in a number of golf-linked projects, says having a golf membership with a
property can enhance the property's value by 20 per cent to 30 per cent.
This company is about to offer a new scheme in Spain, with 10 years'
'green-fee-free golf' with each property, transferable with the unit if it
is sold.
There is a tendency to write-off areas that have become popular, such as
France's Dordogne, as no longer worth considering for 'budget' purchases.
The feeling is that all the cheap unmodernised properties that started the
British going there to gentrify them, have been snapped up. But the area may
be worth another look.
One man who bought a cottage in the Dordogne for Pounds 750 in the 1960s,
before it was 'discovered,' has used it as an occasional holiday home ever
since. He thinks it is worth about Pounds 50,000 now. Had he modernised it,
it would be worth Pounds 100,000.
London agent Rutherford (071-351-4454) says untouched rural buildings are
still becoming available there, as farmers retire. It has a selection at
under Pounds 35,000. Even after improvement they would have cost much less
than Pounds 100,000.
The possibility of letting can add to a property's investment value. But
there are various ways of doing this.
You may choose a property to suit your own requirements, with the intention
of letting when you do not want it.
That may or may not work. It may not be the right size. You may just decide
you do not want strangers using your property.
The alternative could be to find something with separate accommodation for
letting, as a sideline.
In a village near Avignon, in the Gard area of Provence is a restored
detached stone house on three floors which could be a buyer's holiday home.
In an adjacent quarter-acre plot are ten studio apartments, all on ground
level. They are furnished, ready for an owner to let if he wishes. There is
a swimming pool and boules court with them.
Total cost of house and studios is Pounds 180,000. London agent Domus Abroad
(071-409-0571) says potential net annual income from the studios has been
estimated at Pounds 24,000.
You might prefer a property that would be mostly let, with someone else
dealing with the problems, but which you could use yourself occasionally.
In Switzerland the aparthotel system became popular as a way in which
foreigners could own a property there, when it was otherwise difficult
(though it is less so now).
An example of this sort of proposition is offered by Hilary Scott Overseas,
in West Sussex (0234-554319), an agency which deals in Swiss property.
You buy a furnished one-bedroom apartment, with kitchenette and bathroom, in
a hotel building in a Swiss resort for, perhaps, Pounds 100,000. This is
then leased back to the company and it becomes part of the hotel, with the
kitchenette closed off. It is let to hotel guests and you may get a net
return of up to 5 per cent each year.
Still on the subject of letting, though with investment uppermost, London
solicitor Osbornes has a further batch of apartments available in Rotterdam.
(It had others two years ago).
These are in a street of tenanted flats which are being sold, four at a
time. The two/three bedroom properties, one above the other, are priced at
about Pounds 52,500 for the four (just over Pounds 13,000 per flat).
These Rotterdam properties would not be suitable as second homes, but if an
investor buyer wanted something to keep for himself, or to let to someone
not necessarily working in the area, Osbornes (071-485-8811) can sometimes
offer apartments in Amsterdam, from about Pounds 20,000 each.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Property: Convert to a life of affordable luxury - Gerald
Cadogan celebrates countryside architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARNS boomed in the 1980s. As the supply of manors, farmhouses and rectories
diminished, many were sold for Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 200,000 for
conversion into houses. Barns alone seemed to offer the ambience of
traditional country life that Britons, from the Prince of Wales downwards,
have long sought for the house they want to make home.
The results, however, were sometimes architecturally disastrous. If they
were in open country, planning authorities frequently tried to stop
conversions. But, while Nicholas Ridley was environment secretary, local
planners knew his inspectors would probably reverse their refusals on
appeal.
English Heritage eventually led a counter-attack to defend listed barns and
the countryside as a whole. But they did so just as the property market -
and with it the demand for barns - was subsiding.
Barn prices have now come down more than have other houses'. The result is
there is no longer any need to live in a converted barn to experience
country life - not unless you particularly want to. Rectories, manors and
farmhouses are back on the market.
If it is a barn you want, there are now many for sale at fair prices,
whether already converted or, as the estate agents say, ripe for conversion.
The difference now is that district councils, which control planning, are
tougher than four years ago. This means we should see better and more
appropriate conversions. And, in answer to this need, English Heritage has
produced a useful pamphlet, The Conversion of Historic Farm Buildings.
Barns unconverted are lovable buildings, forming part of British economic
and social history. In the past, ownership of one symbolised wealth and
power. Generally better built because of their importance to the life of a
community, many have stood for centuries while farm houses and cottages have
risen and fallen around them. They kept the harvest, the hay and the wagons.
The animals wintered there. Men hid in them from press gangs or from the
enemy during the Civil War. And, being dry, they provided the best space for
celebrations and dances - or for a tumble in the hay.
But barns were never places in which to live. This continues to influence
planning authorities' present attitudes. If there is to be a conversion,
they would prefer the barn to be used for light industrial purposes - as a
workshop, warehouse, office, or packing plant - rather than as as house and
home.
Planners' first question is: Has the barn really become redundant for farm
use? Or is the owner merely saying it has? Is he motivated by a desire to
collect a one-off payment for the sale - rather than let it at a low
business rental?
Keeping the barn commercial may also provide employment and preserve the
airy, open-plan character of the building. A house, on the other hand,
usually entails subdivision - to answer the need for privacy sought by all
but the most eccentric. To English Heritage and the planners, converting a
barn into even a concert hall, theatre, conference centre or restaurant (as
has happened with many barns and National Trust houses) is preferable to
turning it into a home.
If a house is the only solution, the planners will be zealous in ensuring
that you respect the character of the building, especially its doors and
windows. If it has long, slit windows, like arrow loops, you are unlikely to
be allowed to enlarge them, though you will probably be allowed to open up
blocked windows and doors. But the barn will have to retain the aspect of
long, uninterrupted slabs of wall which, as in a factory, shows it is a
working building, not a domestic one.
An imaginative architect is, therefore, essential - one who will enjoy the
challenge and who may be able to convince the planners to allow a few
windows in the walls. Faced with the big problem of barn doors, can he do
better than the standard long strips of glass and wood? If he keeps the
original large wooden doors, can he cunningly devise a system of skylights
to let in daylight? Can the interior be so designed that part of the house
stretches up to the roof to glory in the barn's height, while alongside
stands an upper floor gallery?
A proposed barn conversion in open countryside has a poorer chance of
approval than one in a village. The typical council decision is that a
domestic conversion will have an adverse impact and should be refused since
the barn is outside the village. In this, the council will usually get the
support of the Environment Department. Mention a possible swimming pool or
tennis court and you will not improve your chances of planning approval.
In a village, planners are more relaxed about allowing dormers and chimneys.
But these can change the character of the building so much that, if it is
listed, English Heritage may recommend its delisting.
The brick, flint and timber Hoe Barn at Flansham, West Sussex, provides an
example of what can be done and what is available. Set on three floors to
emphasize its timber framing, and with its skylights cleverly arranged in a
random pattern, it is on offer from Humberts (0273-478828) at Pounds
350,000.
On the edge of Godalming lies a 16th century tithe barn on two levels - the
cattle were kept on the lower - with a magnificent timbered hall/drawing
room, which Browns (0483-31166) are offering at Pounds 650,000.
Several barns, cottages, stables and a coach house are ready for customers'
conversions on the Gullet Farm estate close to the sea at South Pool, south
Devon. Savills (0225-444622) and Luscombe &amp; May are auctioning them on
October 2.
Lot 3 comprises two barns at Halwell Farm, built of traditional Devon stone
and cob (earth mixed with dung). They come with 2 acres, including some
woodland, and private access to a creek and the foreshore. The guide price
is Pounds 75,000, roughly half of what it would have been four years ago.
If the hurdles before a barn conversion are considerable, the results can be
splendid. Barn shells have the advantage of sharing the building style of
the country around them and, if sensitively converted, will fit the
landscape.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Motoring: Chrysler rides again - Jeep will lead the latest
invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DOES the name Chrysler mean to you? If a pensioner, you might recall
the schoolboy excitement of spotting that stylish 1930s' streamliner, the
Chrysler Airflow. If middle-aged, you might have owned an Avenger, which was
born a Hillman and re-badged after Chrysler took over the old Rootes Group
late in the 1960s. If younger, you could have bought a Chrysler 180 or
Alpine in the 1970s.
Chrysler, which also had acquired Simca in France, pulled out of Europe a
few years later. To most of us, it then became a remote, all-American
manufacturer, from time to time in danger of going belly-up. But it
survived. And, a few days ago, it surprised observers of America's troubled
car industry by reporting a Pounds 93m second-quarter profit against a
Pounds 111m loss for the same period in 1991.
Quite a few Chrysler cars are being sold on mainland Europe. They are mostly
Voyager mini-vans (actually, large multi-purpose vehicles in the Renault
Espace and Toyota Previa mould) and Jeeps. Chrysler took over Jeep when
Renault, then owner of American Motors Corporation (which included Jeep)
baled out of the US late in the 1980s.
Chrysler is now about to return to Britain. Right-hand drive Jeeps will be
introduced at the Birmingham International motor show in mid-October. In
January, they will appear in the showrooms of 80 British Jeep dealers at
prices that will bring no pleasure to 4 x 4 makers and importers like
Daihatsu, Isuzu, Land Rover, Mitsubishi and Toyota.
Jeeps are no longer the rough, open-to-the-elements pneumonia wagons of the
Second World War. They are still just as tough and long-suffering, although
the Cherokee station wagons have every mod con. Even the basic Wrangler has
power steering.
Chrysler Jeep Imports UK, of Dover, Kent, says the Cherokee Limited which is
to spearhead the attack on Britain's healthy 4 x 4 market in January will
cost between Pounds 18,000 and Pounds 20,000. That puts it at the Discovery,
Trooper and Shogun price level.
But the four-litre Cherokee will come, in the jargon of the trade, fully
loaded. The price will include automatic transmission, ABS brakes, cruise
control, air-conditioning, leather upholstery, power-operated seats and
windows, central locking, alloy wheels and six-speaker stereo. It will have
a three-year mechanical and six-year corrosion warranty.
It is a great performer. On the road in rear-wheel drive, it went as quietly
and smoothly as a normal estate car. Off-road in four-wheel drive, it
clambered up and down steep, slippery hills and ploughed through deep mud as
capably as, but more comfortably than, many a class rival.
Few buyers will, of course, ever take one off-road seriously. It will be a
Volvo estate car alternative, a role it will fill admirably. This time next
year, the four-door Cherokee should be a familiar sight at horsey events as
well as favoured transport for trendy town and suburban families.
Britain also will get right-hand drive Wranglers with hardtops and
five-speed gearboxes in January. A 2.5-litre version of this basic Jeep will
be a working or fun vehicle; the Limited, with its four-litre engine,
leather seats and alloy wheels, must have Chelsea farmer appeal. Prices will
be in the Pounds 13,000-15,000 brackets.
Next spring, the Jeep range will be broadened to include a 2.5-litre base
model Cherokee - still well-equipped and with automatic transmission - and
two-pedal Wranglers. By early 1994, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and a
turbo-diesel Cherokee (using the same VM 2.5-litre engine as the Range
Rover) will arrive.
Grand Cherokee is Jeep's latest. Bigger than the standard Cherokee, although
not in the least bloated, it combines typical American ride, comfort and
silence with exceptionally good handling. Around a twisty circuit, it was
just as fast as a Chrysler saloon - yet this civilised machine is also a
formidable off-roader. It must compete strongly with Range Rover,
particularly as it will cost far less.
Chrysler's Voyager multi-purpose vehicle will not come to Britain for some
time. Its sliding passenger door is on the right-hand side, which is fine
for mainland Europe (where it sells well) but not for Britain; people would
step out into the traffic. We shall have to wait for the next generation
Voyager, due in about three years, to leave the assembly line with
right-hand drive.
Long before that, though, a small number of Vipers will have arrived. The
Viper is Chrysler's most startling product. Hand-built at the rate of two a
day, it has an eight-litre V10 engine putting out more than 400 horsepower.
It has plastic panels, uses some suspension parts from a Chrysler-made Dodge
pick-up truck, and leaves the start line like a bullet from a gun.
There is a hood of sorts but it is meant to be driven open. Heaven knows
what it would be like on a public road but, in the privacy of the proving
ground, it was sensational - a cross between a Ferrari and a Chevrolet
Corvette ZR-1. This muscular go-kart for wealthy extroverts will cost around
Pounds 50,000 when it arrives some time next year.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Travel: Cuba: coping with inscrutable powers - In Havana,
James Henderson encounters good fortune one moment, frustration the next,
before escaping to the countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOK at Cuba on the map and you will see a crocodile. It is swimming
threateningly among the Caribbean islands and with a switch of its tail it
might thrust them aside. A crocodile is a fitting animal for Cuba, the
biggest island in the Caribbean, which appears frighteningly powerful as it
moves to open up to tourism. It could drain the industry throughout the
area. But angry and defiant as it is, it has one big problem - the US.
Just above it, Florida hangs over Cuba like a massive incisor, poised to
snatch the island in a single bite. Suddenly, the crocodile looks like a
wriggling tiddler, and the accident of geography has rarely been as poignant
as now. The announcement at the beginning of the year that all assistance
from the former Soviet Union had ended means that Cuba needs foreign
exchange more desperately than ever.
Tourism seems to be its only avenue, and the country is developing it
frantically. But the US trade embargo is still in force. Key West used to be
just a few hours away on a car ferry, but there is no contact now.
We joined a weekend tour group to Havana to get settled for the first couple
of days. It is not often that I am a proper tourist, even in the Caribbean,
and the whole thing made me feel rather naughty. We were shepherded into a
tour bus and the guide started his routine.
'My name is Arturo, what is my name, repeat please.' A few voices sounded
uncertainly, but they were drowned by a massive 'Aaaarrrtuuurrooo]]' He gave
us a few skeleton details on the country - population: 11m]; exports:
cigars]; national sport: baseboll] At the back, I felt an urge to heckle.
But while I was tittering at my silent one-liners, I began to notice more
mysterious things afoot. We would not be staying at our chosen hotel.
Inexplicably, the whole party was upgraded to a better one.
There seemed to be inscrutable powers moving behind the scenes, making
themselves tantalisingly visible in a person or in a surprise occurrence,
bringing unexpected good fortune one moment, frustrating us the next. We
called them ministries - and competed with one another to give them
absurd-sounding names.
Next morning we sidestepped the organised bus tour and headed out into Old
Havana. It is without doubt the grandest and most beautiful town in the
Caribbean islands, a square mile of 16th and 17th century palaces set around
cobbled plazas. I love to wander there. That day, the cathedral was closed,
for some reason. But by chance we came on a cafe in a lovely courtyard
surrounded by arched balconies. 'Sorry, coffee's off . . .'
We steeled ourselves for lunch. We chose the famous Bodeguita del Medio,
which retains something of its rumbustious nature from Hemingway days in the
1950s. You are encouraged to sign your name on the wall. We had queued for
half-an-hour just to get the table and were preparing to wait, but no sooner
had we sat down than the Ministry of Expeditious Meals was in attendance,
and our order was with us in a flash, surpassing all reasonable expectations
of speed.
Havana itself is totally unlike any other West Indian town. There should
have been more people in the streets, small traders doing a 'lickle
business.' The single vendor was clearly the Ministry of Green Liquid
Distribution, dispensing iced drinks against the tropical sun. He had a
permanent queue 25 yards long.
The ministries' grand illogic makes independent travel unpredictable and
quite hard work. You are hardly encouraged to mix with the locals anyway,
and in the present difficulties much of the explosive joy of Latin Caribbean
life has gone.
Most of the nightclubs have been closed for want of electricity, though I
would recommend a visit to the Tropicana. Goggle-eyed, I sat in front of an
acreage of taut flesh and shifting satin, all moving in bewildering
sequence; headdresses cascaded, limbs flailed and skirts swirled. My wig
would have blown off if I had one.
After a couple of days we decided to get out of Havana, but of course this
involved meeting the capricious ministries on their own ground. So we
developed deviousness. I visited the girl at the hotel tour desk, but the
Ministry of If In Doubt, Defer, had struck her dumb. There were no cars
available, she explained. How about a trip on a tour bus? No thanks. Then
you'd better try Turismo Individual.
At Turismo Individual there was a lady filing her nails. No, the person we
wanted was out. We waited. Could there really be a Ministry for Strategic
Absence? After an hour's fidgeting we gave up and tried the train station,
but standing around at the station was a bit like a part in a Beckett play.
But then, by chance, we scored. In the foyer of another hotel a woman
ordered a car for us in a flash - the Ministry of Haphazard Hire Cars. We
felt relieved as we left the city and the embrace of the ministries receded.
We headed east and skirted Varadero, Cuba's flagship resort, which is due to
have 30,000 rooms by the end of the century. The beach is 12 miles long and
one of the Caribbean's finest. Varadero is the passing home of thousands of
proper tourists, who lie on the sand all day and dance congas at night.
Beyond, the Cuban countryside is immensely fertile, strikingly green, with
rich, deep red earth where a pencil might take root. We passed from fields
of sugar-cane into the Escambray mountains, with their bright green tobacco
fields. It has always struck me as ironic that one of the favourite luxuries
of the capitalist world, the cigar, should be produced by its self-appointed
arch enemy, Cuba.
We visited a cigar factory. They didn't really roll them on their thighs,
but it is fun to watch cigars being rolled and pressed. Instead of a radio,
a woman reads to the workers from the newspaper.
We even visited a crocodile farm. I peered over the 8ft metal link fence to
see a heap of them snoozing in a bog, each one propped lazily on the next.
They look a bit docile, I ventured. You ought to see them at feeding time,
the guide replied.
A lot has been written about Cuba's difficulties. But generally the people
are well-fed and well-dressed and certainly did not seem rebellious. There
is not much Lycra around, but then that is hardly the pinnacle of 20th
century achievement. And it is worth comparing life in Cuba with the largest
other latin country in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic, where there is
grinding poverty. The Cubans are considerably better off.
Without the random rule of the ministries, smiles began to work and simple
kindness needed no reason. I was on my own in a museum (a derailed train,
left as it was 30 years ago when it was stormed by Che Guevara and the
revolutionaries, with sombre pictures of those who died and a monumentally
ugly sculpture of an explosion cast in concrete), when a stranger
approached, concerned that I was alone and therefore must be lost. Did I
need some help to get back to my tour bus?
The rhetoric of the revolution appears strained now; the brave days of the
1960s are past and to see Che's face everywhere brings back memories of
another age. But communism is only half the story in Cuba.
Long before Lenin arrived, another, more important, national hero was
railing against the US. A century ago Jose Marti was predicting that Cuba
would never be able to escape the overbearing influence of what he called
the 'colossus in the north.' All the Caribbean islands feel the presence of
the US, but with Florida poised so close, Cuba feels it that much more
acutely.
Memories of Havana in the 1950s are still strong: so glorious and sleazy.
There was a cruel logic about money and satisfaction then, and most Cubans
would not want that to return. But the dollar is the flavour of the
Caribbean, and it seems unlikely that the island can survive without contact
with the US. Cuba may be a frightening prospect for the rest of the area,
but the crocodile is looking increasingly vulnerable.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Cookery: Around the globe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GLOBE artichokes are flourishing in the garden while those imported from
Brittany are excellent value in the shops just now. Broad beans - the beans
of antiquity - are also plentiful, making beans and artichokes a timely
twosome this weekend.
The idea of teaming the vegetables in one dish is nothing new. The flavours
are complementary, and good old beans help to make a more substantial dish
of a few aristocratic globes.
The partnership is, unsurprisingly, lightest and best when both vegetables
are young, fresh and green. It becomes less refined as the vegetables grow
more mature, but even coarse, elderly beans are worth consideration.
Of course, broad beans are no fun to eat in their skins once the skins have
turned to leather jerkins and the seam down the side of them is as black as
a dirty thumbnail. If, however, you slip them out of their jerkins after
boiling, they will emerge fresh, bright green and tender.
Thus rejuvenated, broad beans can be processed to a puree with salt, pepper,
chopped chives, a squeeze of lemon, a few knobs of butter, a little creme
fraiche, and enough of the cooking liquor to make a sauce. A flavoursome
low-fat alternative to butter- and egg-rich sauces, this thin bean puree is
lovely for dipping the leaves of globe artichokes into and for spooning over
artichoke bottoms when all the leaves have been pulled from them.
Another fine way to serve artichokes and broad beans together (providing the
beans are young enough not to need the treatment described above) is how
Edouard de Pomiane, dietician and teacher, enjoyed them in a small Athenian
tavern. The place was famous for its artichokes.
Describing his visit to the inn, Pomiane recalls: 'I arrived and sat down on
a wooden bench. Immediately, the proprietress called for the woman who
served as cook and waitress, too: 'Aphrodite, Aphrodite.' She appeared, but
what a disappointment. Aphrodite was blind in one eye and had a limp. She
was more than 60. Venus had aged . . . but the artichokes were
incomparable.'
POMIANE'S GLOBE ARTICHOKES A LA GREQUE Serves four for lunch in the garden
with cheese and fresh fruit to follow.
4 globe artichokes the size of a man's fist or 8 small ones; 1 1/4 lb
shelled broad beans (allow 3 1/2 -4 lb in the pod); 6-8 oz finely chopped
onions; a small handful of chopped parsley and half as much chopped green
coriander or chervil;  1/4 pt olive oil; 1 lemon for preparing the
artichokes and 1 lemon to serve with the finished dish.
First prepare the artichoke cups, a regrettably tedious and time-consuming
task but essential to the recipe. Trim the artichoke stalks, remove the
coarse outer leaves and cut an inch or so off the tops of the rest of the
leaves.
Pull out the inner cluster of immature leaves and use a teaspoon to scoop
out the hairy choke that lies underneath. Rub all cut surfaces with a halved
lemon as you expose them. As soon as prepared, put each artichoke cup into a
large bowl of water to which the juice of half a lemon has been added.
Season the onions with salt, pepper and the herbs and anoint with a generous
drizzle of olive oil. Drain the artichokes and put a tablespoonful of the
fragrant mixture into each cup.
Sit the artichokes shoulder to shoulder in a large flameproof casserole or
sturdy pan. Stir the beans into the remaining onion mixture and pack it into
the gaps. Pour on water barely to cover the artichoke cups and add the rest
of the olive oil.
Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook gently until the vegetables are perfectly
tender - about 45 minutes if the artichokes are large and the beans are
beyond the first flush of youth, as they tend to be if bought in August.
Lift out the artichokes and continue cooking - without a lid - until almost
every drop of water is driven off, leaving the beans in spluttering oil.
Return the artichokes to the pot and leave until barely tepid or cold. Check
seasoning before serving with lemon wedges and good bread.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Drink: Champagne hits back - A look at the price of a
favourite fizz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY IS much champagne so expensive and what are the Champenois doing about
it?
An answer to the first part of this question is that the cost of the grapes
for fine champagne accounts for half the ex-Marne cellars price of the wines
of the Grande Marque firms that dominate the market.
Following the collapse of the interprofessional contract in 1990 and the
implementation of individual ones, they could not press their grower
associates too hard on price. Based on prices of the last two vintages, the
cost of the 1.2 kilos of grapes needed per bottle of high grade champagne is
about Pounds 3.50. The production cost is around Pounds 2.50. Add the cost
of keeping a non-vintage blend well into its third year, and the ex-cellars
price of a Grande Marque champagne rises to between Pounds 8 and Pounds 9.
At the other end of the market, the cost of grapes from the villages selling
at 80 per cent of the top price on the Montagne de Reims and the Cotes de
Blancs can be less than Pounds 2. Then there is champagne, made partly at
least from the third pressing (deuxieme taille), yields a poor quality
vintage with very short ageing potential, and has an ex-cellars price of
about Pounds 5.
The problem of the Grandes Marques and a few other high-quality firms is to
establish, particularly in a time of sharp decline, a fair relationship
between the price and the quality of their (inevitably) dearer champagnes -
after all, why buy champagne if it is not clearly superior to the growing
number of sparkling wines throughout the world? So great efforts are being
made to improve quality, thereby obliging the low-cost producers to raise
their standards and prices.
During the past two or three years, almost all the 3,000 press-houses have
been inspected and 400 have been replaced. The result is better, clearer
must.
Now, the deuxieme taille is to be eliminated at the coming vintage so that
the merchants will secure 100 litres of must from 160, rather than 150,
kilos of grapes. And the leading firms which do not use this third pressing
will be unable to re-sell it, for it will be distilled. Fifteen million
bottles of champagne will thus be lost in an average year. No other
sparkling wine in the world has cut out this pressing.
Further, the maximum yield per hectare of grapes will be cut. This will have
a positive effect on quality and, eventually, will result in some increase
in the final cost per bottle.
A large vintage this year will be highly unwelcome to the champagne makers
for, while the desirable level of stocks is the equivalent of three years'
sales, stocks at the end of June were estimated at 4.3 years. This has led
to prices being cut to levels at which there is little or no profit. It has
been possible in French supermarkets to buy champagne for as little as FFr
52 a bottle.
A normal good crop runs to 10,000 to 11,000 kilos per hectare, but this year
anything exceeding 9,000 to 9,500 will be blocked. The excess cannot be made
into champagne and will be kept in reserve by the growers and co-ops, who
will not be paid for it until it is released, probably in two years' time.
The champagne makers are also planning to extend the minimum age for selling
a champagne from 12 to 15 months and, eventually, to 18. Although too little
even then for adequate maturity, it will prevent the marketing of immature
champagne.
But what will be the likely price of grapes this coming vintage? It must
depend first on the size and quality of the crop; but if these are
favourable, it will certainly come down from the Comite's recommended price
last year of FFr 30 a kilo. Forecasts range from FFr 27-FFr 25.
Last year, for the first time for at least 16 years, prices did not rise and
this trend is likely to continue for another couple of years. After the
effects of inflation, this means a 'real money' cut.
The predicament of the champagne makers is not, however, as bad as it might
appear from the UK, which cut its consumption of champagne by a third last
year compared with 1990. Worldwide, sales fell by only 10 per cent. This
year, a further 7 per cent drop is expected. In less than six months,
however, UK supermarkets may face strong competition.
Their normal retail margins on champagne are much higher than in French
supermarkets: 20 per cent to 25 per cent compared with 5 per cent to 10 per
cent. From January, it will be possible to import without duty (now Pounds
1.56 a bottle) 6 1/2 cases for personal consumption.
While such amounts may exceed the wildest wishes of the average Briton, his
cash resources and the spare space in his car, it is likely to encourage
champagne purchases in France that otherwise might have been made in the UK.
It will be interesting to see how British supermarkets respond.

SOMETIMES food books can be almost too worthy, writes Jill James. Such is
Giles MacDonogh's scholarship that The Wine and Food of Austria (Mitchell
Beazley, Pounds 14.99, 144 pages) runs that risk. It is so exhaustive in its
treatment of the country's wines that might ask: 'Do I really want to know
all this?'
In its coverage of the origins of the country's wine-making, grapes and
methods used, vineyards, producers and imbibers, no grape is left untrodden.
MacDonogh comes up with some splendid quotations from producers. Osberger
does not approve of the post 1985-trend to drink ever-younger wines ('it's
like sending your children down the pit') but, at times, lets his
pre-occupation with history get the better of him.
The last chapter, on Austrian foods, is one of the most enjoyable and that
chapter alone should persuade readers to take it on their next trip to
Vienna.
A different format would have made the book more convenient for the
traveller, for it is too learned for the coffee table. Snappier section
headings and lighter, more teasing captions for Manfred Horvath's pictures,
which range from dull to excellent, would have improved its presentation.

FT  08 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Designs for men that keep women in mind - A
look at the development of male underwear and the struggle to reconcile
conflicting demands of fashion and comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL KEERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to the magazine Men's Wear in 1935: 'Underwear should have the
grace of Apollo, the romance of Byron, the distinction of Lord Chesterfield
and the ease, coolness and comfort of Mahatma Gandhi.' Since then, designers
and manufacturers have been struggling to reconcile these conflicting
demands.
Certainly, none of those men would have been happy with the underwear of the
1960s and 1970s. That was the era of pouches, thongs, tangas and
mini-briefs. Morals were loose, underwear was tight. And it was made of
figure-hugging nylon, until it emerged that the consequent rise in body
temperature could induce sterility.
Underwear also was coloured, in hideous purples and greens. Yet, it was
plain white underpants that made a comeback in the '80s. And by entering the
fray alongside boxer shorts, they really defined the battle between grace
and distinction, between Apollo and Lord Chesterfield, which marks today's
bottom line.
As the 1980s' fitness movement emerged in New York, Calvin Klein hit the
market with his classic, combed-cotton, plain white Y-fronts. In a brilliant
US advertising campaign, he displayed this classic underwear on female
models. A stunning black-and-white Bruce Weber photo of a girl in white
briefs dominated Times Square, and women as well as men rushed to make the
line a sell-out.
Klein always has been allied with a clean-cut, healthy and athletic American
image. His simple white underwear took on the same image by association.
When Jockey introduced the Y-front, the company proclaimed it was
'scientifically perfected for correct masculine support.' In Calvin's hands,
that athleticism became a symbol of the work-out generation. Yet, on the
other side of the Atlantic, Britain was working to a different brief. In the
UK, the late 1980s was the era of the boxer shorts.
As with so much of British menswear, boxers represented a return to
tradition, a harking back to the wardrobe of the classic gentleman of the
1930s. If you wore braces and brogues, then boxers were the obvious
accompaniment.
And it was ace designer Paul Smith, of course, who first realised the comic
potential of the boxer shorts. You could actually print their flat sheets of
cotton (or new-money silk) with anything from polka dots to pigs. There are
few items of clothing with which a man can be a little witty; even a
humorous tie can raise eyebrows rather than smiles in a sombre office. So,
the new breed of City boys, straining against the traditional dress code of
the Square Mile, had fun with their unseen underwear. Serious Money and
frivolous boxers were a fashionable 1980s combination.
Alongside nostalgia and naughtiness, though, perhaps the biggest single
influence on the rise of boxer shorts was their popularity with women. It
takes a good physique to make Y-fronts look sexy, whereas boxers hide a
multitude of sins.
Female taste is a significant factor in male underwear; not only do women
buy a great deal as gifts but they are also the people men generally want to
please when they get down to their basics.
And so, despite the fact that they completely fail to offer the physical
support of briefs, boxers shot to popularity. Form had conquered function.
As we go into the 1990s, the two poles of underwear style are locked in
combat. They give out different messages but both are equally fashionable.
Last month, Luke Perry and Jason Priestley, teen heart-throb co-stars of the
US TV series Beverly Hills, 90210, dropped their jeans for Vanity Fair. One
was wearing white Calvins, the other paisley boxers.
Klein, pushing the sporting image to the maximum, now markets a range called
Athletic, available in London at Harrods and Selfridges and described as
'engineered to excel in the realm of active sport.' With five per cent
spandex in the cotton fabric, to provide extra support, the designs are
based on sports kit; hence, the vest is a 'sport tank' (Pounds 24.95) and
the briefs a 'cycling short' (Pounds 17.95). Those two are combined in a
one-piece 'body tank' (Pounds 29.95), which looks as if it could be
maneouvred on and off only by an accomplished gymnast.
Jockey also has introduced three 'sports' underpants containing five per
cent Lycra (Pounds 5.99 to Pounds 9.99). But the company, which patented the
Y-front during the First World War, retains that traditional design in
briefs, 'midways' (thigh length) and 'thermal longs' (Pounds 3.99 to Pounds
8.99). And Jockey is traditional at heart; any 'sports' range which goes up
to a 38-inch waist is not aiming at serious athletes.
Meanwhile, at Knickerbox there is a range called New England, which seems to
take tradition back to somewhere around the First World War. Ankle-length
long johns in grey ribbed cotton (Pounds 14.99), long-sleeved vests with
three-button necks (Pounds 16.99) and the return of button flies - all push
underwear back to our grandfather's day.
As the nation's biggest underwear outlet, Marks &amp; Spencer naturally is
keeping its options open. Its Active range mimics Klein by putting three per
cent Lycra in the mix and proclaiming that the underwear 'can also be a
sport accessory.' Athletics vests and trunks are Pounds 6.99 each.
Traditionalists, meanwhile, can get Disney characters on their M&amp;S boxer
shorts (Pounds 5.99) or pursue the new trend for old-fashioned button flies
with cotton knitted trunks (Pounds 5.99).
So, which is to be - Apollo or Chesterfield, athlete or aesthete?
Personally, function is more important than form in the end. Klein has my
support, just as I have his.

FT  08 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Mega-yachts sink in a sea of recession -
Keith Wheatley discovers that the super-rich are finding it hard to dispose
of their floating gin palaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE they were known, scornfully and with a touch of envy, as gin palaces.
The mega-yachts of the super-rich were at their most visible each August
moored to the cobbled quay in San Tropez or filling a sheltered anchorage on
the Sardinia coast. But recession has left many of them lined up in
Mediterranean harbours, as empty as the office blocks which financed them.
The industry is unanimous that there has never been a better time to buy a
mega-yacht. As over-borrowed tycoons find the bank manager no longer
returning calls, the corporate toys go on the block. Bargains - although the
pin-striped brokers of this industry would never use such a word - abound.
One such was the late Robert Maxwell's vessel Lady Ghislaine, from which he
fell to his death last November. It was sold this week for a price thought
to be around Pounds 10m - considerably below the original asking figure. But
there is always the slightly larger My Gail III, owned by Gerald Ronson of
the stricken Heron Corporation; he is asking Pounds 14m.
Will he get it? The yacht brokers of Antibes and Monaco shiver. They know
full well that Natalina B, the 162 ft flagship of Harry Goodman's
International Leisure Company, is still for sale at Pounds 8.5m with
scarcely a nibble to date. Southern Cross, once Alan Bond's pride and joy,
sits forlornly alongside a quay in Antibes while its former owner works on a
prison farm in Western Australia.
Nigel Burgess, who runs an eponymous company with offices in Monaco and
London, is the most successful broker and manager of mega-yachts - defined
as being over 110 ft long and worth more than Pounds 10m. 'At prices over
Pounds 10m, you seldom deal with inherited wealth,' he says. 'It's almost
always self-made business money, and the yacht is a corporate vehicle. That
means it is terribly vulnerable to the general state of the economy.'
With his heavy tortoiseshell spectacles, perfect manners and cautious
speech, Burgess could be a Harley Street physician or a royal courtier.
Discretion is a way of life with these men. They may work the Monte Carlo
waterfront but they go to work in worsted suits and black lace-up shoes.
'Owners are paranoid about secrecy, largely because they don't want to
reveal the extent of their lifestyles to their employees or business
competitors,' says Alex Braden of Yachting Partners International, a rival
to Burgess. There is also an unspoken superstition that the better-known a
yacht and its owner becomes, the more likely it is that the two will be
parted - the Lady Ghislaine and the Trump Princess, once owned by Donald
Trump, being just two of the more conspicuous examples.
The Trump Princess used to be called the Nabila after the daughter of its
owner, Middle Eastern 'fixer' Adnan Kashoggi, who hit the financial rocks in
1985. Property developer Trump then offered around Pounds 30m for the
vessel, at that time the world's biggest and most luxurious. After the sale
was agreed, the distaff side of the Kashoggi family pointed out the
dishonour of another man owning a yacht named after Nabila. Adnan's people
called Donald's people. Meanwhile, Burgess was swimming in this rich soup at
10 per cent commission.
Trump recalled: 'They asked if, out of respect for Kashoggi, I would take
his daughter's name off the boat.' He mulled it over and agreed - if
Kashoggi dropped the price Pounds 1m. 'I think it was just a hell of a good
deal,' added Trump who, later in the '80s, met his own financial nemesis.
The yacht now is owned by Saudi prince Talal Ibn Abdul Aziz and is having a
Pounds 35m refit in Germany. Insider gossip says it is for sale again.
Maxwell actually bought the Lady Ghislaine second-hand from Ronson
(although, in this rarified milieu, 'existing yacht' is the tactful phrase
employed to describe something not quite fresh from the builder's slipway).
It is the third-largest yacht registered in Britain after the royal yacht
Britannia and Ronson's present runabout.
The publishing tycoon immediately re-named the Dutch-built vessel after his
favourite daughter. The boat was always available for charter at Pounds
100,000 a week in high season. In contrast, says Burgess, the
privacy-conscious Ronson was one of the few owners who declined to charter
his yacht, although it was used a great deal for corporate entertaining.
With annual running costs for this type of vessel at around Pounds 1.5m  - a
good skipper alone can command a Pounds 150,000 salary - chartering makes
makes commercial sense. Inland Revenue officials are much more willing to
allow a yacht as tax-deductible if it has been chartered. But will the
affluent vacationers who pay Pounds 52,500 a week this summer to charter
Deneb Star C know they are on a boat owned by rock star David Bowie? You
will not find a single photo of the rock star on his private floating
palace.
London charter consultant Jan Spivey says those wanting to charter regard it
as a big plus if they can rent the yacht of a global celebrity.
'Unfortunately, ' she adds, 'most of the people with an attractive image
want total discretion. So you can't exploit it to market the boat.'
Lady Ghislaine was the exception. 'Maxwell's ego made sure it was the most
expensive boat in the Med, so it didn't do a great deal of work. Plus, he
was hideously difficult to deal with.' Nevertheless, some found it worth
persevering, Frank Sinatra among them.
Yet, when it comes to selling a boat, the high profile of the owner can be a
distinct drawback, especially if he has gone bust. 'That kind of publicity
will put people off, however good the yacht is,' says Burgess. Braden
agrees. 'Guys who are in a conservative way of business don't particularly
want to buy the toys of people who took too many risks and failed - or who
may now be in prison. Some of the vessels currently for sale attract flash
characters who haven't really got the money. They just like to say they
looked over so-and-so's yacht. Serious players don't really want to know in
a duress sale.'
At the other end of the scale - serious money, made quietly - there is
scarcely a ripple in the yachting pond. Brave Goose, the 152 ft mega-yacht
of British tycoon Sir Donald Gosling, continues to be booked months ahead at
Pounds 156,000 a week. Very few customers will know or care that Royal Navy
veteran Gosling made his fortune with a UK company, National Car Parks. They
crave a main saloon (with baby grand piano) that, says the brochure, 'is a
piece of England, like an embassy.'
With its midnight-blue hull and white upperworks, red ensign fluttering at
the stern, Brave Goose is testimony to traditional values, sober accounting,
and directors who keep their hands off soaring office blocks and out of the
pension fund.
Meanwhile, who will buy My Gail III or Natalina B? International yacht
consultant Eric Ogden looked out over Antibes harbour and sighed. 'They're
lined up like tombstones,' he said. 'The boats are like a Who's Who of
business problems.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: How gypsies proved a site's
salvation - Keith Wheatley visits a holiday complex that is weathering a
West Country recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GYPSIES were Peter and Liz Heywood's salvation when they took over a
run-down Cornish caravan site. 'We had to get rid of 32 ancient Bluebird
caravans before Easter,' recalled Heywood. 'We thought giving them to
gypsies was the answer. Unfortunately, when you tried to tow them, they fell
apart.' Eventually the gypsies solved the problem - dismantling the
Bluebirds for scrap at a fee of Pounds 10 each.
The experience was an early indicator for running Trewince - no problem or
solution has been predictable.
The 1750 manor house, dominating the glorious Roseland peninsula south of St
Austell, is a unique holiday mixture. The acres of gardens and woods
surrounding the house shelter dwellings ranging from Pounds 80,000 timber
lodges to pup tents containing hikers walking the adjacent south-west
coastal footpath.
Sea views surround Trewince and, with the National Trust owning most of the
Roseland, the landscape is unspoilt. But the business outlook cannot be
isolated from the trauma affecting the rest of the West Country holiday
trade. All along the magical Cornish coast, hotels are closed or for sale at
ridiculous prices.
'My worst guess is that we are going to be 20 per cent down on last year's
turnover,' said Heywood, a former technical director of a pioneering British
robotics company. In 1991, the turnover at Trewince was about Pounds
190,000, with only a very small profit.
Unlike many families, the Heywoods had no dreams of leaving their
comfortable suburban lives in Hertfordshire and fleeing to Cornwall. 'I was
enjoying my very conventional life and my job was stimulating,' said
Heywood. 'I came down in 1984 just to oblige a neighbour who was thinking of
buying the place. It was terribly dilapidated but I heard God telling me to
live here.' Both the Heywoods are committed Christians.
Trewince cost Pounds 300,000 for just the asset. 'There were no books
available so you couldn't buy it as a going concern. It was just finger in
the air stuff - against all my technical and business training.' Heywood
recalls his managing director 'going white' when he heard of the scheme and
begging him not to do it.
In the early days, it was a partnership. Both families sold their homes in
Hertfordshire for Pounds 100,000 and the bank put in Pounds 100,000 plus a
Pounds 24,000 facility for working capital. Early omens were not good. 'We
were snowbound for weeks and it never snows in Cornwall,' said Heywood. 'We
had to be operating by Easter to get some cash in, and all we had for
forward bookings was a scruffy piece of paper with nine names on it.
'We discovered that Trewince had a terrific reputation - for being dirty and
run-down. Some regulars in the chalets brought camp beds so that they
wouldn't have to sleep on the mattresses. Yet they came because there is a
kind of magic here.'
The first couple of years were the usual story of undercapitalised small
businesses owned by people learning the hard way. In the first year they
made a loss and were too broke to go to Sainsbury's, but the second year was
break-even and then a small profit began to peep through.
Crisis was just around the corner, though. For personal reasons, the
Heywoods' partners wanted to be bought out - and even the ever-helpful Royal
Bank of Scotland was not going to turn another third of the Trewince equity
into debt. Heywood's long-term plans began to appear a short-term necessity.
'It was obvious that we had to sell our assets forward to survive,' he said.
Plans were submitted to put 10 timber lodges - highly-equipped
three-bedroomed units - in the orchard adjoining the walled garden. They
would sell for Pounds 79,000 each on a 999-year lease. The National Trust
objected, and it took months and an appeal to secure permission.
The delay was to prove nearly fatal. 'Our timing was perfect - it couldn't
have been worse. We put up our show lodge in June 1990 and by September we
had 10 firm prospects,' said Heywood. Then came the NT objection and 15
months of delay - during the worst property recession in living memory.
Meanwhile, the Heywoods' partner had already been bought out with borrowed
money. 'We could see ourselves going broke rapidly. It came very, very
close.'
The loan on the property went up to nearly Pounds 500,000 at one point,
compared with a bank valuation of Pounds 950,000. At the same time, holiday
cancellations were starting to come in, often accompanied by a letter
telling of redundancy or family hardship.
In the past 12 months, though, things have started to turn around. Three
more lodges have been sold, easing some financial pressure, and good summer
weather has brought in casual visitors. Providing accommodation for
Christian groups and youth clubs has been useful. 'It's a good niche market
and one that we're already in touch with,' said Heywood.
Word-of-mouth has generally been more successful than advertising at
promoting Trewince. 'It's not a holiday park, it isn't a caravan site. The
Cornwall Tourist Board don't know which category to put us in.'
Heywood's next goal is to put a small restaurant into the main house, where

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors who lack a proper sense of
direction - Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THEIR FACES stare at you from company reports
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
balding men in sober suits who seem to be in their 60s (although some are
much younger). They are non-executive directors who, with the recent
publication of the Cadbury report on corporate governance, are claimed to be
a 'good thing' for companies. But are they?
As a private investor, I have learned from bitter experience that having
'the great and the good' or even an army of accountants on the board is no
guarantee of success. Fortunately, I avoided putting money into such
companies as Polly Peck, Maxwell Communications or Dominion International.
All had non-executive directors - and look what happened. (My wife was
particularly upset about Dominion International being placed in the hands of
administrators since she had a small shareholding).
Similarly, there is no reason to believe that a strongly-managed company
without any non-executives is doomed to failure. Indeed, it might well
perform better than many others - especially those where non-executive
chairmen and/or some of the non-executive directors interfere too much in
the day-to-day operations or inhibit development by being too cautious.
On the whole, though, I like to see at least two non-executives on a board -
if only as an indication that it is not too hidebound by tradition. The
trouble, as various surveys have shown, is that too many non-executives are
appointed for the wrong reasons: they were at school or university with one
of the executive directors, or played golf with him, or helped him to
acquire a gong.
What should non-executives do for a company and its shareholders?
Much has been made of the need for a good non-executive to be 'independent,'
but I like to see them having at least a modest shareholding. This
demonstrates some financial faith in the management and direction of the
company.
But the shareholding should not be too big. It seems to me that
non-executives with large holdings or high fees may be less likely to speak
out on crucial issues because they are concerned about protecting their
position.
As well as independence, I believe non-executives ought to bring to a board
a wide range of experience and expertise, and a strong belief in ethics.
They should, of course, have the interests of the company as a whole
(including shareholders) at heart.
Some years ago, I attended a one-day course (organised by the Institute of
Directors) on 'the non-executive director and the board.' I had become so
convinced of the need for more companies to have truly independent
non-executives that I thought I should become one. I then registered with
the two main UK organisations (the institute and PRO-NED) which offer a
service to companies seeking non-executives.
According to PRO-NED's annual review: 'When chairmen use a search agency
such as PRO-NED, their specification for the kind of person they are looking
for tends to be uncompromisingly narrow. They are seeking, on the whole,
main board directors of other PLCs, who are preferably chief executives and
in the age range 45-55.' Unfortunately, one of PRO-NED's own information
leaflets states that 'new entrants' to its register 'are not normally
accepted below the age of 45.'
PRO-NED adds: 'In the cause of independence, there is a case for bringing
some directors on to the board who will have a different background and
outlook and will provide a challenge to accepted executive thinking.'
In 1990, at the age of 'only' 44, I was accepted by both non-executive
registers. I stressed my degrees in law, philosophy (including ethics), and
sociology and business experience. This included founding several companies,
one of which I steered to a full stock market quotation. I also became its
chief executive. Would people be beating at my door?
The result has been absolutely zero. I did not expect PRO-NED's sponsors
(such as the Bank of England) to offer me anything, especially as I would
have been pressing for a realignment of the pound and a dramatic drop in
interest rates. But I hoped to be of use on a company board.
The same fate has befallen most of the other names on the two registers.
Despite the urgings of the Bank ous City organisations, most non-executives
are still appointed mainly because of who they know, rather than what. But
is this so surprising when most City institutions themselves have boards
appointed in a similar manner? Indeed, the Bank of England itself needs a
wider range of directors.
Perhaps I should tear out some of my hair, join a golf club and make more
influential friends.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase, Q&amp;A): Two jobs, one pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE two contracts with a private limited company. Under one I act as
managing director; the other provides for me to offer services as head of
research. Is it possible to retire from one post and to draw the relevant
proportion of the accumulated pension funds while remaining active in the
other? No specific retirement age is laid down.
If your pension scheme gives you the right to retire and draw your pension
there are no Inland Revenue or other rules to prevent you from receiving a
salary, consultancy fee or other income from the employer providing the
pension scheme. The common practice when a managing director retires from a
small company and starts to draw his pension is for him to start a new
contract as, say, non-executive chairman. In your case there is no
impediment to your retiring and continuing to receive remuneration in
whatever form may be agreed between your company and yourself.

I AM self-employed. Can I opt out of the state pension scheme, and if so,
can I get back the money and interest I have paid in?
The answer to both questions is no. Contracting-out rebates are only
available for employees taxed under Schedule E as the self-employed do not
qualify for SERPS. Contracting-out cannot be backdated.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase, Q&amp;A): AVCs and tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM 47, and for the last ten years have been paying 4 per cent of my salary
into my company pension scheme. This year I am inheriting some money and
will be able to afford higher payments. I am therefore making Additional
Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) up to the limit of 15 per cent.
I understand that with a personal pension plan it is possible to backdate
tax relief for up to six years, but because I am part of a company pension
scheme I am not allowed to take out a personal pension as well. Is it
possible to backdate the tax relief for AVCs? Our pension administrator says
no, but it may well be that this is a new request. Are there any procedures
that need to be followed if it is possible?
AVCs cannot be backdated. However, if you are paying 4 per cent as basic
contributions you can pay up to 11 per cent of earnings as AVCs.
Furthermore, if your basic pension contributions of 4 per cent are not based
on your total PAYE earnings (including taxable P11D expenses) your AVCs can
be calculated as 15 per cent of your gross taxable earnings from your
employment, less the amount paid to your scheme - which in many typical
company situations would mean that the permitted AVC limit could be 12 per
cent (assuming a 4 per cent scheme contribution) or more.
As your current scheme membership is providing for current service AVCs at
this level over the next 18 years (assuming your retirement age is 65) this
should enable you to fill up a substantial back service gap. You should ask
your pensions manager for estimates (assuming you are in a final pay plan)
of the likely percentage of final pay that such AVCs could reasonably be
expected to produce, asking him to make allowance for topping up your
spouse's pension to two-thirds of yours and for indexation on both pensions.

GRE UNIT Managers, part of Guardian Royal Exchange, is launching a combined
building society/unit trust product called Progress. But although the
guaranteed income level of 7.5 per cent might look attractive, there are one
or two wrinkles that investors should look out for.
Forty per cent of the investment will be placed in a Nationwide building
society account and the remainder in GRE's Guardhill unit trust, which
invests in UK equities. But on top of the initial and annual charges on the
unit trust element, GRE is making further charges on the building society
portion.
An initial charge of 2.4 per cent is being made on the entire investment; so
if you invest the minimum of Pounds 10,000, that would eat up Pounds 240. In
addition, GRE is charging 0.75 per cent a year plus VAT (deducted monthly)
to manage the building society element (the annual charge on the unit trust
is 1.5 per cent).
In other words, if you invest Pounds 10,000 in Progress, Pounds 3,904 will
go into the building society and Pounds 5,856 into the unit trusts at the
offer price for the units. So with a bid-offer spread of 6.36 per cent on
August 1, according to Finstat, there is an immediate capital loss of Pounds
610 on a Pounds 10,000 investment.
The guaranteed income of 7.5 per cent is payable on the full investment. But
the account might struggle to meet that figure if the unit trust does not
produce growth.
The Guardhill unit trust now yields around 3.55 per cent which means that,
assuming the building society element pays 10 per cent gross, the total
investment yield is around 6.1 per cent. The 'extra' 1.4 per cent will have
to be met from unit trust growth.
If the unit trust falls in value, the investor could find chunks of his
capital being eaten up quickly to produce the income - especially as the
income is scheduled to rise to 7.75 per cent in year two and 8 per cent in
year three (after that, the income will be reviewed). There is no guarantee
of return of capital with this account.
And watch out for a further wrinkle. Even if the unit trust does well and
the investor's capital grows, the income of 7.5 per cent will still be
payable only on the initial investment. Thus, if the capital grows from
Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000, the income in year two will still be Pounds
775, not Pounds 1,162.50.
An investor would still be happy with such growth. But what are the chances
of a good performance from the GRE Guardhill unit trust? It has not exactly
lit up the sector; its growth has been below average over one, two, three,
five, seven and 10 years. Over the 10 years to July 1, it was 53rd out of 54
trusts in the sector.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Now buyers can insure against loss of
value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYERS of new homes will be able to insure themselves against plummeting
property prices under a scheme launched this week.
Provided by General Accident Property Services (GAPS) - which runs a chain
of 400 estate agents and is part of the General Accident insurance group -
it will operate initially in the Thames Valley area near London and will
spread nationally during the ne xt two months.
General Accident is offering to cover owners forced to sell their home
within three years of a purchase against losses of up to 10 per cent of the
original price - up to a ceiling of Pounds 15,000.
David Wright, national operations manager of GAPS, said the scheme would be
sold through housebuilders, which would be able to offer it as a sales
incentive. There are no plans to offer it generally to the public.
The cost to builders would be a flat fee of less than Pounds 300 a house,
which would cover purchasers for three years.
Letters detailing the offer have been sent this week to companies in the
Thames Valley region, including most of the national housebuilders. Wright
said the insurance policies would be written by a Lloyds insurance syndicate
rather than GA. 'The aim is not to generate insurance business but to try to
stimulate the housing market out of the worst slump for more than half a
century,' he added.
To qualify for the new scheme, people must have been forced to sell their
home by loss of job or a forced job move, a divorce or separation, or by the
withdrawal of equity by a joint mortgagee.
'Unemployment and the fear of homes losing their value are the two biggest
concerns holding back the housing market,' said Wright.
A rents-to-mortgages deal for ex-armed service personnel is on offer as part
of a package launched by SSAFA (the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's
Families Association), AFFAS (the Armed Forces' Financial Advisory
Services), and the Birmingham Midshires Building Society.
Properties held by Birmingham Midshires will be available on a 12-month
lease at an annual rent of around 7 per cent of the property's valuation.
These properties will be available for purchase by ex-servicemen, and any
rent paid during the first 12 months will be deducted from the price.
Those who wish to buy will be offered a first-year mortgage rate 1.5 per
cent below Birmingham Midshires' base rate, now 10.75 per cent. Mortgages
will be offered, subject to normal lending criteria, on up to 95 per cent of
the purchase price.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR EVERY sale of stock by a director during the month of July, there were
3.9 purchases. Historically, that is a ratio which has marked the low point
for the UK stock market.
The largest sale this week was recorded in Argyll, the Safeway and Presto
supermarket group.
Chairman Sir Alistair Grant and deputy chairman David Webster sold 100,000
and 50,000 shares respectively at 345p. They are left with 800,000 and
645,000 shares respectively. Food retailing is one of the very few areas to
have bucked the recessionary trend in recent years.
Three directors in DC Gardner, the training and consultancy group, bought a
total of 160,000 shares the day after announcing their interim results. The
shares have fallen sharply since the beginning of last year, but the interim
results showed a return to profit after a Pounds 2.8m loss at the same time
last year. However, no interim dividend will be paid.
Colin Hope, a non-executive director of Ibstock Johnsen, bought 20,000
shares at 47.5p. Over the past two weeks, there have been three small
purchases by directors at around this level.
Directors were selling heavily between September last year and up to May
this year. The most notable vendor was Paul Hyde-Thomson, the chairman, who
disposed of 670,000 at prices between 90p and 94.5p.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage lenders put caution first -
Sally Hamilton discovers there are several types of property on which loans
will not be made at all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY HAMILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN years ago, the path to getting a mortgage on your home was strewn
with obstacles. Most lenders operated a 'red-lining' policy. This meant they
took a map of the country and circled undesirable towns or types of property
with a red pen.
The 1980s' property boom as good as eradicated red-lining, replacing caution
with a credit free-for-all. The drop in the housing market has not seen a
return of the red pen but lending is growing more prudent. The spiralling
number of repossessions has reinforced the trend as lenders fear being
lumbered with unmarketable assets.
All mortgage lenders, whether building societies, banks or centralised
lenders, assert that they will look at each property earmarked by a buyer
'on its own merits.' Yet, many have a hit-list of categories which could
mean a blanket refusal on lending.
The country's biggest mortgage lenders, the Abbey National and the Halifax,
claim to maintain a flexible lending policy. Yet, they admit that market
forces have made them more careful.
'We are more liberal than most but we won't accept any old rubbish,' says
John Cox, group chief surveyor of Abbey National. 'Properties acceptable
three years ago may not be acceptable now. We rely on our local surveyors to
advise us on marketability.'
Which properties should you avoid if you need a mortgage? All mortgage
companies will avoid lending on flats with leases which have less than 25 or
30 years remaining after the mortgage period is up. This means leases of
under 50 years are undesirable except in the most sought-after areas, such
as London's Knightsbridge.
The Leeds Permanent, in common with many other lenders, will not normally
offer mortgages on freehold flats, which became more common in the 1980s as
the converted flat sector grew. What this usually means is that one flat in
a building carries the freehold, instead of an external property company or
individual, and the other flats carry leases. 'The problem with them is
enforcing repair covenants,' said John Graves, chief valuation surveyor of
the Leeds.
Similar problems may arise in a block of flats which has been leased by the
freeholder to a third party - if the third party lives in one of the
properties. The third party holds what is called the 'head lease' and is
responsible for maintaining the common areas.
If the third party decided to do a bunk, the lender could be left with
responsibility for these repairs, explained David Hudson, chief surveyor of
the Woolwich. If, however (as in the freehold case), the third party lives
off the premises and all the flats have leases, mortgages become no problem.
Government reforms are due soon which should clarify the flat owner's
position and create a form of lease called the commonhold.
The Leeds has further guidelines on flats. 'Old blocks of four storeys and
above must have a lift before we consider them,' according to Graves. 'We
will accept six storeys in a modern block and in London we will go up to 10
storeys, but not really elsewhere in the country,' he adds.
And what about that cosy flat above the fish and chip shop you saw last
week? The Leeds and many other lenders take a dim view of flats over
commercial properties which could pose a fire risk; or are situated near
public houses, which can affect resale value.
Regional problems are also something to watch out for. Parts of Cornwall and
Devon are blighted because thousands of homes, which were built on
foundations made from waste materials from the local tin mines, are
suffering from a concrete disease called mundic.
The impurities in the waste materials, including arsenic, have caused the
concrete to crumble. 'If we knew a house had mundic concrete, we would say
no to a mortgage,' says Graves. 'There is no cure except demolition.'
Andrew Hambleton, Bradford and Bingley chief surveyor, says he is wary of
British Iron and Steel Federation houses, which were popular in the 1950s.
They are steel-framed rather than built from reinforced concrete and can
lose stability because the metal tends to rust when moisture gets in.
Nor will B&amp;B offer loans on flats built from high alumina cement, a
controversial cement used in 1970s' flats which was found to lose integrity
if exposed to damp. This is a problem all lenders examine closely.
Hambleton is also cautious about lending on homes built on reclaimed land.
This is not because they are unsound but because they can become
unmarketable, particularly if methane gas starts to seep through as has
happened recently in south Sheffield.
Homes carrying a so-called 'flying freehold' are also unpopular. This occurs
where, for example, a first floor property lies across an alleyway, making
it unclear who owns the land beneath. Some lenders will consider this kind
of property if solicitors can disentangle the complexities of ownership.
Others, such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, refuse to consider them.
All lenders are concerned that they should not be left with a white
elephant, if your property is repossessed.
'We're concerned about being able to dispose of a property should it come
into our hands,' says Matthew White, chief valuer at the mortgage division
of the Bank of Ireland, which admits to having become more cautious in its
approach to lending recently.
'Anything could sell in 1986-87 because the market allowed for it. Now the
market is tough, the fringe properties suffer. The good-looking properties,
with the long leases and so on, have become the most marketable.'
Finally, think twice about that nice, pre-fabricated, reinforced concrete
dwelling you have your eyes on. The lenders speak with one voice on these
properties, which were thrown up in their thousands by local councils during
the post-war years. The 1984 Housing Defects Act listed around 30 types of
pre-fabricated homes that were defective.
A mortgage will be made available only if the property has been repaired
under one of about 70 licenced repair schemes and carries a 10-year warranty
on the repairs. It sounds like a simple solution, but the repairs can cost
tens of thousands of pounds. Some lenders, including the Royal Bank of
Scotland, take a harsher line and will not lend on these homes at all.
The Leeds Permanent Building Society, which is more open on its lending
guidelines than some of its competitors, will lend on repaired
pre-fabricated houses but not on flats made of the same material. Nor will
the Leeds lend on all-timber houses (as opposed to timber-framed houses),
because they are unpopular in the UK, and pose an increased fire risk.

COMPETITION in the personal equity plan market increased this week with the
launch of two unusually structured plans designed to encourage long-term
investment.
Scottish Equitable's new Premier Pep replaces the initial charge - normally
5 per cent of the amount invested - with a flat administration fee of Pounds
45 plus VAT. And even that fee will be waived for those who invest before
September 4.
In most normal unit trusts (and unit trust Peps), investors buy units at the
offer price. When they want to sell, they receive only the bid price,
normally around 6-7 per cent lower. The difference mainly reflects the
initial charge made by the manager.
At Scottish Equitable, investors will pay the 'creation' price. This is
below the offer price but slightly higher than the bid price, to reflect the
cost of actually buying shares for the trust (all shares have their own
bid-offer spread). So investors will still face a spread but, at around 1
per cent, it will be much lower than normal. In addition, those who hold
their Pep for eight years will receive a loyalty bonus, equivalent to 1 per
cent of the bid value of their units.
But Scottish Equitable has to make its money somewhere, and there are some
higher charges which counterbalance these attractions. The first is an
annual Pep charge of 0.875 per cent which is imposed on top of the annual
managers' charge (between 0.75 per cent and 1.25 per cent) on the trust.
The second is a withdrawal fee imposed on those who take out money before
the end of the fifth year. The charge in years one and two will be 4 per
cent of the amount encashed. It will be 3.5 per cent in year three, 2.5 per
cent in year four and 1.5 per cent in year five.
It seems a good idea to introduce fees that encourage investors to hold
their Peps for the long term. The question is whether the extra annual
charge will outweigh the benefit of the reduced initial spread.
Much could depend on the performance of the trusts. Scottish Equitable
allows investors a choice of six: UK Blue Chip, High Income, UK &amp; Global,
European, Europe 2000 Tactical and Ethical. All but the two European trusts
have above-average performances for their sectors over two years.
Metropolitan Unit Trust Managers has launched a new personal equity plan
with an unusual structure. The Triple A Pep is designed for those who are
prepared to commit their Pep allowance to Metropolitan for a number of
years.
In the first year, Metropolitan 'allocates' only 85 per cent of the
investment. This is on top of the 6 per cent initial charge on the unit
trust. The effect is that, if you invest Pounds 1,000, the immediate re-sale
value is just Pounds 790.
In subsequent years, however, Metropolitan will allocate 104 per cent of
your investment to units. This means effectively that Metropolitan is giving
up most of its initial charge on the investment. The immediate re-sale value
of a second year Pounds 1,000 investment would probably be just shy of
Pounds 980. Metropolitan says that, compared with a traditional Pep, its
plan structure starts to make savings after five years and keeps improving
thereafter.
The investment performance might well prove more important than the charges.
In this case, the Pep is based on Metropolitan's Eurogrowth Plus fund
(managed by Mercury Asset Management), which has been 14th out of 88 in its
sector over the three years to August 1.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Two scripts with a common theme - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Lees and Dr John White could happily have swapped scripts for
their results presentations this week. GKN and BBA, two of the UK's
strongest automotive components suppliers, reported encouraging jumps in
profits for the first half that exceeded market forecasts. Both have
benefited from painful cost-cutting that was begun early in the present
recession, and both have reaped gains from tight cash management with a
significant fall in interest charges. Marginal increases in turnover
compared with the rise in profits bear testament to the hard-won
achievements of both groups.
There has been little or no help from market demand and market forecasts
remain gloomy for the balance of the year. But both BBA and GKN have gained
from higher market penetration, with new business won early in the 1990s now
coming on stream.
Such diligence has won scant reward this week, however. GKN's share price
gained ground ahead of its results' announcement but, after a short-lived
bout of excitement, news of its 37 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 65.1m was met with a 12p fall in the share price to 383p at the close
on Wednesday. The price had lost further ground by the close last night.
The BBA share price moved ahead by 8p to 133p last Monday, helped by the
release of news of its 26 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33m,
but much of the gain had been lost by the end of the week.
Both GKN and BBA are advancing through means of self-help, but analysts
remain cautious about the groups' prospects given the absence of any support
from the markets. According to White, the BBA group managing director, there
is 'no firm evidence of any generalised recovery.' The belief is echoed by
Lees, the GKN chairman. 'Although conditions in certain of our markets in
the first half of 1992 were rather better than a year ago, in others they
deteriorated so that overall there was little change.'
With a strong balance sheet and a positive net cash flow, GKN is seen as a
low risk - although still rather expensive - buy into recovery. The question
is one of timing, and Lees is more pessimistic than three months ago. 'We do
not expect the demand pattern we are currently experiencing in our principal
markets to change materially in the next few months,' he says. 'So, profit
improvement must come from increases in market share and continued rigorous
attention to costs and asset management. That is a formula with which we are
growing increasingly familiar.'
Both BBA and GKN recorded their main profit progress in their automotive
component operations, where they have established world leadership in
particular narrow niches. BBA claims a world share of some 35 to 40 per cent
for some friction materials for brakes and clutches. GKN is the world leader
in the supply of constant velocity joints, with a world market share of
around 30 per cent.
BBA's automotive sector, which accounts for 49 per cent of group sales and
42 per cent of operating profit, improved its profits in the first half by
36 per cent on sales that rose by only 5.5 per cent. At GKN, its automotive
and engineered product division raised its trading surplus by 77 per cent,
helped by lower rationalisation charges and start-up costs. Sales rose by
only 6.5 per cent.
The key to caution over the short-term prospects for the components'
suppliers lies in the forecast vehicle market development for the rest of
the year, and GKN had little good news. Already in the first half of the
year, increases in car production of 4.6 per cent in North America and of 5
per cent in west Europe were not matched by registrations, which were
slightly lower in both cases. Now, in the second half, the German car
market, in particular, looks at risk.

The number of unit trust Pep savings schemes has increased by 40 per cent
over the last 12 months, according to a survey conducted by the Unit Trust
Association. Sales of unit trust personal equity plans were boosted by the
Budget change which increased the limit for such plans from Pounds 3,000 to
Pounds 6,000. By the end of June, the value of unit trust personal equity
plans had reached Pounds 2.46bn, spread among over 1m accounts.

<TEXT>
The state retirement age for women should be raised to 65, the same as for
men, according to the recommendations of the Social Security Advisory
Committee this week.
The committee, which advises the UK government on pensions policy, said that
the estimated Pounds 3bn in cost savings should be used to help the poorest
pensioners, who are mostly women penalised by low pay and interrupted
service in their working lives. The SSAC rejected pensions industry
suggestions that the government adopt a so-called flexible decade of
retirement between 60 and 70. In 1990, the European Court ruled in the
Barber judgment against gender discrimination in occupational schemes; the
EC is drafting a directive for member states on the issue.

Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange have fallen sharply over the past
six weeks, ending one of the most impressive bull runs in South America. The
stock market increased by 396 per cent in 1991 but so far this year, share
prices have fallen by 11.2 per cent. In July alone, equities lost one-third
of their value, bringing the market's capitalisation down to Dollars
23.35bn, from a peak of Dollars 32.13bn in mid-June. This is despite a good
economic background with growth forecast at 6 per cent and low inflation.
Observers believe that profit-taking and a political setback for the
government when it failed to win a Buenos Aires by-election in June, sparked
the downturn.

Shares in Tokyo fell once again yesterday, with the Nikkei average falling

reinvested. And only four unit trusts in the sector can report gains over a

FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Federal figures fail to fool financiers - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a tense week waiting for the July employment figures, there appeared
to be something for everyone in the report when it finally came out
yesterday.
Taking the headline numbers first, the national unemployment rate - the most
politically sensitive number in the economic calendar (especially during an
election year) - fell from 7.8 per cent in June to 7.7 per cent last month.
The second most important component of the report, the non-farm payrolls,
showed an increase of 198,000 in the month.
Finally, June's horrible 117,000 decline in non-farm payrolls (remember,
this was the figure that panicked the Federal Reserve into slashing interest
rates and sent President Bush's poll ratings into even steeper decline) was
revised to show a drop of just 63,000.
On the surface, these were good numbers. Although modest, the fall in the
unemployment rate was welcome, even if it is too early yet to tell whether a
sustainable downward trend is developing. The big jump in payrolls, the
largest one-month gain since December 1991, looked great but the number came
with a big asterisk alongside.
The payrolls data included a one-off boost from a federally-funded summer
jobs programme for teenagers. Without this, payrolls would have been up
123,000 - a decent number but not quite the near headline-grabbing rise that
White House spin doctors hailed as so encouraging.
One Treasury official, Sidney Jones, the assistant secretary for economic
policy, went so far as to say that the 198,000 jump in payrolls, plus the
revision to the previous month's estimates, proved that the damaging June
employment report was 'somewhat misleading.' No mention from Jones, of
course, that this month's report was also somewhat misleading.
The financial markets were not fooled that easily. The fact that bond prices
rose sharply after the unemployment figure was released indicated that
Treasury investors saw little in the report to dissuade them from the notion
that the economic recovery remains anaemic (to use Bush's own words).
A closer look at the jobs report revealed several reasons why the bond
market liked it so much. There was a big drop in construction and durable
goods manufacturing jobs and the average of factory hours worked was flat,
as were monthly earnings. These figures confirm that the economy's engine is
barely turning over, even with the lowest interest rates in three decades.
The stock market, meanwhile, all but ignored the data, which was neither
good enough to offer real sustenance nor bad enough to warrant a major
sell-off. Equity investors have had their attention focused on corporate
earnings this week and, generally, they did not like what they saw.
Disenchantment at various second-quarter performances lopped more than 50
points off the Dow between Tuesday and Thursday.
General Motors topped the list of disappointments. The giant car-maker
reported a net loss of Dollars 357m, but that was after a previously
announced Dollars 749m restructuring charge at its Hughes Aircraft
subsidiary.
Ultimately, the pre-charge profit was below the average of analysts'
forecasts, but what upset the market the most was what the GM chairman had
to say about the outlook for the rest of the year. Robert Stempel warned:
'Sustaining the rate of progress we experienced in the first half of this
year . . . appears extremely challenging."
This says a lot about the economy which, if it were in a normal
post-recession pattern, should be on a steady upward growth path by now. If
GM expects to find it difficult maintaining its first-half improvements in
the second six months of the year, the economy obviously is stumbling when
it should be lengthening its stride. GM's share price was quick to reflect
the new-found pessimism about the company's earnings outlook. By midday
yesterday it had fallen Dollars 5 on the week, or 12 per cent, to Dollars 36
3/4 amid heavy selling.
The second big corporate disappointment of the week was Hewlett-Packard. The
computer group announced late on Thursday that it expects its latest quarter
results to come in well below analysts' estimates because of uneven demand
across all its business lines.
The warning shocked the market, which had been delighted by
Hewlett-Packard's exceptionally strong previous two quarters. Consequently,
the company's shares took a savaging, falling Dollars 11 5/8 , or 16 per
cent, to Dollars 59 7/8 in just two hours of trading yesterday.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: National Savings still has an edge - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT SO long ago, a report of a change in National Savings rates would have
struggled to qualify as a brief in most newspapers, even on a slow day.
Nowadays, it makes the front page.
The building societies have been complaining about the excessive competition
and the government has caved in twice, once by cutting the return on its
First Option bond and now by slashing rates across the range.
There is a nice irony here. Most retailers and manufacturers are complaining
that British consumers are saving, not spending. But the traditional
recipients of British savings, the building societies, are claiming that
they are being starved of inflows.
One explanation is that consumers have been repaying debt. But the problem
is compounded for building societies because they have been trying recently,
while interest rates have been high, to favour their borrowers. They know
only too well that high mortgage rates depress the housing market and lead
to bad debt problems and repossessions.
On occasion, as happened in February this year, the societies have cut
mortgage rates in anticipation of a reduction in base rates. Since then,
mortgage rates have been around 0.7 of a percentage point above base rates,
compared with a more normal margin of 1 percentage point.
Late in the 1980s, the societies could have made up this margin by
penalising savers. At that time, the government was in budget surplus and
had no need to offer competitive rates on National Savings. But now the
government has to finance a Pounds 28bn to Pounds 30bn budget deficit,
National Savings is once more a handy fund-raiser.
As we have argued many times, some of the recent National Savings products
have looked very good value for savers. And plenty of British savers have
agreed. The government has raised Pounds 2.1bn via this route since the
start of the financial year.
This week, the 37th issue of certificates, which paid 8 per cent per annum
tax-free if held for five years, was withdrawn. The new 38th issue will go
on sale from August 24, paying 7.5 per cent. But only Pounds 5,000 can be
invested in the issue, compared with Pounds 7,500 in the 37th. (An
additional Pounds 10,000 can be reinvested from matured certificates
immediately.)
In line with the new issue of certificates, the overall return on the yearly
plan will fall to 7.5 per cent per annum.
Series D Capital Bonds, which paid a taxable 10.75 per cent per annum if
held for five years, have also been withdrawn. The new Series E, available
from August 24, will pay 10 per cent. For basic rate taxpayers, this means
the return will be the same as on the 38th issue of certificates - 7.5 per
cent.
But note that you have to pay tax on this issue before you receive the
interest, which is available only when you cash in the bonds. And higher
rate taxpayers will do better to buy the 38th issue.
The 5th index-linked certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent per
annum on top of inflation if held for five years, are still on sale. Whether
they are a good deal depends if inflation averages above or below 3 per cent
between now and 1997.
Issue B of children's bonus bonds, which paid 10.9 per cent per annum over
five years, has also been withdrawn. The new Issue C will pay 10.1 per cent.
There were also cuts in the rates on income bonds (from 9.25 per cent to 9
per cent) and on the investment account (from 8.5 per cent to 8.25 per
cent). The changes will take effect on September 18 and August 19
respectively.
You can now get better (variable) rates at a number of building societies
than from National Savings. As the table on page V shows, Bristol &amp; West is
paying 10.45 per cent (a net 7.84 per cent) on Pounds 2,000 and 10.9 per
cent on Pounds 25,000.
There are also some fixed-rate products available, although not for as long
as five years. Coventry BS, for example, is paying 10.75 per cent, fixed
until October 31 1993, on investments over Pounds 1,000. And some guaranteed
income bonds can offer better fixed rates over five years. If you have
Pounds 50,000 to invest for that period, you can get 8.6 per cent from
Liberty Life.
But average savers who keep their money in a major building society will
still have to work hard to beat National Savings rates. Take the Nationwide,
which yesterday cut rates to savers by around 0.4 of a percentage point.
Someone with Pounds 10,000-Pounds 25,000 in its CapitalBuilder account will
earn just 9 per cent gross, or 6.75 per cent for a basic rate payer.
Indeed, savers will need to be alert to get the best rates over the next few
years. For one thing, the Germans are bound to allow European interest rates
to fall eventually. And, second, financial institutions are offering ever
more sophisticated products which may disappoint unwary investors.
That point was emphasised by the Consumers' Association this week in its
criticisms of the standard of financial services' advertising as 'abysmal.'
Savers should heed its warnings: check the small print, treat claims and
statistics with caution, and watch out for what the ads don't say.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Shaky sterling is stretched to limit - London
Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANCEL THAT golfing holiday in the Algarve. Do not follow John Major to a
Spanish villa. If you have to go abroad, go to Italy - but you must not
spend very much. Spending money abroad is unpatriotic. Every time a holiday
maker swaps his pounds for escudos or pesetas, the Bank of England will have
to buy them back.
The prime minister might just be displaying a 'crisis, what crisis?'
nonchalance by heading for the sun this weekend. It follows a report last
Sunday of a (rather unconvincing) view he holds that sterling will one day
be the strongest currency in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Readers with longer memories will recall that, after the 1967 sterling
devaluation, travellers were limited to taking Pounds 50 abroad in any one
year - although you could get a lot further on Pounds 50 in those days than
now. For a start, even after that devaluation Pounds 1 was worth Dm 9.60.
On Wednesday this week, sterling closed at its lowest level against the
D-Mark - 2.825 - since joining the ERM in October 1990. While that is still
well above the pound's theoretical floor against the D-Mark, sterling was
stretched to the limit against the escudo in the ERM. Only central bank
intervention kept the pound within its limits.
So, a sterling devaluation is again up for debate. August would seem an
unlikely time to pick for a realignment. And, at the moment, the central
banks appear able to see off sellers of the pound. But the autumn could well
see the argument raging once more, especially if the French vote against the
Maastricht treaty on European unity in their referendum in September.
Sterling can probably hang on until after the summer holidays, but then some
hard decisions will have to be taken. At the moment, each solution seems to
lead to higher, not lower, UK interest rates. There are three simple routes:
Sterling is devalued within the ERM, but then credibility is lost and
interest rates are forced up.
Sterling is held where it is within the ERM, but that might mean putting
interest rates up, as the Italians did.
Sterling leaves the ERM, interest rates are cut, the economy surges,
inflation bounds ahead, and Britain is back in exactly the same mess it was
before the pound joined the ERM. Then interest rates go up.
The concern over sterling is one of the reasons for the black mood this week
in the stock market, which fell 49.5 points to 2350.1 on the Footsie index.
Another, related, one is the debate over how to get the economy moving.
Since slashing interest rates is not really an option, the latest fashion is
to dream up a scheme to revitalise the housing market.
Another three were put forward this week and, strangely enough, all came
from people who have lent a lot of money to home-buyers: the Abbey National,
the National Westminster Bank and the Woolwich Building Society. Even more
strange, they think the government - for which read 'taxpayer' - should pay.
So far, only the National Savings investor has paid anything, as interest
rates were cut this week on a range of products in another attempt to stave
off a mortgage rate rise.
There is a grain of moral force to the argument that the government should
pay. After all, whose idea was it that the nation should become a
property-owning democracy? Even so, the mortgage lenders' pleas sound
remarkably like the whingeing in which banks indulged when the Third World
debt crisis broke and, again, when loans to companies began to be
re-financed. At least Sir John Quinton, the chairman of Barclays bank -
which, on Thursday, announced a Pounds 1.1bn bad debt provision in its
first-half results - had the honesty to admit that a fair chunk of that was
down to poor lending decisions.
It is apparent now that there was a lot of that going on in the housing
market late in the 1980s. And, to that extent, the pain might reasonably be
borne as much by the lenders as the borrowers, who seemed to regard a house
as a kind of inflation-linked pension fund that could also be lived-in.
Perhaps schemes to sort out the negative-equity housing problem should
borrow some ideas and terminology from the Third World debt and corporate
re-structuring experience. Did the banks repossess Brazil? How about
debt-for-equity swaps?
Sir John managed to upset the stock market with another remark on Thursday
when he suggested that economic recovery might not start until well into
1993, or even 1994. Add that to British Petroleum halving its dividend the
same day - the last time it cut its dividend, it had the First World War as
an excuse - and the market has a lot to worry about. BP's shares fell 10p on
Thursday and another 11p yesterday, closing at 186p.
It is all the more depressing when a company announces good results and
still suffers a share price fall. On Wednesday, GKN, the car components
group, lifted its interim profits 37 per cent to Pounds 65.1m - better than
most expected - but still saw its shares fall 12p to 383p that day and
another 10p since, ending the week at 373p.
The problem is that however effective cost-cutting and productivity drives
are, there is no real substitute for economic growth. And, in common with
most other companies, GKN cannot see that coming yet. So, cyclical stocks
are out of favour once more and it is back to the defensive sectors.
Thursday was the bad day for news, but Friday was the worst day in the stock
market with a fall of 27.5 points. The week ended with Footsie clinging
desperately to the 2,350 benchmark.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 8 per cent fall in the price of NTT was only the latest chapter
in a sorry tale. From a high of more than Y3m, the shares in Japan's
domestic telephone company have fallen to just over Y500,000, leaving
institutions and individuals stranded. With NTT the most widely held share
in Japan, further declines are bound to have an impact in confidence and
delay the return of investors to the market.
However, the reasons for the latest fall are largely technical. Speculators
had earlier bought stock hoping that foreigners would follow when ownership
restrictions were eased this week. That did not happen, and the traders were
forced to sell. Institutions have also been discreetly realising losses in
NTT while they can be offset against gains in the government bond market.
Where NTT has fallen, the rest of the market need not follow.
That said, there are still reasons for concern. As the Nikkei falls towards
15,000, the health of the financial system is once again in question.
Particular attention is focused on real estate companies and trust and
credit banks. The ministry of finance is resisting arguments which would
help the banks that the government should support land prices by acting as a
buyer of last resort. By contrast, manufacturing earnings may be approaching
their nadir, and further share price falls among these companies should be
limited. If that gives succour to investors, the danger to the banks should
not be forgotten. It is still too soon to call the bottom.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK building sectors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Careless talk costs lives; loose talk of a fresh rise in the mortgage rate
costs further misery for quoted housebuilders and building material
businesses. The two sectors have been among the most dismal stock market
performers since the general election as hopes for an early let-up in
interest rate pressures disappeared. Building material shares are now just
over half what they were at the peak in July 1987. The contractors' paper is
worth less than a third of its value five years ago.
It would be nice to believe that the worst is now behind. The shake-out has
been severe by any standards, with bears hitting out indiscriminately ahead
of next month's interim results season. The trouble is that with scant faith
in the market's earnings, dividend or net asset value forecasts, it is hard
to see where the buying will come from in the short term.
From the anecdotal evidence of the past few weeks, investors are worried
that there are shocks on all these counts in store, and are equally nervous
about 1993. Uncertainty is spreading about the impact on profits of a
further round of rationalisation as stronger companies increasingly seek to
match capacity to lower levels of activity. Only very brave investors will
touch the contractors; leading material companies such as RMC, Redland and
Blue Circle may well prove to be cheap on a medium-term view.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect it is surprising that a solid and well spread business such as
Unilever managed to outperform so sharply in the dizzy stock market
conditions of the late 1980s. Amid a welter of provisions, chopped dividends
and forecasts of unending recession, however, it seems natural that its
class should shine through. Yesterday's 14 per cent rise in second-quarter
profits not only left the shares 10p higher at 953p; these
better-than-expected results put the price back within 2 per cent of its
all-time high.
Unilever, to be sure, can put much of the gain down to increased efficiency
and a lower interest charge. Borrowings have come down by Pounds 900m over
the past 12 months on the back of healthy disposal proceeds and a tight
working capital squeeze. There were also special factors in the company's
favour, such as the right weather for ice cream sales and a relatively
indifferent comparative quarter in the US. On the other hand, the profit was
struck after an estimated Pounds 20m of exceptional restructuring charges -
a heavier burden than this time a year ago - while better volumes were
achieved in most parts of the globe. Consumer products generally fared
better in this respect than the company's industrial interests.
On this showing, Unilever is still set to make around Pounds 1.95bn for the
year, which puts the shares on a multiple roughly 10 per cent higher than
the market average. Given that Cadbury Schweppes is on a premium of more
than 20 per cent to the market - albeit reflecting slightly more exciting
growth prospects - Unilever's rating does not seem excessive.

FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: In charted waters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If you believe the chartists, the equity market is now teetering on the edge
of a black hole. Yesterday the FT-SE flirted with the 2,445 low reached just
before Christmas. If this level were breached, chartist theory shows no
obvious sign of resistance until 2,150, from where prices rallied during the
Gulf war. With present low volumes, the market might just be tempted to try
to prove the chartists right. Then again, equities would look ridiculously
cheap with the index at 2,150.
The yield ratio between equities and gilts would fall to 1.6 times, against
1.75 times at present and a long-term average of around 2. The prospective
p/e for the market as a whole would fall from perhaps 13.5 to little over
12.25. Logic suggests that buyers would step in before these levels were
reached, though it would help if there were some more encouraging news
around.
The interim results season has so far produced figures roughly in line with
forecasts but a worrying tendency for negative comment on the trading
outlook. Yesterday's company insolvency figures show a rate of attrition
which, while stable, is still unacceptably high. Sterling remains pinned to
the bottom of the ERM grid. The Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged at
its latest council meeting but it could still decide on another turn of the
monetary screw. Uncertainty ahead of France's Maastricht referendum on
September 20 is an almost surplus excuse to do nothing. Shares are marked
down in the hope of finding buyers, but none come forward. Still, if that
gives the chartists their chance, canny investors will look for bargains.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Gold
finds support after steep slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD and platinum markets appeared to take a very relaxed view of the
'week of action' in South Africa, the biggest producer of both metals, and
prices fell steadily for most of the week. But values steadied on the final
day, encouraging the view that gold's recent technical uptrend was still
intact.
Dealers said US investment funds had been pulling out of gold, and with
their evacuation virtually completed by Thursday market professionals were
left yesterday to trade largely among themselves. Their reluctance to carry
short positions into the weekend was evident and sentiment was supported
early on by hopes, later justified, of moderately constructive monthly US
employment figures. Also encouraging buying was renewed tension over Iraqi
weapons inspection and relief that key support at Dollars 348 a troy ounce
had withstood a severe test on Thursday.
These factors combined to lift the gold price by Dollars 2.30 to Dollars
350.95 an ounce, but that was still Dollars 7 down on the week. Platinum
responded to gold's advance to reach Dollars 377.25 an ounce at the
afternoon fixing, up Dollars 3.25 on the day but down Dollars 8 on the week.
Gold's earlier fall had been influenced, though not as much as might have
been expected, by the Uruguayan central bank's announcement on Monday that
it sold 50,000 ounces last month, having adopted a new reserve policy
involving a switch out of the yellow metal and into fixed term deposits
denominated in US dollars and D-marks.
Among the base metals copper came under pressure from the beginning of the
week as striking workers at Poland's KGHM combine, who had been threatening
to intensify their action, suggested they might suspend the stoppage. But
the fall was arrested on Tuesday after the London Metal Exchange announced
that stocks of copper in its registered warehouses had fallen another 4,600
tonnes to a 15-month low of 246,750 tonnes. Copper stocks had been falling
for several weeks but traders were expecting a reversal of that trend
reflecting the normal slow-down in manufacturing activity during the
northern hemisphere summer. They did not have long to wait, however.
Yesterday's LME report showed a 1,750-tonne rise in copper stocks.
In the interim copper's struggle to stay above the equivalent of Dollars
2,510 a tonne for three months delivery had been aided by the emergence of
Chinese buying and the three months price had recovered from Monday's low of
Pounds 1,318 a tonne to Pounds 1,339.50 a tonne, hepled by sterling's fall
against the dollar. After yesterday's stocks news, and with sterling
rallying, the price fell back to close at Pounds 1,326.50 a tonne, down
Pounds 10 on the week. In dollar terms the three months price was down
Dollars 6 on the week at Dollars 2,518 a tonne.
A 3,036-tonne rise in LME stocks of nickel, taking the total to a fresh
record of 38,022 tonnes, came as little surprise yesterday as traders had
been expecting recent arrivals of Russian metal to appear in the figure once
they had been cut into shape. The cash nickel price closed at Dollars
7,347.50 a tonne, up Dollars 20 on the day and down Dollars 2.50 on the
week, but traders said further falls were to be expected following the three
months position's failure to break resistance at Dollars 7,450 a tonne
earlier in the week.
The London Futures and Options Exchange's cocoa market began the week in
something of a quandary, with the return of Ivory Coast selling supporting a
bearish view and concern about continuing dryness in west Africa arguing for
a price rise. In the end the New York bulls won the day and despite reports
of further Ivorian sales, plus some from Ghana, the December price ended the
week Pounds 29 higher at Pounds 667 a tonne.
'Everyone knows (the producing countries) have done a fair bit earlier this
week, so I don't see them wanting to come back in until around Dollars 20 to
Dollars 30 above here,' one trader told the Reuter news agency.
The depressed state of the world rubber market prompted the buffer stock of
the International Natural Rubber Organisation to make support purchases
yesterday for the first time in eight months. As a result prices steadied a
little in Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo.
But there were doubts that the upturn could be sustained, especially as the
buffer stock manager had admitted that he could only afford to buy 20,000
tonnes. Some traders thought it odd that he should choose to reveal how
limited his resources were as that clearly reduced the impact of his
intervention in the market.

FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPOSITE insurers were lower ahead of interim figures next week as worries
over the groups' high exposure to mortgage indemnity problems prompted yet
more cuts in profits forecasts by brokerage firms. Royal Insurance and Sun
Alliance were the principal casualties, the former losing 17 to 167p and the
latter 7 to 251p.
Smith New Court has reduced its 1993 forecast for Royal to Pounds 7m from
Pounds 80m and believes it will announce a nominal one penny dividend at the
interim stage against 11.25p last year. It has almost halved its 1993
estimate for Sun Alliance to Pounds 96m. Insurance analyst Mr Steven Bird
said; 'The realisation that the economy will remain in recession for longer
than expected means the mortgage indemnity crisis will also persist for
longer.'
General Accident opens the reporting season on Tuesday and is generally
expected to cut its loss to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 52m against Pounds
101.5m in first half 1991. It is forecast to maintain its interim dividend
at 9.7p, but faces some pressure to cut the final. The shares fell 5 to
380p. Analysts expect Guardian Royal Exchange to reduce its interim dividend
to between 2.25 and 2.45p from 4.4p. The stock held steady at 116p.
Vodafone wanted
Cellular telecoms group Vodafone held up well in a weak market after
analysts were told, at the company's annual meeting, that a radical price
restructuring would be announced next Thursday. The move is Vodafone's
response to rival Cellnet's announcement of several weeks ago which detailed
its own revamped pricing policy.
Behind the restructurings are both companies strategies for increasing
levels of domestic users, which provide only some 10 per cent of income, and
to head off the threat of the new localised telecoms system PCN (Personal
Communications Network) due to be introduced from mid 1993.
Analysts suggested yesterday that Vodafone could attempt to stimulate the
consumer market by extending off-peak times and reducing line rents, while
at the same time increasing peak rates for business users - with the aim of
leaving overall revenue steady while widening the service's attraction.
However, others warned that Cellnet, owned by BT and Securicor, was likely
to respond to any new iniative and that two of the new PCN operators, Cable
and Wireless and Hutchinson Whampoa had the reserves to fight a lengthy
price war. Yesterday, Vodafone remained at 327p, fully-paid BT shares
slipped 3 to 334p, Cables dropped 6 to 518p and Securicor slipped 2 to 813p.
Further consideration of Barclay's results prompted the shares to lose much
of Thursday's post-figures gain and slip back 10 to 324p. Lehman Brothers
has cut its 1992 profit forecast by Pounds 150m to Pounds 350m and
recommends using any strength in the shares as an opportunity to switch into
Lloyds (which rose 2 to 384p) or Abbey National (off 4 at 265p).
Heavy trading continued in BP as the shares sought a level following
Thursday's dividend cut. Yesterday, BP closed 11 down at 185 1/2 p with
volume of more than 68m recorded on the SEAQ electronic ticker, making a
combined turnover of 142m during the past two days.
There are signs that some UK securities houses are modifying their hostile
attitude to the company following the measures announced at the
second-quarter stage. Mr Fergus MacLeod of County NatWest feels the company
has moved from a position of over-optimism to over-caution and says:
'Recession is already there in every part of BP and there will be a recovery
story.' On the other hand, there are hints that US brokers, who had been
attracted by the relative cheapness of the stock, might be tempering their
enthusiasm.
Shell Transport shed a further 7 to 454p following disappointing results
from Royal Dutch/Shell. Nomura believes the stock is expensive on a yield
relative basis.
ICI firmed 3 to 1145p. Kleinwort Benson rates the stock a strong hold at
around the 1150p level.
Rothmans International was also a bright spot with the shares rising 9 to
1039p as they hit the bottom of their trading range.
British Airways followed the market trend easing 3 to 254p ahead of next
week's release of its first-quarter results. The range of forecasts for the
period April to June is from Pounds 90m to Pounds 120m with Smith New Court
predicting Pounds 112m.
Engineering group Siebe fell 19 to 598p, with securities house UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew reported to have been the day's big seller. TI Group gave up 8 to
268p on accountancy concerns.
Fears that Simon Engineering was unlikely to maintain the year-end dividend
caused a sharp fall in the shares. They gave up 18 to 167p, on good turnover
of 2.1m. Dividend worries were also in evidence at Meggitt where the shares
eased 7 to 67p. A recent stock overhang in Weir Group appeared to have been
cleared and the shares jumped 18 to 456p.
Drinks group Grand Metropolitan added 5 to 417p as dealers said that a large
line of stock had finally found a home. The shares were also helped by Smith
New Court reiterating its buy stance and switch advice from Kleinwort Benson
out of Guinness. Shares in the latter dropped 5 to 530p.
More suggestions that Forte was stepping up the search for younger members
for its board stopped the seemingly relentless slide in the shares, which
were steady at 139p.
Rank Organisation rose 11 to 575p as some advised a short-term buy.
After Thursday's bout of downgrades, Thorn EMI edged a penny to 712p, with
some talk that one of the more savage cuts had brought a strong reaction
from the company.
Good figures from Unilever enlivened a dull food manufacturing sector, where
downgrades accompanied the gloomy economic sentiment. Unilever's profits
came in just ahead of market expectations, with European sales particularly
strong. However, most analysts appeared to be happy with their estimates and
stayed around the Pounds 1.9bn range. The shares climbed 12 to 953p.
A BZW downgrade in Northern Foods, put the group under further pressure
following 'take profits' advice from several brokers in the past week. BZW
is looking for a Pounds 155m profit this year against a previous estimate of
Pounds 159.5m. The shares tumbled 21 to 520p.
BZW also turned from buyer to hold on the food retailing sector. Among those
retreating Argyll shed 9 to 338p, William Low, 14 to 188p, and Sainsbury 8
to 445p.
In stores, Burton was subject to a severe pruning from Kleinwort Benson
which lopped Pounds 13m from its profits forecast down to Pounds 15m. The
shares eased 2 1/2 to 30 1/2 p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew advised a switch to
Boots from Marks and Spencer. The former steadied at 424p, the latter
dropped 6 to 309p.

FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Account closes with further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS overnight in Tokyo and New York added to the misery of the UK stock
market which suffered further losses yesterday and barely managed to hold on
to the FT-SE 2,350 mark as the equity trading account came to its close. For
most of the session, London shared the general misfortune of the other
European bourses, but rallied after Wall Street came in with an early gain
of 17 points on the Dow Average.
Footsie 2,350 is an important testing level for the stock market; it was
first achieved in February 1991 and if it is lost, the charts show little
support above the 2,150 mark. The warning was conveyed to traders at morning
meetings of the leading securities firms and thence to institutional
clients. At Strauss Turnbull, for good measure, Mr Ian Harnett said that the
firm was cutting its year-end forecast on the Footsie to 2,650, on the view
that its previous, more bullish forecast, now required too many positive
developments.
Share prices opened lower against the backcloth of a 408.17 drop in the
Nikkei and 24.6 fall in the Dow Averages overnight, but then turned
significantly lower as the Footsie 2,350 mark came into play.
With this benchmark level soon lost, the market fell into gloom and there
was little further move until Wall Street came to the rescue with a gain of
17 Dow points in London hours. The UK market rallied thankfully from the
day's low of 2,344.9 to close at 2,350.1 for a net loss of 27.5 on the day.
The trading account which ended last night has seen the Footsie shed just
over 1 per cent, with most of the fall suffered this week as the cut in BP's
quarterly dividend and the heavy loan loss charges at Barclays Bank have
shaken the confidence of investors.
Trading volume has remained moderate, although Thursday's equity retail
total increased to Pounds 1bn. Yesterday's Seaq volume of 480.3m shares was
above recent totals but the figure includes intra-market business.
BP continued to fall and gloom over the economy and UK interest rates
brought further losses among store, building and construction issues.
However, Unilever stood out well after disclosing quarterly trading results
and ICI, Grand Metropolitan and Rank Organisation were also firm. Sharelink,
Britain's largest execution-only stockbroker, commented yesterday that
private investors were, on balance, buyers of equities.
Retail volume has continued to disappoint, as investors shy away from the
flow of unsettling trading reports from leading companies.

FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUING worries over the economy and on the corporate trading front
caused a further retreat in stock index futures as the account drew to a
close, writes Joel Kibazo.
The sombre mood took hold early in the session as the first trade in the
September contract was struck at 2,378, some 8 points below Thursday's
close. A brief squeeze to 2,384 soon gave way to the sellers, Morgan Stanley
and Salomon said to have been among them.
September continued to drift lower into the afternoon session, reaching
2,353 by 2.30pm, which proved to be the low point of the day.
However, a buyer closing positions helped the contract reverse the downward
trend, as did a firm Wall Street, and September eventually closed at 2,360
down 25 on its previous close and around its fair value premium to cash of
about 12. Turnover at over 9,000 contracts was helped by buying just before
the official close.
Traded options were dull with turnover reaching only 20,569 contracts. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 10,653 lots. BP was the busiest stock option at
1,140 lots and the January 200 calls the most active series.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH RATES in the sterling money market softened across the board yesterday
after the Bank of England was highly accommodating in its discount market
operation and the Bundesbank President suggested that there might be no
Lombard rate rise in the near future.
Short-dated rates softened after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of
Pounds 1.16bn in the morning and saw most of it removed in the early round.
One-month money briefly fell below the base rate figure of 10 per cent for
the first time in many weeks. It closed at 10 1/32 per cent on the offered
side, compared to a previous close of 10 3/16 per cent. Three-month money
closed at 10 1/4 per cent, compared to a previous close of 10 3/8 per cent.
Rates were softer further out, although dealers put this down to comments
from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, who defused
speculation that the central bank would embark on another monetary squeeze
by raising the Lombard rate. 'I can only say that from the way things look
now, we see no reason to raise this rate,' he said. Boosted by these words,
6-month money closed down  1/16 per cent on the offered side at 10 3/8 per
cent, but 1-year money closed unchanged at 10 7/16 per cent.
Sterling futures contracts dipped at around lunchtime following the
poorer-than-expected US non-farm payroll figure for July. This forced the
dollar down by about a pfennig on the foreign exchanges undermining sterling
in its wake. The September contract bottomed out at 89.62, 2 basis points
down from its opening level, but closed back at 89.64.
The softening of rates may prove short-lived, however, as a large number of
UK indicators will be issued next week underlining the gloomy outlook for
the UK economy.
In its money market operations, the Bank of England dealt at the established
rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent for the

in band 1 bank bills, Pounds 116m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 444m in
the repo for resale on 26 and 27 August. The forecast was then revised to
Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 108m in Band 1. There was late
assistance of Pounds 275m.

FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: Den Danske Bank moves to
stabilise confidence

<TEXT>
DEN DANSKE Bank has brought forward publication of its half-year interim
report in the hope that this step would stabilise international confidence
in the Danish banking system.
This follows Thursday's announcement of a DKr1.5bn (Dollars 897m) first-half
loss by Unibank, the country's second largest bank, and the resignation of
the bank's chief executive.
Danske reported a pre-tax profit of DKr6m, down from DKr1.5bn in the first
half of last year, but Mr Sorensen described the result as 'satisfactory in
the circumstances'.
The result was drawn down by a loss on the value of securities of DKr335m.
Last year, this item lifted profits by showing an increase of DKr1.29bn.
Mr Knud Sorensen, Danske's chief executive, as well as the chairman of the
Danish Bankers' Association, yesterday dismissed suggestions that the
situation in Danish banking is comparable with Norway and Sweden.
'Of course, there is not a Swedish-Norwegian situation in Denmark. The
Danish banks are much better capitalised,' he said. Danske's capital
adequacy ratio is 11 per cent and Unibank's is 10.6 per cent.
The result this year included the encouraging news that loss provisions have
fallen to DKr1.04bn from DKr1.34bn last year. Provisions this year are equal
to 0.56 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees.
This year's report includes an extraordinary costs item of DKr228m, which
covers redundancy payments. Staffing at the bank will fall by 10 per cent
this year. The staff cuts contributed to a fall in the bank's operating
costs of DKr100m to DKr3.29bn.
Mr Sorensen declined to make a forecast for the rest of the year but he
noted that loss provisions were likely to remain high.
The group's balance sheet total was reduced by DKr20bn to DKr357bn, mainly
by bringing down engagements with foreign banks. Deposits increased by
DKr6bn to DKr152.9bn, while advances fell by DKr15bn to DKr168.5bn,
reflecting a cautious lending policy, said the bank.
Hafnia, Denmark's troubled insurance group, announced that staffing in its
Danish companies would be reduced from 2,500 people to 2,000 this autumn.

THE RECESSION and special charges reduced George Weston's second-quarter

The Weston family's main Canadian holding company earned CDollars 3.8m
(USDollars 3.22m) or 3 cents a share, down from CDollars 51.3m or CDollars
1.06 a share a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 2.68bn against CDollars
2.6bn. Both periods included special items. On an operating basis profit
fell 43 per cent to CDollars 38.8m.
Canadian Tire, a national retailer, also felt the impact of the recession,
earning CDollars 43.1m in the second half, against CDollars 68.5m a year
earlier.

FT  08 AUG 92 / International Company News: GTE to sell its lighting
operations for Dollars 1.1bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GTE, the US telecommunications group, has agreed to sell its worldwide
lighting business to Siemens of Germany and a consortium of international
investors advised by London-based Citicorp Venture Capital in two separate
deals worth Dollars 1.1bn.
GTE put the business, best known for its Sylvania brand light bulbs, up for
sale last September, saying it wanted to focus its resources more fully on
the telecommunications business.
Osram, the Munich-based light bulb subsidiary of Siemens, will buy the North
American part of the business, which has operations in the US, Canada and
Puerto Rico.
The international consortium, which is taking the name of Sylvania Lighting
International, will acquire the operations in Europe, the Far East, Latin
America and Australia.
GTE declined to name members of the investor group or break out details of
the two transactions, but Osram is believed to have paid the larger amount.
The Dollars 1.1bn includes the assumption of about Dollars 100m in debt.
Osram will increase its sales by some 70 per cent, to about Dollars 3bn,
through the deal, and boost its employment from 16,400 people to about
29,000.
GTE is getting a little less than Wall Street forecast when the business was
put up for sale, but analysts yesterday said they were glad the company had
finally got out ot the lighting business.
The deal excludes two other subsidiaries in GTE's electrical products group,
Valenite, which makes cutting tools, and Control Devices, which makes
circuit breakers. They have a book value of about Dollars 200m.
GTE said that when these were sold, the group expected to 'break even' on
its electrical disposals, with no charge or gain against the division's
Dollars 1.4bn book value.
The divestiture is the latest of many disposals of non-core assets in recent
years by GTE, which has simultaneously been building up its
telecommunications assets, most notably by the Dollars 6bn acquisition of US
regional group Contel in 1990, and last year's deal which gave it operating
control of CANTV, the Venezuelan telephone company.

<TEXT>
ERICSSON of Sweden yesterday announced a link-up with Toshiba to install and
service equipment for Japanese digital mobile telephone networks, in a joint
venture which they said could lead to further areas of co-operation.
The unit, Ericsson Toshiba Telecommunication Systems, will be 60 per cent
owned by the Swedish company. It expects sales of Y32bn (Dollars 251.9m) in
1994, the year its prime customer, Digital Phone Group, is due to begin its
service.
Ericsson, which claims 40 per cent of the world market in cellular mobile
telephone systems, was already under contract to Digital Phone to supply
base stations and exchange systems to its first two operating areas in Tokyo
and Osaka.
Digital Phone, which has backers including the national Japan Railways,
plans a countrywide service by the year 2000.
By then, Toshiba expects some 10m sets to be in use in the recently
deregulated sector with Digital Phone competing against Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, the semi-privatised domestic telecoms utility, and three or four
others, not all of which would have a nationwide network. Digital Phone is
to begin by serving Tokyo, Osaka and the Tokai area of central Japan.
Manufacture of the systems, which will incorporate Toshiba parts, will stay
in Sweden and outside the venture, although at a press conference in Tokyo
yesterday the companies said this could be reviewed later. Toshiba's
production of cellular handsets is excluded from the deal.
Mr Shiro Matsuo, a Toshiba senior vice-president, said it would 'like to
take this as the basis for exploring further possibilities together'. Mr
Gunnar Eriksson, head of Ericsson's radio systems side, said it did 'not
want to limit co-operation' to the one project.
Both sides described Toshiba's 40 per cent minority stake in the venture as
an 'appropriate' level.

RECORD output enabled Placer Dome, the Vancouver-based precious metals
producer, to shake off lower gold prices and post a one-third rise in
second-quarter earnings.
Placer's share of production from 15 mines in North America, Australia,
Papua New Guinea and Chile reached 505,000 ounces in the second quarter, up
from 399,000 ounces a year ago. Thanks largely to rising production at the
30 per cent-owned Porgera property in Papua New Guinea, the company now
expects its share of output from all mines to reach 1.9m ounces this year.
Earnings rose to USDollars 24m, or 10 cents a share, from Dollars 18m, or 8
cents a share, a year earlier. The latest figure includes Dollars 7m in
gains from the sale of investments, and severance costs of Dollars 5m. Sales
climbed to Dollars 259m from Dollars 236m. Cash flow from continuing
operations rose to Dollars 74m from Dollars 69m.
The average realised gold price slipped by 8 per cent to Dollars 371 per
ounce, but this was offset by a steep drop in cash production costs from
Dollars 231 to Dollars 184 per ounce, which marks the lowest level since
late 1987. The company said that production volumes and unit costs were
likely to improve further at the Kidston and Granny Smith mines in
Australia, and the Bald Mountain, Campbell and Dona Lake properties in North
America.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: European side behind 14% rise by Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, increased pre-tax profits
14 per cent in the second quarter to Pounds 511m, due mainly to an improved
performance by its European operations.
In the half-year to June 30, pre-tax profit rose 10 per cent to Pounds 888m.
Mr Michael Perry, chairman, said the progress would be sustained in the
second half. However, he said: 'We perceive little evidence of economic
recovery in a number of our important territories.'
The second quarter profit compares with Pounds 448m in the same quarter a
year ago and was earned on sales of Pounds 6.15bn (Pounds 5.81bn). The
half-year profit, which compares with Pounds 806m a year ago, was earned on
sales of Pounds 11.6bn (Pounds 11.2bn).
In Europe, operating profit rose to Pounds 354m (Pounds 336m) on sales of
Pounds 3.67bn (Pounds 3.48bn) in the quarter. The group said a fall in
half-year operating profit to Pounds 614m (Pounds 642m) on sales of Pounds
6.91bn (Pounds 6.72) reflected the disposal of its packaging businesses.
Mr Perry described as excellent the performance of the ice cream business in
Europe, which had benefited from good weather. Results in the region from
personal products, speciality chemicals and German operations were also
good.
However, meal components and professional products suffered from the warm
weather and slow economic growth. In general, Unilever's consumer operations
fared better in Europe than its industrial activities.
In North America, quarterly operating profit edged up to Pounds 74m (Pounds
69m) on sales of Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The half-year figure rose to
Pounds 91m (Pounds 79m) on sales of Pounds 2.27bn (2.24bn). Unilever said it
gained volume and share in margarine, toilet soap and several other
products. Recovery continued in personal products, particularly at the upper
end of the market.
In the rest of the world, Unilever said quarterly operating profit was
depressed by exceptional items, growing to Pounds 105m (Pounds 98m) on sales
of Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.14bn). Half-year profit advanced to Pounds 232m
(Pounds 194m) on sales of Pounds 2.47bn (2.21bn).
Sales of detergents and personal products grew strongly in Latin America,
and results in Argentina were particularly good. Losses in Japan declined on
improved results from detergents and personal products, though food
performed less well.
Earnings per share rose six per cent in both periods to 16.98p (15.98p) for
the quarter and 30.07p (28.42p) for the half year. Operating margins
remained at 8.7 per cent in the quarter but fell to 8 per cent (8.2 per
cent) in the half year.
Net interest fell to Pounds 84m (Pounds 145m) in the six months, reflecting
lower interest rates and continuing reduction in net debt, which declined by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 1.5bn during the second quarter.
Unilever made 12 acquisitions and 17 disposals in the six months, at a net
cost of Pounds 67m. The interim dividend will be announced with third
quarter results in November.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fairway Group, the USM-quoted distributor of business and computer
stationery, maintained its pre-tax profit at Pounds 656,000 in the opening
half of 1992, against Pounds 655,000 last time.
That came from doubled turnover of Pounds 14m (Pounds 6.76m), as GLS Fairway
and Tonbridge Trade Binders were included throughout the period.
Although GLS achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 138,000 in June, it
incurred a loss of Pounds 10,000 for the six months; last year only June was
included for which there was a profit of Pounds 109,000.
The directors said it seemed likely that significant profits would now be
made by GLS in the second half and orders for July supported that.
Earnings per share fell to 1.49p on increased capital (2.68p) and the
interim dividend is again 1p.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Etonbrook EGM defeats rebel shareholder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The extraordinary meeting of Etonbrook Properties yesterday defeated
attempts by a rebel shareholder to change the board.
However, the board's proposals to repay preference shares failed by 2.8 per
cent to achieve the 75 per cent required.
Mr Jonathan Harris, chairman of the former BES company which came to the
market last year, said he would put the proposals to shareholders again.
The restructuring would enable the company to make a 25p per share capital
repayment and a 2.75p dividend.
Mr Andrew Perloff, who through three companies and a personal stake controls
15 per cent of Etonbrook, had urged shareholders to vote against the capital
restructuring and remove the chairman and Mr Keith Moss, managing director.
He said information from the accounts showed that companies associated to
its directors had taken Pounds 1.5m in fees since 1988, compared with
payments to ordinary shareholders of Pounds 105,342 over the same period.
The company argued that the fees were partly due to the ordinary running of
the company, and partly a board incentive set up under the BES.
Mr Perloff also failed to secure a seat on the board for himself and Mr
Malcolm Bloch.

<TEXT>
HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader, bus and coach body builder and distributor,
has agreed an export and technical deal with Volvo Bus, the bus
manufacturer.
Yesterday was the second closing date of a Pounds 22.9m hostile bid for
Henlys from T Cowie, a rival motor trader with bus and coach activities. The
offer was extended to August 14.
Cowie's 1-for-2 share offer is worth 60 1/2 p per Henlys share. Cowie's
shares closed yesterday at 121p, down 3p, and Henlys' at 69p, down 1p.
The export agreement involves Volvo Bus acting as distributor for Henlys'
Plaxton coaches in Europe and around the world, with a target of 200 coaches
a year, worth Pounds 15m. This is to run for five years from October 1.
Henlys currently only supplies the UK market for coaches, but has been
looking to build up exports.
There is also a technical co-operation agreement, under which Volvo will
provide two production managers for Plaxton's plant in Scarborough.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Venezualan charges put Young Group in the
red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE underlying business performing badly and the need to provide heavy
exceptional and extraordinary charges, particularly for its Venezuelan
investment, Young Group incurred an attributable loss of Pounds 6.71m in the
six months ended May 30.
Turnover at this USM-quoted coal mining group fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds
21.6m) and the trading outcome, after interest, went from a Pounds 756,000
profit to a Pounds 952,000 loss following a small deficit in the second half
of last year. On top of that were exceptionals of Pounds 2.93m for a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 3.88m, and extraordinaries of Pounds 2.82m.
The UK opencast sites suffered both tonnage and quality difficulties
stemming from the geological and mining problems experienced last year.
However, as a result of actions taken the remainder of 1992 was expected to
show a recovery, said Mr Robert Young, chairman.
Of the exceptional charges Pounds 1.33m was for trading losses of the
operation in Venezuela. The mine did not perform well, Mr Young said, and
production was poorer than expected, with consequent severe cash flow
problems for the group.
Because of those changed circumstances, the option agreement for Peabody,
the US coal producer, to acquire the Venezuelan subsidiary had been changed.
Instead of being exercisable until next May at a price of Dollars 6.6m, it
could be exercised this October but at Dollars 3m, and that write-down
resulted in the extraordinary provision.
Losses per share were 40.83p (earnings 5.56p). There is no interim dividend
and there is unlikely to be a final or preference payment for the year.
Previously, there was an interim of 2.6p.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Still banking on being able to take off - A
look at Davies &amp; Newman, which has seen its share price slide to 12p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the sorriest sights in the recession-depressed stock market are
companies which once looked great recovery plays.
Davies &amp; Newman Holdings, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is an extreme
example. After nearly going bust, it was virtually refloated last October in
a Pounds 49.3m equity issue that swamped the old shareholders - notably the
Newman family.
With debt greatly reduced and Pounds 20m pre-tax profit forecast for 1992
(after losses of more than Pounds 35m in both 1990 and 1991), the issue
price of 50p looked very attractive, indeed one disgruntled shareholder
described it as a giveaway. It represented a prospective p/e of four and was
only a third of the opening price on the day the rescue was announced.
Yesterday the share price closed at a new low of 12p.
The background was described by Mr David James, the company doctor-chairman,
at the annual meeting on May 29. 'In our listing particulars we drew
attention to the fact that passenger traffic generally grows at twice the
rate of gross domestic product. Whereas we had adopted the widely expected
GDP growth of 2.6 per cent to give passenger growth of 5.2 per cent, the
growth so far in 1992 has been negligible.'
Results forecasts have been continually downgraded. One forecast obtained
this week was for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7m.
Questions have been raised about whether the Pounds 35m bank credit facility
will be adequate to see the company through the traditional winter drain on
cash, and about whether bank covenants will be breached.
Speculation has even surfaced that D&amp;N may have another October crisis - its
third in a row - and return to shareholders for cash.
Mr James stresses that 'there is no cash problem'. He says only a small
percentage of that Pounds 35m facility is being used and the cash position
will continue to improve until the autumn. 'The seasonal best position is
mid-September to late October, the worst is mid-April to mid-May.'
Previous crises arose in October because the old bank facility expired at
the end of that month. The new facility runs until December 31 1993.
Will the company stay within its Pounds 35m limit? 'I am looking at the
maximisation of cash resources. I have not said to shareholders that I am
turning to them for additional support. I am looking at other strategies
within management control and I am confident that we shall have adequate
resources.'
He added that with two years of recession in view, he was planning not only
how to cope with the borrowing peak in April 1993, but also with that of
April 1994.
What about banking covenants? There is only one and it has 'a formula which
links to an expectation on profit'. There can be no breach until the audited
results for 1992 are declared in May next year.
The most recent figures for borrowings came in the 1991 annual report. On
December 31, gearing stood at two-thirds of shareholders' funds of Pounds
42.8m. The Pounds 29m debt was split between bank borrowings and finance
leases for the aircraft. The Pounds 35m limit only applies to the bank
loans.
A great deal of faith is placed in Mr James's ability to negotiate with
bankers, a view enhanced by the Pounds 180m debt-for-equity swap that he
pulled off last week for one of his other charges - Lep Group, the freight
forwarding and security concern.
In D&amp;N's case, some good will is also expected from the banks. The issue
proceeds paid off a chunk of debt and nearly Pounds 9m was paid in 'special
fees'.
As for the lessors, one analyst commented that it was a buyers' market and
some airlines had even negotiated moratoria on payments.
Mr James says that his close dialogue with bankers and other financial
supporters has never ceased. And if anyone wonders how he has time for such
discussions on behalf of both D&amp;N and Lep, not to mention Eagle Trust, he
says: 'It's largely the same banks,' with Lloyds and NatWest as the most
heavily involved.
While the stock market view of D&amp;N looks dire, some reassurance about
Dan-Air's recent operations is offered by Mr John Olsen, appointed chief
executive in April.
On the charter side, 'although the market is volatile, our participation is
satisfactory'. In the scheduled sector, towards which Dan-Air is shifting
its emphasis, quite a strong recovery is emerging after a poor first half
for all carriers.
Dan-Air had one or two particular problems in the first half, for instance
with its marketing effort prior to Mr Olsen's arrival. The threatened launch
of a rival airline also caused some nervousness.
A much improved performance is in prospect for this quarter on the back of
leisure traffic. Whether business travel will recover in the autumn is
another question.
Shareholders may, however, derive more comfort from the thought that D&amp;N has
some attractive assets in its strong position at Gatwick airport and its
portfolio of European routes. One recent buyer of the shares said the gamble
this time rested more on the prospect of a deal with another airline than on
erstwhile recovery hopes.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Roger Smith, chairman of Trimoco, the Dunstable-based motor dealer, has
written to shareholders advising them 'to ignore any documents or
announcements which may be issued by Hartwell or its advisers and to take no
action in regard to the offers.'
Trimoco said that the terms of the offers, which are 17.5p a share for the
outstanding equity and Pounds 175 for each Pounds 100 nominal of the 11 1/2
per cent guaranteed convertible unsecured loan stock, significantly
undervalued the company.
Hartwell, a fellow motor dealer, is ultimately owned by a discretionary

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Flagstone Holdings, the marine and leisure, property and light industrial
services group, fell deeper into the red in the year to January 1 with
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.5m against Pounds 934,000.
The directors said that because of uncertainty over future working capital
and the possible uncertainty over the realisable value of the assets, the
auditors were expected to qualify their report. In the meantime, the
directors were not drawing salaries.
Although turnover rose to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 956,000) cost of sales were
Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.06m). In addition, this time there was a Pounds
625,000 investment property write-down and a Pounds 400,000 exceptional
debit. Losses per share deepened to 1.58p (0.68p).
A wholly-owned subsidiary, Universal Shipyards (Solent), is disposing of the
demonstration yacht, Universal Hartbeat, for Pounds 40,000 in cash to Fawdry
and Evans (Management), in which Mr John Harding, managing director of
Flagstone, is interested.

Following the completion of the reorganisation phase of its development
plan, Oglesby &amp; Butler, which makes and distributes electrical, electronic
and gas-powered tools and accessories, returned to the black in the year to
March 31.
Net profits were IPounds 277,000 (Pounds 260,000) compared with losses of
IPounds 372,000 previously. The directors said that further cost reductions
and reduced inventory levels had been achieved following the plan to invest
in equipment to make certain equipment in house.
They said they were committed to developing the group, further strengthening
the balance sheet and restoring dividend payments.
Sales, which fell from IPounds 4.33m to IPounds 3.62m, 'must await improved
conditions in world markets' for growth. Earnings per share amounted to
2.39p (3.2p losses).

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: SEET reduces losses to Pounds 630,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at SEET, the Edinburgh-based textile company, were halved in
the year to April 30. However the shares still shed 6p to close at 42p.
On turnover of Pounds 7.14m (Pounds 5.94m) pre-tax losses were Pounds
630,000 (Pounds 1.25m). Losses per share were 15.6p (24p). An extraordinary
profit of Pounds 260,000 (Pounds 123,000) cut the attributable loss to
Pounds 364,000 (Pounds 840,000).
Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, said that Peter MacArthur and Co. had made good
use of the increasing popularity of tartans to increase sales and profits
and now had a healthy order book. Kenneth Mackenzie Holdings increased
turnover and reduced its losses significantly.
The Homemaker retail side, in which SEET has a 46 per cent interest,
reported a small trading profit for the year.
As expected the sale of Homemaker did not take place but SEET has reached
agreement with the original vendors under which it has received Dollars
350,000 from the vendors and Dollars 150,000 from Homemaker. Further
payments totalling Dollars 900,000 are due over the next four years provided
Homemaker remains within the group.
Should Homemaker be sold before August 1996 SEET will receive 65 per cent of
the proceeds. In the present year Mr Mackenzie said that all companies were
trading at a more profitable level than in the comparable period.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Results from West Trust for the year ended March 31 1992 reflect the
diversification into the food industry with the acquisition of Bart Spices,
and the reduced dependence on textiles via the sale of the largest
subsidiary, Indo African Exports, to management.
There was a loss before tax of Pounds 113,000, compared with a profit of
Pounds 458,000. Continuing businesses made an operating surplus of Pounds
250,000 (Pounds 342,000) and discontinued activities incurred a loss of
Pounds 112,000 (profit Pounds 362,000).
Turnover on continuing activities came to Pounds 6.48m (Pounds 6.18m) while
the discontinued side produced Pounds 8.49m (Pounds 10.2m).
Losses per share came to 0.17p (earnings 0.79p) but the dividend is again
0.25p on increased capital, as indicated in February.
Mr Philip Lovegrove, chairman, said Bart Spices contributed Pounds 55,000
before tax, which was one month as part of the group. Its performance in the
current year was well up to expectations and should produce an improved
result.
Conditions in the textile industry remained depressed, so that net profit of
the two retained subsidiaries was Pounds 48,000. Indo African incurred a
loss of Pounds 112,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOLESALE Fittings, distributor of electrical goods, is cutting its final
dividend from 13.39p to 8.47p as pre-tax profits for the year ended April 30
1992 dropped from Pounds 4.26m to Pounds 2.51m.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 11.7p, a decrease of 29.6 per
cent and representing the whole of the earnings per share. Last year the
payment was 16.62p from earnings of 19.7p.
Mr Dennis Rose, chairman, said the group's financial position must be
maintained and improved, and it would not be appropriate to pay a dividend
in excess of earnings.
Sales slipped to Pounds 62.2m (Pounds 63.3m) and the chairman believed that
was a creditable performance, particularly as the high rate of business
failures had meant introducing an even firmer policy of vetting potential
customers.
Trading margins remained under pressure - operating profit fell to Pounds
2.21m (Pounds 4.24m) - and bad debts were abnormally high.

FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kalon predicts extra Pounds 5m for merged
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON Group yesterday said that combining its operations with those of
Manders if its hostile takeover was successful, would add at least Pounds 5m
a year to the pre-tax profits of the enlarged group.
The forecast profits increase came as the paint group increased the terms of
its bid. The offer now values rival Manders group at Pounds 93.7m or 254p,
down from Pounds 95.6m because of the fall in Kalon's share price yesterday.
Kalon increased and made final its offer of 17 of its new shares for every 6
Manders shares, compared with its original 8-for-3 offer.
Kalon also introduced a partial cash element, which comprises 14 new Kalon
shares and 300p cash for every 6 Manders shares and values the offer at
Pounds 95.6m or 259p a share.
The new partial cash alternative values Manders at the equivalent of where
the all-share offer closed on Thursday night with Kalon's share price at
91.5p.
However, Manders share price remained resolutely stuck below the offer
prices, and even fell yesterday from 244p to close at 238p.
Manders said the offer remained inadequate.
A Kalon adviser described the bid as 'a hostile merger', and added: 'We have
said to Manders shareholders that we will give you a fair share of the
merged cake and we will manage your assets better.
'We are not there to buy them out for cash and it's really an argument about
management.'
The bid closes two days early on August 21.

Sir, Doubtless the gloomy words of Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays

Should we not ask how it can be that a person gifted with such remarkable

FT  08 AUG 92 / All because the lady loves: A tale of power, passion and
chocolate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Vorsprungli durch Heirat (a little progress through marriage).'
There is nothing peculiarly Swiss about this situation - it is human,' said
a well-informed Zurich businessman yesterday.
He was referring to the strange case of Mr Rudulph Sprungli, the autocratic
chairman of the Swiss confectionery group, Lindt &amp; Sprungli, whose marriage
last week to a woman 28 years his junior provoked a slump in the group's
shares and the resignation of its respected chief executive.
It is a tale that combines those eternal and ever-troublesome themes - love,
greed, ageing, power, religion and chocolate. Not surprisingly, it has
enthralled Swiss society in the middle of an otherwise soporific summer.
It all started last spring when the 72-year-old Mr Sprungli divorced his
wife of 45 years and announced his engagement to a 44-year-old sometime
adherent of a US-based theosophical sect called 'I AM'.
Within days, it was reported that his betrothed, Ms Alexandra Gantenbein,
had been advising him privately on top management appointments, with the
implication that the company was being infiltrated by 'I AM' adherents. Mr
Sprungli promptly called off the engagement and called in a firm of
accountants, KPMG Fides, to investigate.
All went quiet until 10 days ago when Lindt &amp; Sprungli issued a statement
saying that KPMG had concluded that decisions on executive appointments were
made by authorised directors. But it added a quotation from the KPMG report
to the effect that 'Mrs A Gantenbein, occasional member of the 'I AM'
movement, gained some importance and influence in decisions over top manager
positions'.
Then, late on Monday afternoon Lindt &amp; Sprungli announced that the couple
had been secretly married the previous Friday. Within 24 hours, the group's
shares had lost nearly a tenth of their value and the chief executive had
resigned.
Although the couple, the company and the resigning chief executive have not
been willing to shed any light on these events, the Swiss media have
proceeded to speculate with a confidence that comes of living in a fairly
tight-knit community.
As to Mr Sprungli himself, it is a matter of record that some 12 years ago,
at 61, he stood down as group chief executive, saying that one of the 10
deadly sins in a family company was to leave unsettled the question of a
successor. He stayed on as chairman. In an interview last April he admitted
that the succession was still undecided and he was remaining active.
Indeed, his continued interventions in day-to-day management have led to a
high level of turnover of senior executives. Mr Ulrich Geissmann, who left
the company yesterday, had been chief executive for little over a year. In
the previous six years, there had been four chief executives and a frequent
rotation of other top employees, with departures said to stem from
'differences of opinion' or some similar phrase.
In the spring of 1991, the chairman's eldest son and heir apparent, Rudolf K
Sprungli, then marketing director, left the company to become managing
director of another food group. 'We have grown a bit apart,' Mr Sprungli,
pere, admitted in April.
As for Ms Gantenbein and 'I AM', various reports have emerged in the press,
of which the most tantalising is that she had married a Swiss businessman in
1986 when he was 77. He died 16 months later, leaving her some SFr4.5m
(Pounds 1.7m).
The sect to which she belongs was founded in Chicago in the 1930s and its
followers believe that people carry within themselves the divine spirit. Its
Zurich reading room, in a non-descript office building in a seedy part of
town, has been tightly shut this week.
As amusing as the story is, it has serious aspects. Lindt &amp; Sprungli sales
last year reached just under SFr1bn; it employs more than 4,000 people and
has factories in Germany, France and the US as well as in Switzerland. A
trade union representative said there was a growing feeling of unease among
employees.
At the moment, the group is in remarkably good health. Profits were up 20
per cent last year to SFr23.5m and the dividend was raised for the seventh
year in a row. But all is obviously not well.
'It is a familiar situation,' a Zurich businessman said yesterday. 'The
chairman has passed his prime, but the board is too weak to do anything
about it.' Problems of succession in family companies are not uncommon in
Swiss business. A long-running struggle at Movenpick, the restaurants and
hotels group, was finally resolved last December when the family sold its
stake to a German businessman.
The five-strong Sprungli family controls almost 50 per cent of the company's
voting shares and has a pact to vote together. Until now, the family has let
Mr Sprungli have his way, but the ex-Mrs Sprungli, who is thought to be the
biggest single shareholder, may be losing her patience, company observers
believe. She was unhappy about her son's ejection last year, they say.
Among those embarrassed by the affair is Credit Suisse, the group's bank. Mr
Kurt Widmer, a Credit Suisse director, sits on the Lindt &amp; Sprungli board.
Observers say the bank has been an effective supporter of the Lindt shares
this week. By yesterday's close, the bearer shares, having been as low as
SFr10,900 on Wednesday, had recovered to SFr13,000, SFr800 higher than at
the end of last week.
Credit Suisse also has close relations with Nestle, the Swiss food and
confectionery group, leading to press speculation of a possible Nestle
takeover. Nestle has refused to comment, but such an outcome seems unlikely
on competition policy grounds.
Thus, it could take some time for this steamy tale of power, passion and
sugar to cool down. One Zurich newspaper predicted yesterday that the new
Mrs Sprungli would be in the chief executive's chair at Lindt by next month.
'Absurd,' said the company in one of its rare comments these days.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Private sector porridge: Government plans to shake up the
prison service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rioters who tore apart Strangeways Prison, Manchester, during the 1990
disturbances were dismantling Britain's prison system to a far greater
extent than they realised.
The rebuilding of Strangeways has enabled the government to make a bold move
in attempts to reshape prison management and industrial relations. It
announced this week that the public and private sectors will be invited to
submit rival bids to manage the new prison.
Many public sector trade unions grew weaker during the 1980s; the Prison
Officers Association (POA) was not one of them. With a reputation for being
hard-line and behaving as an equal to the prison service management in
determining how prisons are run, it has traditionally been seen as one of
the biggest barriers to change in the service.
The Strangeways announcement is the latest evidence that the government has
no plans for a miners-style confrontation with the prison officers. Reform
will be pursued through introducing variety into the way prisons are run,
and strengthening the service's management.
Members of the POA immediately assumed that the Strangeways contract was
bound to go to a private company to advance the government's efforts to
experiment with private prison management. There might, however, be a still
bigger prize for the government if the public bid succeeds and can be used
as a stalking horse to introduce new working arrangements in the public
sector.
The Home Office prison department's chances of continuing to run Strangeways
 -and probably the chances of the POA being represented there - depend on it
producing, with the union's co-operation, an imaginative bid outside
existing working arrangements. Were this to happen the effects would be felt
throughout the service, particularly on the POA.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, who became home secretary in April, sees reform, of
Britain's prisons as one of his priorities.
Senior management was criticised in Lord Justice Woolf's report on the riots
at Strangeways and elsewhere, which spoke of 'frequent complaints from
managers and staff of a lack of visible leadership'.
The union was often criticised in private by some of Mr Clarke's
predecessors, who accused it of being obstructive and opposed to change. But
they recognised that its members did a job most people would never volunteer
for, and were armed with considerable industrial power through their
preparedness to stop doing it.
Prison life is rough, tough, sometimes utterly rotten. Britain has some good
jails; it also has others where inmates are locked three to a cell without
internal sanitation for most of the day.
Some reports by Judge Stephen Tumin, the government's own chief inspector of
prisons, read as though they had been lifted from a Victorian bookshelf. In
a report on Dartmoor in June he expressed himself 'aghast' that the same
brushes had sometimes been used to clean plates, eating utensils and
toilets, and found the bath houses so deplorable that he recommended their
immediate closure.
The lifestyles of corrupting and depressing institutions affect staff and
inmates alike. Social stability in prison is built around understandings
negotiated between prisoners and between prisoners and officers. A frequent
criticism of the officers is that, behind the prison walls, they use their
trade union strength to impose working arrangements which reflect their own
interests.
'I suppose what concerns the government is that we remain a strong trade
union with the capacity to represent our members effectively,' says Mr David
Evans, the union's general secretary. 'We are not going to compromise on
that. But we are not fighting the government. We have told Mr Clarke we are
willing to examine any proposals that would contribute to the effective
running of the prison service.'
Naturally, the union does not believe it is the central problem of the
prison service; neither do present home office ministers. Mr Peter Lloyd,
the prisons minister, says his own experience in private industry suggests
that when a union is accused of being over-powerful it usually reflects
deficiencies in management.
Evidence to support this view came in this week's report of the inquiry into
brutality at Ashworth high-security hospital, Merseyside. The report spoke
of POA members filling a vacuum left by managers who had little power.
In 1987 the prison service began introducing the optimistically-entitled
Fresh Start, a new pay, working hours and conditions package. While this has
produced some efficiency improvements, it has also provided fresh
opportunities for disputes over staffing levels.
Fresh Start maintained the style of negotiated change which still
characterises industrial relations in the service. The sign that the
government was prepared to use more radical methods came with legislation to
allow the private management of remand prisons.
Wolds, on Humberside, opened as Britain's first privately-managed remand
prison in the spring: its management Group 4 Security, its staff represented
under a single-union deal with the GMB general union rather than the POA.
The government has already extended the scope of the legislation by
parliamentary order to allow the private sector to manage newly-built jails
for convicted prisoners. Blakenhurst, in Hereford and Worcester, will become
the first later this year.
Ministers are not treating Strangeways as a new prison covered by this
order. When parliament reassembles, it will be asked to confirm another
order extending the powers of private management to established prisons.
Once this is done, the option of private management will be widely available
in the service.
The government had begun restructuring the prison service before April's
general election under Mr Joe Pilling, a new director-general regarded by
colleagues as a man with strong management skills. A move to agency status
operating at arms-length from Whitehall, will come soon.
To achieve far-reaching change, however, the government must look to the
individual prison level and Strangeways is an important step towards this. A
new governor will be appointed soon to prepare the prison's bid.
Ministers are open minded about how and when to extend the Strangeways
concept of competitive bidding. 'If privately-managed prisons continue to
prove themselves, it would make sense to see where else private management
could be used', says Mr Lloyd.
Before that happens, however, the government will start to devolve
management of public prisons - setting specifications but leaving it to
individual governors to decide how to meet them. This is similar to the way
in which Wolds, Blakenhurst and any other private prisons will operate.
But if governors in state prisons are to be allowed the freedom of devolved
management at anything like the level enjoyed in the private sector, they
will eventually need scope to negotiate their own agreements at local level.
This would present the POA with a dilemma. Local governors would want new
agreements which offered more flexible working practices and challenged the
POA's established power - just as the Strangeways bid will have to do to
succeed.
There would be a natural reluctance on the union's part to go along with
this. But with the decision to allow both public and private sectors to bid
to run Strangeways, the government has a new weapon in its armoury. Local
POA members would know that if they failed to support efforts to modernise
the service, their prison might also become a candidate for a competitive
bid from the private sector.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: No simple answer to care of the very old
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J M MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Cassidy (Letters, July 28) suggests that financial needs of those
who are dependent on others through the effects of age rather than specific
illness could be met from their pension schemes by 'a modest funding rate
applied to the whole of the employee population in a way analogous to that
of providing for death in service'.
This requires the employer to charge against current profits generated by
current employees a benefit for individuals who have not been contributing
to that profitability for some time. If this cost really is small, then the
paternal employer might be happy to do so. But where a business has shrunk
to the extent that, say, half the pension scheme membership are pensioners,
the loading will not be so small.
A longer term solution to pre-fund long-term care benefits alongside pension
benefits is not without its problems. The cost of providing full insurance
is still high, all the more because it attracts no tax concessions, and
younger employees will be reluctant to contribute because they do not see
the need. While small benefits may help those who need extra services
brought to their home, when it comes to residential care such benefits may
only serve to prevent those on low incomes from claiming state support, just
as home ownership does now.
Further, the only way of avoiding the extra administrative burden of
assessing need would be to pay long-term care benefits to all pensioners,
but on an age-related basis. This, though, would increase the cost of the
benefits themselves.
There seems to be no short-term solution, but the possibility of a
longer-term solution on a group rather than an individual basis is already
exercising the minds of some pension practitioners.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: Criticism of MMC competence at variance with
experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON HOMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While I agree with David Sawers' view ('A high-price market', August 4)
that 'the most necessary reform is to give the OFT (Office of Fair Trading)
power to investigate where the restrictive practices exist', I take issue
with a number of his criticisms of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
First, he suggests that the MMC 'can at best be described as unprofessional
and at worst incompetent' and that 'a depressing aura of mediocrity hangs
over the MMC and its staff'. On the contrary, I have always been struck by
the thoroughness and competence of the MMC - an impression that has also
been voiced by clients which I have represented before it. These clients
have been favourably impressed by the commission's depth of understanding of
their industry and the incisiveness of its questioning.
Second, the MMC is criticised for having part-time commissioners. I have
never found this to be a disadvantage. On the contrary, it has helped build
clients' confidence that the commissioners are still in touch with the way
industry thinks and works.
Third, David Sawers refers to the 'rigid legalistic approach' with which MMC
proceedings are conducted. I find this a somewhat puzzling criticism given
the lack of rigid procedures, the possibility for open debate in oral
hearings, and the possibility to contact the MMC at any time during an
investigation - by letter, fax or telephone. If Mr Sawers has found things
too legalistic, I would suggest that this may have more to do with the way
in which particular companies and their legal advisers went about the
investigation than with the MMC itself.

<TEXT>
Sir, Was there ever a clearer sign that the financial world lacks leadership
than that displayed by the Abbey National in its proposals for tax credits
to those who sell houses at a loss ('House sales boost urged as prices fall
further', August 4)? It was sad to watch an embarrassed Sir Christopher
Tugendhat making proposals to the government that could only have been
designed to catch the headlines.
So flawed and unworkable is the idea of tax credits for capital losses on
house sales that one shudders at the mentality of those running one of
Britain's largest banks.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: Japanese buyer for County Hall best option, while
LSE should have custom-built school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER H BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You suggest the government is in a dilemma as to what to do about
County Hall ('GLC spectre continues to haunt Tories', August 6). Would that
all dilemmas were so clear cut and so easy to solve.
On one side there is a respected Japanese businessman who wishes to create a
luxury hotel out of County Hall. This will result in capital inflow, work
desperately needed by the building industry and a business which, over the
years, will contribute to the nation's economy.
On the other side, the London School of Economics wishes to stretch its
resources and borrow vast sums at a time when real interest rates are at
record levels. Furthermore, the LSE proposals seem to be postulated on the
sale of real estate within three years at what is generally acknowledged to
be an incredible price. Dare one suggest the LSE faction wishing to go along
this road is, although doubtless brilliant intellectually, perhaps a little
short when it comes to common sense, let alone common prudence.
If the LSE can really lay its hands on tens of millions of pounds for a new
prestigious home, why not build a custom-built school using a renowned
architect? At such a time as now, land, building and indeed professional
services should all be available on highly competitive terms. Given this
outcome all concerned will be winners and London will be able to boast of a
fine new hotel and a fine new LSE.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Letter: If law were changed on lettings it should be across
the board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN PHILCOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, August 6) neatly sidesteps a simple
truth, namely that when times were good in the property market tenants were
happy with the leases they obtained, but with a downturn now wish to move
the goalposts, blindfold the referee, unscore some of the goals and perhaps
take the ball home and not play any more.
Those leases freely entered into, which it is now said are so onerous, are
the leases tenants were happy to sell at a premium when demand exceeded
supply. Did those leaseholders who sold their leases or who obtained a
profit by sub-letting share the profit with their landlord? When inflation
was daily eroding the value of the rent how many voluntarily paid a higher
rent?
Every landlord experiences the leaseholder who stands by every dot and comma
of his lease, and avails himself of every piece of retrospective legislation
when it suits, but defaults and disappears when the going gets tough.
Why should it be inherently unfair for the original leaseholder to be held
responsible for the default of a subsequent leaseholder? Someone receiving a
pension from a company would be justifiably aggrieved if that company were
taken over and the new owner reneged on the company's obligations.
If the market has fundamentally changed, new leases will reflect this.
However Mr Brittan appears also to support the abolition of security of
tenure where leases have expired. Surely if some existing laws protecting
tenants from market forces are to go, this should include the abolition of
all controlled tenancies in the domestic sector, now rent control has here
been largely abolished for new lettings? In other words if there is to be
legislation, why should it not apply across the board?

FT  08 AUG 92 / Balkan minefield for the west: Pressure is mounting for some
form of military intervention to support the Yugoslav relief effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past week, television pictures of detention camps, the forcible
deportation of Bosnian Moslems, the killing of orphans, and the mortar
attack at a funeral in Sarajevo have shocked people throughout Europe and
the US.
Increasingly, public opinion - as well as political parties in European
capitals and in Washington - is demanding that the international community
take measures to stop the fighting and killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
A year ago, when the Yugoslav federal army and Serb nationalists started
attacking Croatia, western governments condemned the fighting. But they
sought a solution through the offices of the European Community, which they
hoped would help negotiate a settlement to the conflict.
Public opinion now believes that the EC's mediating efforts have been a
failure. Western governments are being called upon to do something. But if
action involves some form of military intervention, the questions are, how,
where, and for what aim?
Many EC countries - including Britain, France and Italy - and the US,
however reluctantly, are prepared to send in aircraft (France might even
provide troops) to protect the international humanitarian aid effort
currently being led by the UN, but only with backing from the Security
Council. They recognise that even that commitment carries high risks.
Mr Michael Clarke, head of the Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College,
London, said the military manpower needed to protect a massive humanitarian
effort should not be underestimated.
'If we are talking about opening up two land corridors, in eastern and
western Bosnia, these would have to be manned by three or four divisions.
That's about 60,000 ground troops. I am not so sure there is the political
will to commit such levels of manpower. If these troops were attacked, they
would have to defend themselves,' he said.
The US and Britain are determined not to go beyond supplying aircraft to any
UN-backed relief effort. 'We cannot go beyond providing air back-up for the
humanitarian relief operation,' said a staff member of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee in Washington.
'Let me also mention that we will stick only to supporting a humanitarian
effort. The point is that if we use aircraft to bomb Serb artillery units on
the hills around Sarajevo, we will be effectively declaring war on Serbia.
Do we really want to do that?' he asked. 'And if that were to happen, would
civil war break out in Serbia? There are no easy options or solutions.'
Despite the acknowledged problems inherent in military intervention,
pressure for western countries to become involved appears to be increasing.
'I say, and very reluctantly so, that the consequences of non-involvement in
Bosnia are worse than the dangers of involvement,' said Mr Clarke. 'But we
have to be clear what our goal is.'
This is the nub of the problem.
The US, the EC, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and UN
diplomats in New York have so far failed to identify what they want to
achieve by deploying any form of military force in Bosnia.
Some UN officials and defence experts on the ground in Bosnia believe - in
the short term at least - that military intervention should have two aims.
First, it should be used to support the relief effort. The hope is that the
higher the profile of international military support in Bosnia, the greater
the chance of monitoring, if not reducing, the violence. However, the
continued bombing of Sarajevo in the presence of UN peacekeepers may suggest
that whatever military force is deployed will meet resistance.
Second, military intervention should be coupled with more pressure on the
Serbian leadership in Belgrade and in Sarajevo to control all the Serb
war-lords on the ground in Bosnia-Hercegovina. This might be partly achieved
by preventing logistical support and weapons reaching Bosnia's Serbs through
blocking off the entire airspace between Serbia, Montenegro and
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
But it would also mean trying to disarm Bosnia's Croats, who are backed by
the government in Zagreb. Like Serbia, Croatia is involved in a land grab at
the expense of Bosnia's Moslems.
Despite these limited objectives, Nato officials remain cautious about
becoming embroiled in Bosnia. 'We are agonising over the whole problem.
Public pressure is demanding that we be seen to be doing something. But to
tell you the truth, I still do not know what our level of involvement should
be,' said a Nato official.
'Yugoslavia is a military minefield. I am not even sure it could pacified
with airpower. It would take tens of thousands of ground troops to cover the
terrain. On another level, we are dealing with fanatics on the ground. You
have these crazy, trigger-happy Serb war-lords, heavily-armed Croats and
desperate Moslems. The war in Bosnia has radicalised every ethnic group at
the expense of innocent civilians,' he said.
Other Nato officials said it was unclear how the Serbs would react if a
UN-backed military intervention was launched. One official said the Serbs
would either clearly identify the UN as 'the enemy' and would, therefore,
fight back, or they would retreat rapidly at the sight of well-armed western
forces.
'If you could be sure that military intervention, on any level, would work,
then sure, you could consider it. But you don't want to end up with a
guerrilla warfare,' the Nato official said.
Despite the sense of uncertainty and anxiety about how to respond to the war
in Bosnia, a consensus is emerging: the longer the west prevaricates, the
greater the chance the war could spread to other parts of the Balkan
peninsula.
'I agree that if we do not take any kind of military action, the war will
spread outside Bosnia. I have no doubt of that. The next flash-point is (the
Serbian controlled province of) Kosovo. Maybe even in Macedonia,' the Nato
official said.
Defence analysts in London go one stage further.
'It is not only a question about the war spreading, and many more people
getting killed in Bosnia. It is about Europe's future security policy in
eastern Europe and the Balkans,' said Ms Jane Sharp, a defence expert at
Kings College and at the London-based Institute for Public Policy Research.
She added: 'By not taking direct action of any kind, the west is indirectly
propping up a bully - Serbia. This has an effect on what will happen in the
region as a whole. We are telling potential dictators, in eastern Europe, or
the republics of the former Soviet Union to go ahead with ethnic cleansing
and grabbing land. If we turn our backs on Bosnia now, we will have to pay
the price in the coming years.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / The president's dilemma: Jurek Martin examines the US
response to the conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush's military and political advisers have long concurred
on one thing. There is no part of the world less enticing for US military
involvement than what was Yugoslavia.
The hope was that Europe, with help from the US, would somehow sort out what
is seen in Washington as essentially a European problem. With that hope in
tatters, Mr Bush now faces the dilemma whereby to take no risks might be
worse in domestic political terms and for US standing in the world than, as
one senior official put it this week, 'to roll the dice'.
The pressure on the president intensified sharply this week, though still
perhaps not to the extent of the debate raging in Europe. It was not enough,
for example, to get James Baker, the secretary of state, to cut short his
holiday, but it was sufficient that no presidential response would have been
unthinkable, even if this was not an election year.
Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, the Senate foreign
relations committee acting in bipartisan unity, Lady Thatcher, Jewish groups
and leading newspapers all demanded that the US take the lead in bringing
Serbian aggression to book.
The administration's reaction was initially tentative and contradictory. It
asserted, then denied, it had evidence of atrocities in Serbian-run camps.
Before Mr Bush spoke on Thursday, the best it could do was call for an
extraordinary session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
When he did pronounce, the president was conspicuously cautious, only urging
a UN resolution, backed by force if necessary, to ensure humanitarian relief
for Bosnia. He disapproved of the 'vile policy of ethnic cleansing' but did
not say Serbia must be punished for operating the detention camps.
He coupled this with a determination not to put US military personnel at
undue risk. Yesterday he added that he did not want 'the US bogged down in
any way in guerrilla warfare'. This means any US involvement would be mostly
confined to air power. Any ground presence, the US believes, must come from
European countries, under either a Nato or UN flag.
The reality is that international contingency planning is in its infancy
compared with the blueprints to launch air strikes against Iraq two weeks
ago. Lady Thatcher may urge the use of Nato, but it matters more that John
Major, Mr Bush's staunchest European ally and willing to commit British jets
to any attack on Iraq, remains opposed to anything equivalent in the
Balkans. French and German reservations are also strong.
When a candidate in 1988, Mr Bush once confessed he did not really think he
had been 'tested by fire' in his public life. The invasion of Panama and,
above all, the Gulf war gave him that satisfaction. There is no sign he
wants a third experience in the Balkans. By comparison, even Saddam Hussein
is an inviting prospect.

FT  08 AUG 92 / Man In The News: Scyther with a soft edge - David Simon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When David Simon greeted Prince Charles at the opening of BP's elegant new
headquarters in London's Finsbury Circus earlier this year, guests were
somewhat concerned. BP's then chief operating officer had a black eye.
Perhaps Mr Simon had come to blows with his chairman and chief executive,
the ebullient Mr Robert Horton, one or two observers were heard to mutter.
In fact, Mr Simon had walked into a door.
A punch-up would definitely not have been his style.
There is to Mr Simon something of the John Major: the same sober-suited,
heavy-spectacled, bank manager exterior, the same good humour masking a more
steely edge, and allowing the occasional suggestion of smugness.
The parallels do not end there. Like Mr Major, Mr Simon was a bit player in
his predecessor's downfall, but once the dagger had been wielded, he found
himself thrust to the fore.
Both inherited a ship that had been blown off-course, both were brought in
to mend relations within and outside their organisations, both promised a
more collegiate style of management. Both also promised a change of style,
rather than of substance.
Both, too, moved quickly to jettison some of their former leaders' cherished
dogmas. Mr Major abandoned the electoral liability of the poll tax; and this
week Mr Simon reversed BP's policy of maintaining its dividend, come what
may.
Here, however, the analogy break down. In some respects, Mr Simon has
acclerated his predecessor's programme of overhaul in a way the UK prime
minister has not. Moreover, in contrast to Mr Major's meteoric rise, the new
BP chief reached the top after more than 31 years with BP; and for most of
that time his rise has shadowed that of the man whose job he was to inherit.
Simon was born in London in 1939, the son of an engineer. He was educated at
Christ's Hospital, and, with sponsorship from BP, went up to Cambridge to
read modern languages. He joined BP in 1961, four years after Robert Horton,
and spent his early career in marketing in Europe. After honing his business
skills on an MBA course at the European Institute of Business Administration
in Fontainebleau, he moved around the company before spells as marketing
director in BP Holland, and with BP Oil in the UK.
By 1982 he was chief executive of BP Oil International, and found himself
tackling the losses and oversupply of the group's worldwide refinery
division at the same time as Mr Horton was handling similarly difficult
decisions at BP Chemicals.
Four years later, Mr Simon became the second-youngest group managing
director. The youngest, by three weeks, was Mr Horton.
When chairman and chief executive Sir Peter Walters left in 1990, both Mr
Horton and Mr Simon vied to succeed him. Mr Horton got the job. Mr Simon,
characteristically, agreed to stay on as chief operating officer, enhancing
his reputation as a team player committed to BP.
Mr Horton summed up the differences in personality between the two with his
remark shortly before his appointment: 'Simon is good. I've told him that if
I get the job I'll be happy for him to work with me. If he gets it, there is
no way I am working with him.'
On a personal level, Mr Simon is said to guard his privacy, and is believed
to have disapproved of Mr Horton's publicity-seeking. 'It's not that I
haven't got an ego,' he once confided to a colleague after observing Mr
Horton holding forth for an Italian TV crew. 'It's just not particularly
important to me.'
Unlike his predecessor, he is also careful to maintain a life outside work.
While BP was in turmoil less than 48 hours after the boardroom coup which
ousted Mr Horton six weeks ago, Mr Simon was to be found at his local golf
course.
Associates say he is approachable, popular, and good-humoured, as well as
being shrewd. He can also be ruthless.
'He is not mild-mannered in the sense of insipid or wimpish,' said one BP
insider. 'He is slightly sardonic, and uses irony rather than temper to get
points over.'
When it comes to business, a senior City figure says that Mr Simon is more
of a careful planner than a daring entrepreneur. 'He is not someone to get
carried away about a sexy scheme and embark on it as an act of faith. He
would have to prove on the financial side that it would work.'
He is said to be a prudent man, who abhors debt, and despite his unflappable
exterior is a worrier, with a great deal of nervous energy.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of drinks group Grand Metropolitan, of which Mr
Simon is a non-executive director, summed him up thus: 'David is an
outstanding non-executive, a very interesting combination of the shrewd
strategist, and the thorough and highly analytical operator. He has a
refreshing style matched by a highly entertaining sense of humour.'
These qualities have been noticed by the City, to which Mr Simon represents
a more amenable figure than Mr Horton, and which has offered him several
chairmanships of big companies in recent years. Mr Simon preferred to stay
at BP, even though he was growing increasingly unhappy working with Mr
Horton.
Now, he has the chance to run the company his way, though the programme he
outlined this week had, apart from the dividend cut, more than a touch of
his former boss about it - accelerated job cuts, cost and spending
reductions, and sales of non-core assets.
Employees and shareholders alike will be hoping the style of implementation
will be different from Mr Horton's. Those who know Mr Simon suggest he will
be better able than Mr Horton to carry people with him. It will not be easy.
Rumours are already emanating from BP that after 'Hatchet Horton', the new
chief executive has been branded 'Scything Simon'.
But, warns a colleague, he should not be judged prematurely. 'I see no
reason to believe that David is not behaving with the characteristic guile
of a good chess player. It is just that people sometimes don't realise from
the opening move how good a player someone is.'

FT  08 AUG 92 / Savings restore training centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTING mail second class and making telephone calls after 1pm have helped a
structural engineering company to reopen its training centre for
apprentices.
Cleveland Structural Engineering, a subsidiary of Trafalgar House, the
conglomerate, closed its craft and technician training centre in 1990 while
reducing overheads.
At the time the company, based in Darlington, County Durham, cut its
workforce from 1,200 to 650. Now fears over skills shortages in the industry
 -which fabricates and erects structural steelwork, such as for the new
Dartford bridge across the river Thames - have led the company to reopen the
centre and resurrect a traditional four-year apprenticeship scheme.
Last month 28 craft apprentices and seven trainee technicians started
one-year training off the job. They are soon to be joined by 12 other
trainees who are not employed by Cleveland but whose training is to be fully
funded by Durham Training and Enterprise Council.
A substantial amount of the Pounds 210,000 annual running cost has been
raised by cost-saving measures such as posting all but very urgent mail
second class, using telephones in the cheaper period after 1pm and freezing
the replacement of company cars.
Mr Jeremy Beeton, managing director, said: 'Training is one of the very few
areas of our business on which expenditure will be increased next year.
Without good quality tradesmen, this industry will not survive.
'Because of the serious financial problems of the structural steel industry,
training has been almost totally sacrificed but we cannot afford to neglect
it. Even now, it is difficult to recruit a skilled tradesman who knows how
to weld or cut steel.'

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE and Russian governments maintained an embarrassed silence
yesterday, amid allegations that Russia's third-ranking trade representative
in Tokyo had fled, after police uncovered bribes made to a local trading
company executive.
Japanese press and television reports said Mr Vladimir Davidov, vice trade
representative at the Russian embassy, had sought to buy satellite equipment
and sophisticated memory chips, in violation of Cocom regulations
restricting sales by the west of high technology with security applications.
Attempts to procure 4-megabit D-Ram chips and a relay amplifier for a
communications satellite were claimed to have continued into this year,
after the break-up of the former Soviet Union.
The reports come at an awkward time for relations between the countries. Mr
Mikhail Poltoranin, Russian deputy prime minister, has been in Japan this
week preparing for a visit next month by President Boris Yeltsin, when the
future of the Kurile islands off northern Japan will head the agenda. The
islands were occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the second world
war.
They also coincided with the presentation to the cabinet yesterday of the
Japan Defence Agency's annual report. Although acknowledging that the risk
to Japan's security from the former Soviet bloc had been significantly
reduced, it said arms cuts east of the Urals had not matched those deployed
to the west, and military forces and hardware in the region closest to Japan
had been upgraded.
Mr Davidov's unnamed Japanese contact was described as a 57-year-old
executive of a Tokyo-based electronics sales company who was alleged to have
received some Y1m (Pounds 4,100) cash from him. No merchandise was
reportedly handed over, but the executive is said to face charges of
accepting remuneration for undertaking illicit activity.
Mr Davidov, who had diplomatic immunity, returned to Russia in mid-May. The
Japanese Foreign Ministry had no comment on reports that this was an
immediate result of its conveying a police request to interview him.
The Russian embassy said that, while it would neither confirm nor deny the
allegations, the emissary had finished his term in Japan and was now on
'home leave' in Russia.
The US embassy said merely that it was aware of the case.
Japanese companies have periodically been in the spotlight for sales of
technological equipment to unauthorised countries. Three executives of Japan
Aviation Electronics Industry this week pleaded guilty in the US to the
illegal transfer of jet parts to Iran.

   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A South African prosecutor said yesterday he was examining new evidence of a
state role in the 1985 killing of prominent black activist Matthew Goniwe.
Mr Michael Hodgen said a special police team interviewed unidentified
witnesses provided by newspapers including Johannesburg's Weekly Mail,
Reuter reports from Cape town.
'Our police investigations team. . . is evaluating the allegations made. It
is premature to prejudge what the result of the investigation will be,' Mr
Hodgen said.
The Weekly Mail said it had submitted evidence including the names of state
hit-squad members responsible for the murder of Goniwe and colleagues on a
remote highway north of Port Elizabeth.
Goniwe was among a handful of black leaders who helped to launch a
nationwide uprising against white minority rule.
The New Nation newspaper published an alleged death warrant earlier this
year signed by a senior police officer and ordering that Goniwe be
'permanently removed from society'.
President FW de Klerk ordered Mr Hodgen to reopen inquiries into Goniwe's
killing, which had been dismissed by an earlier inquest as murder 'by
persons unknown'.
The Weekly Mail said its evidence pointed to the now disbanded Civil
Co-operation Bureau, a secret army unit formed to counter opposition abroad
but also deployed to discredit domestic opponents of apartheid, including
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Johannesburg's Sowetan newspaper said Mr Hodgen had uncovered documents
placing former law and order minister Adriaan Vlok, now the minister
responsible for prisons, at a State Security Council meeting debating
Goniwe's fate days before he died.

management and creditors of the Daily News, the New York tabloid, and warned
them that the newspaper's survival could be in doubt unless they can agree
on a plan to obtain fresh cash.
The two bidders for the paper are Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News
and World Report magazine and The Atlantic Monthly, and Mr Conrad Black,
owner of the Daily Telegraph in London.
There is also a so-called 'stand-alone' plan under which Silver Screen, a
group of film financiers, would join forces with the management.
Although she extended to August 17 the deadline under which the newspaper
must submit a reorganisation plan to emerge from its present bankruptcy
status, Judge Tina Brozman said the paper was 'teetering on the brink of a
very large precipice'. She said the Daily News must obtain new financing
soon it if is to survive.
A progress report by the newspaper's managers and union leaders was greeted
with derision by the judge, who said she did not like what she heard. 'You
may be jeopardising my ability to keep this newspaper alive. It appears to
me you are still all going in different directions,' Judge Brozman said.
The judge, who appointed her own representative to monitor the Daily News
bid talks, warned that the paper was in danger of 'dissipating all its
assets'. The judge's representative will meet this morning with key aides to
the prospective bidders.
Before she issued her rebuke, a series of contradictory reports were offered
by two unions and the management of the newspaper.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pre-tax falls at Veba on higher
turnover

VEBA, one of Germany's largest industrial companies, with activities ranging
from chemicals and energy to trading and retailing, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits down 13.9 per cent to DM889m (from DM1.03bn) in the first
six months of the year. However, turnover rose by 12.4 per cent to
DM33.55bn, mainly as the result of acquisitions.
Mr Kiran Bhojani, recently appointed head of investor relations at the
Duseldorf-based conglomerate, explained that, but for a number of specific
exceptional factors, pre-tax profits would, in fact, have risen by 7.5 per
cent.
Heavy depreciation associated with new investments, combined with pension
provisions and provisions for the costs of redundancies in the chemicals
division, absorbed a total of DM222m which was charged 'above the line' to
the profit and loss account. A substantial proportion of the total would
have no impact on cash flow, Mr Bhojani said.
The company gave no divisional breakdown of profits, indicating only in
general terms that the chemicals division - where turnover climbed by half a
per cent to DM5.33bn - lost money in the first half, partly because of poor
market conditions but also because of extensive rationalisation measures.
There was also a 'considerable decline' in profits in the oil division,
despite a 6.6 per cent increase in turnover to DM6.56bn. The company said it
had been impossible to reach the prior-year level, which had benefited
through special factors connected with the Gulf war.
There was unlikely to be any notable earnings improvement over the course of
the year as a whole in these two divisions, Veba warned.
The service businesses improved total turnover by 25.4 per cent to
DM15.62bn. Veba said profits here were pleasing, especially in the
construction materials handling sector which profited from the construction
boom in the eastern part of the country.
The increase in turnover reflected the acquisition of Schenker-Rhenus, a
transport company bought last year. Capital investment in the first half was
DM1.83bn, up from DM1.63bn last year.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotels group which controls Wagons-Lits, must pay minority
shareholders in the Franco-Belgian travel company at least FFr950m on top of
the FFr2.2bn (Dollars 440m) it has already bid for the group, following a
landmark Brussels court ruling.
Accor is to appeal against yesterday's decision to the Belgian supreme court
on legal grounds.
But Belgian advisers to the Wagons-Lits investors were already describing
the judgment yesterday as the most significant blow yet struck for Europe's
minority shareholders. They believe the decision could eventually cost Accor
as much as FFr1.6bn if the French company is forced to raise its bid for all
minority shareholders.
The ruling should also strengthen the ill-defined Belgian takeover code,
making it more difficult for large investors to gain control of companies
through secretive private deals. In France, the controversy has already
played an important part in persuading the authorities to improve minority
shareholders' rights.
The Brussels commercial court and court of appeal have backed dissident
shareholders in their battle to establish that control of Wagons-Lits
changed hands in June 1990, when Accor and Societe Generale de Belgique, the
holding company, bought a 26 per cent stake at BFr12,500 a share.
They launched a joint bid last October at BFr8,650 a share, but both courts
have ruled that the two companies should have bid for the whole of
Wagons-Lits 15 months earlier and at the higher price. The initial stake
purchase was approved by the Belgian banking commission, which supervises
takeovers. The commission refused to comment yesterday except to say it
thought the ruling would have a 'positive effect'.
The court of appeal yesterday expanded the commercial court judgment by
adding interest to the compensation Accor will have to pay. The court also
said Sodexho, the French catering company, should be compensated for its
loss on a Wagons-Lits stake it has sold since June 1990.
The ruling will apply to the three shareholder groups involved in the appeal
 -Sodexho, Rolaco, the Saudi Arabian investment company, and Deminor, which
represents small Belgian shareholders. They hold some 10 per cent of the
group, but Accor has already committed itself to extending the payout to any
shareholders 'in a similar situation' if it finally loses its court battle.
Accor will have to cover any increase in the offer alone, because La
Generale exercised an option to sell its stake in the bid vehicle to Accor
at the end of June.
Accor's shares were suspended yesterday morning. After trading resumed they
recovered from FFr620 to close unchanged on the day at FFr638.

<TEXT>
SOME 60 creditor banks of the big Spanish property group Prima Inmobilaria
are to meet again in Madrid today after a first meeting with Prima and its
owners, the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), to discuss a two-month
moratorium on debt repayments, ended in confusion on Wednesday.
Prima, the KIO and Salomon Brothers, which is advising the KIO on the
restructuring of its Dollars 4bn assets in Spain, are en-couraging the banks
 -which Prima owes close to Dollars 500m - to form a steering committee. In
return, the KIO has promised to lend Prima Dollars 35m to make interest
payments.
At Wednesday's meeting, Mr John Gomez-Hall, Prima's chairman, and Mr David
Jarvis, the Salomon official advising KIO, said 90 per cent of Prima's
assets were either greenfield or under construction and were not producing
revenue. The group needed time to design a survival plan.
Mr Mahmoud Al-Nouri, the chief KIO official in Spain, unexpectedly spoke. He
said the KIO management in London had only been in place since May, implying
they were not responsible for the plight of Prima and Ercros, the KIO
chemicals group which stopped paying creditors last month.
He asked for unanimous agreement on a moratorium or the KIO would have to
take other steps. This may have meant suspending payments or the sale of
assets.
By late yesterday the banks had still not discussed their response.

GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power company, saw net profits increase by 14
per cent from FFr1.71bn (Dollars 340m) to FFr1.95bn for the year ended March
31.
The power group, formed three years ago as a joint venture between the UK's
GEC and Alcatel-Alsthom of France, increased operating profits by 20 per
cent to FFr3.35bn on sales 8 per cent up at FFr52bn.
GEC-Alsthom has emerged as an aggressive player in the European power
generating equipment market due to a forceful strategy of developing a broad
product range and exploiting the licensing agreement that European Gas
Turbines (EGT), its French subsidiary, has with General Electric of the US.
The US group has a 10 per cent stake in EGT, with the rest belonging to
GEC-Alsthom.
One market where GEC-Alsthom has gained ground against its chief
competitors, Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri, is combine-cycle gas turbine
power stations, the fastest-growing sector of the thermal power generation
market. The Anglo-French company has this year won a number of contracts in
this sector including the main one for PowerGen's new station at Connah's
Quay in North Wales.
EGT yesterday announced it had won a FFr1.2bn export order to supply eight
gas turbine generators to Iran Power Generation and Transmission (TAVANIR).
EGT has also won smaller export orders for Europe and Latin America worth a
total of FFr500m.
Its counterpart in the UK reported its first orders for typhoon gas turbines
for off-shore platforms in the North Sea and Australia. The EGT orders in
France and the UK contribute to a total of FFr2.5bn of new export orders for
the GEC-Alsthom group.
GEC-Alsthom said that it received orders worth FFr53.3bn in the 1991-92
financial year.

break with tradition

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the beleaguered Dutch electronics group, yesterday deployed Mr Jan
Timmer, the president, to quell doubts about the company's new consumer
electronic products that have created the weakness which has beset its share
price since early summer.
Breaking with tradition, Mr Timmer presided over the company's quarterly
press conference to clear up what he described as misunderstandings about
the future prospects of the digital compact cassette (DCC), compact
disc-interactive (CD-I) and high-definition television (HDTV).
Mr Timmer, who normally addresses only the annual results presentation in
February, vigorously denied a Dutch press report that the company would face
financial problems if its HDTV standard, developed together with Thomson of
France, did not prove successful.
He said the importance of HDTV to Philips' financial well-being had been
distorted and the effect of these worries on Philips's shares had been
exaggerated.
Mr Timmer said the future of HDTV lay with European Community finance
ministers, who must decide later this year on whether to approve incentives
to encourage broadcasters to produce programmes in D2-MAC. This is the
standard developed by Philips, Thomson and other European companies, as an
intermediary step to full HDTV.
However, Mr Timmer said Philips was 'prepared for a large number of
eventualities' if another solution was found.
Investor worries about HDTV have been compounded by Philips' recent
announcement that it was delaying its planned September launch of DCC until
later in the year, as well as by doubts about the success of CD-I, a
multi-media version of the popular CD player.
Recalling the launch of the CD in 1982, Mr Timmer said: 'At the time, there
were an unbelievable amount of Doomsday Charlies who said 'Don't do it
because we have the cassette . . . and the LP'. If we had listened to them,
the CD would never have been launched.'
He said the delay in getting DCC to shops was small compared with the
expected 25-year life span of the product. Mr Timmer acknowledged that 'we
shot ourselves in the foot' by originally specifying a September launch
rather than speaking of 'the autumn'.
Mr Timmer, who once said he might resign if results did not improve by the
end of 1992, stated that yesterday's figures 'are no reason for me
personally to say 'I'm throwing in the towel''.
After the press conference, Mr Timmer startled journalists in the press
centre by making an impromptu walk-about. Commenting on yesterday's further
decline of nearly a guilder in Philips' share price, he said: 'I didn't come
here with the illusion that the share price would go up by five guilders.'
Clearly, however, Mr Timmer's performance yesterday was designed to win back
some of the confidence which his elevation to the top job at Philips
generated back in July 1990.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Half-year income halved at
Petrofina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETROFINA, the Belgian oil company, yesterday announced that interim profits
had halved to BFr4.2bn (Dollars 138m) as the fall in crude oil and gas
prices and the weakness of the US dollar continued to take their toll.
The group - which last year reported first-half net consolidated profits of
BFr9.5bn - said it could see no immediate end to the economic recession
which is blighting the industry. Overall turnover slipped to BFr265bn from
BFr280bn.
'Nothing leads us to expect in the months to come any significant change in
this situation, which severely affects the petroleum and petrochemical
industry,' said the company, one of Belgium's largest industrial groups.
Mr Francois Cornelis, chief executive, warned of a 'marked drop' in
first-half profits in May, and said an improvement would depend on a rise in
US gas prices and improved refining margins.
Instead, the company reported that refining margins had continued to slide
during the first half. Refining, marketing and transport operations turned
in interim operating profits of BFr3.27bn against BFr7.89bn, and were hit in
the US by unspecified 'technical problems' which caused 'considerable
production losses'.
Profits slipped at all of Petrofina's operations, except paints, which made
BFr919m in the first half against BFr620m in last year's equivalent period.
Chemicals profits dropped to BFr3.1bn from BFr4.99bn and exploration and
production to BFr6.18bn from BFr6.31bn.
The group said it was taking the gloomy outlook into account in its
strategic planning. As part of its strategy, Petrofina is trying to
reinforce its Antwerp refining capability and getting more choosy about the
development of its petrochemical products.
Last week, Fina, the group's US affiliate, reported net earnings of Dollars
67,000 for the six months ended June 30 against Dollars 12.5m last year.
Second-quarter earnings were up to Dollars 5.53m from Dollars 4.24m.
Negotiations are continuing with Arabian Petroleum to establish a joint
venture in the refining sector.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Norton awaits another rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTON, a famous old name in motorcycling, will be born again in corporate
terms if Pounds 2.5m of new equity can be placed with institutions.
Norton Group is under investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry
and its shares have been suspended since March last year because of a
failure to produce results.
If the refinancing goes to plan, it will not be the first time that Norton
has risen from the ashes. It came close to collapse in the early 1970s and
the first, abortive, resurrection attempt involved a workers' co-operative
at the Meriden works, near Coventry.
In 1986 the shell company was revived by Mr Philippe Le Roux, a motorcycle
fan and former merchant banker. He resigned as chief executive in January
1991.
A new management has disposed of a problematic German fasteners subsidiary.
Other problems have included trading losses of Pounds 2m at Norton Motors in
1990-91, and borrowings of about Pounds 6m. Mr Norman Wilson, a director,
said motor losses were cut to Pounds 47,000 last year.
Under the refinancing plan, those subscribing for the Pounds 2.5m of shares
would own the bulk of a new company - still keeping the Norton name - which
would be listed; existing holders would also be offered a stake. The
remainder of the debt with Midland Bank would be rescheduled 'to give us a
breathing space', Mr Wilson said.
The company, which makes rotary engines and has a profitable US piping
components subsidiary, has not produced a motorcycle for two years. The F1
racing bike was priced at about Pounds 13,000, but lost money. Mr Wilson
said a new motorcycle would be brought out in the next couple of months
aimed at 'the more commercial end of the market'.

progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ROTORK, the Bath-based valve control maker which exports three quarters of
its products, lifted its pre-tax profit by 11 per cent in the six months to
June 30.
On turnover of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 25.1m), the profit advanced to Pounds
4.84m (Pounds 4.35m) after the receipt of Pounds 400,000 in interest. The
share price gained 6p to close at 323p.
Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, attributed the group's strong performance to
'not being tied to the UK economy'. It also serviced basic industries
providing fuel and heat, electricity and water. The proportion of its
business that did lie in the UK had benefited from strong demand from the
water companies.
About 80 per cent of turnover came from the actuation division. Mr Eassie
said the operation had a dozen overseas companies selling its valve control
products. Fruitful areas had been the US oil and gas sectors, the Middle
East and the Pacific Rim. The business was driven by margin, not turnover.
Rotork Instruments, which provides emergency shut-down systems, did not
reach its interim turnover target but a good final quarter was in prospect.
Rotork Analysis, a small venture in pollution monitoring equipment, was
trading profitably.
The group had added Pounds 800,000 cash to the Pounds 11m held at the
year-end.
With the order book ahead of last year, further progress was expected in the
second half.
Earnings per share rose to 10.5p (9.3p) and the interim dividend goes up to
4.65p (4.25p).

<TEXT>
BAIN Clarkson, the insurance broking subsidiary of Inchcape, is expanding
its activities in continental Europe through the purchase of a minority
stake in France's third largest broker for Pounds 15.2m.
The deal involves Bain Clarkson initially taking a 25 per cent holding in
Compagnie Europeenne de Courtage d'Assurances et de Reassurances (Cecar). It
also entails Bain's French subsidiary, Rouge Clarkson, being sold to Cecar
for loan stock. The conversion of this stock to equity in 1996 will take
Bain's holding in Cecar up to 34 per cent.
Cecar's gross brokerage income was FFr 370m (Pounds 39m) last year. Mr Simon
Arnold, chairman of Bain, said its contribution would be substantially more
than current French earnings, although less than 10 per cent of all the
group's insurance activities.
Last year insurance services - mostly under the Bain Clarkson name - made an
operating profit of Pounds 18.6m out of a total of Pounds 222.2m (before
central costs) for the whole of the Inchcape motors and business services
group.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Mortgage fraudsters sent to jail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR solicitors were jailed yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court for their
part in a mortgage fraud.
A total of 16 men, including the solicitors, were jailed for periods ranging
from six months to three years, and three women received community service
orders.
The 19-strong network made 128 applications for more than 90 properties in
Greater Manchester and Lancashire, usually giving false details, and backed
by the solicitors and a professional property valuer.
More than Pounds 1.8m was obtained from building societies, banks and other
financial institutions and the team made unsuccessful attempts to obtain a
further Pounds 2.5m. Two solicitors and a valuer were found guilty after a
10-week trial and the rest pleaded guilty to their various roles.
The applications, with property values falsely inflated by the valuer, were
made by the property developers, who often used false or fictitious names
with the aid of the solicitors.
Sentencing them, Mr Justice Jowitt said that, with the right combination of
dishonest people, mortgage fraud was all too easy to commit.
Mr Rodney Klevan QC, prosecuting, described the fraud as 'a well-organised
network of people each playing a particular role in false or fraudulent
mortgage applications'.

<DATELINE>
   THE BBC is to be banned from promoting its magazines
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
such as the Radio Times - with glossy television commercials, because it
distorts the market.
In future, the government has decided, the corporation can give only basic
information - such as the title price and availability of a magazine - over
a still slide at the end of programmes. In addition, the BBC will also have
to mention the availability of competing magazines.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that he would
be asking Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to seek an
undertaking from the BBC on the issue.
Mr Hamilton acted as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission published a
report on the publicising of goods supplied by broadcasters.
The BBC said yesterday that it would be expressing its concern over the idea
that it should have to promote non-BBC magazines.
The MMC investigation, set up as a result of the Sadler report into
cross-media promotion, found that it was only in the consumer magazine
market that BBC promotion distorted competition.
The MMC decided that BBC use of air time to promote its magazines had
distorted competition in the food and cookery sectors. There was also
distortion in listings and gardening, but that did not have such adverse
effects.
The MMC came out against moving trails - videos lasting up to 40 seconds -
because they were more likely to contain 'elements of persuasion, overt
endorsement and selling'. It said mentions of magazines in programmes should
also be prohibited because of the likely adverse effect on competition.
The MMC had suggested that if the BBC and the Independent Television
Commission came up with a code of practice acceptable to the Office of Fair
Trading, that should be substituted for its recommendations. However, Mr
Hamilton rejected that alternative and ruled that moving trails and mentions
during programmes should be banned.
Mr Hamilton said: 'I believe these to be important additional safeguards
which, when taken together with the MMC's recommendations, will help prevent
future distortion of the market.'
About Pounds 97m of the turnover of BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of
the BBC, comes from magazines. The profits are ploughed back into
programme-making.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Travel boss files for bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the Land Travel coach company that collapsed
last month, filed for personal bankruptcy yesterday, removing any lingering
hope that creditors would be able to recover their money.
Grant Thornton, the liquidators, are holding a creditors' meeting at a
Bristol hotel today.
Customers who made bookings with Land Travel have been advised to stay away
as there is no prospect of receiving any payment.
Mr Tjolle attributed his bankruptcy to the Land Travel collapse, in which he
lost more than Pounds 400,000, and to failed property investments made in
1988 and 1989. The property investments were funded by bank loans made on
the strength of shares Mr Tjolle held in the Granada Group.
The rise in interest rates and a drop in Granada's share price had made it
impossible to repay the loans, Mr Tjolle said. Granada owned Land Travel's
holding company, Beau Nash Enterprises, from 1987 to 1990, when it was sold
to Mr Tjolle.
Mr Robert Buller, the Grant Thornton liquidator, said: 'From our appointment
it was clear that liquidators were unlikely to receive any payment from Land
Travel. The only real hope for creditors would have been to mount a
successful claim against Mr Tjolle. Now that he has filed for personal
bankruptcy, this last hope has been removed.'
General Accident, underwriters of Land Travel's holiday insurance scheme,
said policies did not cover the loss of holidays through liquidation.

THE Office of Fair Trading warned yesterday that it had identified three
potentially anti-competitive elements of the new ITV networking arrangements
which it intends to investigate.
In a consultative paper the OFT said it would be looking at the possible
anti-competitive implications of:
Proposals that prevent independent producers contracting directly with the
ITV network. Instead they must go through a regional ITV company.
The extra costs and possible disadvantages arising from that system.
The fact that ITV companies want to buy programme rights for 10 years with a
further five-year option.
The OFT - which has a legal responsibility to ensure that the central
network system is fair - emphasised that it had not yet taken any firm
decisions.
Mr John Woodward, chief executive of Pact, the independent producers' group,
said: 'I think ITV has a major problem. If the OFT had not recognised what
we said, it would not have raised them as issues. Every single foundation
stone of the ITV proposals has been criticised.'
The OFT said terms on programme rights were 'unparalleled both in relation
to UK experience and relevant overseas experience'. It said preventing
independents dealing directly with the network may put them 'at a
competitive disadvantage when competing with licencees to supply programmes
to the network'.
The OFT hopes to rule on the networking arrangements before the end of this
year.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Recall plan urged for danger goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Consumers' Association called for the government yesterday to introduce
a mechanism for recalling dangerous goods after an elderly widow in
Sheffield died when her faulty washer-drier machine burst into flames.
Thousands of other householders are at risk from the Candy Turbomatic
washing machine, model 38d - but there is no means of contacting them
directly.
About 42,000 of the faulty machines have been sold in the UK, of which only
6,700 have been recalled to have the fault fixed.
Kelco, the distributor of the Italian-made machine, based in Ellesmere Port,
Cheshire, put advertisements in national newspapers last year warning of the
dangers but had only a limited response. Yesterday, the company said a fresh
bid to trace owners of the washer-driers would be made next week with more
advertisements placed.
The Consumers' Association has received 21 complaints about the machine, 12
of which have involved serious fires.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, shadow consumer affairs minister, said it was 'shocking'
that there was no official mechanism to alert people of the danger. He
proposed establishment of a national register of addresses of customers who
had bought particular products.
Baroness Denton, consumer affairs minister, said anyone who had bought one
of the machines should telephone freephone 0800 373240 for advice.

FT  07 AUG 92 / County Hall row moves to High Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTROVERSY over the future of London's County Hall reached the High
Court yesterday. Shirayama, the Japanese purchaser of the Thames-side
building, served a writ to overturn the government's decision to allow the
London School of Economics to bid for the site.
Shirayama is seeking judicial review of last month's instruction by Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary, to the London Residuary Body, which
owns County Hall, not to proceed with the sale without his consent. The
order was to allow the LSE to submit a late bid, although the government had
earlier endorsed the Shirayama sale.
Having decided to allow the LSE to bid, Mr Howard was forced to issue a
formal order because the residuary body had made clear its unwillingness to
entertain a further bid.
The LSE last week submitted a bid of Pounds 65m for the entire County Hall
site. That is less than the Pounds 60m sale price to Shirayama for the main
riverside building alone, which it wishes to convert to a hotel. The LSE
argues that national-interest considerations justify its bid.
Mr Howard's action has infuriated Shirayama, which believes the government
has acted in bad faith. Its application for judicial review argues that the
order was grossly unreasonable, since the LSE's interest was evident at the
time of the sale in March.
It asserts that Mr Howard's actions have placed Shirayama in 'an invidious
commercial position' and have 'undermined' their plans for financing the
project. 'The uncertainty requires to be resolved urgently,' it says.
An opt-out clause gives the government until the end of November to withdraw
from the deal, but the London Residuary Body earlier this week 'strongly
urged' Mr Howard to reject the LSE bid and to delete the escape clause.
Sir Godfrey Taylor, LRB chairman, is angry at the government's action. His
view may carry some weight before the High Court.

TRADING partners of the EC have rejected a new offer to compensate them for
Community subsidies to oilseeds farmers, diplomats said, Reuter reports from
Geneva. 'We told them their proposal was insufficient,' one delegate added.
The EC held bilateral meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday and yesterday to
present a new compensation offer to the 10 nations judged affected by its
oilseeds subsidies. Each turned it down, diplomats said. Details of the EC's
new proposal were sketchy. One diplomat said it had talked about added
concessions on beef imports and perhaps maize, 'but we judged the value
insufficient'.
Other countries say the EC has limited their access to the Community market
because subsidised European farmers are able to compete unfairly against
their products. The issue has been a trade irritant, especially with the US.
Farm subsidy rows have blocked a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
trade talks. Nations involved in the dispute are Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
Hungary, India, Pakistan, Poland, Sweden, the US and Uruguay. The US wants
it settled by August 18, threatening import tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of
EC farm products.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSE banking committee yesterday voted to subpoena secret Iraqi-related
documents from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other agencies of
the US government, in a move that could considerably broaden the
investigation of more than Dollars 5bn of unauthorised Iraqi loans made in
the 1980s by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
Subpoena power was awarded against all of the US branches of BNL. The
committee said subpoena authority was also granted against Mr Christopher
Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta branch manager.
Mr Drogoul claimed last April that the US and Italian governments knew of
the BNL loans, which helped to finance the nuclear and chemical weapons
projects of Mr Saddam Hussein.
The Bush administration has denied any knowledge of the illicit BNL loans.
Mr Drogoul, who in June struck a surprise deal with the Department of
Justice under which many fraud charges were dropped in return for his
co-operating with prosecutors, will be called to testify by the committee in
mid-September. His appearance in Congress will come just after he is
sentenced by an Atlanta judge.
The committee will also subpoena documents about BNL from the National
Security Agency (NSA), the secretive electronic surveillance agency that is
believed by congressional investigators to have intercepted many of the
thousands of telexes between Baghdad and BNL Atlanta over a five-year
period.
'This moves our BNL investigation on to a new plane,' said a spokesman for
the committee which may also subpoena bank regulators in New York and Texas
and at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US offers 'open skies' to European
airlines at a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is offering to 'open its skies' to the airlines of European countries
who give essentially free access to their markets to US carriers, Paul Betts
and Reuter report. The move comes as US carriers press their government for
new air pacts with EC countries.
They want the administration to block the British Airways-USAIR equity
partnership unless Britain is prepared to concede a more favourable aviation
accord. The US move coincides with the advent of the single European air
transport market next January and a transatlantic fares war.
Mr Andrew Card, transportation secretary, said the 'open skies' efforts,
including writing an 11-point definition, were focused on Europe because it
was already moving toward free flow of passengers and goods. The
administration hoped other regions would soon be ready to join similar
talks. More liberal air pacts 'will move us closer to a truly open
environment for international aviation,' he said.
European carriers say they do not have the access they would like to the
large US market. France and Germany are seeking to restrict US carriers
which, they maintain, have an unfair advantage. The US department said 'open
skies' would mean: unrestricted capacity and frequency on all routes,
flexibility in setting fares; liberal charter and cargo arrangements;
carriers could convert earnings into hard currency and return them home with
no curbs;
They could enter freely into commercial transactions related to their flight
operations; open code-sharing arrangements, the right of a carrier to
perform its own ground handling in the other country, and a pledge for
non-discriminatory operation of and access to computer reservation systems.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Alarm over chip alliances flares again - A
look at fears that the US is giving Japan crucial technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growing number of strategic alliances between US and Japanese
semiconductor companies is again raising concern in the US that groups there
are giving away crucial technology too easily to competitors.
The joint development programme for advanced memory chips, recently agreed
between IBM, the world's biggest chip maker, Siemens of Germany and Toshiba
of Japan, is the latest in a line of partnerships triggering alarm in press
and government. Critics say links with foreign competitors give away
technology developed with taxpayers' money through organisations such as
Sematech, a collaborative effort to improve US chip groups' competitiveness
and partly funded by the government.
The National Research Council (NRC), operating arm of the US National
Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineers, warns* the
technology flow through strategic US-Japanese semiconductor alliances has
been mainly from the US to Japan.
Such a flow, if continued over the 1990s, could erode US capacity to
innovate in this industry. The council raises concerns over link-ups between
small-to-medium US companies, many of them start-up entities, and big,
vertically integrated Japanese corporations. Its research, based on data
from Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy, shows such alliances
account for some two-thirds of US-Japanese chip alliances.
The increase in these has been spurred by the rising importance of the
Japanese market, which US companies needed to join. Japanese thirst for new
technologies has led them to invest heavily in US chip companies, mainly
start-up ones needing funds. The NRC report cites another study indicating
Japanese chip investments make up about 90 per cent of all the industry's
investments.
Recent developments include the high cost of investing in factories and the
need for greater resources than any one company can muster to market a
product quickly. Japanese companies' manufacturing capability has been a
compelling factor for US chip companies which face the need to bring a
product to the market quickly, as well as second-source their product. The
council argues that while individual companies may benefit from alliances
with Japanese ones by gaining funds and market access, these alliances may
not provide the US chip industry with the stronger manufacturing
infrastructure it needs.
Historically, US companies did not necessarily come out at the top end of an
alliance, says Mr Howard High of Intel, the US semiconductor company which
recently agreed jointly to make flash memory chips with Sharp of Japan. But
'the structure of the deals and the attitude is quite different to what you
used to see in the early to mid-1980s'. Now Japanese companies are
recognised as major players in the industry, US groups are trying to improve
safeguards against one-way technology flows.
IBM, a target of concern for its development pact with Toshiba and Siemens,
says its alliances bring benefits beyond sharing the financial burden,
including skills helping speed development processes. 'The idea is speed to
market,' an IBM official says. Concern that developments funded by tax were
being given away to foreigners was misfounded. 'Sematech focuses on
manufacturing processes, where alliances focus on products.' Even for big
chip companies, the need to invest huge sums in manufacturing capacity and
be quick to the market with new technology, means 'it's a tough call,' Mr
High says.
Intel is a leader in flash memories, a market likely to grow. Flash is a
chip retaining memory after switch-off. Intel knew it needed greater
capacity to bring the product to the market quickly, as the Japanese makers
were working on it too. No advanced chip plants were readily available for
extra output in the US, and because setting up a new plant takes time and
money, that option meant it might miss the boat.
Such are the pressures US chip groups face in trying to lead a fast-changing
market. The council says that without efforts to ensure foreign alliances
bring benefits to the US, the possibility of the US supplying new ideas to
foreigners who then derive most of the value-added, 'is a real concern'.
Chip groups say cross-border co-operation is essential. No company, or
nation, can adequately serve all markets; they must increasingly co-operate,
says Mr Pat Weber of Texas Instruments. Policies to keep technologies in the
US are obsolete. Enabling US companies to serve global markets 'is, in the
end, in the US national interest.'

FT  07 AUG 92 / Rabin adopts new tack to win friends and influence people:
The Israeli leader's more aggressive approach to foreign policy will have an
airing in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, yesterday left for the US on
a visit expected to rekindle Israel's relationship with Washington.
Underlying the trip will be a broader shift in the Jewish state's approach
to foreign policy.
Mr Rabin is hoping for an agreement to release Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn)
in US loan guarantees denied to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, because
of a refusal to freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
President George Bush and Mr Rabin, who meet on Monday, are also likely to
smooth out differences over Middle East peace talks, launched in Madrid last
year and due to resume in Washington on August 24.
The Israeli leader will stop in New York on his way to Mr Bush's home in
Kennebunkport, to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general.
The visit to the US is a chance for Mr Rabin to chart a wider foreign policy
course, well away from the isolationist path followed by Mr Shamir.
He made this shift clear during his inaugural speech to parliament last
month when he said: 'No longer is it true that the whole world is against
us.'
Within Israel, the government believes there is a willingness to consider
compromise on the issue of land for peace. Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy
foreign minister, says the experience of last year's Gulf war, when Iraqi
missiles fired from beyond the occupied territories hit Israel, is largely
responsible for this shift in opinion. A further factor is the disappearance
of Soviet backing for hostile Arab states in the region.
'More and more people believe the territories are not a buffer zone, but
part of the problem itself,' Mr Beilin says. 'People understand that if we
need strategic depth it has to be much more than the West Bank. We must gain
it not by conquering land but by peace agreements with our neighbours.'
However, the internal obstacles to such policies were highlighted yesterday
when an estimated 5,000 Jewish settlers brought traffic to a halt in West
Jerusalem in a protest against restrictions on building in the territories.
A further factor in the policy reassessment is the extension of diplomatic
links with countries previously following Moscow's lead in isolating Israel.
Russia, China, India, the eastern European nations, African countries and
even the Moslem central Asian republics have established, or re-established,
ties with Israel.
Mr Reuven Merhav, director general of the Foreign Ministry until a year ago,
says: 'We are no longer a pariah state. These countries have decided that
boycotting us is not the way to solve our problems. This should help us to
make better decisions also.'
In this more open, less defensive approach to the world, Mr Rabin is seeking
to re-tune, not reduce, links with the US.
With mass immigration placing great strains on Israel's economy, the prime
minister is acutely aware of the country's vulnerability to any cut in the
annual Dollars 3bn aid from Washington.
The collapse of the Soviet Union removed much of the raison d'etre of the
strategic agreement, forged between Mr Shamir and President Ronald Reagan,
which cast Israel as a buffer against Soviet influence in the Middle East.
Then, in the Gulf crisis, Israel seemed more of a liability than an asset to
the US as Washington strove to keep Arab nations in the anti-Iraq coalition.
But Mr Beilin insists the foundation of the relationship remains secure and
will be cemented if Israel can reach peace with its neighbours. 'I believe
the fundamental importance of Israel to the US is as the only democracy in
the Middle East which has a stabilising effect in a very unstable region. I
do not believe this will diminish.' He cites the rise of Moslem
fundamentalism as a threat against both Israel and the US.
Mr Rabin's government has also signalled its desire for closer ties with the
European Community, which has long been perceived in Israel as having a
pro-Arab bias.
While Mr Shamir's government tried to keep the EC out of any significant
role in the peace process, Mr Rabin and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign
minister, recognise that Europe's proximity to the region gives it a
legitimate interest in negotiations. They also acknowledge the economic
importance to Israel of close links with the EC, which is the country's
biggest trading partner.
The government is likely to allow the EC to participate in the multilateral
regional talks on arms control - which Mr Shamir blocked. But in return
Israel expects the EC to press Arabs to end their economic boycott of
Israel.

<TEXT>
THE Australian government said yesterday it was making ADollars 181m (Pounds
71m) immediately available for a railway project designed to create 12,000
direct and indirect jobs over the next two years.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the spending was for the first stage
of a ADollars 454m national rail network programme. Release of the funds
coincided with figures showing unemployment for July stood at 11 per cent,
only marginally lower than June's record 11.1 per cent.
A national rail network was a key element of Mr Keating's economic statement
in February. The statement allocated Dollars 2.3bn over two years to boost
the economy and cut unemployment to less than 10 per cent by the next
general election, in mid-1993.
The government hoped this would lead to 4.75 per cent growth in 1992-1993.
However, it has conceded that growth of less than 4 per cent is a more
realistic target.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UN mission flies into Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SPECIAL United Nations assessment mission yesterday flew into
war-shattered Mogadishu to consider means of improving security to
distribute food to hundreds of thousands of starving Somalis.
The mission arrived as a huge effort was under way to move hundreds of
tonnes of food blocked in the port into the city. 'We are trying our best to
put food into the mouths of people who need it, but it is becoming
increasingly difficult to do so because of looting and insecurity,' said one
aid worker.
A World Food Programme (WFP) official, Mr Trevor Page, yesterday dismissed
British press reports that the UN was going to suspend food deliveries for a
month, due to the insecurity, as 'absolute nonsense'. Two UN-chartered
ships, carrying 10,000 tons of sorghum for Mogadishu and 3,000 tons of food
for Kismayo, are due to dock on Sunday.
However, senior UN officials appear deeply divided about the role of the
technical mission. One official in Mogadishu said it had been sent to
'rubber stamp' the view of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general,
that a contingent of armed UN guards was imperative to protect humanitarian
operations and food distribution - with or without the consent of the
feuding factions. Canada's announcement yesterday that it was prepared to
send 500 troops to Somalia on the request of the UN, appeared to confirm
reports that the secretary-general is shopping around for member countries
willing to provide military forces.
But Mr Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN special envoy to Somalia, has consistently
said it would be extremely dangerous and counter-productive to send in armed
troops in the face of violent opposition by General Mohammed Faffar Aideed,
the strongest of Somalia's feuding war lords.
Gen Aideed has said he will shell any UN troops trying to enter Somalia and
Mr Sahnoun has cautioned against the UN embarking on intervention that would
turn it into an occupying force risking casualties.
Meanwhile, the thousands of gunmen in Mogadishu continue to threaten the
fragile relief operation, exacerbating the mounting death toll from
starvation. On Wednesday, 20 trucks carrying 200 tons of food from the port
to Wardigley, a suburb of Mogadishu, were hijacked by gunmen and disappeared
en route.
So far this year only 107,000 tons of food has been delivered to Somalia,
the bulk by the Red Cross. The estimate of food needs for 1992 is at least
400,000 tons. Getting food out of the ports to the starving civilians,
however, continues to be the single biggest obstacle.
Mr Holbrooke Arthur, the WFP representative in Somalia, said distribution of
food was deteriorating with successful food distribution to the most needy
having decreased from 90 per cent for their first shipment to 30 per cent.
'We can't distribute food successfully without military intervention,' said
one aid worker. 'It can be done with military troops but only if we're
prepared for the situation to become bloody. No one wants to support that.'
The UN technical mission, which yesterday met both feuding factions in
Mogadishu and aid agencies, is also going to consider how to monitor the
shaky ceasefire; a 'food-for-arms' exchange programme; the feasibility of an
airlift to the interior of Somalia; and how to help re-establish a police
force.
Mr Bernard Kouchner, the French health and humanitarian action minister,
yesterday said he had witnessed in Somalia the worst suffering since the
Biafran war.
He urged Britain to use its presidency of the European Community to double
aid to the east African state.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Bush responds to pressure on Bosnia: Thatcher joins US calls
for threat of military action against Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's latest initiative on Bosnia - calling for a UN
resolution authorising the use of force to ensure humanitarian aid gets
through - was hurriedly issued in the midst of a campaign swing through
Colorado, in answer to intensified domestic and foreign pressure for some
form of US action.
Conspicuous among these have been the statements of Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, a column in the New York Times by Lady
Thatcher, the former British prime minister, and a vote earlier yesterday by
the Senate foreign relations committee calling on the United Nations to
authorise the use of military force if necessary.
All the above interventions were themselves a response to a flood of media
reports about Serbian 'death camps' and graphic pictures and accounts of the
latest bombing in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Earlier in the week the administration had appeared caught flat-footed, with
the president concentrating on his struggling re-election campaign and Mr
James Baker, the secretary of state, on holiday in Wyoming.
Sensing administration paralysis as well as a political opportunity, Mr
Clinton again called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security
Council and has warned that force may have to be used against Serbia.
'History has shown you can't just allow the mass extermination of people
based on their ethnic origin and just sit by and watch it happen,' he told a
campaign rally in Missouri.
A foreign contribution came from Lady Thatcher, who said Serbia must be
threatened with military action, if it does not comply with western demands.
These should include an end to Belgrade's economic support for the war in
Bosnia, its recognition of Bosnian independence and territorial integrity,
the demilitarisation of Bosnia within a broader regional demilitarisation,
access for humanitarian teams, and the promise of co-operation in the return
of refugees to Bosnia.
'American leadership in this endeavour is indispensable, as the EC's
paralysis has shown, but America cannot be expected to act alone,' she
wrote.
Before yesterday the only positive initiative this week came late on
Wednesday, when the US called for an extraordinary session of the UN Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
On Monday the State Department had appeared to suggest the US had evidence
confirming media reports of Serbian 'death camps', but this was withdrawn on
Tuesday. But on Wednesday Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of
state, issued a statement saying such reports were 'profoundly disturbing'.
Yesterday, the New York Times quoted an unidentified senior official as
saying: 'We are at the point now where there may well be greater danger in
not taking risks than in taking risks, and I think the president may have to
roll the dice if things don't improve.'
However, the US military has consistently advised that any operation in the
Balkans would be fraught with risk. Mr Bush's political advisers are also
concerned that any US military involvement might backfire, with the election
less than three months away.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Finns try to stem outflow of capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FINLAND yesterday moved to stop a sudden outflow of capital from the country
by raising interest rates on commercial bank lending from 14.6 per cent to
16 per cent.
Last week Finland's reserves fell by nearly FM1bn (Dollars 247m) to
FM30.4bn. But over the past few days the outward flow of capital has turned
into a flood.
The central bank blamed the the lack of international confidence in the
economic policy of the Finnish centre-conservative coalition government,
which has suffered from serious differences of opinion between ministers.
After an emergency meeting yesterday the cabinet insisted the government
would stick to its policy of spending cuts and did not intend to devalue the
currency further. Ministers said there was no alternative to the present
economic course or the continuation of the government in office.
This is the third time since last November's devaluation of the markka that
the central bank has had to raise interest rates to stabilise the markets.
There was further bad economic news yesterday: unemployment rose to 12.7 per
cent in June. It was also revealed that the budget deficit for the year is
expected to rise by FM60bn, to FM152bn, about 20 per cent of GDP.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Russian reforms win IMF backing

<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund and World Bank yesterday threw their weight
behind the economic reform efforts of Russia's President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, sought to allay fears that
Russia and the IMF would be unable to reach agreement on a full programme of
economic reforms. The World Bank, meanwhile, approved a Dollars 600m (Pounds
314m) 'rehabilitation' loan to enable Russia to purchase much-needed
imports.
Mr Camdessus indicated that the Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' credit approved
by the IMF's board late on Wednesday was only the first stage of a 'phased
programme of collaboration'.
He acknowledged some slippage in Russia's reform efforts, but hoped the IMF
would be able to approve a full standby agreement with Russia by the end of
this year. The timing and scale of future IMF support, however, would depend
on the strength of Russia's reform programme and its financing needs.
It was 'absolutely essential' that Russia achieve the ambitious fiscal
targets agreed with the IMF - a sharp 11.5 percentage point reduction in the
budget deficit to 5 per cent of gross domestic product during the second
half of the year. He also stressed the importance of Russia achieving much
firmer control of its money supply.
The IMF's initial Dollars 1bn credit was primarily a recognition of Russia's
'immense efforts' and 'remarkable achievements' in the past nine months, Mr
Camdessus said. The credit line, which covers the next five months, was
available without fresh conditions.
Mr Camdessus indicated a willingness to show flexibility in assessing
Russia's progress on reforms. The IMF was engaged in a 'damage control'
exercise. Its aim was to help the country avoid hyperinflation and to keep
the reform effort on track.
If Russia sustained the momentum of its reforms, the next stage of IMF
support would be a full standby agreement involving tighter conditions than
the initial 'first tranche' credit. This would then be followed by a pegging
of the rouble supported by a stabilisation fund.
The World Bank loan, announced yesterday, is in two parts: Dollars 250m for
imports by Russia's growing commercial private sector and Dollars 350m for
priority imports by the health, agriculture, transport and energy sectors.
The loan has a term of 15 years including an initial five-year grace period.
The US House of Representatives yesterday approved a bill authorising
Dollars 1.2bn in aid to the former Soviet Union. It was part of a wider aid
bill which included a Dollars 12bn US contribution to the IMF.
Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last night warned about the threat
of fascist dictatorship in Russia. Speaking on BBC television he expressed
alarm about the depth of the economic crisis. The country was on the brink,
he said.
If the slump continued the population was likely to sweep away a government
which could offer it no other policies. Dictatorship was likely to follow.
Speaking of his own position, he said he had promised to support the
government as long as it continued on the path of democracy and reform. If
it ceased to do so, he would have to think again.

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Italian government's privatisation plans will overcome a big hurdle
today when special shareholders' meetings of the four biggest public-sector
groups approve their transformation into joint stock companies.
The change in legal status is a vitalstep towards the flotation of some, or
all, of the groups. The companies include IRI, Italy's biggest public-sector
holding, ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals group, ENEL, the
electricity generating authority, and INA, the state insurance agency.
Approval for the change is not in doubt, but the focus will be on the
composition of the groups' boards of directors also up for renewal. The new
boards should offer a clear indication of the balance of political forces
within the government over privatisation.
'You'll have to count how many old faces move out and how many new ones come
in,' said a senior supporter of privatisation in the government yesterday.
However, that is not a foregone conclusion. Some executives who owe their
jobs to party allegiances are resisting change. The Christian Democrats and
the Socialists, the two biggest parties in Mr Giuliano Amato's coalition,
are also divided.
Observers expect the boards to be slimmed down, giving representatives from
the Treasury, now the companies' shareholder, much greater say. The board of
directors of ENI, the biggest of the four, currently has 15 members.
Officials expect the current, politically appointed, chairmen of the four
companies to be reconfirmed. However, it is thought the mandates of the four
 -Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI, Mr Franco Viezzoli
at ENEL, and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA - may be cut from their present
multi-year terms. Their powers may also be curtailed.
Once the assemblies are over, bankers expect little movement on
privatisation until October, by which time a six-member committee of bankers
and economists, set up by the Treasury last week, will have presented its
findings.
The government has already indicated its willingness to float more than 49
per cent of public-sector companies' shares - a virtually impassable barrier
in the past.
Flotation of IRI's Finmeccanica subsidiary and ENI's Agip and Snam
operations is due to go ahead as planned later this year. Ministers are
considering sending a much stronger signal to the markets, possibly by
disposing of the government's controlling stake in a prestigious state-owned
bank.
The positive economic effects of last week's labour accord week could push
Italian interest rates down another 2.5 percentage points by the end of this
year, according to Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of the CISL union,
AP-DJ reports from Milan.
He said such a drop would shave some L40 trillion (million million) of
interest payments off the government's budget deficit.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Moscow agrees big cash boost for state enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government has agreed to provide state enterprises with Rbs500bn
in fresh working capital after Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the newly reappointed
central bank chairman, tried to set the figure at Rbs1,000bn.
Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, said yesterday that the figure
had been reduced to Rbs500bn after stormy debates within the government and
with Mr Gerashchenko, whom he accused of seeking unilaterally to alter
government policy on the debt crisis which has beset state-owned
enterprises.
The new money, which is in addition to another unscheduled Rbs200bn handed
out to enterprises this spring, is supposed to be tied to strict conditions
so that it helps enterprises which are unable to operate because of
inflation-induced cash-flow problems.
Enterprises are not, for instance, to use the government help to increase
wages or prices. Net debtors in the payments crisis are still supposed to be
made accountable for their debts, and Mr Nechayev denied that he had given
up a plan to effect a few bankruptcies of irresponsible state enterprises to
discourage others.
Asked in what circumstances the government might resign rather than continue
to compromise with its domestic critics over financial stabilisation, Mr
Nechayev said that stepping down would become an option 'if we were no
longer able to block financially irresponsible policies'.
But as the government yesterday welcomed the receipt of a first
International Monetary Fund credit tranche of Dollars 1bn and hoped it would
obtain an extra Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in the autumn, it is looking
increasingly unlikely to meet targets agreed with the Fund to restore the
country to some sort of financial health.
To gain access to the first Dollars 1bn, which is to replenish depleted
foreign exchange reserves, Moscow undertook to keep the budget deficit to
below 5 per cent of gross domestic product and to lower inflation to a
monthly level of 10 per cent. The near-impossibility of this task is
underlined by estimates by western experts that the budget deficit was
already heading for 15 per cent of GDP, before the approval of Rbs500bn  -
which is itself bigger than the budget deficit already forecast by the
government.

FOUR European airlines have been rebuked by the European Commission for
increasing fares last summer in breach of EC law.
The Commission condemned fare increases introduced by British Airways,
Alitalia, Luxair and Iberia on 22 routes - all but one involving British
airports. The Commission decided the increases were not 'reasonably related'
to the airlines' long-term costs.
The Commission has not punished the airlines, which increased the fares
during the Gulf crisis when the regulatory regime was temporarily relaxed.
Instead, it has warned governments that they cannot use the prices as a
reference for future increases.
The European Commission yesterday gave PepsiCo and General Mills, US
multinationals, the go-ahead to create Europe's largest manufacturer of
snack food products.
Brussels' competition authorities cleared the joint venture - which will
have sales of Dollars 640m (Pounds 335m) - after a one-month investigation.
The US groups said in May they intended to merge their operations in six
continental European countries. A Commission spokesman said the
fragmentation of the EC snack food business meant the enlarged company would
command less than 10 per cent of the market.

THE 46 members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) are
applying pressure on the UN Security Council to intervene militarily in
Bosnia-Hercegovina following an increase in fighting throughout the
republic.
The OIC, which recently formed a 'contact group' or lobby at the UN, wants
the Security Council to exempt Bosnia from the arms embargo, deploy more
military forces in the independent republic and step up humanitarian relief.
The lobby, which emerged from a June OIC meeting in Istanbul, is chaired by
Mr Mustfa Aksin, Turkey's UN ambassador, and includes Pakistan, Iran and
Egypt.
'We (the lobby) think the Security Council is not doing enough in trying to
stop the killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' a Turkish diplomat based in the US
said yesterday. He added that last Monday, it asked Daoyu Li, the (Chinese)
president of the Security Council, to adopt a much tougher resolution in
defence of Bosnia's Moslem population.
In their effort to seek assistance from the Islamic world, Bosnia's Moslems,
who are Sunni, and Slav, have to play a delicate balancing act.
They cannot afford to receive support from any fundamentalist Shia movements
because that would give credibility to Serbian propaganda that the Moslems
are intent on setting up an Islamic fundamentalist state in Bosnia, a claim
denied by Bosnian officials. But the longer the war continues in Bosnia, and
the longer the international community hesitates in taking military action,
the more likely it is that sections of the Moslem community will be further
radicalised.

TEARS welled up in the eyes of Hasan, a retired Moslem villager, as a fellow
refugee told him yesterday how his younger brothers were beaten at a
detention camp, disappeared, and probably were dead, AP reports from Zagreb,
the capital of Croatia.
Otherwise, there was none of the emotion of a meeting of two rural men from
the same area who chanced upon each other in flight from war.
A quick exchange of names and professions by Hasan, a 67-year-old former
building engineer, and Adem, a 56-year-old forest worker, provided what
likely will have to stand as confirmation of two more deaths in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Serb officials in Bosnia deny they are holding civilians in inhumane
conditions. Yesterday the information minister of their self-proclaimed
government told journalists in northern Bosnia that Serbs also had been kept
in a camp, and charged that many of the women had been raped.
He said the Serbs had been kept by Croats and Moslems in a camp in the
northeast Bosnian town of Odzak until it was captured last month. The women
who had been raped had been sent to the Serbian province of Vojvodina to
recover.
The three men, Hasan, Adem, and a third man, 70-year-old Mehmed, all say
they survived Serb camps before being allowed to flee to Croatia. All three
said they were from villages in the vicinity of Kozarac, a town in northwest
Bosnia-Hercegovina about 120 km southeast of Zagreb.
Such stories usually are impossible to verify, reporters rarely are able to
visit such places. But the three men provided detail of their captivity and
personal data that appeared to corroborate their reports. They provided
their family names but asked that they not be published to protect relatives
who still could be held.
Hasan said he spent 50 days in three camps ' Omarska, Trnopolje and a
brick-factory near Prijedor. Aid workers convinced him and other villagers
when Serb forces arrived in Kozarac that they would be treated like
refugees, he said.
But as soon as people gathered, soldiers separated men from women and
children and took the men to the brick factory.
'We were kept in a brick stove, only three by six meters (yards) big, with
one door, no food or drink,' he said. In three days, he said, he was taken
to a camp near Omarska, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Prijedor.
Interrogators accused him of lying about his family, he recalled. 'Two or
three men there beat me with sticks, gun butts, hands and feet for about one
hour, asking and beating, then asking again.'
He lost seven teeth when he got hit with the butt of a gun in the mouth, and
broke his collar bone, he said.
Hasan is the oldest of nine sons, and in Omarska, he found two of his
younger brothers, he said. They also were beaten.
But after three days, Hasan was moved again, to nearby Trnopolje. He did not
see his brothers again.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S office rent boom is running out of steam. The cost of space in
Frankfurt, for example, is now only 3.5 per cent higher than a year ago, the
RDM property agents' association said yesterday. During the previous year
rents in Germany's main banking and business centre had risen by up to 16
per cent.
The overall slowdown was less marked, thanks to strong demand in Berlin,
Munich and Cologne. But average business rents still rose by only 8 per
cent, compared with 15 per cent a year earlier.
There is a danger of a build-up of unlet space in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf,
Hamburg and Munich, the association said. Further slowing in rent rises is
expected this year, because of economic uncertainty.
Even so, there was no shortage of takers for best-quality, city-centre
space, and the RDM viewed the outlook with cautious optimism.
Average monthly rents in Frankfurt are now DM60 (Pounds 20.60) a square
metre. Top rates of around DM90 compare with DM70 in Munich.
New orders to west German manufacturers fell in June for the fourth month in
succession, the Economics Ministry said. Drops of 3 per cent in domestic
orders and 1.5 in export demand produced an overall seasonally and
price-adjusted decline of 2 per cent.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Iraq bars inspection teams from ministries
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ yesterday stepped up its political challenge to the United Nations in
general and US President George Bush in particular by warning that it would
not tolerate further inspections of Baghdad ministries by teams of UN
inspectors.
The US immediately denounced the statement. Mr Bush pledged that Washington
would guarantee UN inspectors access to suspected Iraqi weapons sites,
saying: 'United Nations resolutions will be honoured in full.'
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, added that military planning had
already been undertaken to ensure the enforcement of such resolutions.
Oil prices rose on fears that the US might eventually use force against
Iraq.
Mr Hamed Youssef Hammadi, Iraq's information minister, said his government
rejected any new attempt to enter ministries because the aim was to 'hurt
Iraq's sovereignty and independence'.
A UN inspection team seeking evidence of Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons
programme was denied entry to the agriculture ministry for 18 days last
month in defiance of Security Council resolutions.
On gaining access to the building, inspectors found nothing relating to
Iraq's weapons programme and President Saddam Hussein claimed Mr Bush had
been politically humiliated.
Iraqi officials were jubilant that the UN team had been delayed for so long
and that Americans in the team did not search the building.
Mr Hammadi said yesterday: 'The entering of ministries or the headquarters
of ministries will not be agreed to. This is one thing. As far as other
places are concerned the inspection teams can visit any place in the
country. We want to end this silly chapter as soon as possible.'
A new 22-strong UN team is preparing to leave Bahrain for Baghdad. Mr Rolf
Ekeus, who heads the UN effort to destroy all Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, last week told Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
that there would be a swift reaction if Baghdad again tried to block
inspection.
In New York, Mr Michael Newlin, deputy head of the UN inspection commission,
said the new probe of Iraq's major weapons capability would start on
schedule tomorrow. A senior UN official said inspectors would not hesitate
to enter a ministerial building if they suspected it contained relevant
material.
The statement by Mr Hammadi keeps the issue high on the US political agenda
as Mr Bush prepares for the Republican convention on August 17.
The Iraqi leader boasted of his part in the political downfall of Mrs
Margaret Thatcher. Baghdad radio has been promising similar treatment for Mr
Bush.

FT  07 AUG 92 / BP cuts payout and axes 11,500 jobs after loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum had its darkest day for decades yesterday as it cut its
dividend for the first time since the first world war, reported a
substantial first-half loss and said it was eliminating 11,500 jobs
worldwide.
About 1,500 jobs will go in the UK, as the group's research and engineering
divisions, which employ 3,600 people, are merged. The BP engineering site at
Uxbridge, west London, will close, with its workload transferred to the site
at Sunbury, Surrey.
The loss and the redundancies were the result of an aggressive cost-cutting
and assets sales programme, for which the company made an exceptional charge
of Pounds 1bn.
The charge transformed a second-quarter net profit of Pounds 107m - slightly
better than expected - into an unprecedented Pounds 812m net loss. The
first-half loss was Pounds 717m, compared with a Pounds 834m profit in same
period last year.
The second-quarter dividend was halved to 2.1p and BP reported a loss per
share of 12.1p, compared with earnings of 4.5p in the second quarter of last
year. BP's shares fell 10p to 196 1/2 p yesterday.
Mr David Simon, who replaced Mr Robert Horton as chief executive after a
boardroom coup in June, said the results were 'clearly unsatisfactory'. He
outlined an accelerated programme of cost-cutting and asset disposals to
reduce BP's Pounds 8.4bn (Dollars 16bn) debt.
The 11,500 job losses include some that have already gone since the
beginning of the year. Some 80 per cent of the losses will be in Europe,
where BP is 'Europeanising' its refining and marketing business by
integrating 23 different national managements into one office in Brussels.
Although Mr Simon said BP faced an 'extremely uncertain economic outlook',
analysts said that without the exceptional charge, the first-half profit of
Pounds 202m on a replacement cost basis (which does not take into account
changes in stock values) was better than expected. It was helped by a strong
performance from the exploration and production arm despite weak oil prices.
The refining and marketing and chemicals businesses suffered sharp drops in
profits, however, which BP blamed on the impact of recession and
overcapacity in the industry.
Debt had also reached Dollars 16bn, taking gearing - the debt-to-equity
ratio - to 87 per cent. Mr Steve Ahearne, BP's chief financial officer, said
this was the 'limit of prudence'.
Mr Ahearne said debt could rise to Dollars 16.5bn or Dollars 17bn by the end
of the year, taking gearing to about 90 per cent. He said the company had no
plans for a rights issue.
This made it essential to cut the dividend and to continue slashing costs
and selling assets to allow debt to be paid off.
Shareholder reaction to the dividend cut ranged from resignation to
disbelief. British institutional shareholders had been expecting a cut of 30
per cent to 50 per cent in the dividend, with most opinion centred on the
lower end of that range.
'I hope they live to regret it,' said one fund manager, adding that
management should have done more to cut costs to salvage the dividend.
'It's a disappointing admission of management expectations of the company,'
he said.
Several institutions, however, felt the company had little choice in the
matter and that the dismissal of Mr Horton as chairman and chief executive
offered BP its best opportunity for aggressive write-downs and a dividend
cut.
'They have had a manic obsession with maintaining the dividend. Essentially
they would have been selling assets to maintain it,' said one pension fund
manager.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Barclays warns of longer recession: Stock market falls as
bank chairman predicts upturn may still be two years away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Financial and Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S recession could go on for as long as another two years, Sir John
Quinton, chairman of Barclays, warned yesterday.
His gloomy prediction came as he disclosed the recession had cost Barclays
Pounds 1.07bn in charges to cover loan losses during the first half of the
year. It follows a series of warnings by business leaders that the economic
recovery is some way off.
Sir John's forecast was immediately attacked by the government. Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the prediction conflicted
with the views of most independent forecasters.
'The important thing is to avoid the danger of talking ourselves into a
sense of almost terminal gloom,' he said.
He added: 'We must not be panicked by short-term problems. We have to keep
our eyes clearly on the medium-term objective of a stable monetary
background.'
But Sir John, one of Britain's most experienced bankers, said he detected no
'green shoots of recovery'. He had formulated his views from talking to
customers and branch managers. He said the economy was 'bumping along the
bottom and I expect we could be well into 1993 or even 1994 before there are
genuine signs of a revival.'
As a result of the loan-loss charges, Barclays incurred an after-tax loss of
Pounds 30m, only the second reported loss in its 300-year history.
Barclays has been particularly hurt by the recession in the property market.
It has suffered large losses on loans to three property companies: Heron
Corporation, Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Barclays' figures
were 'a more accurate guide to our future than the fiddled forecasts of the
Treasury'.
Sir John's remarks led to a fall in share prices, which was exacerbated when
British Petroleum disclosed that it was halving its second-quarter dividend.
The FT-SE 100 index closed 15.2 lower at 2,377.6. However, Barclays' share
price gained 10p to 334p, in part because some investors had expected the
bank to cut its dividend. In the event, Barclays held the payment, although
Sir John left open the possibility that the final dividend would be cut.
That would damage investor confidence because only one of the clearing
banks, Midland, has cut its dividend since the 1930s.
The Confederation of British Industry said talk of no recovery for two years
was 'unduly pessimistic'. But it added: 'Recovery is likely to take place
very slowly and the economy may not get back to the levels of activity
prevailing before the recession within two years.'
Sir John had no policy suggestions for the government apart from supporting
its commitment not to devalue sterling within the exchange rate mechanism.
He said devaluation would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates.
When asked what he thought about plans to revive the housing market put
forward this week by Abbey National, the retail bank, Woolwich building
society and National Westminster Bank, he noted that their proposals had
been 'savaged' by the press.
He added that the press reaction was 'justifiable'.

FT  07 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESULTS from BP, together with more talk of a poor outlook for equities
in the wake of the continued recession, caused a retreat in stock index
futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The September contract opened tentatively, with the first trade struck at
2,406. A period of sideways trading then ensued, with independent traders
responsible for most of the early activity, and the session's high point of
2,409 was recorded at around 9.30am.
The release of the BP results sent September falling to 2,365, with further
worries about the outlook for the UK economy also playing a part in the
retreat.
The Bundesbank's decision not to raise the Lombard rate, however, prompted a
rally in the September future in the afternoon, as did an early recovery on
Wall Street. September eventually closed at 2,385, down 30 from Wednesday's
close and 3 points below its fair value premim to cash of about 12. Turnover
at 6,885 remained dull.
The traded options saw an improvement on Wednesday's poor volume. Total
turnover reached 28,751 lots, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 11,863
trades. BP was the busiest stock option with 4,058 contracts dealt.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Fare wars ravage European airlines -
But progress in cutting costs should help share prices to recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European airline stocks have had a rough ride during the past few weeks, hit
by airline overcapacity, damaging fare wars, and the tortuous progress on
the part of management towards a lower cost base.
Since setting nominal and relative highs in the spring, most of Europe's
handful of quoted airline issues have fallen steeply. The worst performance
has come from Swissair, where the shares, down by more than a quarter since
their peak in May, have fallen 20 per cent faster than the local index.
As well as having to cope with industry-wide troubles, Swissair has
acknowledged that its cost base - one of the highest in Europe - has to be
reduced. The company is in the process of relocating its accounts department
to Bombay, India, with the intention of saving between SFr10m and SFr12m as
part of a plan to save SFr300m (Dollars 227m). Its first round of compulsory
job cuts has started: 420 staff will have left by the end of September.
This is only a small dent, however, in Swissair's total staff of more than
19,000. By comparison, British Airways axed 4,600 jobs, almost 10 per cent
of the workforce, in its last financial year. BA is the most profitable
large airline in the western hemisphere and its shares have declined by less
than 7 per cent since their May high.
After Swissair's sharp fall, there is scope for a share price recovery, says
Mr Guido Meier, an analyst at UBS in Zurich. 'As cost-cutting programmes go
on, we see an increase in the share price,' he says.
Austrian Airlines, too, has had a tough time. Until recently the stock had
followed the rest of the Vienna bourse in a drop of about 15 per cent since
May. Then suggestions that falling profits meant that the dividend was in
danger triggered a further 10 per cent retreat. Mr Frank Jonuschat of
Kleinwort Benson in London says: 'Our earnings estimates will probably have
to be revised downwards by roughly 20 per cent.'
Shares in KLM, the Dutch carrier, by contrast, recovered well at the end of
July. As one of the more entrepreneurially-minded airlines in Europe, KLM
has engaged in the kind of cost-cutting and price competition that industry
watchers in the US and Asia have seen for some time.
The late recovery in the shares was partly the result of a proposed
ground-breaking deal with the US Department of Transportation which should
allow the airline to operate within the US. Washington hopes, thereby, to
put pressure on European governments to allow reciprocal rights for US
carriers in Europe.
For KLM, any boost to transatlantic profitability would be welcome. It was
reluctantly drawn into the US-initiated price wars in the spring and its
Asian routes are far more profitable.
By comparison with its bigger neighbour, Lufthansa, the German state
carrier, KLM's challenges seem small. Lufthansa made an operating loss of
DM600m (Dollars 407m) in the first five months of this year. Since the
shares peaked in February they have lost more than 40 per cent of their
value and the reasons are clear: generous staffing levels and aircraft that,
on average, are barely more than half full.
In response, Lufthansa has grounded some aircraft and initiated a programme
of staff cuts. These are modest by comparison with what has happened at BA
but may begin to affect the bottom line by the end of the company's
financial year, according to Mr Gordon Smith-Carby, an analyst at Smith New
Court in London.
Lufthansa has also hived off its domestic services into a separate
organisation, Lufthansa Express, which may be incorporated eventually.
Cost-cutting measures include paying staff less, and Lufthansa hopes that
the DM350m lost on domestic routes last year will be eliminated.
Prospects for Lufthansa are uncertain in the short term, not least because
the Bonn government has said it wants to sell half of its 51 per cent stake.
A change of control might prompt Lufthansa's executives to reduce costs even
more sharply, to find themselves leading a lean management philosophy among
Europe's airlines and, perhaps, to win the friendship of shareholders and
creditors.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank decision fails to
lift continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision to leave German interest rates alone did little
for continental equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's DAX index finished 7.66 lower at 1,621.15, but off a low of
1,614.96. Turnover rose from DM5bn to DM6.1bn, and there was talk that
futures trading had depressed blue chips after lifting them on Wednesday.
Dealers talked hopefully of rate cut prospects after the drop in west German
industrial orders in June and rising unemployment figures in east and west
Germany. However, Mr Reinhard Fischer, head of equity research at Paribas
Capital Markets, said that his bank was still underweighting the German
market, given that more disappointing company results were in the pipeline.
Douglas, the retailer, stood out painfully with a loss of DM20 to DM510
taking this year's drop in the shares to 23 per cent, against a 17 per cent
gain for Kaufhof over the same period. Douglas reported lower first half
profits, although it said that it expects earnings to improve in the second
half.
PARIS eased in dull trading, as the CAC 40 index failed to hold above 1,800
and closed 4.14 lower at 1,793.84 in turnover of FFr1.5bn.
News that BP had suffered its first-ever net loss of Pounds 812m on a
replacement cost basis for the second quarter, and halved its dividend
weighed heavily on Elf which dropped FFr11.20 or 3.3 per cent to FFr333.30.
Peugeot lost a further FFr18 to FFr649 following its disappointing first
half turnover.
Euro Disney gained FFr3.65 or 4.1 per cent to FFr92.75 for a gain of 9.1 per
cent this week on reports that the theme park has been operating at full
capacity recently. Bancaire jumped FFr17 or 5 per cent to FFr358 but traders
were unable to give a reason for the rise.
Accor was suspended before news that it will have to pay FFr950m to minority
shareholders in Belgium's Wagons-Lits following a Brussels court ruling on
its bid for Wagons-Lits. Later, Accor fell to FFr620 before closing steady
at FFr638.
AMSTERDAM fell on disappointing second quarter results from Philips and
Royal Dutch. The CBS Tendency index lost 1.2 to 116.9.
The electronics group reported a 56 per cent drop in second quarter
earnings, below most analysts' forecasts. The consumer products division
remains the most serious problem and Mr Jan Timmer, the chairman, said that
he did not expect a recovery until 1994. The shares lost 80 cents or 3.2 per
cent, to Fl 24.30.
Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.40 to Fl 145 after announcing lower second quarter net
income which reflected the weak dollar.
MILAN was enlivened by some corporate news but trading remained thin. The
Comit index rose 1.74 to 421.37 in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's
L95.9bn.
There was some interest in the telecoms sector, as Stet rose L38 to L1,638
on news that it had won a Dollars 160m licence to develop cellular phone
systems in Greece.
Benetton added L481 to L11,470. After the close United Optical, a subsidiary
of the Benetton family holding company, Edizione, said that it planned to
raise its share capital. Fiat rose L34 to L4,638 but there was some
nervousness ahead of the car sales data for July, following the poor numbers
in France earlier this week.
Several shares were suspended temporarily for excessive losses, including
the cement and construction group Calcestruzzi, which dropped L1,710 or 17.6
per cent to L8,000, and Euromobiliare, which closed down L305 at L2,400.
STOCKHOLM declined on worries about interest rates and the banking sector.
The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 3.7 to 859.4 in low turnover of
SKr192m.
The ball-bearings group SKF bucked the downward trend ahead of its half-year
earnings report today as its B shares rose SKr1 to SKr97.50.
TEL AVIV closed sharply higher in active trading, the blue-chip share index
gaining 2.48 or 1.7 per cent to 155.23 in turnover of over Shk100m to
register a gain of 5 per cent on the week, recouping the losses of the
previous week.
OSLO's all-share index slid to a new 1992 low, losing 5.73 to 366.20 in
turnover of NKr172m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr3 to NKr136.5.
VIENNA closed at a record low. The ATX index lost 19.84 or 2.6 per cent to
744.21. Leykam, the paper manufacturer, fell Sch10 to Sch305 after
announcing a first half loss of Sch66m.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines as
traders unload speculative stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices closed moderately lower after another thin volume, as traders
unloaded speculative stocks to avoid margin calls, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 57.20 at 15,926.44. The index rose to the day's high
of 16,138.50 in the morning on arbitrage-linked buying, before sinking to a
low of 15,808.61 in the afternoon session.
Volume came to 180m shares, against Wednesday's 185m. Declines led rises by
615 to 290, with 164 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 6.02 to 1,207.32, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
1.38 to 977.64.
However, earlier pessimism appeared to have lifted. 'People seem to have
abandoned the gloom and doom scenario,' said an official at Nippon Life.
Small-lot buying, linked to arbitrage-unwinding, was seen in the morning
session. Arbitrageurs have been booking profits by selling cash stocks, and
buying futures contracts after the recent fall in the futures market.
Unwinding of these positions has led to recent purchasing by dealers in the
cash markets.
Most technical analysts see near-term resistance at 16,300 on the Nikkei. Mr
Jason James, strategist at James Capel, said investors were selling around
the 16,000 level to hedge their positions.
Profit-taking weighed on high-technology blue chips, which had gained ground
on Wednesday on purchases by foreign pension funds. Sony relinquished Y50 to
Y4,020.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y28,000 to an all-time low of Y551,000.
Traders said some selling was prompted by reports suggesting that mobile
telephones were radioactive, and could cause tumours among users.
Banks firmed on covering of short positions. Industrial Bank of Japan put on
Y10 to Y1,770 and Bank of Tokyo Y30 to Y1,200. But Nippon Credit Bank
weakened Y100 to Y4,800 on reports of severe problems at its leasing
affiliates. Nippon Credit has been requesting other banks to co-operate in
restructuring of its three non-bank financial affiliates.
Nippondenso lost Y120 to Y1,310. The Toyota Motor affiliate reported a 25
per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits for the first half due to slack
demand.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 94.33 to 17,479.54 in volume of 17.2m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were influenced by domestic factors.
AUSTRALIA closed at its lowest level for almost four months on nervousness
about the speed of economic recovery. The All Ordinaries index fell 16.8 to
1,588.9 in turnover of ADollars 273m. Banks remained weak, with Commonwealth
down 11 cents to ADollars 7.08 and ANZ off 7 cents at ADollars 3.41.
SEOUL staged a technical rebound in thin trading, struggling back above the
500 level. Speculation that the ruling Democratic Liberal Party would come
up with market-boosting measures today contributed to the advance. The index
ended 6.71 up at 500.04.
Companies vying for the country's second mobile telecom contract fell on
rumours that the ruling party had asked President Roh Tae-Woo to delay
selection of the winner.
MANILA eased as large-capitalisation stocks followed a fall in Philippine
Long Distance Telephone. The composite index slipped 22.05 to 1,463.80 in
combined turnover of 195.7m pesos. PLDT shed 30 pesos to 1,030 on a smaller
than expected 5.8 per cent rise in first-half net income.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower as investors took profits in
late trading. The weighted index rose more than 20 points initially as
shares responded to the central bank's injection of liquidity into the money
market on Wednesday. It was finally a net 12.13 down at 4,122.78 in turnover

FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia expects tin profit
after cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S TIN industry is expected to return to profit in 1992 with the
dominant state-owned tin mine, Tambang Timah, having cut production costs by
25 per cent since 1990.
Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the resources minister, said this week that
Tambang, which accounts for 80 per cent of national production, had cut
production costs to Dollars 5,000 a tonne, down from about Dollars 6,700 in
1990.
Tambang is undertaking a five-year restructuring programme entailing a sharp
reduction in the company's workforce from 24,000 two years ago to 8,250. The
company is expected to concentrate its operations at the offshore areas of
Karimun and Kundur islands.
Mr Kartasasmita set a target to reduce production costs to Dollars 4,500 a
tonne. He welcomed the current international tin price of about Dollars
7,000, as against the forecast price of Dollars 5,800 for the year. He
warned, however, that the price could drop if the US decided to run down its
tin stockpiles.
Indonesia is the world's third largest tin producer after Brazil and
Malaysia and had an export quota at the end of last year of 28,376 tonnes a
year under the Association of Tin Producing Countries' market stabilisation
scheme. In 1990 Indonesia produced about 34,000 tonnes of tin.
Indonesia is to host the next meeting of the association in September and
has requested that Brazil and China, which are not members, attend to
discuss world production levels.
PT Freeport, Indonesia's leading copper mining company, is expected to begin
construction of a Dollars 500m copper processing plant next year.
The state-owned Antara news agency reported yesterday that the plant would
produce 150,000 tonnes of copper a year, of which about 90,000 would be
exported.
Freeport has been undertaking a Dollars 550m expansion programme at its
mines in Irian Jaya to increase copper-ore production to about 57,000 tonnes
a day.
Indonesia's exports of copper concentrate last year earned Dollars 512m.
Freeport also produces gold as a by-product of the copper-concentrate
process and exports totalled 9,355 kg in 1990.
The new plant, located in East Java, is to be constructed by
Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which will take substantial equity in the
project.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developing the last great oil
frontier - Western moves to exploit ex-Soviet reserves are gathering pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PROBLEMS and risks may still be legion, but moves by western companies
to exploit oil reserves in the former Soviet Union are gathering pace.
While the floodgates have yet to open, almost all major western companies
have involvement of some kind - and a number of smaller companies have
proved that they too can do deals with the former Soviet republics. Only
this week, it was announced that a venture that is seeking to become the
first integrated Russian oil company with a listing on the London stock
exchange had been officially registered.
The Siberian Oil Company (Sinco) has been formed by Eurosov Petroleum, a
private company backed by US and Australian oil interests, together with 16
Russian shareholding enterprises. It has licences to exploit 20 fields in
the Tyumen region with recoverable reserves estimated at 1.74bn barrels.
Joint ventures with local producers remain the most popular means of entry
into the former Soviet industry. The first was Yuganskfracmaster, made up of
Canadian Fracmaster, Shell, and the west Siberian producer Yuganskneftegaz.
This undertakes well treatment at fields in the Yugansk region and has
managed to make satisfactory profits by exporting incremental oil production
as payment for its work.
The first US-Soviet venture to get approval to pump Siberian crude oil to
the world, the much-trumpeted White Nights project, has had more variable
fortunes.
Formed in 1990 between US oil companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse and
the western Siberian producer Varyeganneftegaz, it began producing last year
from the Tagrinskoye and West Varyegan fields near Raduzhny, 2,400 km (about
1,500 miles) north-east of Moscow.
It was, however, hit hard by the high costs of employing expatriate workers
and the effects of the Ecu26 a tonne (about Dollars 5 a barrel) export
tariff imposed by the Russian government just before Christmas - from which
it was only recently granted exemption.
Undaunted, the White Nights partners are still preparing to embark on a
bigger project, called Golden Mammoth, to develop four fields in western
Siberia.
Reserves are estimated at 400m barrels, and Mr Gil Labbe, president of
Anglo-Suisse, recently said investment was planned of between Dollars 150m
and Dollars 200m.
The recent offer by the Russian government to exempt 'serious' foreign
investors from the punitive export tariff may help take the brakes off
investment. Other joint ventures to benefit from exemption are Conoco's
Polar Lights project, a Dollars 3bn development of three oil basins in the
autonomous republic of Komi, west of the Ural mountains and close to the
Arctic Circle.
The other is KomiArcticOil, for which Gulf Canada is the operator, with
partners British Gas and local producer Komineft. This has been producing
about 8,000 b/d from Komi's Vozey and Upper Vozey fields since last
December.
Komi has been a centre of interest for western companies that are beginning
to go beyond production-boosting agreements, to sign new exploration and
development deals.
Total, the French oil group, signed a production-sharing contract with
Komineft in May, to develop the 250m-barrel Khariaga field in Komi's Timan
Pechora basin.
The company expects to invest Dollars 400m over two and a half years to
bring the field on stream, and a total of Dollars 1bn over the life of the
field.
Occidental Petroleum, the US major, had long-established links with the
former Soviet Union through its founder, Mr Armand Hammer, once a friend of
Lenin. The company announced in June that a subsidiary, Occidental of the
Republic of Komi, would begin exploration activities as soon as possible on
a 1.5m-acre (600,000-hectare) block in the Timan Pechora basin, after
winning exclusive exploration and exploitation rights with local petroleum
enterprise Ukhtaneftegasgeologia.
Another US major, Texaco, is negotiating a significant production-sharing
agreement in Timan Pechora.
Several other joint ventures have been announced since the demise of the
Soviet Union. Pennzoil, the Texas-based natural resources company, said in
January that it was forming a joint enterprise with Agansk Geological, to be
called the Siberian American Oil company. The venture will develop the
45m-barrel West Mogotlorsk field in the Tyumen region of western Siberia -
Russia's biggest oil-producing area.
In the transition towards competitive tendering for licences, however, some
companies are running into problems.
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the UK independent, secured exclusive rights
to study the Caspian Sea's 100m-barrel Inchke More field last October and
hoped this would lead to a full development contract. Instead, a competitive
tender has been called, although Premier remains confident that its early
work will give it a competitive advantage.
Premier is not the first western company to find the rug apparently pulled
from under its feet.
The so-called 3M group, consisting of US companies Marathon Oil and
McDermott and Japan's Mitsui, carried out a feasibility study on developing
oil and gas offshore of Sakhalin island in the Russian far east. This was
superseded by a competitive tender, only to see 3M come out the winners.
There is, apparently, no such threat to the deals reached by the French
major Elf Aquitaine, which was the first western company to sign significant
exploration deals with both Russia and Kazakhstan, after nearly three years
of painstaking negotiation.
Elf has two blocks of almost 20,000 sq km (7,700 square miles) between the
cities of Saratov and Volgograd in Russia, and south-west of Aktyubinsk in
Kazakhstan. The Russian deal was recently ratified by the Russian
parliament, and Elf has said it expects up to 20 per cent of its reserves to
lie in these regions by the end of the century.
In the race to attract western investment, Kazakhstan has scooped up by far
the biggest deals. Three months after the Elf deal, it reached a
long-awaited agreement with Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the
US, to develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev fields with estimated recoverable
reserves between 6bn and 9bn barrels.
Less than two months later, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state-owned
oil company beat off competition from British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil
to win exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field. The
field contains 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and 2bn
barrels of oil and condensate.
Kazakhstan also has deals with Oman and with the privately-owned Turkish
engineering company United BMB group, which signed a Dollars 1.7bn deal to
exploit four oilfields and construct a gas-fired power station at
Aktyubinsk.
Moreover, Mobil, BP and Chevron are said to be negotiating with Kazakhstan
on the Tesh-Tali in the Caspian Sea.
Kazakhstan's southern neighbour Uzbekistan also recently reached agreement
with the Stan Cornelius Consortium, a group of US investors, to develop its
Mingbulak field, with estimated reserves of 800m barrels.
Even before the break up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian republic of
Azerbaijan, which also has extensive reserves,selected US major Amoco,
together with partners Unocal and McDermott, to develop the Azeri field in
the Caspian Sea, together with local producer Kaspmorneftegaz.
Most experts agree that it will be the end of the century or beyond before
these new ventures start producing enough oil to influence world crude
prices. But the development of the last great oil frontier is well under
way.
This is the final part of a series on the oil sector of the former Soviet
Union. Earlier articles appeared on July 24 and 31.
THE RUSSIAN government has exempted some joint ventures in the key oil and
natural gas sector from tough export taxes, but western companies and energy
advisers in Moscow said the new rules did not go far enough, reports Reuter
from Moscow.
The rules, applying to joint ventures set up before January 1, 1992, say
firms will not have to pay the tax until they have fully recovered initial
investments on energy projects.
'It is certainly better than nothing, but it means there is not much hope
any more for ventures registered this year,' said Mr Richard Lewis of Ernst
and Young Vneshaudit in Moscow. 'Newer joint ventures will still be looking
for help,' said another Western adviser. 'It is prohibitive to conduct
business here with export tariffs so high.'

FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US meat output soars to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN RED meat production soared to new highs in June, bucking generally
depressed global market trends.
The US Department of Agriculture has reported that commercial red meat
production went up 12 per cent from last year to 3.42bn lb, a record for
June. Also, pork production, at 1.33bn lb, broke a 12-year old monthly
output record.
This output surge will probably further improve US export performance, which
has risen steadily during the first half of the year.
For the first five months, beef and veal exports were up 8 per cent compared
with the same period last year to 175,000 tonnes, worth Dollars 791m, while
pork exports rose 32 per cent to 47,000 tonnes, worth Dollars 161m. June
export figures are not yet available.
Industry analysts warn, however, the production boost may be illusory. This
June there were more slaughter days than last June and, more importantly,
output is largely supply driven.
'We go through cycles of production, but we also have had slight growth in
demand,' says Mr Glenn Grimes, an agricultural economist at the University
of Missouri.
Most of the increase comes from hogs, which are up 17 per cent over the last
year.
'We're actually setting a record in pork production in 1992,' says Mr
Grimes, who estimates output at 17.2bn lb, eclipsing the 1980 record of
16.43bn lb.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson meets expectations with
fall to Pounds 21.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLEINWORT Benson Group, the City merchant bank, made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 21.3m in the six months to June 30, down from Pounds 24.7m in the
first half of last year.
Provisions for liabilities and charges were Pounds 21m against Pounds 22m at
the end of last year. Specific banking provisions for the period were Pounds
15m compared to Pounds 29m in the same period a year ago. Net banking
provisions were Pounds 2m, down from Pounds 19m.
The provisions include Pounds 5.3m against a future fall in the costs of
office space which will have to be let at a lower rent.
The group balance sheet has grown to Pounds 9.99bn, up from Pounds 9.95bn at
the end of last year. Share capital is unchanged at Pounds 32m.
Mr David Peake, chairman, said that the results represented a substantial
improvement in the performance of the financing division. He said that the
bank was pleased with the lower level of provisioning. City stockbroker
analysts said that the result was in line with expectations.
'They are a reasonably steady set of results compared to some that Kleinwort
has produced in the last few years,' one analyst said.
Kleinwort's loan book has fallen from Pounds 2.31bn at the end of last year
to Pounds 2.15bn. The bank says the reduction has come entirely in corporate
lending.
Corporate finance, equities, and investment management were all unfavourably
affected by poor market conditions.
Merchant banking made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18m, down from Pounds 23.4m
a year ago, while investment and private banking made Pounds 10.6m (Pounds
13.4m).
Equities were said to have made a reasonable return on capital, but to have
been below last year's levels.
There was a retained profit of Pounds 7.2m, against Pounds 9.2m last time,
and earnings per share slipped from 12.66p to 10.81p. The interim dividend
is unchanged at 5.3p.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BOC advance to Pounds 251m lifts share
price by 17p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday demonstrated its
resilience by revealing a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the nine
months to June 30 from Pounds 229m to Pounds 251m.
Although the results were below expectations, which had ranged as high as
Pounds 257m, BOC's shares rose 17p to 601p. Earnings per share rose 8 per
cent from 30.49p to 33.06p.
Mr Ian Clubb, finance director, warned that there was no clear indication of
any improvement in economic conditions in its main world markets.
He said the group would continue to reduce costs and improve operating
efficiencies. Turnover increased from Pounds 2.07bn to Pounds 2.15bn.
Gases and related products lifted operating profits from Pounds 207.5m to
Pounds 217.4m. Requirements for compressed gases, used mainly in welding and
cutting, remained poor. However, demand for liquid gases continued to grow,
except in the US where the market was flat and in Japan where it was much
lower, said Mr Clubb. Cost control measures had ensured that margins for
those operations were up slightly at 14.5 per cent.
The healthcare businesses' increased contribution of Pounds 76.5m (Pounds
68.3m) was, said Mr Clubb, aided by an improved performance at Glasrock, the
home healthcare operation. Negotiations are under way to sell Glasrock to
Homedco Group, a California-based company, for Dollars 72m (Pounds 37.6m).
Mr Clubb admitted that third quarter results for the healthcare businesses
had been below those of last year. He blamed poor demand for health devices
and the weakness of the dollar.
Most healthcare operations' sales were in the US. In addition, the group was
spending about Pounds 8m a year on development costs at Delta Biotechnology,
which the group acquired last November from Bass, the brewing company.
Mr Clubb said BOC continued to enjoy very strong cash-flow. Gearing had
fallen from 32 per cent to 30 per cent.
Some of the group's debt has been transfered into dollars, which has
depreciated against sterling, while also benefiting from lower interest
rates. Mr Clubb pointed out that the interest rate differential between the
dollar and sterling was seven percentage points.
Overall debt had fallen by Pounds 100m since the start of the financial
year, of which Pounds 40m had been thanks to a cut in working capital, he
said.
He warned that if present currency rates persisted, they would have an
adverse impact on the translation of overseas results for the year.

SIMON Engineering, the world's largest access equipment company, is paying
up to Dollars 15m (Pounds 7.8m) for Hi-Ranger line of truck-mounted
hydraulic platforms from Utility Equipment Corporation, the private US
group.
The deal continues the process of consolidation in the Pounds 1.2bn world
access equipment industry, in which Simon has played a key part with a
string of acquisitions during the past 15 years.
The consideration involves an initial Dollars 2.5m cash payment, an
additional Dollars 2.5m over the next five years, and further sales-related
payments up to a maximum of Dollars 10m.
The complex deal has taken three years to negotiate, and excludes
Hi-Ranger's US manufacturing plant. Its production of about 600 machines a
year, for turnover of Dollars 20m, will be switched to existing Simon plants
in the US.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BP and Italians reveal details of styrene
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BP CHEMICALS and Enichem, the Italian state-owned chemicals group, yesterday
fleshed out details of their broad strategic alliance announced in May with
a memorandum of understanding to set up a joint venture in styrenes.
Under a new company, Styrenics Joint Venture, they will pool their
activities in styrene monomer, polystyrene, expandable polystyrene and
styrene acrylontrile resins. Annual sales of L1,000bn (Pounds 467.94m) are
expected.
The venture - which is subject to European Commission approval -
will rank equally with BASF of Germany as Europe's biggest styrene group and
among the world's top five producers, and should be formed by early next
year.
The interim period will probably be taken up assessing the value of the
businesses being contributed by the partners. Although EniChem's output is
much higher, it is not expected to be the bigger shareholder in Styrenics. A
company official said final ownership levels had still to be decided.
EniChem makes about 520,000 tonnes of styrene polymers, against BP
Chemicals' 170,000, while its output of styrene monomers is about double
that of the UK group.
The deal reflects the strategy of EniChem, which lost L742bn after minority
interests last year, to pick partners in various product areas in order to
raise market share and cut costs.
In May, the company agreed with BP Chemicals to use its gas process to
produce 200,000 tonnes a year of high and low density polyethylene at a
plant in Brindisi.

KALON, the paint group involved in a hostile bid for its rival, Manders,
will today announce terms of an increased and final offer.
At yesterday's closing prices a new cash and shares offer values Manders at
Pounds 88.9m, up from Pounds 82.3m under the previous all-share offer.
Kalon is offering 17 of its shares for each six of Manders against 8-for-3
previously but is introducing a cash alternative of seven of its shares plus
150p for each three Manders.
The new all-share offer equals 260.7p per Manders share and the cash
alternative is worth 264.7p. Manders' and Kalon's shares closed unchanged at
244p and 92p respectively. The offer closes on August 24.
Analysts had been expecting Kalon to improve its offer and give a partial
cash alternative to try to clinch the closely-fought bid. But the
improvement was smaller than some had hoped.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Barclays incurs Pounds 30m after-tax loss: Bad loans have
taken the bank into the red for only the second time in its history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS has made an after-tax loss of Pounds 30m in the first six months of
the year. It is only the second time in the bank's 300-year history that it
has disclosed a deficit.
It is also the first time that Britain's biggest bank has made a loss due to
problems in its core UK operations. Its previous trading deficit in 1987
resulted from provisions against possible losses on loans to less developed
countries.
The Pounds 30m loss compares with a Pounds 242m profit in the first half of
1991. The sharp decline stemmed from a record charge of Pounds 1.07bn to
cover losses on loans, mostly in the UK.
However, the board maintained the dividend at 9.15p a share, all of which
was paid out of reserves, which meant there was a net drain on capital
resources during the period of Pounds 206m.
A Barclays executive said the board had debated intensely whether to cut the
dividend, culminating in a decision on Monday afternoon by the finance
committee.
Sir John Quinton, Barclays chairman, said, however, that a cut in the final
dividend was possible. 'In the present uncertain economic conditions, it is
too early to comment on the final dividend,' he said.
He expected loan losses to continue to be high for the next two years, but
he was hopeful they would not exceed Pounds 1bn.
The bad debt charge included Pounds 200m in respect of problems experienced
by five large borrowers. These are thought to include the three property
companies Heron Corporation, Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh.
Sir John admitted there had been some 'bad lending' at Barclays and that the
bank was reforming its procedures for scrutinising loans.
Staff numbers were cut by 2,331 in the half year, most of the reductions
coming in the UK. Another 1,500 jobs are expected to go in the second half.
Profits of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking and foreign
exchange division, fell from Pounds 154m to Pounds 99m. Recently purchased
banks in France and Germany, Europeene de Banque and Merck Finck
respectively, are still only breaking even.
Group profits before tax and provisions rose 16 per cent to Pounds 1.17bn.
After provisions, pre-tax profit was Pounds 51m, down from Pounds 378m. An
exceptional debit of Pounds 82m covered a fall in the value of businesses
being sold.
Net interest income rose 4 per cent, because of a widening in the margin
between what Barclays pays for deposits and the rate it charges on loans.
This increase in the loan margin offset a reduction in the volume of loans
outstanding in Barclays' books and also the effects of an increase in the
amount of loans classified as non-performing, from which Barclays earns no
interest.

FT  07 AUG 92 / New broom sweeps the decks: The scale of restructuring by
BP's new chief executive has surprised analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only six weeks after jettisoning its chairman and chief executive Mr Robert
Horton, BP yesterday surprised the City again by unveiling an aggressive
programme to yank the company back on to a profitable path.
As the company announced its second-quarter results, new chief executive Mr
David Simon bit the bullet. He halved the dividend to 2.1p, wrote off Pounds
1bn of restructuring costs and assets and promised to axe 10 per cent of the
remaining workforce.
The widely-expected dividend cut was a reversal of his predecessor's policy
of maintaining the dividend at all costs - one of the main issues over which
Mr Horton is believed to have clashed with BP's board.
The rest of the programme was Hortonesque. Mr Simon said BP would
concentrate on its core businesses of exploration and production, refining
and marketing, and petrochemicals. He confirmed that it was seeking to sell
its nutrition arm, reclassified as 'non-core' earlier this year.
The pace, however, has been quickened. BP has raised its target for cost
savings from Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) a year to Dollars 1bn a year by 1994
 -entailing 11,500 job losses - and set a target of earning Dollars 2bn a
year in net replacement cost profits within three years.
Otherwise, the programme was the same as that outlined to analysts by Mr
Steve Ahearne, chief financial officer, days after the boardroom coup which
removed Mr Horton. It entails reducing capital expenditure by 25 per cent to
Dollars 5bn in both of the next two years, and speeding up the assets
divestments, with a target of between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn this
year and in 1993.
Mr Ahearne said yesterday this would enable BP to start paying off its
Dollars 16bn debts at the rate of Dollars 1bn annually from next year.
The real surprise was that BP had plumped to take the Pounds 1bn
restructuring and write-down charge for all this as a one-off hit. Taken as
an exceptional item, this transformed a Pounds 107m profit on a replacement
cost basis - slightly better than expected - into an unprecedented Pounds
812m loss. 'BP has decided to take all the pain of the redundancy costs in
one go, and to write down the values of the assets for when they don't sell
them for what they are worth,' said Mr Alan Sinclair, analyst with Smith New
Court, the London brokers.
Some Pounds 472m of the charge is to cover redundancy costs - 11,500 jobs
are to be lost from a workforce which has already been cut by more than
8,000 since the appointment of Mr Horton in 1990. About 1,500 jobs will go
in the UK, mainly from the research and engineering divisions, for an
expected saving of Dollars 180m a year. The rest of the jobs will be in
European and US operations.
The other Pounds 544m is asset write-downs, to cover the expected losses
associated with BP's disposal programme.
The charge is spread across BP's businesses, including Pounds 175m from
exploration and production; Pounds 351m from refining and marketing; Pounds
185m from chemicals; Pounds 101m from nutrition; and Pounds 204m from
corporate and other businesses.
However, the importance of the dividend cut, which will save the company
about Pounds 450m a year, should also not be underestimated. Mr Simon said
the dividend was now rebased to a level which allowed for sustainable
growth. It was set to be covered by cash flow, and did not rely on the
success of the divestment programme.
The cut was broadly in line with expectations, although some analysts had
suggested a cut of 33 per cent or 40 per cent would have been sufficient.
Analysts also said they believed the medium-term financial programme was a
prudent one, although there was concern over whether BP would be able to
achieve the scale of assets disposals it was planning in a difficult market
conditions.
'I think they are definitely moving in the right direction, and this will
help restore confidence in the management.' said Mr Fergus MacLeod, analyst
at County NatWest. 'They have cut the dividend and stopped over-spending,
and will benefit when the economic environment starts to improve.'
Mr MacLeod believed BP would still be able to start paying off its debts
next year even if it did not make all its planned asset sales, given a
modest upturn in the economy. Without it, prospects are bleak. But any
growth in the economy would bring an immediate improvement in profits from
the refining and chemicals businesses.
BP is more heavily tied to the crude price than its main rivals because it
is a less integrated company, with lower refinery input. Mr Horton once
claimed that every Dollars 1 a barrel increase in world oil prices added
Dollars 200m to BP's bottom line.
While BP is well-placed for recovery, observers say there are still
long-term concerns about structure of the company, and about the
geographical spread of its exploration and production activities, which are
too reliant on mature and declining fields in the North Sea and Alaska.
Moreover, while the new management has pledged a change in leadership style,
it remains to be seen whether Mr Simon will be more successful than his
predecessor at carrying through structural changes without further damaging
the company's morale.
If Mr Horton was known as the hatchet man, BP's employees may be wondering
today what that makes their new boss.

FT  07 AUG 92 / M-way service sites to increase as controls are eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY MORE motorway service areas will be built under new arrangements
announced by the government yesterday.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the private sector, instead of
the government, would now decide where to build the service areas. The
minimum distance between them would be cut from 30 miles to 15 miles.
Strict rules will prevent service areas expanding into other activities such
as shopping and entertainment, however, because the department does not wish
them to become destinations in their own right.
There were fears such a development would generate extra traffic and that
existing facilities in nearby communities might be jeopardised.
At present, sites for motorway service areas are identified by the transport
department. It seeks planning permission for the areas and acquires the
necessary land.
The department lets the sites to private companies which build and operate
the service areas under long leases in return for premium payments and
peppercorn rents.
The new system will leave it to the private sector to decide where to build
service areas. Companies will seek planning permission from local
authorities and acquire the land.
Some curbs will still apply. Free parking, toilets and picnic areas will
have to be provided, all facilities will have to be be available to the
disabled, fuel will have to be on sale 24 hours a day and alcohol sales will
be banned.
Mr MacGregor said the new arrangements would give private operators more
scope to respond to the needs of motorists without jeopardising welcome
aspects of the existing system.
'The old regime for motorway services did not always succeed in providing
drivers with the facilities they required at the right intervals,' he said.
'Although there are schemes in the pipeline, you can still drive from
Folkestone to Birmingham on the M20, M25 and M40, for example, without
meeting a single service area.'
The Council for the Protection of Rural England yesterday gave a cautious
reaction to the proposals.
'There is a real risk that developers will be looking at these new
opportunities to obtain a toehold for development in previously unavailable
countryside locations,' it said.
But they were welcomed by the Automobile Association and the Freight
Transport Association.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Lloyd's to make more information available to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNING body of Lloyd's of London yesterday acted to force disclosure
of its members' business dealings after widespread criticism about conflicts
of interest.
For the first time in its 306-year history Lloyd's also plans to compile
detailed financial figures for all the syndicates into which Names - the
individuals whose wealth backs the insurance market - are grouped.
The two measures, announced yesterday, are designed to increase the quality
of information available to Names. They also respond to criticisms voiced by
'outside' Names, who have borne the brunt of Lloyd's recent record losses,
that insiders who work at the market have benefited at their expense.
From next year, members of Lloyd's governing bodies will be obliged to
disclose full details of all their business interests.
The new register of interests will cover directorships, shareholdings,
Lloyd's partnership interests, salary, pension and profit related pay,
interests in Lloyd's related contracts and details of participation in
individual syndicates. Members of the council, Lloyd's governing body and
two new executive bodies will have to disclose relatives' interests. All
Names will be able to inspect the register.
The first issue of the detailed figures, under the name of Limelight, was
published yesterday. Limelight brings Lloyd's into competition with Chatset,
an independent company, whose unofficial listings, Lloyd's League Tables,
have been published since the early 1980s.
In recent months Chatset's editors, Mr Charles Sturge and Mr John Rew, have
been highly critical of Lloyd's and pessimistic about its business
prospects. The market's losses in 1989, the latest year for which figures
are available, were Pounds 2.06bn.
Mr Sturge said the new publication was designed to 'stuff' Lloyd's League
Tables which sold about 3,000 copies last year.
Limelight will have an initial print-run of 3,000 copies.
Lloyd's is also cutting the number of council members from 28 to 21 in 1993
and 16 in 1995.
This is in line with the recommendations of a committee headed by Sir Jeremy
Morse, the chairman of Lloyds Bank.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Water quality costs set to rise: Bills may double as
estimates to meet directives reach Pounds 60bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER companies in the UK may have to spend up to Pounds 60bn this decade to
comply with new regulations on water quality - double the level projected at
the time of privatisation in December 1989, several water companies said
last night .
Water bills would more than double - on top of inflation - in the most
extreme projections, if all directives were enforced, several companies
said.
Ofwat, the industry watchdog, is next week due to publish a report assessing
how water and sewerage bills might rise in the last five years of the 1990s
according to which water quality regulations are implemented.
The report by Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director general, is expected to
emphasise the need for debate on whether customers would prefer lower bills
or higher standards. It will also comment on the water charges to be made in
1994.
The Ofwat report is likely to be controversial as estimates of investment
and possible impact on customers' bills are now much higher than those made
when the 10 large water companies in England and Wales were privatised. It
was estimated then that water companies needed to spend Pounds 28bn during
the 1990s, and the effect would be to raise customers' bills by an average
of 60 per cent on top of inflation.
The greatest rise in spending plans since then is the result of the recent
European Community directive on Urban Waste Water. Several water companies
estimated last night that this could add an extra Pounds 10bn nationally to
spending plans.
Implementation of EC directives on discharge of sludge at sea could add
another Pounds 2bn, as could full implementation of existing directives on
pesticides in drinking water.
One of the biggest remaining uncertainties is whether the World Health
Organisation will recommend late this year that standards on the level of
lead in water should be raised. Replacement of lead pipes 'could easily add
another few billion', one water company finance director said last night.
Further costs could come from the need to improve water distribution systems
or to build more reservoirs because of the water shortage in the south-east.
Water companies emphasised last night that the relationship between spending
plans and customers' bills was complex, and was very sensitive to the cost
of capital, levels of debt taken on to finance the spending, and the time
over which the investment was made. A doubling in spending did not have to
mean a doubling in the size of bills, one finance director said.
The Water Services Association, representing the large water companies, has
frequently argued that some EC directives on drinking water could be
modified, leading to lower bills without risk to health.

If the BBC had to choose which government minister it wanted to vet the MMC

Hamilton, who is keen to beef up the MMC's rather tepid recommendations, has
crossed swords with the Beeb before. Along with Gerald Howarth, who lost his
seat at the last election, Hamilton successfully sued the BBC over a 1984
Panorama programme which falsely accused the two Conservative MPs of
neo-Nazi behaviour. It cost the BBC Pounds 500,000 and could well have been
one of the issues that led to the sacking of Alasdair Milne as BBC director
general.

Lloyd's of London needs all the help it can get. But maybe it should look no
further than its own navel.
The Natural Law Party thinks that transcendental meditation is a solution
for all the world's problems; now it is proposing 'detailed discussions'
with insurers.
For the investment of 'a few million pounds' in 'Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's
Vedic technology', insurers could save hundreds of millions of pounds by
reducing crime and accidents, according to the party's leader, Geoffrey
Clements. Seven thousand experts, which presumably include the 310
candidates fielded in the general election, practising transcendental
meditation twice daily can 'create a positive influence on the entire
world,' he insists.
The crisis at Lloyd's and at big insurance companies indicates the
'short-sightedness of leaving the destiny of the world to chance. We would
like to invite the leading insurers to ensure their own future,' says
Clements, arising from his horizontal plane.

Thousands of traders will now be able to claim a 5 per cent supplement on

President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, though proud of his free-trade colours,
has drawn in his horns of late. On his recent visit to Britain, Salinas dug

Northern Irish beef which the Mexican authorities claimed was contaminated
but which met all international health standards.
But it would seem that Salinas has been stampeded into his protectionist
stance. Patricio Chirinos Calero, a close friend of the president and his
former environment minister, was publicly thanked by Veracruz
cattle-breeders for keeping out foreign beef earlier last month.
Chirinos, then standing for re-election as governor of Veracruz in Sunday's
election, told the delighted farmers that accepting the foreign beef would
have violated national sovereignty and endangered Mexican health. Now that
the election is over, will Salinas get down off the stockade and let the
beef in?

Now that BP has cut its dividend one wonders which other pillars of the
corporate establishment could be a bit shaky. Like most good clubs, the FT
30-share index has a rather quirky membership; even so the health of its
members is well worth monitoring for signs of dividend fatigue.
Asda and Royal Insurance have only been admitted to the FT 30 club in the
last decade, and they have already cut their dividend. BP itself is a
relatively junior member - it was only invited to join in 1977 when Sir
Jimmy Goldsmith whisked his Cavenham foods business offshore. Among other
new members which may have difficulty keeping up their dividends, P &amp; O,
Forte and BICC are worth keeping an eye on. No need to sound the alarm
bells, but their shares are far more lowly rated than they were at the
bottom of the last recession in 1981.
However, Courtaulds, ICI, Allied-Lyons and Guinness were all rated even more
lowly in the last recession, but they pulled up their socks and have gone on
to win their club colours for good behaviour.

For a privately-owned company with an annual turnover of Pounds 16m, Efamol,

to its letterhead. A few years back Sir James Black, the Nobel prize-winning
scientist who discovered two of the world's best-selling drugs, joined the

It is not every day that Britain's regulators take up non-executive

However, Sir James, who is two years from retirement, says that he first
heard of Efamol - short for Essential Fatty Acid Molecules - through its

Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. Sir James is not some
healthy medicine freak. Nevertheless, he is clearly excited by the potential
of some of the drugs under development.
It seems that Britain's scientists are leading the race to find natural
cures for diseases. He hopes he has something to add on the commercial side.
Who knows, he may even have an eye on taking on the chairmanship when the
70-year-old Sir Ian eventually decides to stand down.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Why British banks are singing the blues: Dismal first-half
results from the four big clearers have raised doubts over the industry's
long-term health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the wrong decade to be a British bank clerk, just as the 1980s were
not happy years for steel workers.
The banking industry is not merely in the grip of a recession, though its
effects - in the form of unprecedented levels of bad debts - have been
severe. The long-term outlook is also bleak.
That was the message delivered over the past week by the chairmen of the
UK's big four clearing banks - Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and
Midland - all of which have announced their first-half results. Since the
recession began two years ago, the four have set more records than the
British Olympic team. But these records have been the source of little
pride. Never before have the banks lost so much money from lending.
Barclays' bad debt charge of Pounds 1.07bn was the largest, in part because
of the bank's excessive lending to a handful of big property companies -
including Mountleigh, Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk and Heron - when the property
market was approaching its peak at the end of the 1980s.
As a result, Barclays yesterday disclosed that it had made a Pounds 30m loss
after tax in the first half. It was only the second time in Barclays'
300-year history that it disclosed a loss and the first time that such a
loss stemmed from problems in its core UK operation.
The long-term prospects for growth, once the recession ends, are also poor.
Sir John Quinton, Barclays chairman, is doubtful that the economy will start
to recover for a year or two. Even when the recession ends, he believes that
'it will be difficult to return to the levels of profit enjoyed in the late
1980s'.
Some bankers and industry observers are even more pessimistic. They fear
that the severity of the recession could force the banking industry close to
insolvency. The thesis is that the banks have an excessive exposure to the
property market through direct lending and through commercial loans backed
by property collateral.
Unless interest rates are cut sharply, property prices may continue to fall,
leaving the banks bereft of security for their loans. So if customers
continue to have difficulty making loan payments, the banks could be hit by
a second great wave of loan losses - and this wave could be the killer.
That, at least, is the apocalyptic scenario. However, such pessimism is
probably unwarranted. The Bank of England, responsible for monitoring banks'
health, is convinced that they are strong enough to weather further knocks,
a view shared by the banks.
The latest results nevertheless give credence to a modified version of the
gloomy thesis, which would run as follows: banks will survive the current
shocks, but an extended period of contraction in the industry has begun.
All the banks expect loan losses to continue at high levels, but their
balance sheets are probably robust enough to withstand the pressure. Despite
suffering unprecedented levels of bad debts over the past two years, all
four of the clearers continue to have strong balance sheets by international
standards.
Indeed, there has been an improvement over the past year in the banks'
ratios of capital to assets - the main measure of balance sheet strength -
except in the case of NatWest, whose ratio has held constant. There are two
reasons why ratios have not been impaired. First, operating profits,
excluding bad debt charges, have held up well; for NatWest and Barclays they
have risen sharply. Second, there has been a reduction in lending and thus
in the asset side of the ratio.
Operating profits have improved for three reasons:
Banks have been cutting costs, mainly by shedding staff. Around 30,000 jobs
were lost in the UK banking industry last year. In the first six months of
the current year, more than 10,000 jobs have gone from the four's domestic
operations.
Most banks have been increasing their non-interest income sharply. They have
been pushing up the tariffs for consumers and businesses by considerably
more than the rate of inflation, a process euphemistically described by one
banker as 'realistic pricing'. Only Midland, for some years the weakest of
the four and recently pre-occupied by the stormy preparations for its
marriage to Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, failed to derive any significant
benefit from this source.
Banks have widened the margin between what they pay to depositors and what
they earn on loans.
Yet despite this widening, interest income has been under pressure. In part
this is because the banks have suffered a sharp rise in non-performing loans
which pay no interest.
Perhaps the most important trend in the latest results is the reduction in
the volume of loans outstanding on the banks' books. This has had one
beneficial effect. It has meant that gross assets have fallen, thereby
improving the ratio of capital to assets.
But if banks have been lending less, the opportunities for earning interest
have also lessened. Some of this reduction in lending has been the banks'
own choice. They have eschewed low-yielding loans and have become more
averse to risk - a belated response to their imprudent lending of the past
decade. Bank customers, both companies and individuals, have also been keen
to reduce their borrowings.
It is the reluctance by customers to borrow which gives grounds for
pessimism about banks' long-term prospects. Mr Terry Smith, head of research
at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker, says the demand for loans is likely to
remain very low, even when the economy recovers. The banks generally agree.
At the same time, banks are also likely to find it increasingly difficult to
increase their tariffs by more than the rate of inflation. Competition from
other financial institutions should put a brake on these rises. However, if
the rises continued, the government could ask UK competition authorities to
intervene.
So if banks are going to be able to push up profits significantly, they
would have to continue cutting costs and improving productivity. Since staff
costs account for the bulk of overhead, this means making more employees
redundant.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, says: 'We are going to go
through what manufacturing industry went through a decade ago.'

FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: A little lesson for Big Steel - Mini-mills
and imports have forced US companies to reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
Fly south-east from Chicago and you will quickly reach one of the most
imposing landmarks of 20th-century American industry - an ugly, sprawling
monument to the past glory, present tribulation and future uncertainty of
the big US steel companies.
There, strung out along the southernmost curve of Lake Michigan, like
grotesque mechanical monsters at a watering hole, stands the most
concentrated collection of steel plants in North America. The largest of
them all, US Steel's Gary works, stretches for more than six miles along the
shore.
This is the heartland of 'Big Steel', the giant corporations which have
dominated the US industry since the turn of the century. And, though you
might not guess it from the lake shore's grim appearance, Big Steel has
poured over Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) into the modernisation of these and
other US plants during the past decade to combat two potentially deadly
threats which have battered the leviathans for more than 20 years.
One is cheap imported steel. The other is the seemingly unstoppable growth
of nimble US 'mini-mills', which have much lower capital demands and
operating costs than the giants. This month brings two significant
milestones in these battles:
On Monday, the International Trade Commission, a US government agency, will
make a preliminary judgment on Big Steel's complaints that foreign rivals,
unfairly subsidised by their governments, have been dumping steel in the US
market and depressing prices.
The steel companies began firing off the complaints last spring, upon the
expiration of Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs), in force since the
early 1980s. These restricted the import of steel into the US to give the
domestic industry time to modernise. However, in recent years, steel imports
have actually been declining, in part because of the weak dollar.
On Wednesday, US Steel, the biggest company in the industry, acknowledged it
was considering building a mini-mill of its own. This would be the first
such plant by a steel major and tacit admission that even after their
radical restructuring over the past decade, the big steel companies must
adapt a great deal more if they are to survive.
'They have some very formidable challenges ahead of them,' says Mr
Christopher Plummer, a consultant at Philadelphia-based Resource Strategies.
Still, over the past 10 years Big Steel has undergone a remarkable
transformation for the better. At the start of the 1980s, after decades of
neglecting technology pioneered in Europe and Japan, the American industry
was one of the world's less efficient producers and in danger of being
swamped by imports.
Today it is on many measures among the world's most efficient. Apart from
the huge capital investment, it has benefitted from the closing of dozens of
inefficient plants and a halving of the industry's workforce; the VRAs; the
decline of the dollar; and capital and technical help from Japanese rivals
which have got round the trade barriers by investing in joint ventures with
the Americans.
Yet the large steel companies remain troubled. Virtually all of them are
losing money, as they have in most of the past 10 years, and many are
crippled by weak balance sheets and onerous retiree health and pension
costs.
The most immediate cause of pain is the US recession, which has sharply cut
American demand for steel. The effects of that have been exacerbated by a
global glut of steel products, which has forced world prices down to the
level of 1980 - and even lower once inflation is taken into account.
This problem is likely to recede gradually as the US and global economies
emerge from recession, and American prices could get a further fillip if the
industry eventually wins some form of protection through its anti-dumping
actions.
But Big Steel also faces a longer-term, purely domestic threat, symbolised
by a spanking new mill which lies 100 miles south of Lake Michigan, amid the
red barns, silver grain silos and flat corn and soybean fields of rural
Indiana.
This is the technologically innovative Crawfordsville plant of Nucor, the
largest and most successful of the mini-mills which over the past three
decades have come from nowhere to snatch from Big Steel much of the US
market for commodity products such as bars, wire and rod. They now account
for about 21 per cent of US steel consumption, compared to about 17 per cent
for imports.
The mini-mills differ from the US majors in that they are non-union, niche
players with extremely lean organisational structures and make steel with
less capital intensive technology. Big Steel is vertically integrated,
meaning that each company carries out every stage in the transformation of
iron from raw ore into finished steel. The mini-mills start not with ore but
scrap metal, which they simply liquefy in an electric arc furnace.
All these factors have given the minis large cost advantages in low- grade
steel markets. Big Steel's response has been to retreat to the more
technologically sophisticated, higher margin markets for flat-rolled
products, which account for about half of US consumption.
Nucor's two-year-old plant at Crawfordsville is special because it is the
first mini-mill to make flat-rolled products - albeit for the less
sophisticated end of that market - and it does so with a new technology,
called thin-slab casting, which sharply cuts the time and capital costs
required to make sheet steel.
Just how far Big Steel has come, and the challenge from the mini-mills that
still lies ahead, can be seen by comparing the reforms which have
significantly improved the efficiency of US Steel's Gary works with Nucor's
Crawfordsville operation.
Five years ago the quality of Gary's flat-rolled output was so poor that it
was in danger of being struck off the supplier list for two of its biggest
customers, Ford and General Motors. Today, it holds a string of quality
awards and its productivity, at around 2.7 man hours a ton, compared to over
seven a decade ago, is probably the best of any Big Steel plant.
Mr John Goodwin, the plant manager, attributes about half of this
improvement to Dollars 1.2bn of capital investment, which has been used to
upgrade blast furnaces and rolling mills and make all of its output
continuously cast (a cost-saving production method which integrated plants
were slow to adopt.)
The other half was due to a big change in the culture of the plant, with
managers devolving much more responsibility to workers. 'It sounds easy,'
says Mr Goodwin, 'but it's very difficult. Our culture has always been: 'I'm
the boss and you do what I say, when I say.' '
For example, a team of five workers has been assigned to customers' plants
to assess problems with steel shipments and makes recommendations for
improvements.
Along with other parts of US Steel, Gary has gone some way to reducing job
demarcation lines, and in one of its new finishing lines it intends to have
just one category of union member running the whole operation. This should
lead to more efficient use of the machinery. 'But it's a lot easier to
accomplish at a greenfield site,' says Mr Goodwin.
That is clearly evident at Crawfordsville, where the heavily sweating
labourer you see standing at the base of the casting machine turns out to
also be the shift manager.
Nucor's employees are extremely flexible in their work practices. This is
partly because they are from overwhelmingly rural backgrounds - not for
nothing is Crawfordsville in the middle of corn fields - and distrust
unions. It is also because a very large element of their pay is linked to
productivity, so the more flexible they are, the larger their take-home
package.
The cost of employing labour at the two plants is not far apart. Gary spends
about Dollars 30 for an hour's work and Crawfordsville Dollars 28. But
because US Steel has the historic burden of high retiree benefits, the Gary
worker only sees around Dollars 14 an hour in his pay package, compared with
Dollars 20 for the Nucor employee.
Now put these labour advantages together with Nucor's relatively cheap
electricity costs (thanks again to a rural, greenfield location) and the
operating advantages of its new technology. The result is the lowest
manufacturing costs of any US flat-rolled producer - some Dollars 50 to
Dollars 75 a ton below Big Steel. Nucor claims the gap will widen as
Crawfordsville matures.
'While those guys in Big Steel are wringing concessions from the labour
unions, getting a morsel there and a granule here, this thing is a powerful
beast that has a long way to move forward,' says Mr Keith Busse, the plant
manager.
Crawfordsville's 1m tons of output is small in a sector totalling 40m to 50m
tons. But Nucor expects to be producing 8m tons from Crawfordsville and
three clones by the turn of the century. Other mini-mills sniffing around
the new technology could boost the total to 13m to 15m tons, says Mr
Plummer, who adds: 'There's no way that can happen without some companies
being pushed out.'
However, companies such as Nucor have no monopoly on new technology and US
Steel's consideration of a mini-mill of its own shows how the most flexible
and efficient of the Big Steel companies can fight back.
US Steel could even have a technical advantage over Nucor, since one new
method of steel-making it is considering - thin strip casting - may produce
higher quality steel than Nucor's thin-slab technique.
Mr Tom Usher, president of US Steel, which looked at and rejected the
thin-slab method, argues that Nucor will never compete at the very top end
of the flat-rolled market because its technology cannot make sufficiently
fine steels - a view strongly disputed by Mr Busse.
Whatever the truth, many analysts believe that over the next 10 to 15 years
the traditional distinctions between the mini-mills and integrated companies
will blur as the two converge on new technologies both for smelting and
casting steel, and as the Big Steel companies are driven to become nimbler
niche players themselves.
Whether US Steel and other integrated plants can beat the mini-mills at
their own game will depend in large measure on management enterprise, on
each company's capital resources and on its ability to get the steel
workers' union to adopt more flexible labour practices. US Steel looks
reasonably well-placed, but some of its weaker brethren do not.
A flight over Gary provides a chilling reminder of the fate awaiting those
that fail to adapt. Below, in the heart of America's mightiest steel
complex, lies a large empty space, the site of razed factories that once
served commodity markets lost to mini-mills and imports. Weeds cover the
wasteland.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Stalemate in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AFRICAN National Congress has made its point. It should now return to
the negotiating table. The trial of strength on the streets has ended in
stalemate. Millions of Africans stayed away from work on Monday and Tuesday,
either out of political conviction or as a result of intimidation. On
Wednesday exuberant supporters of the ANC were addressed by Mr Nelson
Mandela in the amphitheatre near government headquarters.
President FW de Klerk evidently instructed his senior police officers to
co-operate with the demonstration leaders, but this does not mean that
further 'rolling mass action' would necessarily pass without setting off a
violent explosion. In any event, continued negotiation by street theatre
would be self-defeating. It would further weaken the republic's economy and
deter foreign investors.
It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that Mr Mandela will lead his party
back into talks. That is the logical next step. The ANC has expressed its
understandable anger at the killing of its people at Boipatong, allegedly by
supporters of the Inkatha Freedom party. Recent reports have lent credence
to charges that the lower ranks of the South African police have connived
at, or taken part in, murders of ANC supporters.
The number of deaths in police custody has been shown to be suspiciously
high. The assertion that Mr de Klerk is either unable or unwilling to
control his security forces has become increasingly difficult for him to
refute. This puts his government back under the world spotlight.
He is aware of this. South Africa has accepted 10 United Nations observers
within its borders. The team is small, but its potential contribution as a
facilitator of an eventual settlement is disproportionately large. Mr Cyrus
Vance was instrumental in bringing about a pre-demonstration meeting between
the South African government and the ANC, thus contributing to the
apparently peaceful nature of this week's events and setting the scene for
an early resumption of talks. Mr Vance is now expected to propose the
establishment of a long-term UN presence in the republic, to monitor the
progress of the national peace accord.
This should be welcomed, but its potential should not be exaggerated.
Outsiders such as the UN and the British individuals sent to assist into
inquiries into police behaviour can help diminish the mistrust between the
ANC and the government, but they cannot solve the fundamental problem that
faces the two sides.
This is that Mr Mandela's party demands majority rule while Mr de Klerk's
insists on 'power-sharing' as a means of protecting minorities. A deal can
be struck only when the ANC recognises that it cannot have total control
over South Africa handed to it on a plate and the National party accepts
that in the end constitutional safeguards for minorities cannot permanently
and universally thwart the will of an elected majority.
If South Africa is lucky, the perilous weeks now behind it will have served
to concentrate the minds of those who must reach agreement - or face a
future that a former prime minister once described as too ghastly to
contemplate.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Off the road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF JACK KEROUAC had been British, he would probably have gone by bicycle.
The folk hero of America's road culture would have drawn little poetic
inspiration from a coast to coast drive on Britain's motorway network. Even
today, more than 30 years after Kerouac's fabled journey, a 'road-trip'
along America's highways is exciting and up-lifting: in marked contrast to
the congestion, pollution and poor services which scar the M1 from London to
Leeds.
The great British public has always shown a dogged willingness to tolerate
squalor. Some even claim to take a strange pleasure from a stop at a
motorway service station. Maybe it is the lingering legacy of the war-time
spirit that has caused decades of motorists to tolerate greasy food served
by unwilling staff at inflated prices.
The quality of Britain's motorway services is a clear example of the abuse
of monopoly power. Five companies currently control all 55 motorway service
areas on sites owned by the government and operated under 50-year
franchises. Almost never spaced less than 30 miles apart, they have had
little incentive to respond to consumer needs.
Road travellers have detected some recent improvement in food quality. But
last year's Which? report found dirty or shabby toilets, drab surroundings
and 20-minute restaurant queues. In three cases, the report recommended
motorists to drive on by.
Yet budding beatniks be ready. Mr John Major's famous intimacy with roadside
Happy Eater restaurants has equipped his administration for radical
measures. Yesterday's announcement that the government plans to deregulate
motorways service areas suggests Britain's motorways are to enter the
consumer age. The franchise system is to be dismantled and private
developers will now be able to identify new sites where they see
profit-making opportunities and apply for planning permission.
This change does not herald a new age of motorway fun: service stations will
still be tightly controlled. A minimum 15-mile interval between services
will still be maintained; and stations will not be allowed to provide
activities 'which are unconnected with motorists' use of the road and which
would therefore lead to the site becoming a destination in its own right'.
The intention of these restrictions is understandable. It is in no one's
interest to develop motorway leisure complexes on the edge of large cities
which undermine urban facilities, increase traffic flow and disadvantage
city-dwellers without cars. And, surprising as it may seem, Britain's
motorway verges are an important natural habitat for wildlife.
Still, the government should interpret its guidelines liberally. Safety
demands that long distance motorists need plenty of breaks; and there is no
reason why the only available pastimes should be eating, drinking and arcade
games.
Why not allow drivers to break the trip from London to Glasgow with a
refreshing swim at Newport Pagnell, or from Birmingham to Carlisle with a
spot of 10 pin bowling outside Warrington? As for the leisure-centre seeking
tripper, there is a long overdue way to discourage short journeys: motorway
tolls.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: On Golden Pond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE loons, the loons] You old poop] Oh, look at you] Remember Katharine
Hepburn and Henry Fonda in the 1981 film? Well, here is the stage original,
at London's Richmond Theatre, and here are real-life husband-and-wife team
Googie Withers and John McCallum. On Golden Pond enables two ageing actors
to be relentlessly adorable all evening long - a pursuit in which they
involve anyone else who passes by.
The scene is the Thayers' summer house in Maine, and out there through the
windows is Golden Pond. (The name is presumably mixed from two real New
England lakes - Goose Pond and Walden Pond. Julian Saxton's set catches the
luminous look of the water and the architecture of such a house to
perfection.)
Over there in the water, the loons call; the loons mate. Meanwhile, indoors
Norman Thayer is getting older and Ethel is coping gamely with his loss of
memory. ('You old poop.')
He is difficult in one adorable way, and she is practical in another
adorable way. Their childless, no-longer-young daughter, Chelsea, arrives
('Oh, look at you]'), and every stereotypical failure of communication
between father and daughter pops to the surface. However, Chelsea - her
parents' daughter - knows also how to be adorable. And she has at last found
Mr Right, and has brought along both him and his 13-year-old kid Billy.
Billy fits right in, for he too is non-stop adorable.
Norman teaches Billy to fish, Ethel picks berries, the loons keep up their
bit. Chelsea marries Mr Right, Norman recovers from an angina attack, the
months pass, and everything in the world of nature helps everyone in this
great big lovely learning process: How To Stay Adorable Till Death Us Do
Part.
On Golden Pond - in whatever version - is not the place to look for good
acting. It is just a vehicle for determined loveableness, and - thanks to
Christopher Renshaw's direction and the script's surefire sentimentality -
everyone rides it for all it is worth. Julia Foster is charming as the
daughter, though she overdoes the winsomeness. Matthew Hearne is duly sweet
as Billy.
Most of the play has Norman and Ethel alone together, and these scenes are
the gooiest. John McCallum is fine as Norman once he has settled into brisk
speech, but otherwise he plays a distracted old dear by exaggerating one or
two obvious shticks - isolating his vowels and letting them slide away like
toboggans.
The best fun is to watch Googie Withers. She retains the same arched brows
and mobile lips that made her famous 40 years ago. Her figure is even more
Edwardian today and her voice is now a husky baritone.
But, whereas she used to be dark and sultry, now she is a model of bright,
no-nonsense energy. She is the person least obviously engaged in tugging the
heartstrings, and her Ethel is the most nearly three-dimensional character.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: NY City Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE New York City Opera season, from now to November, is not one of the most
adventurous. A promised production of The Excursions of Mr Broucek which
would have given Janacek's fantastical comedy its American premiere, has
been postponed, leaving Busoni's Doktor Faust as the only stiff addition to
the repertory. The other new productions are of Carmen, and of works either
on the edge towards Broadway musical (Marc Blitzstein's Regina) or over it
(110 in the Shade).
Nor is there much risk in the choice of opening revivals La Boheme, Cav and
Pag, and La Traviata - except in as much as this last opera is given in a
shoddy, sniggering updating saved only by stylish, poised singing from
Michael Rees Davis as Alfredo. (There are strong performers in the Pagliacci
too, especially Gwynne Geyer as Nedda, flicking a steely voice with the
speed, accuracy and gleam of a flayer's knife, and Sigmund Cowan as a Tonio
dark-toned and true, intelligent with the words and with his watchful eyes,
commanding sympathy by his entire involvement.)
110 in the Shade is unbelievably corny. First presented in 1963, it was a
mild failure and sank into the limbo of college productions from which Scott
Ellis, directing this City Opera staging, determines to rescue it. He got
the original team of Harvey Schmidt (music), Tom Jones (lyrics) and N
Richard Nash (book) together again to make a trimmed version with a couple
of new songs. He also encouraged excellent support from set designer Michael
Anania, who provided a selection of slatted silhouettes to suggest farm
buildings rippled by heat haze, for the action takes place during a drought,
at the stated temperature, somewhere in the old west.
The drought also affects the heart of the heroine, Lizzie (the pathetic
fallacy, along with all other dramatic devices, is working at a pretty basic
level here). The sheriff is her obvious match, but cannot be made to declare
himself. Along comes a young mountebank, Billy Starbuck, who promises he can
bring rain, and meanwhile takes Lizzie off for a night of passion on his
lorry. This fires up the sheriff; Lizzie makes her inevitable choice; and
the rains come down. City Opera's cast, led by Karen Ziemba as Lizzie,
Richard Muenz as the taciturn sheriff and Brian Sutherland as the rainmaker,
give it all they have and disguise any embarrassment they might feel. The
rain, drenching the stage at the end, has a charming stillness that fits
rather well.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Italy set to move step nearer to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE new Italian government's privatisation plans will overcome a big hurdle
today when special shareholders' meetings of the four biggest public-sector
groups approve their transformation into joint stock companies.
The change in legal status is a crucial step towards the flotation of some,
or all, of the groups. The companies include IRI, Italy's biggest
public-sector holding, ENI, the state-owned energy and chemicals group,
ENEL, the electricity generating authority, and INA, the state insurance
agency.
While approval for the change is not in doubt, the focus will be on the
composition of the groups' boards of directors which are also up for
renewal. The new boards should offer a clear indication of the balance of
political forces within the government over privatisation.
'You'll have to count how many old faces move out and how many new ones come
in,' said a senior supporter of privatisation in the government yesterday.
'If there are more new faces than old, it means we've succeeded.'
However, that is not a foregone conclusion. Some executives who owe their
jobs to party allegiances are resisting change. The Christian Democrats and
the Socialists, the two biggest parties in Mr Giuliano Amato's coalition,
are also divided. The composition of the boards had still not been decided
last night.
Observers, however, expect them to be slimmed down, giving representatives
from the Treasury, now the companies' shareholder, much greater say. The
board of directors of ENI, the biggest of the four, currently has 15
members. 'The new boards should be much smaller - 10 people at the most,'
said one official.
Officials expect the current, politically appointed, chairmen of the four
companies to be reconfirmed. However, it is thought the mandates of the four
 -Mr Franco Nobili at IRI, Mr Gabriele Cagliari at ENI, Mr Franco Viezzoli
at ENEL, and Mr Lorenzo Pallesi at INA - may be cut from their present
multi-year terms. Their powers may also be curtailed.
Once the assemblies are over, bankers expect little movement on
privatisation until October, by which time a six-member committee of bankers
and economists, set up by the Treasury last week, will have presented its
findings. 'Once we've received their suggestions, we'll put things in shape
and decide how to proceed,' a senior official said.
The pace may disappoint foreign bankers who have postponed their holidays in
the hope of submitting privatisation proposals to Treasury officials. Mr
Perio Barucci, the Treasury minister, has turned down all such meetings
until he receives the privatisation committee's recommendations. 'Then the
bankers will have their chance,' said the official.
The government has already indicated its willingness to float more than 49
per cent of public-sector companies' shares - a virtually impassable barrier
in the past.
Flotation of IRI's Finmeccanica subsidiary and ENI's Agip and Snam
operations is due to go ahead as planned later this year. However, ministers
are considering sending a much stronger signal to the markets, possibly by
disposing of the government's controlling stake in a big, prestigious
state-owned company, such as one of the public-sector banks.
The change in status should coincide with final approval in the Senate, the
upper house of parliament, of the government's decree law which put the
transformations into effect. Although changing to joint stock company status
had been discussed at length by the previous government of Mr Giuliano
Andreotti, execution has been one of the main achievements of Mr Amato.
The positive economic effects of a national labour accord could push Italian
interest rates down another 2.5 percentage points by the end of this year, a
union leader said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Milan.
Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of the CISL union, said such a drop in
the Bank of Italy's official discount rate would shave some L40 trillion
(million million) of interest payments off the government's budget deficit.
Mr D'Antoni said that although the government had not made any promises or
outlined any specific interest rate target in negotiations with unions to
reform Italy's wage-indexation system last week, 'it was clear to everyone
that it was one of the objectives'.
'We certainly weren't joking when we reached an agreement of that kind,' Mr
D'Antoni said, referring to the unions' decision to accept the wage plan.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Brussels rebukes airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOUR European airlines have been rebuked by the European Commission for
increasing fares last summer in breach of EC law.
The Commission condemned fare increases introduced by British Airways,
Alitalia, Luxair and Iberia on 22 routes - all but one involving British
airports. The Commission decided the increases were not 'reasonably related'
to the airlines' long-term costs.
The Commission has not punished the airlines, which increased the fares
during the Gulf crisis when the regulatory regime was temporarily relaxed.
Instead, it has warned governments that they cannot use the prices as a
reference for future increases.
Britain asked Brussels to look into nearly 100 fare increases in April 1991.
Most of the fares were cleared by the Commission.
British Airways received a rap over the knuckles for increasing the standard
fares on 12 routes booked from Greece, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Belgium
into Manchester and London. The British carrier also broke the law with fare
increases on three routes out of Birmingham.
The European Commission yesterday gave Pepsico and General Mills, US
multinationals, the go-ahead to create Europe's largest manufacturer of
snack food products.
Brussels' competition authorities cleared the joint venture - which will
have sales of Dollars 640m (Pounds 335m) - after a routine one-month
investigation.
The US groups said in May they intended to merge their operations in six
continental European countries. A Commission spokesman said the
fragmentation of the EC snack food business meant the enlarged company would
command less than 10 per cent of the market.
The Commission found that the companies' operations overlapped only in the
area of savoury products, such as potato chips. But as the two companies
were active in different parts of the Community, Brussels decided the deal
would not distort competition.
Pepsico will own 59.5 per cent of the joint venture and General Mills 40.5
per cent. The joint venture will embrace Pepsico's operations in Spain,
Portugal and Greece, and General Mills' business in France, Belgium and the
Netherlands.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Islamic nations press UN on force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 46 members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) are
applying pressure on the United Nations Security Council to intervene
militarily in Bosnia-Hercegovina following an increase in fighting
throughout the republic.
The OIC, which recently formed a 'contact group' or lobby at the UN, wants
the Security Council to exempt Bosnia from the arms embargo, deploy more
military forces in the independent republic and step up the humanitarian
relief effort.
The lobby, which emerged from the OIC meeting in Istanbul in June, is
chaired by Mr Mustfa Aksin, Turkey's ambassador to the UN, and includes
Pakistan, Iran, Egypt and Senegal. Saudi Arabia will soon join the lobby
which acts on behalf of all the OIC member countries - which include a
quarter of UN members.
'We (the lobby) think the Security Council is not doing enough in trying to
stop the killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' a Turkish diplomat based in the US
said yesterday. He added that last Monday, it asked Daoyu Li, the (Chinese)
president of the Security Council, to adopt a much tougher resolution in
defence of Bosnia's Moslem population against Serb aggression.
'We are prepared to take other measures if the Security Council does not
respond favourably to our proposals,' an official from the Turkish Foreign
Ministry said yesterday. Although he did not give details, he said Turkey
would continue to comply with current UN resolutions and sympathise with any
EC resolutions.
Eastern European diplomats at the UN said Morocco, which is a non-permanent
member of the Security Council, has repeatedly backed Hungary and Austria in
attempts to apply more pressure on Serbia to stop the killing.
But despite the unanimity among OIC member states in criticising western
caution and in condemning the violent break-up of Bosnia, the movement
remains unclear about its goals. It provides aid to the Bosnians but is
unlikely to launch any unilateral military initiative.
A Pakistani diplomat said: 'In all honesty, the movement is pretty
spineless. The most important Arab countries continue to hide behind the US.
They give a bit of money to the Bosnian Moslems. But it does not add up to
much, yet.'
In their effort to seek assistance from the Islamic world, Bosnia's Moslems,
who are Sunni, and Slav, have to play a delicate balancing act.
They cannot afford to receive support from any fundamentalist Shia movements
because that would give credibility to Serbian propaganda that the Moslems
are intent on setting up an Islamic fundamentalist state in Bosnia, a claim
denied by Bosnian officials.
On the other hand, the longer the war continues in Bosnia, and the longer
the international community hesitates in taking military action, the more
likely it is that sections of the Moslem community will be further
radicalised.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S office rent boom is running out of steam. The cost of space in
Frankfurt, for example, is now only 3.5 per cent higher than a year ago, the
RDM property agents association said yesterday. During the previous year
rents in Germany's main banking and business centre had risen by up to 16
per cent.
The overall slowdown was less marked, thanks to strong demand in Berlin, the
new capital, Munich and Cologne. But average business rents still rose by
only 8 per cent, compared with 15 per cent a year earlier.
There is a danger of a build-up of unlet space in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf,
Hamburg and Munich, the association said. Further slowing in rent rises is
expected this year, because of economic uncertainty and the fading
excitement over completion of the single European market, it added.
Even so, there was no shortage of takers for best-quality, city-centre
space, and the RDM viewed the outlook with cautious optimism.
Average monthly rents in Frankfurt are now DM60 (Pounds 20.60) a square
metre. Top rates of around DM90 compare with DM70 in Munich. Prices there
climbed more than 15 per cent, driven up by a shortage of space in the
centre and the development of new properties near the route to the new
airport.
Further north, quality space in Dusseldorf ranges from DM35 to DM60. In
Cologne, the office property boom town of the 1980s, rents are 12.5 per cent
up on a year ago, at around DM32. The city's position in the centre of
industrial Germany and the EC still has strong pulling power, the
association said.
Berlin, meanwhile, continued its upward charge, recording a 60 per cent
increase over the 12 months under review. The best offices now cost DM100
and more, with good quality space DM30 dearer at DM80 a square metre.
New orders for west German manufacturers fell in June for the fourth month
in succession, the Economics Ministry said. Drops of 3 per cent in domestic
orders and 1.5 per cent in export demand produced an overall seasonally and
price-adjusted decline of 2 per cent.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Support for Maastricht melts away in French sun: The
prospects for next month's referendum, where a No vote could kill European
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cover of Paris-Match, usually emblazoned with headlines about ageing
actors and their latest romances or the melodramas of the Monegasque
princesses, this week carries the more sober message 'Maastricht: le non
grignote' - 'Maastricht: the no vote gnaws away'.
For weeks French support for the Maastricht treaty on European union has
been falling steadily. This week's Paris-Match magazine confirms just how
far it has gone by publishing a poll, compiled by the BVA consultancy, which
shows that the proportion of the electorate planning to vote Yes in next
month's Maastricht referendum has fallen from 63 to 56 per cent in a month.
If France does vote No to Maastricht in the referendum on September 20, the
treaty will be dead. This would be an ironic end for the treaty because the
French have historically been strong supporters of European unity, and
because President Francois Mitterrand has styled himself, at home and
abroad, as the treaty's champion.
The president, bruised by a slide in popularity this year, has so far
adopted a conspicuously low profile in the referendum campaign. But the
depth of his past involvement, and that of the ruling Socialist party, means
a No vote would at the very least also be a serious blow to the party's
prospects in next spring's National Assembly elections.
What is the risk of the French voting against Maastricht? Until recently
such a prospect would have seemed inconceivable. The pro-Europe faction in
the French electorate has rarely fallen below 60 per cent since the 1950s.
In a 1989 poll European unity emerged as the top priority of the French,
ahead of disarmament and helping the third world.
There has since been a slow but steady decline in support for Europe. But it
is only in the past four weeks, since Mr Mitterrand announced the date of
the referendum and the political campaigning began in earnest, that
opposition to Maastricht has accelerated, particularly among older voters.
The Paris-Match poll simply reinforced the message from other recent polls.
A similar study conducted by the IFOP consultancy published in Liberation on
Tuesday showed that the No vote had risen from 38 per cent in early June to
44 per cent by the end of July.
Most of the French say they have already decided which way to vote. However,
29 per cent of the Yes voters and 34 per cent of the No voters in the BVA
poll said they might change their minds. This means that, in theory, the Yes
vote could fall as low as 40 per cent, or rise as high as 71 per cent.
In practice, the switch in sentiment in the remaining 6 1/2 weeks before the
referendum is unlikely to be nearly so dramatic. Although the trend is
clearly towards rejection, it seems more probable that the French will say
Yes. Privately, however, even the Socialists accept that they could do so by
an embarrassingly slender majority.
The situation is complicated by the referendum's timing, just after the long
French summer holidays. August is scarcely the time for political discussion
in France, which helps to explain the absence of any serious intellectual
debate over Europe's future in the approach to the referendum.
So far the referendum campaign has been notable only for its scrappiness.
The government was last week forced to abandon its proposed television
campaign after objections by the broadcasting authority. The centre right
parties, the RPR and the UDF, are hopelessly split over Maastricht. Their
campaign has consisted of a motley assortment of personal statements by
their more outspoken members.
The only concerted campaign against the treaty has come from Mr Jean-Marie
Le Pen's extreme-right National Front, which has this week been hauling an
anti-Maastricht caravan from beach to beach on the south coast, although
some hard-left Socialists, and the Communists, have also come out against
Maastricht.
The critical question is how far the growth of the No vote should be
interpreted less as a sea-change in sentiment towards European union than as
direct criticism of the Socialists, who have come under criticism for rising
unemployment and a series of scandals. These range from next month's
corruption trial for Mr Henri Emanuelli, president of the National Assembly,
to the involvement of senior Socialists, including Mr Laurent Fabius, party
chairman, in the HIV-contaminated blood case, which resumes in October.
So far no one knows the answer. Asked why they oppose Maastricht, people
tend to cite the threat to France's identity or the risk of damaging the
economy. Meanwhile, Mr Mitterrand and his fellow Socialists are bracing
themselves for the effect of the next set of unemployment figures on the
Maastricht polls, as France snoozes through the summer holiday.

FT  07 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Dream Team may not be asked back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Olympic party is winding down, one's attention turns to farewells.
Some stars have announced their retirement from Olympic competition. In
other cases a glance at the calendar provides its own brutal conclusion.
Evelyn Ashford is going of her own accord. The US 100 metres runner has been
among the best-loved of that country's galaxy of sprinters.
Now 35, she first competed at the 1976 Montreal Games, coming fifth in the
100m. She holds the second-fastest time ever for the distance and has broken
11 seconds 33 times.
At the Los Angeles Games Ashford won two gold medals, taking another in the
4x100m relay in Seoul. Watch for a tidal wave of emotion in the big stadium
when she runs her final relay tomorrow.
Fate has been less kind to another, equally talented, female runner. Ana
Quirot has had the misfortune to be Cuban in a decade when politics have
been as big a factor at the Olympics as the stopwatch.
Since the early 1980s she has been winning World Cups and Pan-American
titles. What Ana did not do, because of boycotts, was run in the Los Angeles
or Seoul Games. Barcelona was her first Olympics, and a bronze medal was the
best this fine athlete could manage.
One must wonder if Carl Lewis will thrill another Olympic stadium? He had
some claim to bad luck in the sprint trials for the US team but a look at
Linford Christie's gold medal in the 100m gives a clue to their joint
futures.
At 32 Christie was older by four years than any previous 100m champion and
his chances of repeating the triumph in four years' time, in Atlanta, must
be minuscule. Lewis is just a few months younger than the British star.
Predicting the age at which swimmers need to find another pool has become
risky. Money has kept mature swimmers such as US hero Matt Biondi in the
water far longer than one would have predicted at Seoul, where he won seven
medals, five of them gold. Biondi has won two gold medals in Barcelona. 'If
you've been around the block, you know how to go around the block,' shrugs
Biondi, 26.
British swimming stars Adrian Moorhouse and Sharron Davies have both
announced their goodbyes to Olympic competition. Both have been British
swimming's only instantly recognisable characters and the sport will miss
their charisma.
On top of the water rather than in it, Barcelona seems certain to sound the
swansong for Italy's extraordinary Abbagnale brothers. Rowing has seldom
seen a duo such as Giuseppe, 33, and Carmine, 30.
In the coxed pairs they have won seven of the last nine world championships
and came to Barcelona looking for their third consecutive Olympic gold
medal. Ironically, Britain's Searle brothers - Jonathan, 23, and Gregory, 20
 -took the gold medal in that event. They are exactly 10 years younger than
the Abbagnales.
Another, somewhat larger, ensemble we may not see again is American
basketball's Dream Team. US officials are saying that the squad for the next
Games may exclude National Basketball Association players. 'Bird', 'Magic'
and 'Air' have looked too much like Ugly Americans with their squabbles over
sponsorship and status.
Finally, Adios] to a few animals. That much-loved horse Murphy Himself has
raced his final cross-country event for British rider Ian Stark, who says
that Murphy was the greatest horse he ever rode.
Few people have said such kind things about Cobi, the squashy little mascot
used to market the Games. Atlanta's designers are working in secrecy on his
successor.

China

   By PETER BERLIN

<TEXT>
WHEN Piet Norval and Wayne Ferreira met Goran Ivanisevic and Goran Prpic in
a tennis doubles semi-final the other day, it signalled a small piece of
Olympic history.
Both pairs were already assured of medals. This meant that Norval and
Ferreira were the first South Africans to win Olympic medals since boxers
Daniel Bekker and William Meyers, and 400 metres runner Malcolm Spence,
collected a silver and two bronzes in Rome in 1960. The two Gorans were the
first ever to win Olympic medals in the name of Croatia. After the match
Ferreira said: 'It is possible that by us winning South Africa's first medal
our fellow countrymen will take courage and compete better.
'The nationalist element played an important role in the match. Up until now
the only South African finalist has been a swimmer in the 50m free-style.'
(Peter Williams, who came fourth.) Xolile Yawa, 13th in the 10,000m on
Monday and the first black South African in an Olympic final, seemed to have
escaped his notice. But sportsmen in competition can be blinkered.
There have been many other happy returns in these Games. Erika Salumae won
Estonia's first gold since the palmy days when they were a power in
weightlifting and wrestling and before the Soviet Union invaded.
After her victory in the women's cycling sprint, Salumae said happily: 'It's
marvellous. I think that, at the moment, they are throwing a huge party in
my country. It's very exciting.'
It might have been Estonia's first gold in cycling, but it was Salumae's
second. She won in Seoul when representing the Soviet Union.
The Toniste brothers, Tonu and Toomas, who collected their yachting bronze
medal for Estonia in gangster suits, won silver for the Soviet Union in
1988.
Frankie Fredericks' silver for Namibia in the 100m was that country's first
Olympic medal ever. But then it did not exist as an independent country four
years ago.
The Barcelona Games have also marked the debut of several semi-countries.
Fedor Kasspu won the gold in the 75kg weightlifting in the dull green of the
Unified Team. But when he stood on the podium the audience had the privilege
of hearing the Olympic debut of the Moldovan national anthem.
There are 172 countries entered in these Olympics, a record. But for 1996
the Atlanta organising committee is planning to welcome 190 to the centenary
Games. Atlanta calculates there will be 13 more teams from what used to be
the Soviet Union, plus five countries that no one has yet thought of -
Catalonia, for example.
The Barcelona Games will probably mark the only appearance of the Unified
Team. They might also mark the solitary Olympic entry of Bosnia-Hercegovina
and of the Independent Olympic Participants, which is Serbia and Montenegro
under a five-ringed flag of convenience.
The war in the Balkans has cast a strange glow over the Olympics.
Ivanisevic, never slow to take the moral and political high ground,
proclaimed after one five-set victory: 'Today I was tired but I think that
winning a medal for my country, Croatia, gives me strength to do anything.'
Mehmed Skender, the weightlifter, was in a trench in Zenica with a machine
gun when he was selected for the Bosnian team. He has surrendered the hell
of life in Bosnia for the hell of the Olympic Village, incapable of
performing at anything like his best, unable to reach his family at home.
'We are here to show the world that we are alive and that we exist,' said
Mladan Talic of the Olympic Committee of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
These Games have also seen the continued spread of medals to developing
countries. On Wednesday evening, Ximena Restrepo came third in the women's
400m to win Colombia's first athletics medal.
The increased number of events has also helped put unaccustomed names on the
medal table. Indonesia won its first Olympic medal, a silver in archery, in
Seoul. In Barcelona it has already won two golds, two silvers and a bronze,
all in badminton, which is an Olympic sport for the first time.
But the biggest redistribution of medals has been to the People's Republic
of China. It re-entered Olympic competition in Los Angeles in 1984 with 32
medals. It won 28 in Seoul. Its total in Barcelona is already way past that.
A lot of eyes in Barcelona have focused on the gallant performances of the
many small or weak nations. But over them all looms the growing power of one
very big nation.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Unions join in power protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY and coal unions have linked with large electricity consumers in
a lobbying group that is threatening to take Professor Stephen Littlechild,
head of electricity regulator Offer, to court.
The Coalition for Fair Electricity Regulation (Coffer) says Prof Littlechild
is standing aside while new gas-fired power stations secure contracts that
will push old coal-fired stations off the market, raising electricity prices
and threatening hundreds of thousands of power station jobs.
Coffer has written to him giving him three weeks to convince the users and
unions that there is no reason for them to go to the High Court to seek
judicial review of his decisions.
Coffer is led by representatives of the Major Energy Users Council, a lobby
group for lower electricity prices, and the Electrical Power Engineers
Association,
The group says electricity prices to large consumers have risen by up to 30
per cent since privatisation, and accuses Prof Littlechild of failing to
stop the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales from signing
long-term contracts to buy power from independent gas-fired power stations.
Coffer says the contracts, which were also criticised by the Commons Energy
Select Committee report on electricity privatisation in February, lock the
regional companies into buying power that will be more expensive than power
from existing coal-fired stations.
It says that forces the price up because coal stations lose market share and
raise prices and shed labour to cover their costs.
Coffer says Offer should have intervened to stop the contracts. It can do so
because a condition of the regional companies' licence is that they must buy
the cheapest electricity available to them.
Offer, which has begun a review of this 'economic purchasing' licence
condition, said it was convinced it had a '100 per cent robust' case for not
having intervened.
Miss Penny Boys, Offer's deputy director-general, said: 'There is no
apparent link between the contracts and the contracting procedure, and the
existing market prices.
'There is only one gas-fired station up and running, which must have a
fractional effect on prices.'
She said other factors were more relevant to high prices. For instance the
possibility that the two large electricity generators, National Power and
PowerGen, were influencing market prices. That is at present being
investigated by Offer.

FT  07 AUG 92 / VAT penalties may cost Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE is to pay up to Pounds 100m in penalties to payers of value
added tax because of an error in drafting legislation seven years ago.
The 1985 Finance Act allowed traders not receiving VAT refunds from Customs
&amp; Excise within 30 days to claim an additional 5 per cent of the value of
the refund as a penalty for the delay.
The 1985 act was supposed to allow the 30-day period to be extended so that
Customs &amp; Excise could check the accuracy or validity of claims where it had
doubts.
However, the High Court has ruled in the case Customs &amp; Excise vs L. Rowland
(Retail) that the provisions in the 1985 act were more narrow than had been
intended.
The High Court said the original legislation only allowed the clock to be
stopped for the time between raising queries with claimants and their
responses, not for the entire period during which the payment claim was
being investigated.
New provisions in the most recent finance act this year have amended the
legislation to give Customs &amp; Excise more breathing space. But the
legislation is not retrospective, leaving the way open to demands for
additional payments dating as far back as 1985.
Those entitled to rebates will be any taxpayers claiming VAT where the money
took more than 30 days to process, and where the sum they claimed was within
5 per cent of the final amount agreed with Customs &amp; Excise.
For those with claims before 1988, their claim had to be within Pounds 100
of the settled amount.
Last year Customs &amp; Excise paid out penalties of just Pounds 1.13m for
legitimate refunds that took longer than 30 days to process.
Total refunds from 2.5m claimants amounted to Pounds 23bn, of which fewer
than two cases in 100 were queried for accuracy.
Refund applications to: VAT Central Unit (Section 2), 4th Floor East,
Alexander House, Victoria Avenue, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, SS99 1AU.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Hurd hits out at Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, made an uncharacteristically robust
attack yesterday on Britain's Euro-sceptics, arguing that opponents of the
Maastricht treaty offered 'no convincing alternative'.
His speech to Scottish Conservatives in Cuminestown, Aberdeenshire,
acknowledged that the European Community had 'caused our national hackles to
rise' on occasions, but also said that Britain could claim important
successes in changing the course of the EC.
Mr Hurd was at pains to point out that it was Baroness Thatcher who had
helped to create the Single European Act - enabling the single market, which
is increasingly criticised by Euro-sceptics.
He argued that under Mr John Major's leadership, provisions negotiated by
the UK at Maastricht were, for the first time, decentralising EC
decision-making and ensuring legislation could be enforced by the European
Court.
It was the UK's intention to conclude its six-month-long presidency with
negotiating mandates in place for the accession to the Community of Austria,
Sweden and Finland.
'On the single market, on the rule of law, on the principle of minimum
interference, on enlargement and on keeping co-operation against crime and
on foreign policy intergovernmental, it is British ideas which are carrying
the day,' he claimed. In a clear swipe at backbench critics, Mr Hurd added
that this 'impressive record' ran counter to the 'neurotic drip-feed of
Brussels horror stories retailed in certain quarters'.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Three convicted of pension plot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE men were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday of conspiring
to defraud pension funds of Aveling Barford, an engineering company based in
Grantham, Lincolnshire. Two other men were cleared of being part of the
conspiracy.
The verdicts came at the end of a 4 1/2 -month trial in which it was alleged
that Pounds 6.7m had been taken from the pension funds and used as capital
for Aveling Barford and for paying commissions.
Mr Robin Chapman, who was Aveling Barford's solicitor, Mr David Carter, a
financial adviser and pensions expert, and Mr Graham Severn, a former
director of Mildminster, an investment company, were found guilty of
conspiring to defraud the pension funds' trustees and beneficiaries by
failing to disclose to them the true nature and value of a Pounds 5.7m
investment in a Royal Heritage Life Assurance pension portfolio.
Mr Peter Murphy, a former executive director of Aveling Barford, and Mr
Harold Hobson, another former director of Mildminster, were found not guilty
on that charge.
Mr Chapman was also convicted of conspiring to obtain Pounds 1m of the
pension funds' property by deception.
Mr Severn was also convicted of stealing Pounds 424,525 belonging to the
pension funds, a charge on which Mr Hobson was found not guilty.
All the charges were denied.
A sixth man, Mr Mathieu Einhorn, a pension fund trustee who had denied two
conspiracy charges, had been dropped from the case early in the trial
because of his ill health.
Judge Clive Tayler QC will sentence the convicted men today.
The court heard that the matter came to light in late 1988 when Standard
Chartered, Aveling Barford's bank, put in administrative receivers.
The money removed from the pension funds was subsequently recovered - Royal
Heritage repaid the Pounds 5.7m invested with it - and the pensioners have
not suffered any loss.
Aveling Barford is now in liquidation.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Doubts raised on Cadbury proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS DOUBTS over the effectiveness of the Cadbury report on corporate
governance were raised yesterday after two leading bodies representing
accountants and auditors questioned how far its code of conduct could be
enforced.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned in a
submission to the Cadbury committee that it had 'serious misgivings' about
auditors certifying that companies had followed the code.
Separately, the Auditing Practices Board, which sets auditing standards,
dismissed as impracticable the use of auditors to check compliance with the
qualitative aspects of the code.
The concerns raise questions over the effectiveness of the Cadbury
recommendations, which have a voluntary code as their centrepiece.
The institute's financial reporting and auditing group said aspects of the
code would be impossible for auditors to verify, such as determining whether
non-executive directors were bringing independent judgment to bear on issues
of strategy and performance.
The Auditing Practices Board said auditors could only verify the objective
parts of the code. It suggested that a company's audit committee might
better certify compliance.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Phasing out is predicted for company car perk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BEGINNING of the end of the company car as a perk was forecast yesterday
in a report that found evidence that employers are offering cash instead.
Only a few companies have axed the company car, but many others are planning
to follow suit or offer cash instead because of diminishing tax benefits and
the recession, according to the report by Incomes Data Services.
Cash allowances instead of cars are being offered at City companies such as
Nikko Europe, Citibank, Morgan Grenfell and Merrill Lynch as well as
high-street banks such as Midland and TSB.
Companies that have stopped providing cars to staff entirely include Bankers
Trust, which made its decision because of the popularity of the allowance
alternatives and a desire to reduce costs.
Mr Ray Storry, one of the report's authors, said yesterday that employers
would continue to provide company cars when they were essential tools for
jobs, as in sales.
However, the Inland Revenue's proposals to increase tax for status cars,
generally those provided to senior managers as a perk, would lead to more
companies revising their policies.
The widespread use of company cars in the UK has always been anomalous, the
report says. UK managers traditionally earn less than their counterparts in
other countries but they are provided with better cars.
However, the climate is changing. Providing cash alternatives to cars can be
an attractive recruitment tool.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Management: Treading warily over the snails - A business
lunch in the French capital is a serious affair. William Dawkins has a word
of advice on the etiquette of where you should go and what to say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lunch is an important part of doing business in Paris. But it has to be
exploited with discretion. Correct business etiquette is crucial in France
because social formalities are still more rigid there than in the
Anglo-Saxon world, despite the liberalism which has swept French management
in recent years.
So rule one is not to insult your guest by trying to use the lunch bluntly
to further a contract or achieve some other kind of direct business gain,
warns Marie-Helene Descamps. As attachee de presse for former President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, she is an unassailable authority on do's and
don'ts of the lunch table.
'There are two kinds of business lunch. The first is to build up relations,
without expecting anything in return, so that things are easier when you
eventually do contract some business. The second is to discuss a deal
already in the making or celebrate a deal afterwards. If you want to
conclude a deal, that must be done in the office,' she explains.
Never bore your guest by talking about business right at the start of the
meal, she warns. This might be OK in London or New York, but it will only
irritate most French businessmen. A private FT straw poll of public
relations advisers and English executives in Paris produces the unanimous
advice that a successful business luncher must be well stocked with
non-business anecdotes and subjects of conversation, which must last him for
at least the hors-d'oeuvres, main course and cheese.
When preparing your opening gambits, bear in mind that Parisian business
lunches cannot be hurried. Two to three hours is the average time. If you
are really pressed, it is quite acceptable to refuse cheese, but you have to
be sure of your host or guest if you want to turn down dessert.
Recent political events are a surefire conversation starter, since most
French people love politics. But avoid politics when lunching with senior
executives in France's large state sector. They will probably follow the
government line on everything - especially when in public - so it is better
to talk about wine or food in their case.
'When the cheese is out of the way, then you can start to talk business.
This is the good moment because the wine will have put everyone at their
ease and the dessert is on the way. Do not wait until the coffee, because
your guest might be in a hurry to leave by then,' says a corporate public
relations adviser.
The idea is encapsulated in the colloquial French expression for a
judiciously chosen moment: 'entre la poire et le fromage'. This is a bit
confusing because cheese actually comes before dessert in France, but still,
the principle is clear.
In addition, Descamps advises that it can be a good thing for a male host to
be accompanied by an intelligent and presentable female public relations
adviser. This is not an absolute rule, but it is common practice, as shown
by the large number of young women in the Parisian PR industry. 'A woman can
be useful because she can get away with putting things in a more direct
manner than a man,' says Descamps. Where to eat, of course, depends on who
you are entertaining. The key rule is that style matters more than money.
If your guest is French, he will be agreeably flattered if you take him
somewhere considered branche or 'in'. Try Fouquets (pronounced as in
English) or Chez Edgard. These are both well-known watering holes for
politicians and the better sort of media folk, which might suggest to your
guest you are well-connected.
A non-French executive foreigner will obviously recognise none of the famous
French faces round these tables, so do not bother. He or she would feel more
flattered at one of the big names of the Parisian restaurant business, like
Lucas Carton, Taillevent or the Tour d'Argent. Many Parisian business folk
think places like this are a touch ostentatious, though they would be too
polite or too pleased with the sublime food they serve to say so.
An alternative for foreign guests is one of those glittery places frequented
by film stars and models, who they will admire even though they do not know
their names, around the Avenue Montaigne. In this class, Plaza Athenee or
the Bar des Theatres - open from 6am to 2am - are recommended.
If you are already friendly with your French business contact, you might do
well to take him slightly off the beaten track, a sign that you think he
matters enough to justify a spot of personal effort.
In the summer, you might try one of the very few good restaurants with quiet
terraces or gardens, such as Recamier, Ledoyen or Laurent. Equally, you
could produce a gem of a bistro that you might have discovered yourself, the
sort of place noted in the back of many globe-trotting executives' diaries,
ideally with a limited but superb menu and an authentic atmosphere.
Descamps's personal favourite in this class is La Marlotte.
Mine is Cafe La Jatte, where a life-size dinosaur skeleton hovers over hot
house plants and an excitingly eclectic menu - but it is slightly out of
town. Back in the city centre, branche Parisians like smart Italian food,
stylishly available at Stresa.
Details of most of these restaurants are in the Michelin guide to France,
except for Bar des Theatres, Cafe La Jatte, and Chez Edgar which can be
found in the Paris yellow pages.
A word of warning: some are closed in August, when many Parisians take a
month off and when business on and off the table grinds to a halt.

FT  07 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Why women got a raw deal - The
weaknesses of female sports people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not dance. It is not acrobatics. Nor is it a juvenile fashion show. It
is something of all three. It is women's rhythmic gymnastics, and as the
crowd's applause indicated yesterday in preliminary Olympic competition, it
is a delight to watch.
These are girls as young as 13, yet they have more grace that most of us
will learn in a lifetime. There is also an astonishing mastery of physical
skills. Some of the contestants move with lithe sensuality; others like
modern jazz dancers. All have the ability to make ordinary objects and
movements riveting.
I saw Celine Degrange of France transform an ordinary skipping rope into a
living thing: it flew through the air with a will of its own, wound around
her body like a snake, writhed and circled at her feet.
I am fascinated by female gymnasts' youthful energy and character, but their
bodies are a mystery. All-female gymnastic competitions are nominally
women's events, but nowhere are women to be seen. Here are girls who begin a
rigorous training programme at six and reach their peak at an average age of
16. Yet even in the most difficult exercises on bars and beams, in vaulting
and on the floor, their dynamism and speed often exceed that of male
gymnasts in their mid-20s.
These days, top female gymnasts in their mid-20s are unheard of. In recent
years women's gymnastic techniques have altered radically, coming to
resemble men's much more, and the age of competitors has plummeted.
In gymnastics, it seems, the more a woman is shaped like a man the better
she is at performing athletic tasks.
Could Nature, I wondered, have dealt a low hand to women in other physical
skills? The answer is generally yes. Consider women's legs. They do not,
like men's legs, run parallel from the hips. Instead, because women have
spacious childbearing hips, their legs are set wider apart and run at a
pronounced angle down towards the knees.
Consequently, most women tend to splay out their heels when they run. Not
only does this make them less efficient runners, but such an articulation
pushes the kneecap outwards, causing its underside to rub against the femur
below - often the cause of pain and injury.
But a woman's legs are just the beginning of Nature's conspiracy to put her
at a sporting disadvantage against men. Throughout the world men are on
average 7 per cent taller than women. Men have wider shoulders, longer and
more muscles in the back and chest, and greater strength in the thorax.
Men have longer arms than women, which gives them greater bio-mechanical
leverage and greater ability to project objects at velocity in ball and
racket sports.
The amount of a woman's body weight given to fat puts them at a considerable
disadvantage in many sports.
Perhaps the greatest difference between men and women's sporting abilities
lies in their cardio-vascular systems. Relative to their body size women
have smaller hearts than men and less pumping capacity. Women carry about a
litre less blood than males, and that blood has fewer oxygen-carrying red
cells and less haemoglobin. Women's lungs are about 10 per cent smaller than
men's. Together, differences in heart, blood and lungs make women's oxygen
utilisation only 75 per cent that of men's.
The good Lord, however, has not made men's relative advantages an entirely
one-sided affair. Women's bodies function in cold better because of their
additional body fat. Because they sweat less they adapt better to heat and
aridity. They have greater resistance to cold water and float better; eight
out of the 10 fastest English channel swimmers are female.
Women also have greater physical flexibility, a better sense of balance, a
higher pain threshold and greater manual dexterity.
However, generalisations are dangerous. Myths of masculine physical
superiority and female weaknesses are disproved every day.
Try it for yourself. Step out on to the gymnastics floor and achieve just a
fraction of the grace and finesse of those small, young people trailing
satin ribbons behind them. Hats off to the man who can do it.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American hammer thrower Jud Logan was thrown out of the Olympics after he
became the first US athlete in 16 years to fail a drug test at the Games.
The International Olympic Committee said earlier that Logan had tested
positive for Clenbuterol, a banned anabolic-type drug.
Logan, 33, said he used Clenbuterol until last February but stopped using it
when he learned it was banned.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation must decide whether to impose
sanctions on Logan. IAAF rules state that athletes testing positive for
anabolic steroids face an automatic four-year suspension.
The IOC has already announced that women's marathoner Madina Biktagirova of
the Unified Team tested positive for the banned stimulant norephedrine.
Biktagirova, 27, who finished fourth, returned home before the test result
was made public. The first competitor to be disqualified was Wu Dan, a
female volleyball player from China who tested positive for the stimulant
strychnine.

FT  07 AUG 92 / July fall in new-car sales reverses modest upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in the UK fell 8.45 per cent last month, ending a run of three
successive months when registrations increased modestly from last year's
very depressed level.
The renewed drop in car sales was reinforced by a further decline in new
commercial vehicle registrations in July, which were 20.9 per cent lower
than a year ago.
New car sales in the first seven months of the year, at 801,796, were 4.3
per cent lower than a year ago and 35.7 per cent lower than in the peak year
of 1989, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. New commercial
vehicle sales in the first seven months have dropped 9.6 per cent. Sales
have plunged 47.5 per cent in the last three years.
July is the slowest month of the year for new vehicle sales, as buyers delay
until August for the change of registration letter.
The motor industry's fortunes are much more closely tied to its performance
this month, which traditionally accounts for between a fifth and a quarter
of all car sales.
New car registrations in the first three days of August - with the K-prefix
 -were 11 per cent higher than a year ago at 161,000, but carmakers are
still very cautious about their prospects for the full month.
Most forecasts suggest only a small increase from last year's August level
of 368,000 new car registrations. According to preliminary reports, retail
demand is stronger in Scotland and the north of England but remains weak in
the south-east.
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the society, said July was 'a notoriously
bad guide to the general pattern of sales as it is heavily influenced by
prospective purchasers delaying registrations until August'.
Ford, the leader of the UK new car market, suffered a further sharp erosion
of its sales in July. In the first seven months of the year its
registrations have dropped 11.7 per cent, which has depressed its market
share to 22.7 per cent from 24.6 per cent in the corresponding period a year
ago.
Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace which is in third place in the UK
market, has also lost ground this year. The French carmakers Renault,
Peugeot and Citroen, as well as Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General
Motors, have all gained market share and have increased sales volumes.

FT  07 AUG 92 / British bookmakers can't separate Bush and Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton are neck-and-neck in the race for
the White House, according to British bookmakers. Ladbrokes is offering odds
of 4-5 (bet Pounds 5 to win Pounds 4) on both candidates.
The latest prices reflect growing support for Mr Clinton in recent months.
At the end of May, he was languishing as the outsider at 4-1, with Mr Ross
Perot, who subsequently withdrew, at 3-1 and Mr Bush at 1-2.
Mr Bush's odds, meanwhile, have been on the drift - in mid-March, his price
was as short as 4-11.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Political punters buy Bush to win: US market that trades
shares in candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WANT to know what Americans really think about their presidential race this
year? Have you watched the polls fluctuate wildly and wondered what is
really going on?
Four professors at the University of Iowa say that you can find out - and
even bet on the results - at the Iowa Political Stock Market, the only
public US market that trades shares in political candidates.
The IPSM began four years ago when three professors of economy, Mr Robert
Forsythe, Mr Forrest Nelson and Mr George Neumann, and one of political
science, Mr Jack Wright, were griping about the inaccuracy of political
polls for predicting election outcomes.
They devised the market over a weekend in March 1988 and launched it in June
that year for the US presidential race.
Since then, they have run markets in eight more elections, including
parliamentary races in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey.
Once just an experiment with students, the IPSM has grown into a fully
fledged public market. And its creators believe it has proven their
hypothesis that the market is a more accurate indicator of political
outcomes than opinion polls - because you have to put your money where your
mouth is.
For this year's presidential contest, the IPSM is operating 24 hours per
day. It has some 510 traders, with a total Dollars 34,000 invested. That may
not be much, but the initial deposit for a trading account is only Dollars 5
and accounts are limited to Dollars 500.
But, says one punter, Mr Steven Maravetz, a University of Iowa official:
'People take it very seriously. If you had made all the right moves till
now, you could have parlayed Dollars 5 into Dollars 1,000.' Mr Nelson says
that he expects the amount invested will at least double by election day,
November 3, and that it may reach Dollars 100,000.
Since the start of the year, the IPSM has run markets in the Democratic
presidential nomination, the Democratic vice-presidential nomination (both
of which are now closed), the two-party (now Bush-Clinton) race, a three way
plurality contest that includes Mr Ross Perot, and a three candidate vote
share.
Its latest product is a market in 'presidential derivatives,' or the vote
shares above and below a designated percentage for President George Bush.
The entry of Mr Perot as a possible presidential contender has made for some
exciting moments. After responding to a clamour to create a Perot share, the
IPSM watched Perot investors get skinned when he withdrew from the race and
his shares dropped from 29 cents to 4 cents. They still trade, but at a
tenth of a cent.
Although the name suggests a stock market, the IPSM is closer to a futures
market. Earlier this year, the IPSM won recognition from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, as an
experimental, non-profit market. This prohibited IPSM from advertising
itself or charging transaction fees and commissions. All revenues must be
distributed after the presidential election on November 3.
Trading accounts can be opened with a telephone call to the university.
After receiving a traders' instruction manual and making a Dollars 5
deposit, traders can log onto the computer and start buying and selling
shares. Credit trading and short selling are not allowed.
A typical first move might be to enter the two party market with a purchase
of five Dollars 1 'unit portfolios' each consisting of one share of Bush and
one share of Clinton. While payout formulas vary, at the close of this
market the trader will receive Dollars 1 times the percentage of popular
vote for each candidate share. If, for example, the election is 51 per cent
Bush and 48 per cent Clinton, and a trader was holding 50 Bush and 10
Clinton, the pay-off would be Dollars 30.30, plus whatever was left over in
the trader's cash account. Other formulas work on a winner takes all basis.
About 80 per cent of the traders are students and faculty at the University
of Iowa and 64 other universities, but, since some publicity about the
market in the spring, several professional traders have joined in. Mr Boaz
Weinstein, a trader at a top Wall Street investment bank, said he jumped
into the Democratic vice-presidential market, and 'did pretty well.'
Mr Weinstein believes that Wall Street and other professional traders do not
have that clear an advantage in the market. The students learn quickly and
the market is efficient, he said. It also cannot be cornered. Mr Weinstein
and other professional traders also say they think it is a better gauge of
the political climate than polls.
For example, the surge in favour of Mr Clinton after the Democratic
convention, did not even register in the IPSM, where Mr Bush has been the
favourite since January. Mr Clinton's shares have, however, gradually
improved in price to about 48 cents currently. Mr Bush's shares are running
at about 52 cents.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Boeing wins Dollars 1.2bn order from
Dallas airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING of the US yesterday won a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m) order for 34
twin-engine 737-300 airliners from Southwest Airlines, the Dallas-based
carrier.
Boeing is also understood to have taken the edge over the European Airbus
consortium in competition to sell widebody jets to China Southern Airlines,
the Cantonese-based carrier.
The Chinese airline, which operates Boeing 737 and 757 airliners, is
believed to have signed a memorandum of understanding to buy six Boeing 777
widebody jets.
The 777, Boeing's latest aircraft, has been in competition with the Airbus
A330 widebody airliner for the Chinese order.
If the deal is confirmed, Rolls-Royce, the UK aero- engine maker, appears to
be in a good position to win the engine order to power the Chinese 777s.
Rolls-Royce is providing the engines for China Southern's fleet of 757s.
It would be Boeing's first sale of 777s to China. Boeing would not comment
on the Chinese deal yesterday, but confirmed Southwest Airlines' intention
to order 34 Boeing 737-300s.
This would bring total orders for 737s to 3,019 (more than 3,000 being a
milestone in the commercial jet airliner market).
Boeing said yesterday that Southwest intended to convert 30 options it holds
on 737 airliners to firm orders.
It would also place four new orders, all for delivery between 1995 and 1997.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexico awards big contract as Nafta deal
nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican finance ministry has announced a Dollars 500m contract for
computer services - the largest awarded in this sector - to Systemshouse, an
Ottawa-based company with offices also in the US.
It is this kind of deal the US and Canadian governments are counting on to
illustrate how jobs are to be created across borders by a North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Negotiations on the pact were still continuing yesterday in Washington, but
the real sales jobs - to the US and Canadian publics - are yet to come.
President George Bush has the additional task of convincing a Democratic
Congress that not only will Nafta benefit the US economy but that it also
contains sufficient safeguards for US workers and the environment.
Congress has constitutional jurisdiction over trade, but it ceded initial
control to President Bush in June, 1991, when it gave him 'fast-track'
negotiating authority. A completed deal will set in motion a complicated
procedure which, in theory, means that Congress will vote yea or nay on
legislation needed to implement an agreement.
Because of widespread fear that jobs would be lost to Mexico, the
president's request for fast-track authority was highly controversial. It
was granted only after he made concessions and promised an adjustment
package for displaced workers and the inclusion of environmental provisions.
The usual procedure for fast-track is as follows. After a pact is agreed,
the president gives Congress at least 90 calendar days' notice of his
intention to enter into the agreement. During that time, all relevant
committees - and there are many - would hold hearings. Nafta would then be
signed by the countries' three leaders and returned to Congress for 90
legislative days.
Then administration, congressional and private sector representatives would
meet to write implementing legislation. This includes a formal acceptance of
the pact and any legislation needed to fulfil its terms.
However, the fast-track procedure was established by rules of both houses.
Key Democrats have argued that they can change those rules and will do so if
the president does not produce satisfactory labour and environment
provisions. This would allow them to make amendments.
Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, last week raised a ruckus,
when he warned that he would write controversial provisions into the
implementing legislation. (This was done in the case of the US-Canada Free
Trade Agreement in 1987.) It can be assumed that no deal could get past him,
but he is also known to be a willing compromiser, who starts the negotiating
process with tough demands.
In any case, it is being suggested that the Bush administration will initial
a Nafta deal to reap its political benefits but hold off sending it to
Capitol Hill until a new Congress convenes next year.
