ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, said its Lummus
Crest subsidiary in the US had won a Dollars 270m (Pounds 141m) turnkey
contract to engineer and build a linear polyethylene plant for Petroquimica
de Venezuela.
The plant will use Dupont Canada's proprietary Sclairtech technology to make
a wide range of linear resin grades and have a capacity of 150,000 metric

ZIMBABWE'S government, which recently passed a controversial law to take
land from white farmers for black peasants, has appealed to white farmers to
stay in the country, reports Reuter from Harare.
Industry officials say hundreds of white farmers, angered by the new law,
plan to emigrate to neighbouring countries, especially Zambia and
Mozambique.
'Those who are calling for a latter-day 'great trek' to the north and east
of our borders are over-reacting and misleading others,' said the country's
vice-president Mr Simon Muzenda. 'There is enough land in our country for
Zimbabweans who genuinely want to make a living from it,' he said when he
opened an annual meeting of the white Commercial Farmers Union.
White commercial farmers occupy about 70 per cent of the country's most
fertile land.

GOLD was again in retreat on the London bullion market as Comex futures came
under pressure from selling by locals testing the market's downside support.
Dealers said US funds appeared to have largely liquidated their positions,
leaving them neutral as a market factor, while other directions were scanned
for the possible source of selling that might push gold through support at
Dollars 348 a troy ounce. Gold has to hold the Dollars 348 area to retain
its recent technical uptrend and was fixed at Dollars 348.60, down 65 cents
from the morning fix. Official selling could be the catalyst to push the
market down through the pivotal support, dealers said. On the LME COPPER
edged further ahead as Chinese buying continued. Three-month metal closed
above Dollars 2,510 a tonne, suggesting further gains, dealers said.
Three-month TIN put on a spurt in late trading on short covering and closed
at Dollars 6,835 a tonne, up Dollars 100. The market is staging a correction
from the recent fall to eight-week lows. NICKEL succumbed to downside
pressure, with three-month metal retreating below Dollars 7,400 a tonne. The
failure to move above Dollars 7,450 and fill a chart gap above that level
has dampened sentiment, dealers said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Steen Rasborg, chief executive of Unidanmark, Denmark's second-largest
bank group, is to resign and the bank will bring in an outsider to take over
his job.
The move , announced by the board yesterday, came two weeks before the
bank's half-year interim report is due, on August 18. The report will show a
pre-tax loss of DKr1.5bn (Dollars 267m), reflecting loan loss provisions of
DKr2.5bn and unrealised losses on the value of securities of DKr400m.
The result for the full year is expected to be a slightly larger loss than
last year's DKr1.7bn, depending on how securities markets perform over the
next few months.
Mr Hugo Schroder, supervisory board chairman, said the change at the top was
necessary to restore 'unconditional confidence,' in the bank.
The bank reported losses of DKr1.1bn in 1990 and DKr1.66bn in 1991, but this
was not the core of the problem, said Mr Schroder.
'On the last five occasions that the bank has published a report it has
predicted an improvement in results, which has given us a bit of a
credibility problem,' he added.
Mr Rasborg has presided over the bank since its was formed in 1990 from a
merger of three banks, Privatbanken, SDS, the savings bank, and
Andelsbanken. Mr Rasborg was formerly chief executive at Privatbanken.
Since the merger the bank has been dogged by large loan loss provisions,
which increased from DKr2.66bn in 1990 to DKr4.21bn last year.
Privatbanken had a reputation as a bank prepared to accept high-risk
business, but Unibank has consistently denied the old Privatbanken portfolio
was responsible for a disproportionate share of the bank's losses.
Mr Lars Eskesen, Mr Rasborg's co-director, will take over as acting chief
executive until a new appointment is made.

backing to reshape affiliate

<TEXT>
NIPPON Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, has won
support from Daiwa Bank for its plan to restructure one of its leasing
affiliates, heavily burdened with doubtful property loans.
Daiwa, a leading commercial bank, has agreed to reduce the interest rate on
loans extended to Crown Leasing, one of Nippon Credit's three financial
subsidiaries. Nippon Credit has been seeking financial assistance from the
creditors of its three affiliates and Daiwa's move could draw positive
responses from other banks, which have so far rejected the plans.
The move will be the first case where a non-parent bank has agreed to
support a non-bank financial company. 'We still feel that Nippon Credit Bank
should take full responsibility, but we also felt that by rejecting
restructuring the problem would only get worse,' said Daiwa.
Daiwa has Y70bn (Dollars 549.8m) in loans outstanding to Crown Leasing, and
said it would reduce the interest rate to 2 per cent from 7 per cent. Daiwa
said its interest income on the loans would therefore fall by Y3.5bn.
Nippon Credit is the smallest of Japan's long-term credit banks, which have
been responsible for much of the long-term lending for industrial investment
since the Second World War. It has been dubbed 'Nippon Fudosan (property)
Bank' by local bankers, due to its large outstanding loans to property
companies compared with other leading commercial banks.
While Nippon Credit claims that outstanding bad loans at its three financial
subsidiaries total Y350bn, the figure circulating in Tokyo is as high as
Y1,000bn.
Jitters over mounting bad loans at Nippon Credit and its affiliates have
caused volatility in Nippon Credit's shares. On the Tokyo stock market
yesterday, its shares fell by Y1,000 to Y4,800.
The yields on Nippon Credit's five-year debenture has risen compared with
debentures issued by the other two long-term credit banks: Industrial Bank
of Japan and Long Term Credit Bank. While until now, their five-year bonds
were seen as identical investments, bond traders say investors have started
to differentiate the credit value of the three banks.

MALAYSIA Airlines System (MAS), the partially privatised Malaysian state
airline, yesterday announced its one-for-one rights issue, set for the end
of 1992, which is designed to raise more than MDollars 700m (USDollars
281.1m) and double its share capital.
At the same time, MAS forecast pre-tax profits of MDollars 372m for the year
to March 1993, against pre-tax profits of MDollars 119m a year earlier.
MAS is confident of the success of the rights issue, one of the biggest on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. It says five substantial shareholders,
including Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, and the Brunei Investment
Agency, have asked for their full entitlement of shares.
At the end of June, MAS agreed a Dollars 170m syndicated loan facility with
27 international banks to fund partly its acquisition programme.
MAS is in the middle of a big aircraft acquisition programme and needs the
additional capital to prevent further borrowings. It is due to take delivery
of 72 aircraft over the next five years, replacing leased jets which make up
about half of its fleet.

first half
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER prices in export markets and weak domestic demand caused earnings at
Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic), the industrial arm of South
Africa's largest company, to fall by 15 per cent in the first half to June.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to R3.3bn (Dollars 1.2bn) from R3.1bn a year
earlier, but difficult trading conditions saw operating profits fall to
R170m from R211m. Amic's share of earnings of associated companies rose
marginally to R90m from R89m, while income from investments and interest
earned rose to R48m from R35m.
Pre-tax earnings fell to R239m from R282m, while attributable earnings were
12.1 per cent lower at R160m compared with R182m.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said most of Amic's subsidiaries and associates
had experienced reduced demand in local markets and lower prices abroad.
This had resulted in cuts in some operations and lower production runs.
Amic's interests are concentrated in mining-related activities and heavy
industry. These have been hard hit by a fall in fixed investment by
industry, which dropped at an annualised 7.5 per cent in the first quarter.
The dividend was maintained at 110 cents a share on earnings of 281 cents,
down from 333 cents.
Mr Boyd said that earnings for the full year were likely to be in line with
those for the first half.
Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second-largest
ferrochrome producer, improved its operating performance but still made a
loss in the year to the end of June. CMI, a member of the Johannesburg
Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, increased turnover to R306.4m from
R274.6m in 1991 and managed to turn a R6.4m operating loss in 1991 into a
R14.9m profit in 1992.

BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, one of Bavaria's two largest banks, yesterday
rounded off the German banks' half year reporting season by announcing a 28
per cent rise in partial operating profits, the biggest increase of any of
the country's big banks.
This figure, excluding any contribution from the bank's own account trading,
rose to DM681m from the DM534m a year earlier. It did not report total
operating profits.
The group balance sheet total grew by 5.6 per cent to DM239bn, reflecting
what it termed lively credit demand in normal banking and mortgage business.
An important factor was the growth of its activities in eastern Germany,
where it has 53 branches and granted credits of DM5.4bn.
Parent bank earnings on interest rose by 14.8 per cent to DM1.09bn compared
with half the figure for the whole of 1992, while fee income climbed 7.5 per
cent to DM253.5m.

<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations,
unveiled an unexpected 43 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income in
spite of posting record revenues in the period. Sun has been one of the
fastest-growing companies in the computer industry.
Its net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 37.7m, or 37
cents a share, against Dollars 66.4m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
rose 3 per cent to Dollars 972.7m from Dollars 942.5m last year.
The company's share price has been subject to spurts of volatility this year
reflecting some concern that Sun would not be able to live up to
expectations of very strong growth.
Several analysts reduced their earnings projections for the company earlier
this year, but most had expected fourth quarter earnings of about 51 cents a
share, with essentially flat earnings for the year.
Instead, Sun posted annual net income which slid almost 9 per cent to
Dollars 173.3m, or Dollars 1.71, compared with Dollars 190.3m, or Dollars
1.85, in fiscal 1991. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars
3.22bn.
Mr Kevin Melia, Sun's chief financial officer, said the company had
established a new price-performance curve with new products that included
substantial price reductions on its existing products. 'While the price
reductions did reduce our gross margins, much of the margin impact was
offset by improvements in our operating efficiencies.'
One factor driving Sun to reduce prices is the increasing overlap between
high end personal computers and low end workstations. The steep decline in
personal computer prices is now being seen in the workstation segment.
Operating income tumbled 51 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 49.3m from
Dollars 100.8m. For the full year, operating income was off 11 per cent to
Dollars 261.1m from Dollars 294.9m.

<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Securities, the third-largest brokerage house in the US, is to
keep its headquarters and back office operations in Manhattan.
The company had considered relocating outside New York, but a Dollars 106m
incentive package of tax and energy rebates provided by the city and state
government, and the reduction in rental costs linked to the local commercial
property slump, persuaded Prudential to stay in the Wall Street area.
Prudential's decision is a victory for the administration of Mr David
Dinkins, New York's mayor, which has fought hard to persuade big companies
to stay in the city despite the cost, the high crime rate and the crumbling
infrastructure.
If major corporations and their employees leave New York, the city's tax
base declines and local government finances, already damaged by federal cuts
and the impact of the recession, would come under further pressure.
Delighted city officials said Prudential's decision would generate Dollars
830m in revenue for New York.
In recent years, several big Wall Street firms, including Merill Lynch,
Salomon Brothers, and PaineWebber, have moved their back office operations
out of New York to cheaper locations in the suburbs or in other states.
Kidder Peabody, Smith Barney, and Morgan Stanley have also recently
considered relocating part or all their operations elsewhere, although none
have yet made a final decision.

AMPOLEX, the Australian petroleum group, has declared its first dividend for
eight years and plans to spend ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.03bn) on
expansion over the next half-decade, despite a subdued earnings performance
in the latest year to June.
The company yesterday announced a 23 per cent fall in net earnings to
ADollars 37.2m for the 12 months from ADollars 48.1m a year earlier. This
reflected falling world oil prices which cut about USDollars 4 a barrel from
receipts. Net profits werehelped by substantially lower tax of ADollars 8m
against ADollars 51.3m.
Revenue fell by 19 per cent to ADollars 176.4m from ADollars 217.5m, despite
steady crude oil sales at 6.2m barrels a day. The directors declared a final
dividend of 2.5 cents a share.
Exploration spending took ADollars 64m, with a further ADollars 186m spent
on development.
Mr Peter Power, chief executive, said yesterday he was expecting improved
earnings for the current year following the start of oil production from the
company's Kutubu project in Papua New Guinea.

moratorium

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate has thrown out a proposal to place a one-year moratorium on
federal land sales to mining companies and adopted a watered-down 'reform'
measure criticised as a 'giveaway' to the industry.
The mining industry hailed the vote as a victory. But Mr John Knebel,
president of the American Mining Congress, said the industry, which has
battled with environmentalists over land reclamation standards, was 'by no
means finished with this saga.'
Senator Dale Bumpers, a Democrat from Alabama, sought the moratorium to give
congress more time to consider tougher reform legislation.
The Bumpers reform Bill, which is still in committee, aims to change
completely a century-old system under which anyone can explore US federal
lands for as little as Dollars 2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable
mineral deposits.
Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said a one-year moratorium would shut
down mineral exploration.
His proposal, which was passed, requires federal land to be sold at fair
market value, but does not place a royalty on the Dollars 3.9bn worth of
minerals that private concerns extract from federal lands every year. Also,
it says land must be returned to the federal government if no minerals are
extracted.
Mr John Knebel, president of the American Mining Congress, the industry
lobby, said the Senate took a 'proper step' to reform mining law without
changing the its basic law structure.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's Primary Industries Minister, is leading a palm
oil selling mission to Pakistan and India in an effort to counter what
Malaysia sees as rising competition from other palm oil producers.
'We see a necessity to step up efforts not only to seek and expand new
markets but more importantly to protect our existing markets in the face of
rising competition,' said a Malaysian official.
Malaysia, the world's largest palm oil producer, faces increased competition
for export markets from Indonesia, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and a number
of producers on the African continent.
India was once the main export market for Malaysian palm oil. But sales to
India have dropped dramatically in recent years, because of what Malaysian
officials describe as India's 'foreign exchange constraints'. In 1987
Malaysia exported more than 1m tonnes of palm oil to India. In 1991 sales to
India were only 160,336 tonnes. But sales to Pakistan have improved
considerably - from 117,397 tonnes in 1980 to 961,841 tonnes last year.
Malaysia produced 6.14m tonnes of palm oil in 1991 and expects to increase
this to 6.5m tonnes this year.

MINERA TIWANACU, a subsidiary of Miami-based Jordex Resources, is to sign a
joint venture contract with Comibol, the Bolivian state mining corporation,
to exploit Bolivar, a polymetallic mine in the department of Oruro, in the
south-west of the country.
The deal should be finalised in the next three or four weeks, according to
Mr Alfredo Rojas, Tiwanacu's executive president. Comibol has invested
Dollars 14m in the mine over the past ten years and, under the terms of the
contract, Tiwanacu will invest at least a further Dollars 14m. Production is
estimated by Mr Rojas at 1,000 tonnes of ore a day, of which 400 tonnes will
come from Tiwanacu's existing operations 10 miles away at Poopo. The plant
at Poopo is to be valued and will form part of Tiwanacu's investment in
Bolivar.
Of the 1,000 tonnes of ore, some 15 per cent will be zinc and 1 per cent
tin, plus 350 grams per tonne of silver. The resulting concentrate will be
50 per cent zinc, with 800 grams per tonne of silver.
The project should be operating in 12 months, producing about 19,000 tonnes
of concentrate a year. Mr Rojas said it should have a working life of about
15 years.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Nordic markets jittery on Finnish rate
decision
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Finland's decision to raise its key tender rate from Monday left
Nordic government bond markets in a jittery state and pushed up bond yields.
The Bank will raise the tender rate to 16.0 per cent from 14.62 per cent, in
an effort to stem the outflow of capital from the country. The prime
minister announced a package of economic measures yesterday evening aimed at
restoring confidence in the Finnish financial markets.
Yields on Finnish government bonds have risen recently, with the 11 per cent
bond due 1999 now yielding 12.7 per cent, against 12.3 per cent last Friday.
The Swedish government bond market responded to the sudden rise in Finnish
short-term interest rates, with government bond yields increasing initially.
However, yields later fell, and the bond due 2003 ended the day with an
unchanged yield of 10.06 per cent. Dealers said the Swedish market had been
helped by some positive news in the form of a well-received Treasury-bill
auction.
DESPITE a larger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury
prices fell yesterday as dealers adjusted their positions ahead of today's
July employment report.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/16 at 106
15/32 , to yield 7.447 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, albeit
only slightly, down  1/32 at 99 15/16 , yielding 4.266 per cent.
Normally, Treasury prices would have responded favourably to the news from
the Labor department that the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance rose 69,000 in the week ending July 25 - the largest rise in
weekly claims since 1982.
Analysts, however, pointed out that the big increase in claims was almost
entirely the result of the company-wide shutdown of General Motors during
the last two weeks of July and other layoffs in the car industry.
FRENCH government bond prices closed higher across the yield curve helped by
the combination of Wednesday's opinion poll in France on the Maastricht
Treaty and a general sense of relief that the Bundesbank had decided to
leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's council meeting.
The opinion poll - which indicated firm support among voters for European
economic and monetary union ahead of the September 20 referendum on the
ratification of the Treaty - helped spur buying by foreign investors,
particularly at the longer end of the yield curve. The yield on the 8 1/2
per cent bond due 2002 fell from 9.07 per cent to 8.98 per cent.
At its auction yesterday, the French Treasury sold FFr6.58bn of bonds due
2002 at an average yield of 9 per cent, and FFr4.18bn of bonds due 2023 at
an average yield of 8.94 per cent.
Dealers said that the French bond market was able to absorb the new supply
without any problem.
NEWS that the Bundesbank had decided to leave its key interest rates
unchanged following the central bank's council meeting yesterday helped to
nudge up German government bond prices.
The bund market had been worried that the Bundesbank would raise the Lombard
rate, following the rise in the discount rate from 8.0 per cent to 8.75 per
cent on July 16.
The Liffe bund futures contract moved up to 87.07 by late afternoon against
the previous day's close of 86.95.
STERLING weakness and funding concerns continue to hold the UK government
bond market in check, and gilt prices ended the day either little changed or
only slightly higher.
The Liffe futures contract opened at 96.24 and traded up to 96.29 by late
afternoon. Dealers said the gilt market was waiting for the Bank of England
to make an announcement about its next auction - possibly as early as today.
THE Japanese government bond market closed lower with the benchmark No 129
under-performing the rest of the market.
The No 129 is due to relinquish its position as the benchmark bond issue
soon, with the No 145 seen as the likely successor. The four tranches of the
No 145 become fully fungible in September.
The yield on the No 129 opened at 4.945 per cent, corresponding to the high
price of the day, and closed at 5.03 per cent. In the futures market, the
September contract opened at 104.95, reached a high of 104.97, and closed at
104.65.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Guinness takes advantage of Bundesbank
rule changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the UK drinks company, yesterday became the first issuer in the
D-Mark Eurobond market to benefit from the Bundesbank's new rules on D-Mark
issuance, which came into force on Monday.
Guinness Finance launched a DM200m three-year issue, the proceeds of which
were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks, and will be used to fund the
company's German operations.
The company decided not to take advantage of all the Bundesbank rule
changes, according to Mr Ian Scott, director of treasury at Guinness. The
firm chose a non-German paying agent, US bank JP Morgan (which also arranged
the deal through its German subsidiary); but Guinness decided to list the
deal on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to ensure easy access of information
for German retail investors, although a German stock exchange listing is no
longer required.
The dropping of compulsory German listing under the new rules was expected
to pull business to other exchanges with cheaper listing fees.
However, the continuing importance of the German retail investor base to the
market appears likely to encourage continued use of the German exchanges.
The Guinness deal is governed by German law and can be cleared through the
Kasseverein, the German clearing system, even though these requirements have
also been dropped.
The lead-manager reported demand from both German retail investors and
international institutions, but dealers said the issue appeared aggressively
priced.
Meanwhile, Halifax Building Society issued DM20m of three-year medium-term
notes via JP Morgan, using the newly-incorporated D-Mark option on its
multi-currency programme.
Abbey National was the first borrower to issue medium-term notes under the
new rules, when it place DM50m of two-year notes via Merrill Lynch earlier
this week.
Elsewhere, the flow of floating-rate note issues with minimum and maximum
coupon levels was unabated. Three German banks yesterday launched a total of
Dollars 250m of so-called 'mini-max' floating rate notes. Commerzbank and
Bayerische Vereinsbank each launched Dollars 100m of subordinated debt,
while Bayerische Hypotheken raised Dollars 50m of senior debt through a
Dollars 1.5bn medium-term note programme.

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Rubber, Japan's third-largest tyremaker and parent of Dunlop in
Europe and the US, lifted pre-tax profits 2.8 per cent to Y4.8bn (Dollars
38m) in the first half to June, writes Gordon Cramb.
Parent company revenues were 2.3 per cent ahead at Y123.4bn. Although
falling sales of new cars in Japan left demand for its tyres unchanged,
sales of its golf and tennis goods improved by 3.1 per cent.
Non-tyre sales - which also include marine equipment and office machinery -
accounted for a record 37.7 per cent of its overall business.
Profit growth is forecast to be more sluggish for the full year, up 0.5 per
cent before tax at Y11.6bn on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Y265bn.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Profits rise 17% at Cheung Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEUNG Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing's flagship Hong Kong company, yesterday reported
a 17 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.23bn (USDollars 288.5m) for
the six months to June 30 from HKDollars 1.98bn in the first half of 1992.
Cheung Kong, in which Mr Li has a 34.9 per cent holding, is one of Hong
Kong's leading property developers and investment companies.
It is the vehicle through which Mr Li holds a 40 per cent interest in
Hutchison Whampoa, and a diversified portfolio of small investments in other
listed companies.
Cheung Kong's profit growth was struck on a 38.8 per cent jump in turnover
to HKDollars 4.7bn from HKDollars 3.4bn. Earnings per share rose to
HKDollars 1.06 from HKDollars 0.90.
An interim dividend of 20 cents a share was declared, up 18 per cent from
the 17 cents last time.
Mr Li expects the full year results to show satisfactory growth and
dividends for the year would be raised.
The Hong Kong property market was showing some signs of slowing down.
'However, in view of the still robust economy and the restricted supply of
land, the market will continue to be active, after a short period of
consolidation.'
During the first half, Cheung Kong invested HKDollars 1.6bn in
locally-listed companies. It has a large cash surplus - estimated to rise to
about HKDollars 9bn by the end of this year. For cash management reasons it
has decided to put part of that surplus into local shares where returns are
higher than in the local money market.

<TEXT>
KIRIN BREWERY, Japan's biggest beer producer, yesterday reported a 13.1 per
cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y32.1bn (Dollars 252m). It blamed
increased depreciation costs after expanding capacity in recent years, and
lower interest income.
The earnings fall for the six months to June came in spite of a 5.2 per cent
rise in sales to Y609.8bn. Beer sales volumes, for domestic consumption and
export, rose 4.1 per cent, showing higher growth than the industry average.
Kirin, which accounts for about half the Japanese beer market, has been
battling to maintain its share in the face of slowing growth in demand.
Marketing costs among the three main brewers have been rising as a result.
The company is also cutting shipping costs by licensing production overseas.
It linked up last month with Bedford-based Charles Wells to brew Kirin lager
for the UK market and export to the rest of Europe.
Along with Asahi and Sapporo, its rivals, Kirin expects 1992 pre-tax profits
to fall. It forecast a 5.1 per cent decline for the full year to Y82bn, on
sales up 4.9 per cent to Y1,380bn.
Net income is, however, expected to edge higher at Y35.15 a share, compared
with Y34.90. The company is holding to a planned rise in its total payout to
Y10 a share, from Y9.
Although the company has surplus cash, with Y138bn on deposit, its financial
position will be dented by the expiry this month of more than Y50bn in
warrant bonds with an exercise price offering a Kirin share at Y2,324. The
shares closed in Tokyo yesterday at Y1,140, and the issue is thus likely to
expire unexercised.
Suntory, Japan's largest whisky distiller and one of the country's biggest
private companies, managed a 6.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y5.3bn
for the half-year.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the diversified Hong Kong conglomerate, yesterday
surprised the colony's financial community with a 20 per cent cut in interim
dividend and a substantial write-down of its investment in Husky Oil, a
Canadian oil and gas producer.
The company took an above-the-line write-down of HKDollars 1.42bn (USDollars
183.7m) on Husky, cutting by half the book value of the investment it first
made in 1986. In 1991, it wrote off HKDollars 760m for a fall in the value
of Husky's oil and gas reserves.
The latest write-down pushed the group into first half net losses of
HKDollars 78m, compared with profits of HKDollars 2bn a year earlier.
Although it is a non-cash item, it will affect Hutchison's gearing.
Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, the Hong Kong
brokerage, said: 'Husky goes down as one of the world's worst acquisitions.
It is on a par with Midland Bank's acquisition of Crocker.'
But the market, which had been expecting a Husky provision, was further
disappointed by a deterioration in the company's underlying profitability,
apparently due to the poor performance of Hutchison's UK telecommunications
business.
Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said that given the planned substantial cash
requirements for the development of the company's UK telecommunications
business, it was considered prudent to cut the interim dividend by 20 per
cent to 16 cents from 20 cents.
He said losses in the UK would continue for the next few years, but added
that the long-term potential of the business was promising.
Turnover advanced to HKDollars 10.2bn, from HKDollars 9.4bn. Operating
profits fell slightly to HKDollars 1.9bn from HKDollars 2bn.
Husky again appears to be the main problem at the operating level, together
with UK telecommunications and possibly the company's satellite television
venture, Star TV.
Analysts said Hutchison's Hong Kong operations - principally its container
port interests, property development, retailing and telecoms - all performed
reasonably well.
Analysts said that, paradoxically, Mr Li was about the only investor in
Hutchison to benefit from the company's woes. Last year, he raised HKDollars
881.4m through the issue of 273m covered warrants over Hutchison stock -
equal to 7.5 per cent of the company.
Hutchison has under performed the market since. If it continues he may not
have to face conversion, they said.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank loses its immunity
to recession - Questions posed by poor results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AN ELEMENT of schadenfreude
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
joy at others' misfortunes - crept into analysts' reactions to Deutsche
Bank's poor figures this week. Germany's biggest bank, the most powerful and
profitable in the country, suddenly appeared to have run out of steam.
'It looks as though the great ship of state Deutsche Bank has at last ground
to a halt,' quipped one analyst, commenting on the 3.2 per cent decline in
total profits to DM3.06bn (Dollars 2.08bn) for the first six months of the
year.
Deutsche's relatively weak performance was accentuated by comparison with
the figures put out by its smaller competitors in recent days. Commerzbank,
Germany's third-largest bank, increased its total profits by 17.5 per cent
and Dresdner Bank, the second-biggest, by 15 per cent.
Other large banks also showed themselves immune to recession. Yesterday,
Bayerische Vereinsbank said that partial operating profits - excluding
trading gains - rose by 28 per cent, and in recent days Bayerische
Hypotheken und Wechselbank reported a 22.8 per cent increase, and DePfa, a
Wiesbaden-based mortgage bank, improved profits by over 30 per cent.
Where Deutsche Bank goes other German banks tend to follow: the question
troubling analysts and investors is if the Deutsche Bank slowdown is a
leading indicator for the German banking sector.
On the face of it, the results show that Germany's banks are still capable
of generating robust, double-digit growth in profits.
The sector's prosperity is linked to developments in eastern Germany.
Germany's banks have prospered as a result of strong credit demand from west
German companies wanting to invest in eastern Germany.
It is this credit demand - calculated to be an annualised 11 per cent in
March to June and at more than 12 per cent in the first quarter of the year
 -which has helped stimulate the growth in money supply which in turn
prompted the Bundesbank to increase interest rates to ever higher levels,
most recently the 0.75 per increase in the discount rate last month.
Despite the interest rate rises - which in theory should discourage further
borrowing - the demand for loans has remained strong. Much to the annoyance
of the Bundesbank, lending to finance projects in the east is 'interest rate
insensitive'. A multitude of government and other incentives make it
attractive to borrow money to finance new projects, even though interest
rates are at historically high levels.
Coupled to strong loan demand, banks' first-half profits climbed because of
the recovery in German stock and bond markets in the first part of the year,
which boosted fee-income and the result from own-account trading.
The banks' profits also benefited from the relative weakness of Japanese, US
and British competitors, which because of domestic problems were not able to
pursue and win high-quality international business as effectively as the
German banks.
Deutsche Bank's woes should not be overestimated: the drop in profits was
from record levels and its interest rate margin, though down, is higher than
other banks. Deutsche's operating profits are about as the results from the
next three biggest banks combined.
It attributed the drop in profits to the general deterioration of the German
economy and the rest of the world. Specifically, it blamed higher costs of
financing customer deposits and a growing role in lower margin interbank
lending.
More generally, it seems likely the bank's size ensures it is the first to
feel the effects of a slowdown - and equally likely that other German banks
will in turn follow suit.
Over the past year, bank shares' have under-performed the DAX 30 index of
top German companies by more than 7 per cent, despite the profits increase.
This under-performance reflects investors' worries about the impact of
interest rates on the banking business which have, in the event, proved
unfounded.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The directors of Blacks Leisure acted yesterday to reassure investors
following the substantial fall in its share price earlier this week.
The shares have slid slowly from a peak of 130p last November. On Wednesday
they lost 12p to close at 41p. Yesterday, however, they recovered by 2p to
43p.
The directors said they believed Wednesday's decline had been caused by a
sale of 100,000 shares at a price substantially below the market rate.
They added that although trading remained difficult, as indicated in the
chairman's statement in May, strong core businesses, together with a strong
balance sheet, positioned the company to take advantage of an eventual
upturn.
It was too early to make a dividend forecast, but the directors were mindful
of shareholders' income requirements.

ABBEY, the Dublin-based housebuilding and plant hire group, achieved a
significant improvement in pre-tax profits from IPounds 354,000 to IPounds
1.55m (Pounds 1.46m) in the year to April 30 and is resuming a dividend
payment.
However, at the operating level profits fell to IPounds 215,000 (IPounds
1.57m) and the pre-tax result was after interest received of IPounds 1.33m
(IPounds 1.22m charged).
Abbey's housebuilding activity is based almost entirely in the south-east of
England and the company said that, despite the continuing deterioration
within the residential sector, Abbey Developments achieved an operating
profit of IPounds 890,000 and completed 408 sales at an average price of
Pounds 73,000 sterling.
The plant hire division was suffering one of the most difficult trading
periods in recent years and M&amp;J Engineers reported an operating loss of
IPounds 370,000.
At present the group had a strong balance sheet and nil gearing.
Turnover declined to IPounds 42.4m (IPounds 59m). Earnings per share worked
through at 2.7p (0.61p) and the proposed dividend is 1p.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Simon Engineering to refocus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Engineering, touted since 1990 as an environmental play, has decided
to sell most of its environmental division and will concentrate on other
core businesses.
Simon is in discussions with two overseas companies about the sale of its
waste water treatment and environmental consultancy businesses, which had
turnover of about Pounds 90m last year.
Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive, said the businesses had been disappointing,
despite their longer-term prospects. 'We've seen a slowdown in environmental
legislation and people have deferred expenditure,' he said.
Since 1990, when it had a rights issue, Simon has spent about Pounds 25m
building up the division. The company hopes to raise at least Pounds 40m
from the sale, Mr Kemp said.
Simon announced yesterday that interim profits had fallen sharply because of
the continued recession and a higher interest charge following last year's
Pounds 52m purchase of Robertson Group, the geological consultant.
Pre-tax profits dropped from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 6.05m in the six months
to June 30, and Mr Kemp said he was 'cautious' about the full year. Turnover
increased to Pounds 235.4m (Pounds 218.1m) helped by acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits from access equipment fell to Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 4m) but
improved from last year's very weak second half.
Orders in the US have shown a slight improvement, Mr Kemp said.
Industrial services, which includes Robertson, slipped to Pounds 5.5m
(Pounds 6.3m) because of a poor first quarter from US chemicals.
Interest charges increased to Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 2m) and gearing rose to
40 per cent, with net borrowings of Pounds 51m, compared with 29 per cent at
the year end.
Earnings dropped to 3.8p (8.2p). But the dividend is unchanged, and
uncovered, at 5p.
Simon's shares, which fell sharply last month, recovered 4p to 185p.
COMMENT
Shareholders who stumped up for the rights issue, partly designed to build
up the environmental division, may feel a bit perplexed by yesterday's news.
Even if they are prepared to overlook the change in strategy, they will be
less happy with the share price, which has underperformed its sector by 40
per cent in the past two years. Most of the damage has been done by profit
downgradings and uncertainty over the dividend, which is almost certain to
remain uncovered this year. Simon is financially more sound than some, and
proceeds from disposals could repay most borrowings. But as economic
recovery appears ever more elusive, Simon's reliance on late cycle sectors
such as construction makes its own recovery ever distant, possibly not until
1994. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 17m, compared with Pounds 18.3m
last time, put the shares on about 15 times. The 11 per cent yield gives the
shares a useful safety net, but the upside appears limited.

SHAREHOLDERS subscribed to only 43 per cent of the shares in the Pounds
200.1m rights issue launched by BET to restore some order to the business
service group's balance sheet.
Underwriters were not, however, altogether unhappy with the 106m shares they
were left holding.
Barclays de Zoette Wedd, the brokers, offered to buy the stock at 107.5p,
some 2.5p below the rights price of 110p and enough for the underwriters to
break even on the deal after their underwriting commission.
Only 20m of the 106m shares were in fact offered for sale, leaving the bulk
in the hands of sub-underwriters happy to hold their stake, the company
said.
BET's rights issue was widely recognised as a necessary step towards
restoring some stability to a balance sheet bloated by debt and auction
market preferred stocks to fund a late 1980s acquisition binge.
But as the stock market fell in the run-up to the closing date of the offer,
BET's share price fell, removing the rights issue discount and raising the
prospect of a substantial and damaging flop.
In the event, a 43 per cent subscription level appears to border on a
successful issue. Shareholders who are daily being unnerved by the state of
the markets were wary of taking up their rights when experience of recent
new issues suggested they would be left with shares as sub-underwriters.
Yesterday BET closed at the rights price of 110p.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Philips half-year profits fall 63% in wake of price cuts

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, suffered a sharp drop in profits in
the second quarter, as fierce competition in the key consumer electronics
sector forced the company to reduce prices on compact disc players,
televisions and video cassette recorders to maintain its market share.
Net profit fell to Fl 82m (Pounds 25m) from Fl 552m the year before, when
Philips' results were increased by a Fl 365m extraordinary gain on the sale
of its remaining white goods activities to Whirlpool of the US.
The sharp decline in quarterly results pushed first-half net profit down to
Fl 256m, a fall of 63 per cent from the year before.
Philips, whose shares have been under pressure since it issued a profits
warning in June, said problems in consumer electronics masked progress in
areas such as lighting, where first-half operating profits rose 64 per cent.
'If it had not been for the setbacks in consumer electronics, we might have
served you champagne today,' Mr Jan Timmer, president, said at a press
conference.
Group turnover in the first half fell 1 per cent to Fl 25.8bn, again
reflecting price-cutting in consumer electronics.
Philips declined to give details of the losses in its consumer electronics
sector but said selling prices had been reduced by an average 6 per cent to
preserve the company's market share.
Mr Henk Bodt, head of consumer electronics, said the sector was not expected
to return to profitability until 1994. To achieve the turnaround, the
company planned to boost the efficiency of its factories in Europe, to
centralise its warehousing and to double the size of its European sales
force.
The consumer products division - which accounts for nearly half of Philips'
annual sales and includes consumer electronics, appliances such as shavers
and coffee-makers, and PolyGram, Philips' profitable, 80 per cent-owned
music company - saw operating results tumble to Fl 118m in the first half
from Fl 470m a year earlier.
The malaise in consumer electronics also hit Philips' television picture
tube business, as well as associate companies such as Grundig of Germany.
Together, these difficulties in consumer electronics shaved Fl 400m to Fl
500m off net results, according to Mr Henk Appelo, Philips' finance
director.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Shell's income falls by 26%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, yesterday reported a 26 per
cent second-quarter fall in net income to Pounds 481m excluding inventory
gains and losses.
Over the first half, net income measured on the same current cost basis fell
24 per cent to Pounds 1.44bn, on sales down 4 per cent at Pounds 34.43bn.
A second-quarter improvement in upstream profits from a higher crude oil
price was offset by a reduction in downstream margins and further falls in
chemicals as a result of weak economic demand.
The figures included Pounds 216m of non-operating profits, most of which
related to sales of assets and the settlement of tax affairs in the US.
These special gains were only partly offset by foreign exchange losses of
Pounds 102m which were also included in the net income figures.
The comparative figures for the second quarter of 1991 were a Pounds 21m
gain from special non-operating profits and a currency gain of Pounds 120m.
Royal Dutch/Shell said these special benefits were exceptionally high and
unlikely to be repeated this year.
The group's net income including inventory gains rose 8 per cent in the
second quarter to Pounds 576m and 4 per cent over the first half to Pounds
1.44m.
Royal Dutch's share of group net income in the first half rose from Fl 5.60
per share to Fl 5.71; Shell Transport's share rose from 14.3p to 14.8p per
share. The dividends for the two parent companies will be set on September
10.
Cash flow from operations in the first half fell from Pounds 3.73bn to
Pounds 3.06bn, with the swing arising largely from a sharp increase in
working capital utilised. Capital spending and exploration costs in the
first half fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn.
The group's share of crude oil production from its own and shared ventures
rose 7 per cent to 2.15m barrels a day while natural gas volumes were 8 per
cent higher at 7.1bn cu ft a day.
Manufacturing, marine and marketing was hit by lower margins only partly
offset by a 3 per cent increase in refinery intake and oil product sales
volumes.
In chemicals, group earnings fell from Pounds 101m to Pounds 3m in the first
half with the main losses outside the US and heavy inventory losses in both
quarters.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC could not have chosen a better day on which to remind the market of its
defensive qualities. Nine-month figures were notably robust and contained no
surprises: in the current market certainty has a value all its own. BOC's
policy of announcing its dividend in advance only adds to the sense of
security. Even exposure to the weak dollar is hedged through forward
currency transactions which have already netted some Pounds 3m in cash. This
goes a long way towards offsetting the Pounds 6m currency translation loss
that might be anticipated for the full year.
Yet BOC has not convinced the market that it can deliver anything more than
secure but incremental earnings growth. Yesterday's 3 per cent gain in the
share price only partly reverses a 10 per cent fall in the last two weeks.
Bottom-line improvements in the core industrial gases business came from
efficiency gains this time around. There must be doubts about BOC's ability
to repeat the trick in the absence of higher volume. The healthcare side
looks increasingly exposed, with the patent for Forane expiring in January.
The replacement drug, Suprane, has to convince US regulators of its safety
and anaesthetists of its efficacy if the threat from generic manufacturers
is to be repelled. Until these doubts are resolved BOC is unlikely to trade
at a premium to the market despite the attraction of a secure dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any bank chairman who announces a bad debt charge of more than Pounds 1bn
and then suggests the UK recession could last for another two years is
courting extreme unpopularity with the stock market. But yesterday's 3 per
cent rise in Barclays Bank shares in the wake of such pronouncements from
Sir John Quinton is less perverse than it looks. The dividend was
maintained. Perhaps even more important, operating profit before provisions
rose 16 per cent, which is in striking contrast to the 4 per cent fall at
Lloyds.
This is not to say, however, that Barclays is now set firmly on a recovery
trend. On past experience, the bank may not find it so easy to hold costs
down in the second half. It must be nearing the limit of its ability to
squeeze commission income out of its reluctant customers, even though this
made an important contribution to the first half advance. Crucial to the
chance of maintaining the dividend for the full year will thus be the speed
with which bad debt provisions fall.
Here the outlook is murky and the forecasters' record abysmal. One argument
is that Barclays was slow to make provisions during the recession and has
now caught up with its competitors. But its lending also grew particularly
fast in the late 1980s and it retains a heavy exposure to property. Assuming
no repeat of the large hits which cost Pounds 200m in the first half, a
maintained final should be affordable. Thereafter investors might yet have
cause to remember Sir John's warning about the duration of the recession.

FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was other news, besides BP, for the London bears to picnic on
yesterday. A warning from Barclays darkened the economic gloom, BET's rights
issue received a lukewarm response, and sterling finished the day nudging
that bit closer to its absolute D-Mark floor in the ERM grid. In the
circumstances, perhaps, it was surprising that the Footsie managed to claw
back more than half its initial 32-point fall.
At current levels one can argue that investors are at last discounting a
lower growth economy in the mid 1990s, and that the 0.75 percentage point
rise in the market's average yield since early May represents a substantial
adjustment. The view that most of the risks are in missing the upside,
though, looks questionable given that nervousness over sterling interest
rates is likely to be here for some time. Mr Lamont will doubtless fight
tooth and nail to avert dearer money - as demonstrated by this week's
pandering to the building societies - but his very reluctance is an open
invitation to foreign exchange dealers to test the government's ERM resolve
to the limit. The contrast between UK policy and recent determination to
defend the lira has certainly not been lost on the markets.
While signs of weakening in the German economy have probably lengthened the
odds against a rise in DM rates, political pressures nearer home are just as
dangerous. UK equities are assuming interest rates will remain at current
levels for some time, but anything worse is not in the price.

FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Half way for BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP's decision to cut costs and its dividend has the feel of necessary but
insufficient action. With cash draining from the business at an alarming
rate, the board was left with little option. However, the measures announced
yesterday will do little more than return cash flow to an even keel next
year once the savings from redundancies come through. Any repayment of debt
will have to come from asset sales. Those will be very hard to come by,
despite BP's good track record in auctioning unwanted companies.
The most likely candidates for disposal are in refining and chemicals. With
downstream profits under severe pressure, finding buyers, even at fire sale
prices, will not be easy, as Lasmo's experience demonstrates. Shell's
results show how even financially strong oil companies are suffering. When
it comes to deals, the weak can expect no quarter.
That leaves very little room for dividend growth to resume from the low base
established yesterday. BP's yield is now below that of Shell, reversing the
pattern of the 1980s. This makes the share price vulnerable, to say the
least. True, American investors have been buying BP because the shares look
better value than some domestic producers. But UK institutions are more
likely to focus on the relative attractions of Shell.
The joker in the pack is the oil price. Any substantial rise in crude, or
upturn in the world economy, would bail BP out nicely. That, however, seems
a remote possibility. While they wait for their shrunken dividend cheques,
shareholders might also ruefully reflect that the man now at the helm, Mr
David Simon, was intimately involved in the decision to buy the assets which
caused all the trouble.

Sir, I note with something approaching delight that decision time seems to

It blights the tree-filled beauty of nearby Battersea Park and is a chronic
waste of riverside. By all means preserve industrial architecture and
technology which can teach people something of the industrial past, eg the
Steam Museum opposite Kew, but Battersea Power Station a rival to Paris Euro
Disney? Come off it]

FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Retirement proposal bad for employment and costly
long-term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs KATHRYN VESSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with some concern your article, 'Retirement age of 65 proposed
for men and women' (August 4). This recommendation is nothing less than a
cost-saving exercise and a huge betrayal of the quality of life expected by
the majority of working women. The men gain no favours either when
considering the substantial numbers already opting for early retirement.
I feel the Social Security Advisory Committee has based its proposals
entirely on the basis of how government will find the wherewithal to fund
future state pensions.
A substantial percentage of today's female workforce has been working full
time, paying a full stamp, since early teens and, to boot, raising a family
before returning to work in their mid- to late-20s, increasing their working
day to two full-time jobs. Women are now living longer than men. The SSAC
proposals obviously intend to reverse this trend.
On the equality issue of bringing men and women to the same retirement age,
can the SSAC justify these proposals against the employment factor for our
young people? The longer a mature generation stays marketable, the fewer the
job opportunities for the young. Young people are needed in all sectors of
the marketplace to bring fresher energies and newer ideas to Britain's
future growth and development in a competitive world. Can the SSAC believe
Britain will be better served by somebody approaching retirement age rather
than enthusiastic and technically more highly trained young school leavers
and graduates? The social issues of the unemployed youth of today will be
nothing compared with those in 15 years' time.
The billions looking to be saved over future years to improve pension
packages will be far outweighed by the funding required for the young
unemployed by way of benefits and educational/work experience training
packages. Finally, in a so-called democratic society, where has freedom of
choice disappeared to? I fear we may well need another Emily Pankhurst to
endorse this committee's suggestion that the issue is one of 'political
unpopularity'.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: Strong case for forgiving debt of low-income Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARIA ELENA HURTADO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Lawrence Summers, the chief economist at the World Bank who shot to
fame when he proposed the transfer of polluting industries to the third
world, has made a valiant attempt to rehabilitate himself by advocating a
substantial forgiveness of the debt which is owed by low-income Africa
(Personal View: 'The lessons of debt', August 3).
The case for urgent debt forgiveness could not be stronger. Drought is
threatening the lives of some 18m people in 10 southern African countries.
The lives of another 130m are seriously at risk, according to the United
Nations.
Yet, instead of building food stocks and strengthening their agricultural
sector against recurrent drought, these countries have been spending their
foreign exchange earnings to pay back debt.
In 1990, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania all used up more than a quarter of
their foreign exchange earnings for this purpose. The situation would have
been far worse were it not for the rescheduled payments and the build-up of
arrears.
Tanzania, and now Zambia, have been granted Trinidad Terms of debt relief on
50 per cent of the debt falling due in the next years.
As Mr Summers acknowledges, much more is required.
The World Development Movement agrees with the United Nations that all of
the official bilateral debt of the poorest countries in Africa must be
cancelled.
But while industrial country governments, with the exception of US, are
doing their tiny bit to reduce the debt burden, multilateral institutions
such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have failed
sub-Saharan African countries.
Around 40 per cent of their debt servicing (excluding Nigeria) goes to
multilateral institutions, and this debt cannot be rescheduled. Mr Summers
can only hope to start to rebuild his tattered image if he tackles the debt
haemorrhage his own institution is causing Africa.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr I J BLAKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Porter's letter ('Subsidies have been forgotten by energy users',
August 5) obviously reflects the interest of his Association of Independent
Electricity Producers' members in high electricity prices if they seek to
increase (or persuade others to increase) overcapacity in generation at
current fuel prices.
What happened to large industrial customers' prices for 1987 to March 1991
was that an attempt was made to give them the benefit of ordinary commercial
discount for quantity and regularity of custom, and also to recognise the
value of load shedding at times of system stress.
The present (and former) general system of pricing does not otherwise
accommodate this commercial principle. The problem with the present system
is that, in principle, big users pay the same prices for energy as domestic
consumers, which is absurd. The difference in final delivered price of
electricity arises from the additional costs of distribution to domestic
consumers, as David Porter well knows.
If he has evidence of state subsidy to Britain's European competitors'
electricity suppliers, he should let the European Commission have it. Our
studies simply show that the continental supply industry behaves more
commercially than ours.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Food secrets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS VIRGINIA Bottomley, the health secretary, deserves some credit for
publishing this week the commercial interests of her department's outside
advisers on food and health policy. But the decision is scarcely the advance
of open government she claims. At most, it is a modest, belated - and
apparently grudging - recognition of what should be basic principles of
public accountability.
The government has a clear responsibility to safeguard the public interest
by setting nutritional guidelines and educating the country to accept them.
But if they are to command confidence, their formulation needs to be
transparent and their impartiality beyond doubt. As a minimum, advisers must
be seen to be free of any possible conflict of interest.
The department's disclosure that many advisers have financial links, either
personal or through research funding, with food and pharmaceuticals
companies is not evidence of impropriety. But by refusing to publish the
information until now, the department has fuelled suspicions that it had
something to hide. Even now, these have not been wholly dispelled by the
decision to slip the information out late on a holiday season afternoon and
the failure to publish details of the advisers' occupations and places of
work.
The most charitable explanation for such secrecy is an anachronistic belief
that Whitehall knows best. If Mrs Bottomley is to demonstrate a genuine
commitment to open government, she needs to go further. At the least, she
should require disclosure of the sums received personally by advisers from
industry and the precise services rendered.
It is impossible at present to be sure whether an adviser is paid a few
hundred pounds a year for the occasional odd job, or is on a lucrative
retainer for work at the heart of a company's competitive strategy.
Better still, departmental advisers should waive any personal payments from
companies with a vested interest in their policy recommendations, and such
companies' employees should be made advisers only if they possess unique
skills.
Finally, the department should disclose when, and on what topics, advisers
are required to stand down from discussions to avoid conflicts of interest.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Personal View: The pragmatic option on pension equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HOWARD DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government must soon declare its hand on one of the most important
social and financial decisions any administration will face in the next
generation: how to equalise state pension ages for men and women.
For the past two years, company schemes have been grappling with the need to
put men and women on an equal basis, following a European Court ruling - the
Barber judgment - that occupational pensions must not discriminate between
the sexes. Now it is the government's turn to decide; it is critical that it
gets the answer right.
During the 1980s, the real income of pensioners rose on average by over a
third - more even than the record pay increases achieved by those at work.
One measure of a civilised society is how well it treats its elders, so this
improvement in pensioner income is welcome.
But the increase has not benefited all pensioners evenly. Indeed, little of
the rise has come from changes to the basic state pension. Much more
significant has been the growing contribution from 'second tier'
arrangements, particularly occupational pension schemes set up and largely
funded by employers.
Members of those schemes benefited from the exceptional growth of stock
values and yields during the 1980s, in sharp contrast with the 1970s, when
many employers with company schemes found that they had to divert resources
from business revenues or reserves in order to maintain existing pensions at
promised levels. But the 'fat' years are now behind us. Few expect future
investment performance to match the levels of the last decade.
Meanwhile, birth rates have generally fallen and people are living longer.
That means the number of pensioners is going to grow much more rapidly than
the working population. The cost of pension provision will quickly rise too.
Against that background, more than 80 per cent of company schemes moving to
equalise pension ages for men and women since the Barber judgment have
decided to do so at age 65. That is what we, and the Social Security
Advisory Committee, believe the government should do. The right to a full
basic pension in the state scheme should start at 65 - the current age for
men - for everyone.
Others have taken a different view, arguing for equalisation at 60 or 63.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, for example, has pointed to the problem
of poverty among women and the importance of the state pension in many
women's incomes, in part because their shorter working careers leave them
with inadequate contributions to second-tier schemes. We understand these
arguments, and we accept that the issue of how women build up occupational
pension entitlements needs addressing. But equalising pension ages for men
at 60 would be an expensive and poorly targeted solution.
But why 65? The first reason, frankly, is cost. The cost of state pensions
is now Pounds 26bn a year, some 11 per cent of total public expenditure.
Employers' contributions to the National Insurance Fund are outstripping
inflation as well as the rate of economic growth. The cost burden is
mounting perilously.
Every leading industrialised nation faces the same fundamental problem -
with an increasing proportion of elderly people in the population, how is a
decent level of pensioner income to be maintained or improved? All seem to
be coming to the same conclusion - the age of entitlement to a full pension
must be higher rather than lower.
Germany is moving from a pension age of 63 for men and 60 for women to a
unified arrangement at age 65. Italy is considering equalising at 65; so far
pensions have been available at 55 for women and 60 for men. New Zealand is
moving up from 60 to 65; Ireland already has an equal age of 66; Denmark has
long been equalised at 67 and a move to 70 is being contemplated; and the US
is the process of raising the current equal age of 65 to 67. France, in
pensions as in other areas, is different; it decided to equalise at 60. But
now a white paper proposes increasing the contribution period by 3 1/2 or 4
1/2 years - in effect, raising the age of retirement.
We acknowledge, as other countries have done, that such a change could not
be introduced overnight. So it does not mean that women now in their 50s or
60s would not be able to draw their state pensions at 60. But women
currently under 40, retiring beyond the year 2015, say, would begin to move
on to the same footing as their male colleagues.
Looking further ahead, we should be planning for more flexible arrangements
that will allow people of either sex (and their employers) to make their own
decisions about when they retire, suited to their own circumstances. That
kind of freedom to choose is already becoming more common in occupational
schemes. In the state scheme, too, men can retire between the ages of 65 and
70 and obtain an enhanced pension, meaning they gain extra income later to
compensate for the years in which they drew no pension. There is no good
reason why the same approach cannot be extended to allow early retirement
for all, with a reduced - but still adequate - starting pension.
Would people reject a phased move over 20 or 30 years to equal provision
based on the assumption that most would choose to work until 65? It is
unlikely given the evidence from other countries.
Many older people want to stay on the job. The UK Labour Force Survey has
shown that almost 20 per cent of men aged 65 to 69 remained in work. More
recently, a Gallup survey undertaken for the CBI showed that 25 per cent of
men and women up to age 70 who had actually retired were interested in
returning to work. More missed the companionship than missed the income.
Moving to a joint age of 65 would end a wartime anomaly that was mainly
designed to remove women from the labour market on the premise that they
should be at home when their husbands retired. That sort of thinking is out
of place today. For many women it could open up the opportunity of
contributing for a further five years and earning a higher pension. By
creating an expectation that women would normally work on as long as men,
equalisation at 65 could also help break down the so-called 'glass ceiling'
that many feel stops them from reaching senior positions.
Britain's pensioners are becoming better off and that is good news. But as
costs escalate they - or their children still in work - will lose out in
future unless equal pension treatment for women is based on current
arrangements for men. The author is director-general of the Confederation of
British Industry.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALTYNAI Asylmuratova has been bringing her radiance to the last weeks of the
Royal Ballet season, making her debut as MacMillan's Juliet, and, in La
Bayadere, reasserting her absolute command over this fascinating work.
Bayadere is about many things, implicit and explicit: about sexual passion
and dance training, about religious belief and belief in an old theatrical
style. It is the intoxicating beauty of Nikiya, the temple dancer heroine,
which precipitates the drama, and Asylmuratova's loveliness - that of a
Helen from the East - calmly, gloriously justifies the action. (When the
High Brahmin removes the veil from her face at her first entrance, we
understand everything that is to follow).
But Bayadere is also about the Petersburg, and Russian, dance-style, about
the grandeur of its scale and the fullness of its emotional and physical
tone. Step and gesture from Asylmuratova, and from Irek Mukhamedov, her
Solor on Tuesday night, have a largeness of dimension, a sense of expanding
tremendously into space and establishing great shapes that are emotional as
well as actual, so that every movement is resonant. The following evening,
Viviana Durante and Tetsuya Kumakawa took these same roles. Their
interpretations were accomplished, technically polished, but wore a cloak of
modesty - unnecessary in view of their gifts - that muted the ballet's
opulent colours.
For Bayadere is also about its artists' belief in what they do.
Asylmuratova, by education as by divine right, knows how to command the
choreography. She phrases movement, varies the speed of a step, with a
sensitivity that is both technical and dramatic. An extension is allowed to
flower and hang on the air. A pose is held, as a singer holds a note,
because of its beauty. The bewitching artifices - and rewards - of rubato
are shown with rare skill, and not a little sense of her own mastery. And
they give the choreography such grace that the ballet lives and holds us in
its thrall - as does Asylmuratova.
Mukhamedov's Solor is the ideal foil for this Nikiya. He tells us everything
of the haunted lover who is also a warrior hero: it is a superb study in
Romantic theatre. And as the Chief Brahmin, Stephen Jefferies gives an
interpretation worthy of the best Petersburg traditions. From his first
entrance we sense the tensions and lusts that drive the character, and
Jefferies turns the mimetic rodomontade of the role into truest feeling
through the dignity of his every action.
In Wednesday's performance, Viviana Durante offered an eminently sure
account of Nikiya. The dramatics of the role flared; the dancing was no less
bright in skill and clarity. Tetsuya Kumakawa, in an unexpected debut, was
making only a first sketch of Solor's emotions but his dancing was of
exhilarating power. High-soaring, magnificently clean in execution,
unstrained even at its most prodigious moments, it gave Solor thrilling, if
temporary, life. Two other performances were exceptional: Matthew Hart's
eagerly danced and acted Fakir, and Rosalyn Whitten's enchanting appearance
in the Pas d'action, her dancing so pretty and so rich in its harmonies of
torso and arms that her companions looked as if they had been lightly
starched.
The Royal Ballet season continues at Covent Garden until August 8.

The Olympics is approaching its climax and British interest today will focus
on the 10,000 metres final (8.30 this evening) when Liz McColgan will
attempt to repeat her gold medal triumph of four years ago at Tokyo. Anyone
wearying of the television commentators might try the more relaxed, off-beat

Alan Whicker's group of well-heeled tourists, who are jetting their way

was all champagne and sunsets, the natives of Easter Island are as defiant
as their mysterious statues.
A welcome return for Dear Diary (Radio 4 at 10.00am). This is a simple idea

FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: The landscape of imagination - Art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVIER MOURGUE is one of France's most innovative designers. He is also a
maverick. In the 1960s he travelled Europe in various 'ateliers mobiles'
establishing a reputation as a furniture designer and producing, most
memorably, futuristic sets for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.
There followed design projects for motor-car as well as furniture
manufacturers and experiments with textiles and 'animated' canvases. More
recently, while living in Brittany, he began to furnish the landscape of his
imagination.
This is the stuff of the current exhibition, his first in Britain, at the
Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich. Out of the long-familiar
materials of watercolour or balsa wood, canvas and paint he has confected a
series of Imaginary Gardens and Little Theatres - and a world of the
gentlest fantasy.
Only gradually does this world come to be recreated in our mind's eye.
Certainly the visitor leaves the almost impenetrable prose of Mourgue's
introduction ill-prepared for the watercolours that look more like textile
or wallpaper designs than preparatory drawings, and the models and
constructions that fuse folklore and craft traditions, design and the
theatre.
Such is the nature of exhibitions that the Little Theatres stand empty,
their props neatly arranged and hermetically sealed behind glass a few feet
away. The man-sized painted and slatted wood 'play' furniture looks
similarly bereft, uncomfortably confined and untouched in this indoor space.
Mourgue's own photographs, reproduced in the catalogue, record these pieces
as they should be seen and used. The kite-backed chaise-longue, for example,
catches the breeze at the point where the flat, wet Brittany beach seems to
merge with the expanses of sea and sky.
Photographed at low tide too is 'The Bird' which is suspended above us. It
is a five metre long sledge bearing a figure crowned with a bird's-nest
seated behind a kite-like head of a bird. The bird's wings are imaginary
sails, its long tail feathers a tiller. The watercolour shows this
fantastical vehicle and its equally strange occupant gliding across what may
be waves or clouds. Sea and sky seem ever interchangeable.
Mourgue has described elsewhere how his silent theatre came into being as a
result of constantly re-arranging the objects scattered about his studio -
pebbles, driftwood, feathers, dried sea-weed, children's drawings. They
developed as 'a sort of mime' in his watercolours and then acquired a third
dimension. Just as Mourgue's imagery comes out of the Brittany landscape,
his theatres and props - large or small - look most at home within it.
Regrettably, there is no film of his silent story-telling - in Brittany, New
York or Helsinki - as there is of Alexander Calder operating the famous wire
Circus that must have inspired him. Mourgue's theatres, like Calder's
Circus, fit into a suitcase. His performances are, apparently, equally
impromptu, improvised and compelling.
That is where the similarity ends. While Ringmaster Calder's stage is
makeshift and his troupe of miniature performers concoctions of wire, cork
and fabric strips, Mourgue's minimalist wood and canvas theatres are
impeccable in their artful simplicity, each prop and character beautifully
crafted. There are smooth, pebble-shaped wooden figures with jaunty acorn
heads, stone houses and rocks, and a retinue of cats, birds and jumping dogs
that are either carefully drawn and cut out or made from strips of torn
paper.
Calder's wire performers thrilled their audiences by ingeniously replicating
human movement. His wire strongman, clad in a scrap of leopardskin, raises
his weight in a series of authentic jerks; the belly dancer's hips gyrate
convincingly and the stretcher bearers, come to whisk away the victim of an
inept knife-thrower, enter and exit with a comic trundling gait.
Mourgue offers a kind of Theatre of the Absurd. Ladies take tea or play the
'cello floating out to sea with hungry chicks clamouring in the nests made
on their heads. Boats give the illusion of carrying trees, even houses. This
Absurdist humour - long a characteristic of his furniture design - brings to
mind the work of Sam Smith and the English automatists, which also has its
roots in folk traditions, although there is none of their irony or
subversive wit.
Mourgue's flights of fancy are innocent, domestic. Even his Imaginary
Gardens have the qualities of samplers stitched with sacred symbols. His
tall tales and enchantments are as inconsequential as dreams. Like dreams,
they are compelling as long as they last and then they are instantly
forgotten.
* * *
Norwich, for another week, is also host to a selection of paintings and oil
sketches on loan from the Turner Bequest at the Tate.  'From Turner's
Studio' focuses on work that would never have been exhibited during the
master's lifetime. A wide-ranging sequence of small, fresh landscapes, some
painted direct from nature, canvases laid in but never completed, and all
manner of preparatory sketches, atmospheric studies and impressions reveal
this most inquiring of artists at his most dazzlingly experimental.
'Olivier Mourgue: Imaginary Gardens and Little Theatres' is sponsored by
Worms et Cie, Association Francaise d'Action Artistique, Visiting Arts, the
French Ministry of Culture and Communication, and Sir Norman Foster and
Partners. It continues at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University
of East Anglia, Norwich, until August 30.
'From Turner's Studio' closes its national tour, sponsored by Digital, at
The Castle Museum, Norwich, on August 16.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: My Mathematics - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROSE ENGLISH brought her new show, My Mathematics, to London's Queen
Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday, sadly for one performance only. One reason I
would like to see it again almost immediately is to tell how far it is
improvised, for surely not even the remarkable Ms English can perform the
same tricks every night.
You will be inevitably misled by the title. Although there is some fanciful
stuff about numbers and moving from zero to nought, Mathematics is the name
of a horse. In the second act it is on stage almost throughout. Ms English
achieves what Hollywood stars are advised never even to try: she acts with
an animal and more or less comes out on top, though even she admits that it
is sometimes touch and go.
Ms English is a brilliant tease. That is how her act works. She comes across
as an educated Gipsy Rose Lee. So first one must pay tribute to the
build-up. The first half is a mildly seductive introduction to the second.
At the start Ms English tells how she used to be Rosita of the Circus with a
huge troupe of animals and a large band. Now she has only an accordionist
(discretely played by Ian Hill) at her side. She goes in for some audience
participation, pantomime-style. She has the most enormous black artificial
eyelashes.
The audience is invited to be kissed or lashed, then to cut the lashes.
Presumably she is relying on plants scattered round the hall, but there is
always the chance that someone unexpected might turn up. This is a high-risk
business.
Ms English also has a habit of saying 'Yes, yes', sometimes 'Yes, yes, yes'
and occasionally even 'Yes' five times. There is the odd variant of 'No,
no'. Irritating at first, it becomes endearing. They are, after all, strong
words. When this lady says them, she obviously means them, even to horses.
Thus the first act is pleasant, with the odd bit of conjuring, but slight.
Only the glimpse of Mathematics just before the interval gives a hint of
what is in store. Ms English is now in leotard, bare-backed like the horse.
Her eyelashes have switched to red. She still has a whip, but seems to need
it less with the horse than with the accordionist. She rides, cajoles and
practically makes love to the beast. At one stage on Wednesday he seemed in
a distinctly and - one would guess - unpredictably randy mood. 'He's been in
a lot of Westerns,' Ms English says, as he looks set to gallop off into the
sunset.
How far this is all pre-planned is impossible to tell from one sitting. Ms
English seems to have doubts herself. 'Is it coercion?' she asks as the
horse obeys her. 'It's a difficult question, isn't it?' Then the horse
suddenly starts pushing her around.
According to the programme, the real name of the horse is Goldy, owned and
trained by Joan Rosaire, who appears at the final curtain. Ms Rosaire
deserves a large share of the credits. It is Ms English, however, who has
achieved the ultimate in strip-tease: teasing without stripping.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When equipment involving electronics breaks down the most common approach is
to identify the faulty circuit board and then exchange it for a good one.
But while 'board-swapping' is quick, it can carry a high price tag. This led
Polar Instruments to develop a low-cost maintenance tool, known as the T6000
D-I-Y electronics fault finder. It uses a technique called impedance
signature comparison (a kind of 'electronic finger-printing') to locate the
fault.
Every electronic component responds in a particular way to electrical
stimulus, so by stimulating components on a board and recording their
response, the T6000 identifies a behaviour pattern for a 'good' circuit
board or component. If a fault develops the component causing the problem
can be identified by measuring the new behaviour pattern and comparing it
with the old. Polar Instruments: UK, 0481 53081.

Injection moulding, a process usually associated with plastic, is now being
used to make small metal components. IMPAC Technologies, a subsidiary of the
French Vallourec steel group, is developing a low-cost way of making complex
metallic parts which are comparable in density to those produced though
casting. It enables cost savings of 50 to 200 per cent over conventional
machining techniques.
The process consists of mixing metal powders with a thermo- plastic binder
to achieve the necessary cohesion. The mix is then injected into the
moulding machine where it sets. Afterwards, the binder particles are removed
through thermal extraction. Finally, the component is heated in a controlled
atmosphere. IMPAC Technologies: France, 4909 3969.

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, the US motor group in the throes of a radical restructuring,
yesterday reported reduced second-quarter losses but its shares fell as it
warned that the second half of the year looked tough.
The figures underlined the slow recovery from recession of the US vehicle
market and Detroit's concern that trading conditions between now and
December could be difficult, given both the fragility of the US market and a
slowdown in Europe.
Mr Robert Stempel, chairman, said GM's big cost-cutting programme should
mean a significant improvement in second-half results over the final six
months of 1991. But he added: 'Sustaining the rate of progress we
experienced in the first half of this year . . . appears extremely
challenging.'
GM reported a net loss of Dollars 357m (Pounds 186.9m), or 66 cents a share,
in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 784m, or Dollars 1.44 a
share, in the same period of last year.
Sales and revenues rose from Dollars 31.3bn to Dollars 35.2bn. However, the
group earned Dollars 392m, or 31 cents a share, when a previously announced
special Dollars 749m restructuring charge, taken by its GM Hughes
Electronics subsidiary, was excluded.
This move into the black depended heavily on the group's three non-motor
businesses. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the group's financial
services arm, made Dollars 286.9m, up from Dollars 283.6m; Electronic Data
Systems made Dollars 157.1m, up Dollars 17.3m; and GM Hughes made Dollars
164.6m, up Dollars 114.3m, before the restructuring charge.
The results were not far from market expectations, but GM shares slipped
Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 37 1/8 , amid concern about the second-half
outlook.
GM's board expressed displeasure with the pace of change under Mr Stempel
last April when it staged a coup which reduced his powers and promoted Mr
Jack Smith, head of international operations, to president. He was given a
mandate to introduce his successful management practices at GM Europe into
the loss-making North American vehicle operations.
Mr Stempel said North America's figures had been helped in the quarter by a
12 per cent year-to-year increase in factory unit sales and cost controls.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Bush calls on UN to sanction use of force in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday urged the United Nations to pass a
resolution authorising the use of force, if necessary, to ensure
humanitarian aid reaches war-torn Bosnia.
The US would extend full diplomatic recognition to the former Yugoslav
republic, he added, as well as to Croatia and Slovenia, two other breakaway
Yugoslav states.
Mr Bush was responding to growing international pressure for action to stop
the fighting in Bosnia and to increasing condemnation of Serbia's role in
the Yugoslav conflict.
But he voiced extreme reluctance at the idea of intervention in 'blood
feuds'. He pointedly referred to the use of force only for the purpose of
getting supplies through to civilians, avoiding any suggestion of air
strikes against Serb irregular forces or other military action to end the
ethnic conflict.
Pressure for UN-authorised action has been fuelled by media reports of
alleged atrocities in detention camps in Bosnia and an escalation of
fighting in and around Sarajevo, the republic's besieged capital.
Some British journalists have just been allowed to visit Serb-run detention
camps holding Croats and Moslems. They saw emaciated figures and heard
allegations of violence, which they could not verify.
The European Community condemned what it called 'repulsive and despicable'
Serb camps to detain Bosnian civilians. A statement issued by the British EC
presidency demanded that the Belgrade government press Bosnian Serbs to let
international observers, especially from the Red Cross, into the camps.
Member countries of Nato agreed to draw up contingency plans for possible
use of western military force to make sure humanitarian aid gets through to
Yugoslav republics. The plans will include the possibility of opening up a
land corridor to Sarajevo for armed relief convoys.
In his latest response to the growing crisis, Mr Bush condemned what he
described as 'the vile policy of ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia. He did not
specifically identify Serbia as the prime culprit but added that its
government had to understand it would pay 'a real price' for aggression.
In an article in the New York Times, Lady Thatcher, former British prime
minister, called for military action against Serbia: 'A clear threat of
military action would force Serbia into contemplating an end to its
aggression.'
Mr John Major again ruled out military intervention. 'All the advice I have
tells me that we cannot use force . . . without disproportionate risk to the
lives of civilians and our armed forces,' he told Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, who earlier in the week advocated some form of military
initiative in Bosnia.

second-quarter dividend, as well as announcing an exceptional charge of
nearly Pounds 1bn, and the shares spiralled down amid hectic selling.
The stock was 17 off at one stage before ending with a net fall of 10 at 196
1/2 p, the lowest level since mid-1986. The day's turnover of 74m shares was
one of the highest for the past five years. In addition, the equivalent of
some 40m shares changed hands during the first two hours of the new session
in New York, where they are traded in the form of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs).
US institutions have consistently taken a far more optimistic view of the
oil company than their UK counterparts and overnight ADR buying was
reflected on the UK shares when London opened yesterday. Then, the UK began
to sell the shares and an early gain had been reversed by the time BP's
headline losses were released at mid-morning. On the news, the stock ticked
back sharply to trade 13 down with the turnover doubling within minutes.
The analysts' meeting at midday did nothing to alleviate the gloom.
Nevertheless, US investors continued to show support, with houses such as CJ
Lawrence and Kidder Peabody said to be clinging on to their positive stance.
Mr Bernard Picchi of Kidder said: 'The dividend cut was bitter medicine but
the right medicine and, if anything, US investors have intensified their
interest as a result of the sharp fall in the share price.'
In London, Mr John Toalster, the Strauss Turnbull analyst who has long
predicted a dividend cut, argued that the oil group would be unable to lift
it again for at least two years.
C and W weak
Cable and Wireless retreated 16 to 524p on rumours that unofficial
negotiations between the telecoms group and American counterpart US West had
broken down. The talks were believed to involve US West taking a minority
stake in C and W's telecoms subsidiary, Mercury, with a price tag of Pounds
500m to Pounds 600m being suggested.
Although C and W has never admitted the existence of the talks, most market
analysts accepted that negotiations were in progress, particularly in view
of C and W's stated aim of bringing partners on board in its serach for a
global partnership. But the talks now appear to have foundered on regulatory
worries on the US side.
This suggestion prompted several other whispers about C and W, one that a
survey among leading business users by a broker had found BT favoured ahead
of Mercury for the first time. BT shares, strengthened by press reports that
it would not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, edged a
penny higher to 337p.
Barclays ahead
Disappointing interim results from Barclays were accompanied by what one
analyst described as 'a sigh of relief that the dividend was maintained'. In
spite of the effect of chairman Sir John Quinton's gloomy general statement
on the rest of the market, Barclays rose 10 to 334p, the best percentage
performance among the 100 FT-SE Index stocks, with 15m shares traded.
The Pounds 1bn provision for bad debts was larger than the market had
expected, and one analyst argued that the bank had not been able to control
costs and was unlikely to maintain its rate of growth in the second half.
However, there was confidence that the dividend would be held for the full
year and Nomura Research was arguing that the shares were attractive at
around 320p. A number of investors were switching from National Westminster,
which slipped 6 to 315p.
Thorn EMI tumbles
Leisure group Thorn EMI's shares tumbled 32 to 711p under the combined
weight of poor results from the Dutch Philips concern and consecutive days'
downgrades.
After Wednesday's downgrade by one leading house, yesterday saw further
trimming by Smith New Court, Henderson Crosthwaite and Paribas. Worries over
Thorn's music division were said to be behind the cuts, Smith now looking
for Pounds 315m, down Pounds 10m, Paribas a similar reduction to Pounds
345m, and Henderson an unconfirmed Pounds 300m.
Profits from industrial gases concern BOC came in above the market's
estimates and the shares jumped 17 to 601p.
Turnover in business services group BET jumped to 43m after the company said
only 43.2 per cent of its Pounds 201m rights issue had been taken up by
investors. Around 19m shares were placed with sub-underwriters at 107 1/2 p,
representing through double counting a majority of the day's volume. The
stock closed at 110p, unchanged on the day and in line with the rights issue
price.
Telecoms group Vodafone moved forward 7 to 327p as it announced plans to
form a consortium to provide a cellular network in Greece.
Vague talk that Anglian Water was in line for a share of a lucrative
Argentinian contract, together with a big buyer in the market, lifted the
shares 12 to 406p.
Turnover in freight company NFC rose to 11m as the shares retreated after
two large trades - one of 5.6m and another of 5.5m - went through the market
at 245p and 247p respectively.
Regional brewer Greene King continued to suffer from holding 29.3 per cent
of its failed bid target Morland. Shares in the latter closed steady at
405p. Greene King, which had paid some 450p for its Morland holding,
weakened 18 to 445p.
Mirror Group Newspapers saw very heavy turnover as a block of 6.8m shares
was bought for cash for the next account. The recorded volume was 15m
shares, which represents both sides of the block trade. The stock eased a
penny to 73p.
Simon Engineering was subject to a two-way pull after the company reported a
rise in half-time profits just ahead of expectations. The buyers were
cheered by the figures and the shares ended 4 better at 185p.

FT  07 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities shaken by corporate news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market yesterday survived highly negative reports from two of
Britain's largest companies to close in better shape than appeared possible
at the day's low point. The halving of British Petroleum's second-quarter
dividend dealt a harsh blow to a stock market already driven lower by a
sharp fall in interim profits at Barclays, whose chairman warned that the UK
economic recession might continue for a further two years.
However, a midsession fall of 32 Footsie points, taking the index to
2,360.7, was halved later as the market's battered confidence was helped by
the decision of the Bundesbank's policy council to leave interest rates
unchanged, and by an assurance from a UK Treasury secretary that the
domestic recession has already bottomed out.
The FT-SE Index ended the day 15.2 down at 2,377.6. London was helped at the
end of the session by a better performance from Wall Street than had been
feared in view of the impending trading reports from British Petroleum and
General Motors. The Dow Industrial Average was 11 points off when London
closed.
The UK trading session was heavily dominated by the day's batch of important
company news and special situations. Of the sharply increased Seaq trading
volume total of 497.3m shares, about one-quarter represented activity in
only three stocks: British Petroleum, Barclays and BET, where underwriters
had to take up the bulk of a Pounds 200m rights issue.
Wednesday's Seaq total of 383m shares incorporated a mere Pounds 798m in
genuine retail business in equities, a continuation of the unprofitable
levels of activity in the London market at present.
From the viewpoint of the London stock market, the Pounds 919m write-off and
reduced payout at BP measured up to the worst possible expectations; but the
impact was softened slightly by signs of US support for the shares when Wall
Street opened. The maintained dividend helped Barclays shares at first but
the market was depressed by the gloomy view on the economy expressed by Sir
John Quinton, the chairman.
Across the range of the equity market, the investment mood seemed little
changed in spite of yesterday's developments. Pharmaceutical shares remained
firm but domestically orientated issues, including consumer stocks and
builders, continued to give ground. BOC provided a firm feature, responding
to improved profits.
The absence of any move on rates by the Bundesbank left UK investors to
ponder the widespread calls for action to be taken by the UK government to
stimulate the domestic economy, possibly by easing base rates to spark
recovery in the housing sector. Any optimism on this score was restrained by
a sluggish trend in sterling, which moved narrowly against the D-Mark
yesterday after its recent fall.
However, many analysts sounded relieved by the market's performance in a
trading session which had been identified far ahead as potentially hazardous
for share prices. The fall in BP shares was responsible for nearly
one-quarter of the day's loss in the Footsie.

FT  07 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): GM disappointment adds to
Dow's woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
DISAPPOINTING earnings from General Motors and nervousness ahead of today's
employment report for July left share prices lower across the board after
moderate trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 24.58 down at 3,340.56. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 1.60 to 420.59 and the Nasdaq composite
slipped 2.85 to 574.02. NYSE turnover was 181m shares.
The early news from the Labor Department of a 69,000 rise in jobless claims
for the week ended July 25, the largest weekly increase in 10 years, was not
promising. An analysis of the figures, however, revealed that nearly almost
all of the rise was accounted for by temporary lay-offs and shutdowns at
General Motors and other car company plants in the final two weeks of July.
Confusion over the weekly claims data added to the nervousness felt by
investors about today's July employment report. Analysts are expecting a
rise in non-farm payrolls and a slight fall in the national unemployment
rate.
The other major influence on sentiment was the latest batch of
second-quarter earnings, which provided little comfort.
General Motors fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 on 5.9m shares traded
after reporting a net loss of Dollars 357.1m in its second quarter, compared
to a loss of Dollars 784.5m a year earlier. The loss in the quarter was
attributable to a previously announced Dollars 749m restructuring charge at
GM's Hughes Aircraft subsidiary.
Nevertheless, the market responded negatively to the figures because, even
without the special charge, GM's earnings came in below expectations, and
because investors are worried about the outlook for car sales for the rest
of the year. Ford dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 41.
The ADRs of British Petroleum plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 45 1/4 after the
UK oil company reported an 11 per cent decline in net profit on a
historic-cost basis and before extraordinary items, halved its
second-quarter dividend and announced plans for 1,500 job cuts. BP's fall
would have been much greater were it not for the strong US support for the
stock around the Dollars 44 3/4 level.
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International weakened Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 39 3/4 on fears that its entry into the Windows software market
might be postponed until next month.
Canada
TORONTO shook off the sharp decline on Wall Street, partly recovering from
heavy midday losses to end just slightly down on the day. Brisk early
dealings, highlighted by a number of large block trades, gave way to a slow
afternoon session.
The TSE 300 index closed 7.5 off at 3,398.6 and declines led rises by 250 to
218 after volume of 25.2m shares. Companies in the Bronfman empire recovered
some ground after quarterly earnings: Hees International, the merchant bank,
rose CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 12 3/4 . It maintained the dividend in spite
of dividend cuts at its real estate affiliates. Carena Developments, parent
of the Bronfman's real estate arm, rallied 45 cents to CDollars 4.75.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Markets await payroll figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR traded in tight ranges against the D-Mark yesterday as the
markets anxiously awaited today's US non-farm payroll figure for July,
writes James Blitz.
The payroll figure is widely seen as the big number of the week, with the
market expecting a rise in US employment of anything up to 200,000 on the
month. Dealers believe that if the figure comes through as expected, the
dollar could make a concerted move towards DM1.50. There is also speculation
that June's reported fall of 117,000 in non-farm payroll was greatly
overstated and some think it could be revised all the way up to a 100,000
increase.
However, a leading London economist said there was still deep uncertainty
over the jobless figures: 'We have got uncertain revisions, huge seasonal
adjustments and one-off adjustments for government-sponsored work schemes,
so the market has every right to be paralysed with fear.'
The US currency received a small boost yesterday from the Bundesbank's
decision not to raise its emergency Lombard rate. Adding to the more relaxed
mood was July's figure for German manufacturing orders, which was down 1.8
per cent on the month. Signs that the German economy is weakening will put
pressure on the Bundesbank not to tighten policy further.
However, analysts believe there are still reasons to fear a Lombard rate
rise this autumn. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi
International, thinks Germany's M3 money supply figure for August, due out
in three weeks time, will show monetary growth peaking at 9.5 per cent. He
believes that the Bundesbank could increase the Lombard rate by  1/4
percentage point in the wake of this.
In London, the dollar ended higher against the D-Mark at DM1.4815 compared
to a previous finish of DM1.4760. At the close of New York trading the US
currency had slipped back to DM1.4772.
After having fallen about 2 pfennigs this week, sterling's descent against
the D-Mark was halted yesterday. The UK currency finished a little firmer at
DM2.8275, after a previous close of DM2.8250.
Dealers, however, remain bearish towards the currency, which is testing its
floor against both the Portuguese escudo and the Spanish peseta in the
European exchange rate mechanism. An analyst sugg-ested that if the pound
drifts down to DM2.80 in forthcoming days, the Bank of England will be
forced to respond with heavy intervention.
The Italian lira showed a mild improvement against the D-Mark, ending at
L756.0 compared to the previous close of L756.5, as did the French franc,
with a finish of FFr3.3770 to the German unit, against FFr3.3800 previously.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Short dates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer yesterday
as dealers spotted signs that the Bundesbank may not raise its emergency
Lombard rate again this year.
The Bundesbank's decision at its council meeting yesterday not to lift the
Lombard rate had been widely expected. But there was speculation, too, that
the German central bank could bring forward the date of a rate cut following
July's figure for German manufacturing orders. This was down 1.8 per cent
from the previous month, heightening signs of a slowdown in the German
economy and the need to stimulate growth.
The most significant reason for the softening of sterling rates yesterday
was the German central bank's decision to provide an estimated DM4bn to
DM6bn of short-term funds to the market at a rate of 9.70 per cent.
The Bundesbank's decision to drain DM8bn from the banking system on
Wednesday had caused deep anxiety, as it pushed call money up to the Lombard
rate level. However, there were suggestions that the Bundesbank had
withdrawn the cash in anticipation of a flow of liquidity to the market
later this month from the banking sector. Yesterday's new injection was
probably provided as bridging funding.
One-month sterling cash was down  1/16 percentage point to 10 1/8 per cent
on the offered side, and three-month cash was similarly lower at 10 5/16 per
cent. September short sterling rose 4 basis points from its opening figure
to close at 89.61.
Cash rates remained bearish further out, however, as the fundamental view on
a possible rate cut is still gloomy. One-year money was firmer on the
offered side at 10 1/2 per cent from a previous close of 10 7/16 per cent.
The Bank of England dealt in Band 1 at 9 7/8 per cent and in repurchase
agreements (repos) at 9 15/16 per cent. After fore-casting a shortage of
Pounds 1.05bn, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the repo.
The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. In further operations, the
Bank bought Pounds 440m in Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 600m in the repo.
The forecast was subsequently revised again, to around Pounds 1.25bn. The
Bank purchased Pounds 1m in Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 180m of Band 1
bank bills.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Quaker Oats slips 2% in quarter

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QUAKER Oats, the Chicago-based food, beverage and pet foods company,
yesterday posted a 2 per cent decline in fourth-quarter net income to
Dollars 103.9m, from Dollars 106.4m a year earlier, on flat sales of Dollars
1.54bn.
Earnings per share held steady at Dollars 1.38, with fewer shares
outstanding in the latest quarter.
For the full year, Quaker Oats had net income of Dollars 247.6m, or Dollars
3.25, compared with Dollars 235.8m, or Dollars 2.65, a year ago. Results for
last year included a Dollars 30m loss from the discontinued operations of
Fisher-Price. Sales rose to Dollars 5.58bn from Dollars 5.49bn.
Mr William Smithburg, chairman and chief executive, said the earnings
decline in the second half of this year reflected a change in the timing of
the company's trade promotions.
However, he expects this change to boost the company's results for first
half of fiscal 1993.
During the quarter, a 17.7 per cent improvement in international grocery
sales to Dollars 491.8m helped offset a 6.1 per cent decline in north
American product sales to Dollars 1.05bn.
Operating income from international grocery products rose 5 per cent to
Dollars 41.7m, while US and Canadian operations saw a 4.2 per cent decline
in operating income to Dollars 170.4m.
Woolworth, the US stores group, said its FW Woolworth Co unit was to acquire
89 Joan Bari and Cabaret accessories boutiques from Edison Brothers Stores.
Terms were not disclosed.
FW Woolworth will assume operation of the stores, which average in size
about 1,000 sq ft, in September.
Edison said the acquisition by Woolworth was for the entire chain of stores.
In 1991, the Joan Bari/Cabaret chain generated 1.7 per cent of Edison's
sales and none of its profits.
In addition to cash, Edison said it would get up to three leases from the
Richman Brothers and Anderson-Little chains, which Woolworth said it was to
soon close. Edison Bros said the leases will be used for its menswear and
footwear chains.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Reichmanns agree to detail
business interests in full
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of Canada's Reichmann family, long famed for their secrecy, have
agreed to disclose all their business interests to creditors of the ailing
family-owned developer, Olympia &amp; York.
A list of assets will be compiled by Price Waterhouse's office in Toronto.
But Mr Bernard Wilson, a PW partner who also acts as O&amp;Y's information
officer, said yesterday that agreement has yet to be reached on a precise
definition of assets to be disclosed. Mr Wilson said he was uncertain when
the list would be completed.
O&amp;Y's creditors have repeatedly voiced concern that the Reichmanns may
control assets outside the O&amp;Y group which could be used to help repay the
company's CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.4bn) debt.
Olympia &amp; York Developments, the holding company, and 28 Canadian
subsidiaries filed for protection from their creditors last May.
Admin-istrators have also taken over the Canary Wharf project in London, but
the company has so far managed to keep its US properties out of court
protection.
O&amp;Y said in a progress report yesterday that, based on a series of meetings
with creditors in recent weeks, it expects to present a debt-restructuring
plan by August 21. O&amp;Y said that it has adopted a strategy of drawing up
separate restruc-turing proposals for each of its six creditor groups, with
the highest priority being given to lenders to specific projects.
Under pressure from the creditors, the Reichmanns earlier disclosed CDollars
71m of assets not directly owned by O&amp;Y. These include a CDollars 4m
residence in Hampstead Heath, London, and various other buildings and
securities in Canada. Some properties and a corporate jet have already been
sold to help pay O&amp;Y's restructuring costs.
The Reichmanns, through their lawyer, earlier objected to the degree of
disclosure demanded by the creditors. But a lawyer for one bank lender said
in court yesterday that the creditors are now satisfied that O&amp;Y is
co-operating with the creditors.

MANY leading US retailing groups yesterday reported improved sales for July
after a generally disappointing June.
The Gap, a specialty clothing chain, posted a 7 per cent gain in comparable
store sales, while overall sales in the four weeks to August 1 climbed 18
per cent to Dollars 181m.
Rival specialty retailer The Limited, however, saw same-store sales fall 6
per cent in the month, and a more modest 4 per cent improvement in total
sales to Dollars 415m.
Wal-Mart, the fast-growing discount chain and the biggest US retailer by
sales, reported a 13 per cent improvement for July. Total sales advanced 28
per cent to Dollars 4.32bn.
K-mart, another big discount retailer, posted its best comparable store
sales gain this year. They rose 7.5 per cent, while total sales were up 13.3
per cent to Dollars 2.69bn.
Sears, the Chicago-based stores and catalogue group, said comparable US
store sales slipped 2.2 per cent in July.
JC Penney, a department store and catalogue group, saw same-store sales
increase 9.7 per cent, while total sales rose 10.4 per cent to Dollars 870m.
Among other big US retailers, Woolworth saw US comparable store sales rise 2
per cent while total domestic sales slipped 0.2 per cent to Dollars 395m.
Dayton Hudson's comparable store sales were 3.2 per cent higher, while its
net retail sales advanced 11.8 per cent to Dollars 1.18bn.
May Department Stores had comparable store sales that were 3.9 per cent
higher while total sales rose 8.9 per cent to Dollars 667.4m

<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the large Chicago-based consumer products company, yesterday
posted strong fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting improved margins in its
packaged meat business and the contributions of the company's recent
acquisitions.
For the three months to June 27, net income rose 20.6 per cent to Dollars
170.2m from Dollars 141.1m a year earlier. Primary earnings per share were
19.3 per cent higher at 68 cents, compared with 57 cents in the same period
of 1991. Sales advanced 11.8 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn.
Full-year results were distorted by a large one-time gain on the sale of the
company's European over-the-counter pharmaceutical business, which
contributed 60 cents a share net of restructuring charges.
Including one-time items, net income rose 42.2 per cent to Dollars 760.6m
from Dollars 535m, while primary earnings per share were 43.3 per cent
higher at Dollars 3.08 from Dollars 2.15. Stripping out extraordinary items,
earnings per share increased 15.3 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.48.
Sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 13.2bn from Dollars 12.4bn.
Operating income for packaged meats and bakery products rose 29.9 per cent
to Dollars 87.4m in the quarter, in spite of a 6.2 per cent decline in sales
to Dollars 1.2bn. The company attributed the improved profitability to
operating efficiencies, lower raw material costs in packaged meats and an
improved product mix in its bakery operations.

FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: IBM considers plan for PC
division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SEPARATE personal computer division may be the latest step in
International Business Machines' strategy to transform itself from a
monolithic giant into a loose federation of smaller, more competitive,
business units.
Industry analysts attending a meeting with IBM executives earlier this week
were told of plans to create a new subsidiary which would design, develop,
manufacture and market IBM personal computers.
It would have worldwide revenues of about Dollars 7bn, on a par with those
of most leading computer manufacturers.
The plan is thought to be the brainchild of Mr James Cannavino, the
energetic head of IBM's PC business, but the company this week refused to
confirm or deny that he had been given the go-ahead.
A spokesperson said several avenues were being considered in the company's
efforts to improve the competitiveness of its PC business.
IBM is the world's largest manufacturer of PCs, but its profitability has
been badly affected by falling hardware prices as components have become
cheaper and fierce competition from manufacturers of copies ('clones') of
IBM's machines, which have become the industry standard.
The plan to set up a separate PC subsidiary follows moves in Europe and
Canada to set up separate organisations to market low-cost PCs in direct
competition with the clone-makers.
There is sound logic behind the idea of casting loose the company's PC
business. Culturally, PC operations, which depend on fast responses to
market conditions, do not sit comfortably within large mainframe computer
companies.
IBM's shares fell Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 88 1/4 in New York on
forecasts that there would be little or no growth this year in its mainframe
business.
Hewlett-Packard said projected earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended
July 31 would be below analysts' expectations of Dollars 1.12 a share,
Reuter reports.
The US computer and electronics group said earnings could range from about
equal to the 76 cents a share earned in the same period last year to 15 per
cent higher.
It said orders in some businesses, such as printers and medical equipment,
remained strong, but weak capital spending was affecting its orders in other
areas, such as test and measurement equipment.

<TEXT>
IMPRESSIVE first-half results have pushed Banespa, the state bank of Sao
Paulo, Brazil's largest state, up the ladder to rank as the country's second
biggest bank for the first time.
Mr Antonio Sochacewski, the bank's president, said it hopes to consolidate
this position through overseas expansion.
Banespa posted profits of Dollars 106.4m for the first half of this year -
up 44.2 per cent on last year - and recorded a 48.6 per cent rise in
deposits to Dollars 5.25bn.
Brazilian banks appear to have recovered from the disastrous blow they
received two years ago when President Fernando Collor seized 80 per cent of
bank accounts.
Most banks have since shed staff and are benefiting from high real interest
rates and government borrowing.
Banespa has 17 overseas agencies and a new bank, Ban-espa International, is
opening in Luxembourg to co-ordinate European operations, with an initial
capitalisation of Dollars 16m.
The bank is waiting for Brazil's political situation to improve before
making its first Eurobond issue, planned to be between Dollars 80m and
Dollars 130m.

WALL STREET securities house Shearson Lehman Brothers confirmed last night
that it is in talks to sell the Boston Company, its custodial, trust
services and mortgage lending subsidiary.
Shearson, which is part of financial services and travel group American
Express, said in a brief statement that a number of blue-chip financial
institutions had 'indicated that they believe that our subsidiary, the
Boston Company, may be a natural fit with their organisations. We have put
in place a rigorous and professional process to explore this interest'.
However, Shearson said that negotiations were only in the preliminary phase
and that no decision had been made to sell the Boston Company. Shearson said
it was reviewing its strategic options but would not comment on which
companies had said they were interested in the subsidiary.
Shearson bought the Boston Company for Dollars 50m in 1981, and in the
recently completed second quarter, the unit reported revenues of Dollars
149m.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Enthusiast set on avoiding pitfalls of
runaway success - The launch of a new model has widened TVR's appeal. But
its owner is not fazed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Wheeler increased his output of cars by a quarter and quadrupled
his profits last year in the depth of the UK car markets slump.
The Pounds 750,000 profit might just have covered the cost of developing a
new door handle for a volume car maker. It was achieved on output of 800
cars and turnover of Pounds 14m, a sum which General Motors generates
world-wide in an hour.
But it is not financial performance which is preoccupying Mr Wheeler, a
former account-ant who bought TVR, the Blackpool-based sports car maker, a
decade ago.
TVR is suddenly being taken seriously by a wider world than the die-hard
enthusiasts who have kept it in business - through several owners and
sometimes precariously - since it first began making sports cars in 1954.
Mr Wheeler had already overseen the launch of several new models and a
steady increase in output since he took over. Then came the 1990 UK motor
show and the display of a prototype which, only weeks previously, had been
simply a sketch on his cigarette packet.
The motoring press fell over itself to praise the car. The
internationally-respected Car magazine compared its styling favourably with
Ferrari. Called the Griffith, after a 1960s TVR two-seater, it has just gone
into production and well-known owners already include Mr Creighton Brown,
head of McLaren's road car project.
Mr Wheeler's problem is what to do about a lengthening order book, which
leaves would-be owners with waits of up to a year.
This year TVR's 200 employees should be able to squeeze between 950 and
1,000 cars out of its motley collection of buildings at Lytham St Annes, on
the outskirts of Blackpool. But orders for the Griffith alone are
approaching this level, and it is only part of a range of TVR cars.
Additional capacity would thus appear to be a safe investment, and fairly
cheap because TVR tubular steel chassis are welded manually and bodies are
moulded from glass-reinforced plastic, avoiding the high cost of metal
machine tooling.
But Mr Wheeler says the motor industry graveyard is overflowing with small
sports car makers whose optimism overtook their judgment and he has no
intention of joining them.
So he does not envisage TVR ever making the 2,000 a year some suggest as a
target - 'times will certainly get worse again.' Also, he points out,
obtaining skilled labour is difficult in a region better known for tourism
than industry.
By intensive training of very small groups of extra workers, Mr Wheeler
thinks annual output of 1,500 might eventually be feasible. But he
pro-fesses another reason for caution:
'I've never made anyone redundant in my life. And I don't intend to start
now. I'd put prices up rather than do that.'
That might sound naive, but TVR does not follow normal 'what the market will
bear' pricing policies. 'We cost the car, put a small margin on it, and then
the dealer margin. We don't even look at other cars to fix the price; so the
customer gets a cost-plus car.'
The result, in the case of the Griffith, is a Porsche 944-sized two-seater
with essentially a racing car chassis and performance similar to a Ferrari.
Its Pounds 26,000 price 'is because we haven't spent any money persuading
anyone that it's worth Pounds 45,000. We're not paying any money for
marketing machinery; with others you're paying for the Le Mans reputation,
not the car itself.'
TVR's marketing policy, observes Mr Wheeler, 'is zero; it doesn't exist.' It
produces brochures, but leaves promotion to its dealers.
Its management traditions reflect the cars: simple and slightly raw-edged.
There is no finance director - 'the company secretary looks after all the
accounts.'
With Mr Wheeler answerable to no shareholders, TVR is fuelled by earnings
and bank borrowings. 'So we have to generate a small amount of profit to
keep everyone happy. In the past few years we've usually made about Pounds
250,000 net. Now it's much closer to Pounds 1m.'
Mr Wheeler professes to care little about bottom lines - only that there
should be adequate development cash. 'During the whole of the past 10 years
TVR has never seriously tried to make any money. We've tended to spend every
penny on development - and probably not been cautious enough with the
pennies.'
It seems an extraordinary way to run a business. But then Mr Wheeler, having
become wealthy enough to retire from the chemical engineering business in
his 40s, says he bought the business out of an interest in cars, not
commercial ambition.
'My life plan was to retire the day I bought this place. The end result is
that 10 years later I have wound up working harder than ever before in my
life. You've got to know and love building cars, and I suppose we're trying
to do what GM does, but with no resources. That's got to be the most
challenging thing going.'
Despite his carefree air, financial monitoring in reality is tight. No cars
are built for stock and Mr Wheeler insists that the company makes, and is
audited to make, profits each month.
One claimed reason for TVR's survival should, according to motor industry
convention, actually be sinking it. A high proportion of cars and tooling
are made 'in-house', whereas larger car makers are increasingly curbing
costs by becoming assemblers of out-sourced parts.
'We would wind up paying ridiculously high prices for 1,000 components a
year from motor industry suppliers ordinarily used to 60,000 a year', says
Mr Wheeler. 'Either that, or we would have to accept very high stocks. So it
really does pay us to stock raw material and fabricate it using our own
labour, no matter what anyone else might say.'
Profitability should be much increased by the Griffith, which is designed
for much easier construction - 200 man-hours against more than 400 required
by some predecessors.
The Griffith has no visible body seams, being produced in a few very large
moulds in which the glass fibre has to be laid by hand. 'The Japanese, or
anyone else, can't copy it, or make anything like it, unless they're
prepared to make it by hand as well.'
TVR buys V8 engines and gearboxes from Rover, but they are built to
specification and made much more powerful by 25 employees at TVR Power, a
subsidiary in Coventry.
There are distributors in Germany, Japan, France and Italy, but not in the
US. 'TVR's been in and out of there four times, and it's been the ruination
of countless European companies. It's worse than the Middle East - you've
got to be as strong as GM or forget it.'
TVR would like more UK dealers than its current 18, but finding them is
difficult. 'What we need is enthusiasts with money; what's usually on offer
is large companies with plenty of money but no enthusiasm, or enthusiasts
with no money.'
Mr Wheeler does not rule out eventually selling TVR or taking it public, but
regards both as a distant prospect.
'Taking it public would certainly be an exciting gamble. But then I suppose
you'd have to have all those glib-talking finance directors  ..'

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Manweb's canteen meeting cuts costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANWEB, the electricity supply company serving Merseyside, west Cheshire and
north Wales, yesterday cut the costs of its annual meeting by holding it in
the staff canteen at its headquarters in Chester.
The Pounds 250,000 bill is a 37.5 per cent saving on the Pounds 400,000 for
last year's event, held in a large marquee on Chester racecourse. Displaced
staff were provided with 'airline' meals to eat at their desks.
And there should be further economies, as Mr Bryan Weston, chairman,
explained to complaining shareholders. An Pounds 85,000 tailor-made, lean-to
tent, clipped to the side of the building to provide a reception area,
should be re-usable for about 10 years and could possibly be hired out.
About 750 people attended last year, nevertheless the company was worried
there might not be room for reporters, so decided not to invite any. This
year it countered suggestions that this was a bar on the press - following
niggling questions last year on the chairman's salary - by letting in any
who turned up, provided they agreed to sacrifice their seat to a shareholder
if required.
With only 437 shareholders present, in a canteen which holds 1,000, this
proved unnecessary.
The chairman and male directors demonstrated their 'coats off' commitment by
conducting the meeting in their shirtsleeves. Mr Weston, was soon challenged
on his 37 per cent increase in pay and perks to Pounds 214,000 last year.
This was described as 'obscene' and 'a crime' in the present economic
climate but was vigorously defended by Mr Eryl Morris, a member of
Courtaulds' main board, who is also a non-executive director of Manweb and
chairman of its remuneration committee.
After a bilingual greeting of 'Bora da and good morning' to emphasise
Manweb's role in supplying most of the world's Welsh speakers with
electricity, Mr Morris said earnings per share had risen by 71 per cent, so
the directors had earned their bonuses.
Salary increases had enabled Manweb to recruit two new top-class executive
directors, he added, but the rises had been a one-off adjustment. The
directors were getting only 5.5 per cent, the same as the staff, this year.
He did not reveal whether they would be eating airline lunches yesterday.

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALL eyes in Brazil are on Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister,
to see if he can withstand increasing pressure to relax the government
austerity policy in order to win political support for beleaguered President
Fernando Collor.
Mr Moreira continues to insist that he will neither quit nor abandon the
government's tight monetary policy, despite pleas from Mr Collor's political
allies in the Liberal Front (PFL) that money is needed for social projects
to secure congressional votes to withstand an expected impeachment process
against the president.
'I can open the coffers but there's nothing in them,' he says.
Speculation is increasing over his possible departure as a result of
mounting criticism from PFL members of the recessionary effects and lack of
positive results of the economic programme.
The most serious attack came from Mr Collor's most important backer, Mr
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the governor of Bahia and PFL leader.
'This marriage between high inflation and deep recession is not working,' he
said. 'What brings down a minister is not a political party but constant
inflation of 20 per cent. If Marcilio falls it will be because of the poor
results of economic policy.'
The supreme council of the powerful Sao Paulo Federation of Industries is
also preparing to ask the government to reduce interest rates and delay the
timetable of reduction of import tariffs.
But the majority of the financial community both inside and outside Brazil
is highly nervous about the effects of a change in policy or the replacement
of Mr Moreira, fearing this could result in hyperinflation and a collapse of
the accord with the IMF.
The central bank has been intervening heavily in the market to prevent the
cruzeiro falling too much against the dollar and Brazilian debt on the
secondary markets has fallen to 30.6 cents.
For the time being Mr Collor is managing to contain both the PFL pleas and
Mr Moreira's resistance to a change in policy. However, political pressures
will mount as the congressional inquiry into corruption comes to an end on
August 26, after which an impeachment process is expected to begin.

FT  07 AUG 92 / President promises to take off gloves soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush promised yesterday to 'fight tough but fight fair' to
retain the White House against Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic party
nominee.
He told a conservative audience in Colorado Springs that perhaps he had been
'a little slow' in the campaign so far to the point that the election has
seemed 'a little one-sided'.
Complaining that Mr Clinton, whom Mr Bush still tries not to mention by
name, criticises him every five seconds, the president said the gloves would
be off after the Republican convention in Houston the week after next. 'I am
tired of being slugged by these people,' he asserted.
His pugnacity was well received, as similar performances before Catholic and
veterans' organisations had been a day earlier in New York and Nevada. But
in both cases he told his audiences what they wanted to hear - respectively
that abortion was wrong and that there was no substitute for a strong
defence.
But the wider American public still seems unimpressed. The latest national
opinion poll, compiled for the Washington Post and ABC News, has Mr Bush's
approval rating down to 33 per cent, a 5 point drop in a month, while an
earlier Gallup poll for CNN had him at an all-time low of 29 per cent, a
depth from which no incumbent president has recovered to win re-election.
Both surveys suggest Mr Clinton's lead has not narrowed since his party's
convention in New York last month. This contrasts with 1988, when Mr Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, lost half his 17 point post-convention
edge within two weeks.
His determination notwithstanding, this has also been a difficult week for
Mr Bush, first because he had to disown a savagely worded attack on Mr
Clinton by his political director and, second, because of new criticisms
that he was not doing enough to stop the slaughter in Bosnia.
Additionally, the Washington Post speculated yesterday that when Mr James
Baker, the secretary of state, takes over the White House and the campaign
later this month there will be a wholesale house cleaning of the present
re-election team.
This assumes that Mr Baker will come back, on which no announcement has yet
been made, and that he will bring with him his inner circle from the state
department, most of whom worked on the 1988 Bush campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CLARK CLIFFORD, the former US defence secretary, who was charged last
month over the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, has been
accused by a New York prosecutor of trying to manipulate the US judicial
system.
The accusation by a deputy to Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, came in a New York court hearing that set an October 22 trial for
Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his partner.
The two men were charged in New York on July 29 on charges of bribe-taking,
conspiracy and a scheme to commit fraud, related to their dealings with BCCI
during the 1980s.
Both were also charged in Washington of allegedly lying to federal banking
regulators about their knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First
American Bankshares, a Washington bank they ran during the 1980s.
The New York trial date is important because a Washington judge had earlier
set October 26 as the date of the Washington trial of Mr Clifford and Mr
Altman. That trial may now have to be postponed.
Mr John Moscow, the chief prosecutor for Mr Morgenthau's office, told a New
York judge that the 85-year-old Mr Clifford and his lawyers were trying to
manipulate the judicial system by seeking a Washington trial first.
Mr Moscow said yesterday the New York charges were much broader and more
serious and noted that if a Washington trial went ahead first Mr Clifford
might have been able to avoid facing the New York charges because of double
jeopardy provisions in New York state law.
Mr Clifford's lawyers had argued for a speedy trial on the grounds of health
but in court they denied Mr Moscow's claim that in doing so they were trying
to manipulate the judicial system.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government said yesterday it was making ADollars 181m (Pounds
71m) immediately available for a railway project designed to create 12,000
direct and indirect jobs over the next two years.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the spending was the first stage of a
ADollars 454m national rail network programme. Release of the funds
coincided with figures showing unemployment for July stood at 11 per cent,
only marginally lower than June's record 11.1 per cent.
A national rail network was a key element of Mr Keating's economic statement
in February. This allocated Dollars 2.3bn over two years to boost the
economy and cut unemployment to less than 10 per cent by the next general
election, in mid-1993.
Australia's railways are fragmented by different state systems and track
sizes, making inter-state rail inefficient. Mr Keating's programme aims at a
uniform-gauge track linking mainland state capitals.
The programme also intends to set up a National Railway Corporation, which
would control inter-state rail freight operations.
The government had hoped the Dollars 2.3bn economic boost would lead to a
4.75 per cent growth in 1992-3. However, it has conceded this will not be
achieved and that growth of less than 4 per cent is a more realistic target.
Growth in 1991-2 is expected to be about 2 per cent.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Japan fails to kick the export habit: The country's current
account surplus is soaring again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VERY large current account surplus has returned to haunt the Japanese
government. After sharp falls in the late 1980s, the surplus this year is
set to surpass the record Dollars 87bn in 1987 and to intensify
international pressure on Japan to prove that its markets are genuinely
open.
The sharp appreciation of the yen after the Plaza Accord in 1985 was
supposed to have blunted the surplus, as was investment abroad by leading
exporters such the electronics and car industries. But a slowdown in the
domestic economy has weakened demand for imports and encouraged
manufacturers to export, enlarging the surplus to its old, daunting size.
In the first half of this year, it rose by 94 per cent to Dollars 56.2bn,
and while the sheer size of the figure suggests that nothing much has
changed from the mid-1980s, there are differences. Instead of selling the
whole product, companies are exporting components to new factories abroad,
and east Asia has replaced north America as Japan's most important market.
However, these patterns have not lessened trade tension with the European
Community and the US, rather they have created new frictions with Asian
trading partners and have placed further pressure on the Japanese government
to show there are no 'structural impediments' to imports.
When the Japanese economy expanded rapidly in the late 1980s, the current
account surplus fell in tandem. After the customs-cleared trade surplus
reached Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, the figure declined to Dollars 77.5bn in
1988 and to Dollars 52.1bn in 1990.
The government claimed credit for orchestrating the fall and even expressed
concern that the surplus, regarded as an important measure of economic
strength, was disappearing too quickly. But just as the 'bubble' economy
grossly inflated land and stock prices, so the decline in the surplus was
exaggerated.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), admits the 'adjustment
process' was distorted in the late 1980s, and that some manufacturers
misread their markets. 'We can say that some companies invested too much in
new capacity,' he says.
Adjustment was distorted by unsustainable imports of luxury goods, including
French impressionist paintings and European cars, and by manufacturers
presuming that a hungry domestic market would become even hungrier. In
addition, rapid growth in overseas travel helped reduce the current account
surplus.
The cycle ended as the Tokyo stock market peaked in December 1989, the
official end of the easy money era. In the first half this year, European
car imports were down 4 per cent year-on-year, after a 23.4 per cent fall
last year, and art imports were down 65 per cent. A current account surplus
equivalent to 1.1 per cent of gross national product in fiscal 1990 rose to
2.6 per cent in 1991.
Another important factor is that Japan's imports are heavily weighted
towards raw materials, partly-processed materials or low value-added goods.
In the first six months, machinery of all kinds accounted for only 18.8 per
cent of the import total, while foodstuffs, raw materials and fuels amounted
to 49.6 per cent.
While imports remain low value-added, Japanese exporters have continued to
add value to their products. In the first half, the volume of car exports
rose 2 per cent but their value rose by 14 per cent. And as the economy
idles, inventories are rising, capacity utilisation is falling, and
manufacturers have good reason to turn to export markets.
At the same time, foreign producers attempting to expand market share face
increased competition and cut-throat pricing in the overcrowded domestic
market. Semiconductors provide a good example - the foreign share of Japan's
semiconductor market has stalled at around 14 per cent, while Japanese
producers increased their chip exports by 16 per cent in June.
Under a US-Japan semi-conductor pact, the foreign share is supposed to be 20
per cent by the end of the year. The US trade representative recently
concluded that there had not been 'sufficient progress' and that action
might be taken against Japan.
The Japanese government fears that this and other disputes will force the
Bush administration to take tougher action in the lead-up to the US
presidential election. Japan's exports to the US rose 5.3 per cent in the
first half and imports from the US fell 1.7 per cent - the deficit with
Japan accounted for 62 per cent of the total US deficit in May and for 74
per cent of the April deficit.
Meanwhile, the European Commission, annoyed by a similar increase in the
Japanese surplus with the EC over the past year, wants talks on removing
'structural impediments' to trade. The demand echoes the US-Japan Structural
Impediments Initiative and reflects concerns that the Japanese market is
restricted by the country's corporate culture.
Realising that stimulating the domestic market could solve some of these
problems, Tokyo has promised to deliver a supplementary budget this month,
while companies are being quietly cautioned against flooding foreign markets
with products that cannot be sold at home.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S week of protest, to force an early transition to majority
rule, appeared to be winding down yesterday.
Marches and sit-ins continued in several cities and towns; thousands of
workers in Port Elizabeth occupied office blocks and shops, while in
Pietermaritzburg about 400 taxis clogged the city's roads. Further
demonstrations are planned today.
But the campaign seems to have peaked at Wednesday's rally in Pretoria,
attended by more than 50,000 supporters of the African National Congress
(ANC).
There was speculation yesterday about an early resumption of constitutional
talks, after comments by President F W de Klerk on Wednesday night. He said
at an informal press conference that 'we are moving to the resumption of
negotiations', and confirmed that discussions between the government and the
ANC on 'specific issues' had been taking place over the past five days. He
did not elaborate. It is known that one of the subjects discussed was the
release of about 350 political prisoners.
'We need to broaden the discussion to include other issues,' Mr de Klerk
added. 'I look forward to the day when Mr (Nelson) Mandela will once again
see me in my office.'
At least two armed white men dressed in camouflage uniforms were among
attackers in the June 17 Boipatong massacre, according to a witness who
testified yesterday before the Goldstone judicial commission of inquiry into
political violence.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Philippines plans Eurobond launch: Two US banks already in
discussions
</HEADLINE>

   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING completion of its commercial debt rescheduling package last month,
the Philippines is planning to return to the international financial markets
for the first time since the debt crisis of the 1980s.
Two US banks, Chase Investment and J P Morgan Securities, are already in
discussions with the authorities in Manila about a potential Dollars 100m
(Pounds 52.3m) offering of Eurobonds, which could be launched as early as
next month.
Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, told a news conference: 'We think
this is a logical step, and then hopefully after the national government has
taken that step, private corporations. . . can also begin to take the plunge
back into the voluntary financial market.'
The terms of the bond issue were still being worked out, he added.
Analysts believe the offering is feasible, not only because of the debt
rescheduling but because of renewed confidence in the country's future under
the newly elected administration of Mr Fidel Ramos.
'I don't think you could have talked about the country's return to
international markets six months ago,' said Ms Joyce Chang, vice-president
of emerging markets at Salomon Brothers in New York. 'There is a positive
feeling both internationally and domestically about prospects for the new
government.'
The country's secondary market debt, which was trading at about 49 cents in
the dollar prior to the election, is now quoted at 58 cents in the dollar.
However, she cautioned that a number of difficult measures had still to be
taken by the government.
The Philippines' return to the international capital markets would follow
rehabilitation of Latin American countries such as Mexico and Brazil, after
a long absence following the 1980s' debt crisis. The Philippines' financial
crisis began in 1983 when the central bank's gross reserves plunged to
dangerously low levels, prompting a unilateral debt moratorium.
The Dollars 100m Eurobond is expected to be issued through a state bank or
agency, such as the National Development Bank, and to have a short life of
two or three years.
According to bankers, Manila would have to pay interest of about 3 1/2
percentage points more than the yield on the comparable US Treasury note.
The Philippines 'would be hard put to justify a finer spread than Argentina
or Venezuela,' said Mr Paul Luke, head of research at Morgan Grenfell in
London, which paid around that level for recent debt offerings.
Philippine officials are supporting moves to encourage the entry of foreign
banks, adds Jose Galang in Manila.
Under a proposed bill the banks would be allowed entry as full-service
branches, wholly owned subsidiaries, or as 70 per cent equity partners with
domestic banks. The policy-making Monetary Board, of which Mr del Rosario
and the governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines are members, has
endorsed the bill.
The timetable for introduction of the proposals has not been disclosed but
officials have said it would be a priority. Opposition from domestic
commercial banks had derailed plans by previous governments to allow the
entry of foreign institutions. However, many of the 24 domestic banks have
foreign investors as minority partners.
There are four branches of foreign banks operating in the Philippines -
Citibank, Bank of America, Hongkong and Shanghai, and Standard Chartered.

FT  07 AUG 92 / UK looks at safe havens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is reviewing the possibility of creating safe havens for civilians
and refugees in Yugoslavia, Mr John Major, the prime minister, revealed
yesterday.
But he also made clear that the creation of havens, which won Mr Major
praise as a successful personal initiative for the Kurds in Iraq, could have
serious drawbacks in the different circumstances of the conflict in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'A real problem is how to avoid precipitating a further outflow (of
refugees) and thereby risk colluding in Serbian ethnic cleansing,' Mr Major
warned.
The safe havens option was raised in a letter to Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democrat party, who had criticised the government for inaction
over the Yugoslav crisis.
Mr Major rejected the inaction charge, pointing to RAF airlifts, increased
humanitarian aid, the London conference scheduled for the end of this month
and the visit of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to the region.
'This is hardly sitting on our hands,' he said.
Claiming Mr Ashdown had misrepresented Britain's position on refugees, he
pointed out that the UK was the only EC country that had no visa requirement
for nationals of the former Yugoslavia.
Some 4,000 a month had entered the country since the crisis began and 'no
one from a conflict area' would be forced to return. But the UK believed the
best solution to the refugee problem was for people to remain as near as
possible to their place of origin, where relief and medical supplies as well
as shelter and protection were available,

ABBEY NATIONAL has sent letters to 16,000 solicitors this week telling them
that they must allow the bank access to files about their clients when
necessary.
The move is part of a drive to halt rising levels of mortgage fraud, and
Abbey National said it had already received letters from about 4,000
solicitors agreeing to the conditions. To date there have been no refusals.
It is thought to be the first time a mortgage lender has told solicitors
that it wants to be able to check borrowers' details before a house sale
takes place.
Abbey National said: 'We shall not be asking for any personal information.
The inquiries will be strictly limited to information relating to the house
sale and in particular to ensuring that a potential borrower is the person
that they say they are.'

BRITISH Telecommunications and Motorola, the US communications and

Users of the PCs will be able to talk to each other and see each other on
their screens and to 'window swap' - send data and images to each other.
BT is already working with IBM to develop PCs with fully integrated
video-conferencing units. The units will cost between Pounds 3,500 and
Pounds 4,000. Add-on kits that will transform an ordinary PC into a
video-conferencing unit will also be about Pounds 3,000.
The more advanced BT-Motorola model due out in two years and its add-on
card, however, are expected to be available for less than Pounds 1,000.

FT  07 AUG 92 / TV gains access to Scots courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH courts are to become the first in the UK to admit television
cameras, it was announced yesterday. Lord Hope, the Lord President, who is
head of the Scottish judiciary, yesterday said he was in favour of TV
cameras covering criminal and civil appeal hearings.
The historic decision was welcomed by advocates and solicitors in Scotland,
and by broadcasting organisations. In London, the Bar Council  - the
barristers' ruling body - said the decision should be emulated in England
and Wales.
Lord Hope said the introduction of television cameras would require
'detailed investigation and experiment', and no date could be given for when
it would begin. Scotland has a separate legal system from that of England
and Wales, where a law of 1925 bans photography in court.
Lord Hope said it was likely that court proceedings could be televised
'without undue interference'. Parliament was televised and there was
'sufficient support within the judiciary and the legal profession in
Scotland' for the introduction of TV cameras.
Under Lord Hope's decision, neither criminal nor civil trials may be
televised while they are in progress because of 'risks to the administration
of justice'. But they may be filmed for later broadcast for documentary and
educational purposes, provided all parties agreed and the presiding judge
approved the final product before it was broadcast.
The televising of appeal hearings would be subject to the approval of the
presiding judge.
Ceremonies in courtrooms could be televised and pictures of judges would be
allowed for archive purposes, but without sound.
Lord Hope said it was in the public interest that people should know how
justice was administered.
TV cameras are allowed in criminal trials in the US.
In 1989, the English Bar Council recommended that pilot projects of
televising courts be introduced and sponsored a private member's bill that
would have amended the law accordingly.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Scrapping of 'needless' audits urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of thousands of small companies should be freed from the
requirement to be audited, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales said yesterday.
In a consultative document submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Inland Revenue, the institute called for an end to compulsory audits
for more than 250,000 companies with turnover of less than Pounds 36,600,
the threshold for registration for value added tax.
It said companies with turnover of less than Pounds 300,000 a year should
also be exempt from auditing on a unanimous vote from their shareholders,
although no regulated businesses or other 'public interest' companies should
be exempted.
Mr Chris Swinson, chairman of the institute's financial reporting and
auditing group, said many people viewed statutory auditing as a 'needless
and expensive burden for smaller companies'.
He estimated that abolishing the audit could reduce a small company's
payments to its accountant by 20 per cent to 50 per cent. There might be a
case, he said, for requiring a qualified accountant to sign a 'compilation
report' - short of a full audit - on the preparation of the accounts.
The debate over auditing of small companies was rekindled this year when Mr
John Redwood, then minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade
and Industry, indicated that he was considering the case for abolition.
The views of the institute, which represents 100,000 chartered accountants
and helps to regulate the majority of registered auditors, are shared by a
growing number of other bodies, including the Chartered Institute of
Management Accountants.
The Inland Revenue and other government departments have opposed the removal
of the audit because of concerns about the reliability of published
financial information without some independent verification.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which includes about
3,000 registered auditors among its members, has been a consistent opponent.
It argues that the audit is a cost that accompanies the privileges of
incorporation.
Mr Swinson emphasised that there would still be the requirement for the
directors of limited-liability companies to file accurate accounts at
Companies House.

FT  07 AUG 92 / People: Hartstone's Alan Cohen retires at 47
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hartstone, the acquisitive leather goods and hosiery company that has
recently provoked some market uncertainty with its rapid growth, said
yesterday that Alan Cohen, chief executive of the European leather goods
division, is retiring. He is 47.
Chairman Stephen Barker, who was previously boss of Albert Fisher before
turning to tights and leather, says Cohen - whose family leather goods
business Symphony International was bought by Hartstone for around Pounds
10m in 1989 - wishes to take a 'lower profile'. Cohen has built up the
European division to sales of around Pounds 40m, and had already handed over
the UK side - which forms the bulk of that division at present - to Jeffrey
Nash six months ago.
Barker added that Cohen's wishes suited the company's restructuring plans,
according to which Trevor Brentnall, 45, chief executive of the North
American leather goods operation, assumes responsibility for those products
worldwide.
Brentnall, previously a partner with City solicitors Turner Kenneth Brown
before he joined Hartstone in 1990, is reckoned to have done a good job in
starting the integration of last year's two big US acquisitions, Michael
Stevens and Etienne Aigner.
'As companies grow, so the management structure evolves,' explains Barker.
Cohen, with his father, built up Symphony over a period of 20 years; he will
now act as a consultant for Hartstone on the organic development of its
leather goods business across continental Europe in what Barker calls 'a
fairly full capacity for at least a year'. Cohen is on holiday and was
unavailable for comment.
The other piece in Barker's new management jigsaw is American Robert Chavez,
who was president of merchandising for the East Coast division of R H Macy,
the large US department store which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
January. He joins as ceo of Etienne Aigner which needs more attention than
the fast-growing Michael Stevens. 'We have been courting him for the past
six months and he has eventually decided to join us,' says Barker of Chavez.

NatWest has recruited a seasoned hand to manage its newly formed life
insurance subsidiary, National Westminster Life Assurance. Peter Baxter,
currently head of marketing with Lloyds Abbey Life, will take charge of the
new subsidiary from September 1.
Baxter will be heading a new joint venture which will be capitalised at
about Pounds 150m and of which 92.5 per cent will be owned by NatWest. The
products will be NatWest's own brand and cover three core areas; life
assurance including mortgage-related products, pensions and long-term
savings products.
NatWest, which had been the UK's largest purveyor of independent financial
advice, stunned the industry last year when it announced it was forming a
'tie' with Clerical Medical under which it would sell that company's
products exclusively. Financial Services Act rules require those who sell
financial products such as life insurance either to be independent and
recommend the best of all producers' products or to sell the products of a
single firm.

Aiglon Ltd and L'Aiglon SA v Gau Shan Company Ltd
(FT, June 26)
GRANTING AN application by the plaintiffs to set a side a Mareva injunction,
as well as an order for disclosure of assets, which the defendant had
obtained, Mr Justice Hirst stated that the litigation had arisen out of an
award of the technical appeal committee of the Liverpool Cotton Association
in favour of the first plaintiff, an English company and the second
plaintiff, a Swiss company.
The award was against both companies and stated that the sellers 'are in
fact Aiglon Ltd. For the purpose of this appeal there is no real distinction
between the two companies'. It was submitted that by no stretch of the
imagination could the appeal committee have had jurisdiction to determine
whether SA were party to the sale contract, so that the award against SA on
the footing that they were contractually subject to the arbitration was a
nullity (Duke of Buccleuch (1870) 5 Exch Cas 221).
It was common ground that the arbitrators had exceeded their jurisdiction in
deciding that SA were party to the contract. That part of their award was a
nullity. There was therefore no award to enforce so far as SA were
concerned, and it was no part of the court's function under section 26 to
salvage it by considering the issue as to who was party to the contract.
Aiglon Ltd and another v Gau Shan &amp; Co Ltd
Gau Shan &amp; Co Ltd v Aiglon Ltd and others (FT, July 1)
FURTHER TO the decision of the court (as reported above), the defendant now
applied to extend the Mareva and ancillary order on entirely fresh grounds,
including a claim against SA under section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Section 423(2) of the 1986 Act provided that where a person entered into a
transaction at an undervalue, the court might make an order 'restoring the
position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into'.
The evidence demonstrated a strong case showing that Ltd had entered into a
transaction with SA offending against section 423, alleging that assets had
been put out of Gau Shan's reach, apparently at an undervalue, by transfers
to SA at a time when the arbitration award had been made.
Mr Justice Hirst stated that a good arguable case had been established, on
the footing that there was credible evidence that SA's assets might in part
be the assets of Ltd which had, as a result of the asset-stripping
operation, put it out of its power to meet the arbitration award - so that
an injunction against Ltd alone was likely to be inadequate to protect Gau
Shan.
Those conclusions provided a firm basis for continuing the Mareva
injunction, subject to the court's overriding dis-cretion.
Securities and Investments Board v Pantell (FT, July 2)
SOLICITORS, AS third, fourth and fifth defendants appealed from a decision
in which the vice-chancellor had refused to strike out a claim against them
in an action by the Securities and Investments Board against Pantell SA and
others.
Dismissing the appeal, on the alleged facts for the purposes of the
striking-out application, the Court of Appeal stated that Pantell had
distributed misleading advertisements and had carried on unauthorised
investment business in the UK in contravention of the Financial Services Act
1986.
The solicitors had acted for Pantell, and the SIB had sought a remedy
against them under section 6(2) of the act in that they had been knowingly
concerned in the contravention by Pantell. The fact that a person 'knowingly
concerned' had not received anything under the transaction did not restrict
the court's power to make a section 6(2) order against him, the appeal court
stated.
Kirklees Borough Council v Wickes Building Supplies Ltd (FT, July 3)
SECTION 71(1) of the Shops Act 1950 provided that it was the duty of every
local authority to enforce the provisions of the act 'and for that purpose
to institute and carry on such proceedings in respect of contraventions as
may be necessary to secure observance thereof'. Section 222 of the Local
Government Act 1972 provided that local authorities 'in the case of civil
proceedings, may institute them in their own name'.
In an endeavour to deter large stores from opening for Sunday trading in
contravention of section 47 of the act, the local authorities had sought
injunctions to restrain stores from infringing the section. The stores
invoked EC law that section 47 was inconsistent with Article 30 of the
European Community Treaty.
At first instance, the judge had held that he had discretion whether to
require the local authority to give an undertaking in damages but decided
against that requirement.
The Court of Appeal reversed his decision. In allowing the local authority's
appeal to the House of Lords, Lord Goff stated that the question whether
section 47 was inconsistent with article 30 had been referred to the
European Court of Justice.
If the European Court should hold that section 47 was invalid as being in
conflict with article 30, the UK might be obliged to make good damage caused
to individuals by the breach of article 30 for which it was responsible. It
did not follow, however, that the council should be obliged to give an
undertaking in damages as a condition of the grant of an injunction.
Zucker and others v Tyndall Holdings plc (FT, July 8)
THE APPELLANTS had validly exercised an option to sell their shares in a
three-month period due to expire on June 24 1992. In March 1992 they issued
a writ for specific performance and obtained an ex parte Mareva order.
The judge at first instance concluded that the court had no jurisdiction to
grant a Mareva injunction in the circumstances.
Dismissing the appellants' appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that as the
law stood at present, for the purpose of a Mareva injunction, it was
necessary to demonstrate that a legal or equitable right had been interfered
with or invaded, or such an invasion or interference was threatened. Though
interlocutory relief could be obtained in certain circumstances to protect
an equitable interest even before the time for performance under a contract
had arisen, on the facts of the present case it was not open to the court to
grant an injunction.
The Wondrous (FT, July 9)
THE SHIPOWNERS were covered under a loss of hire policy for 'war loss of
hire and/or earnings'. By clause 1.2 of the hulls clauses the insurance
covered loss to the vessel caused by 'seizure, arrest, restraint or
consequences thereof'. By clause 4.1.5, however, it excluded 'arrest,
restraint, detainment . . . by reason of infringement of any customs or
trading regulations'.
The shipowners contended unsuccessfully at first instance that they could
claim under the policy when the vessel was prevented from earning hire in
consequence of being 'detained' within the meaning of clause 1.2.
The judge had found that the immediate cause of the detention was failure to
comply with local custom laws. He referred to 'detention' in the conditional
sense that if the vessel had tried to leave before paying port dues it would
have been forcibly detained. In that sense only was it being detained.
As to the furnishing of the foreign currency guarantee by the exporter, the
judge found that if the owners had been prepared to put up the foreign
exchange, the port authorities would have been satisfied.
As to clause 4.1.5, the judge held that the exclusion of loss arising from
restraint or detainment 'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations
applied. The judge said 'restraint' and 'detainment' had to be given a wide
commercial interpretation, and in a commercial sense the vessel was detained
'by reason of infringement' of customs regulations.
The Court of Appeal dismissed the owners' appeal on the grounds that the
judge's reasoning could not be impeached.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Technology: Signed, sealed and delivered - British
Entrepreneurs / An adventurous couple have capitalised on a simple idea
</HEADLINE>

ENCRYPTA Electronics needs to update its stationery again. The Welsh
developer of 'electronic seals', devices used to ensure the security of
goods in transit, has another award to add to a masthead that already lists
several honours garnered over the past six years for innovation and business
achievements.
The latest accolade for this small family-run business comes from the
British government's Department of Trade and Industry. The Welsh Development
Agency (WDA) has also sponsored Encrypta, taking a 12.5 per cent equity
stake in the company.
Encrypta has been promoted by the WDA as a model for how the government
agency can help to nurture high-technology start-up companies in
economically depressed 'development areas'.
In addition to venture funding and grants, the WDA lent credibility to the
fledgling enterprise and 'opened doors' says Mark Hayward, who founded
Encrypta with his wife Pippa eight years ago. Practical help was also
available. Pippa Hayward recalls WDA officials helping her to locate
premises for the company - although she ultimately turned down their
suggestions of conventional commercial premises in favour of a Victorian
mansion in rural Caerleon, near Newport, that now accommodates their
business offices and a basement workshop as well as their family home.
Despite WDA 'handholding' the Haywards have had to struggle with some
serious setbacks over the years. The success of the fledgling enterprise,
which now has an annual turnover of about Pounds 750,000 and profit margins
of 10-12 per cent, is as much a tribute to their personal determination as
to government sponsorship.
Indeed, the first time the Haywards approached the WDA for financial support
they were turned down. 'I had been involved in a frozen pizza company in the
1970s that went bust,' Mark Hayward explains, noting that American venture
capitalists might have viewed his failed attempt at business development
more positively.
The WDA was more receptive, however, when the Haywards returned with orders
for their first product from British retailers Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare
and Iceland Frozen Foods.
Encrypta's story began in 1984, when Mark Hayward, then a buyer for Marks &amp;
Spencer, became aware of a problem that the company faced with pilferage of
goods in transit. The numbered plastic and metal strips, or 'seals' used to
prevent unauthorised access to the backs of lorries, were proving to be
inadequate security devices.
He turned to his father, a retired electrical and mechanical engineer who
had worked on deciphering German codes during the Second World War, to come
up with a high-tech alternative.
The result was a simple, but seemingly effective, solution; a random number
generator that is triggered every time the device is removed from the back
of the lorry.
After patenting the device, the Haywards initially attempted to license it
to established seal manufacturers. When this failed they began to consider
setting up their own company. Investing a few hundred pounds they
participated in a trade show in London and were overwhelmed with the
response they received from retailers.
Presented with evidence that there was a market for their prototype product,
they set about finding designers and manufacturing contractors. Still,
leaving 'a good job with a nice salary and a company car' was a wrench for
Mark Hayward.
Almost immediately, disaster struck. The first production units of the
electronic seal began to fail. While struggling to find the cause of the
problem, Mark Hayward assured customers that Encrypta would replace the
units.
'That was when we learned about testing,' says Pippa Hayward ruefully. It
was at this point that the Haywards turned to the WDA for equity funding.
With Pounds 100,000 in the bank they set about redesigning the product and
replacing failed units. 'We didn't lose any customers,' Mark Hayward boasts.
'Customer relations are a key issue in our business,' Pippa Hayward
interjects. 'We pride ourselves in keeping close to our customers.'
Even so, Encrypta's credibility was sorely tested when only a few months
later the redesigned products began to fail. 'It was depressing. We were
getting failed units arriving here at the rate of 20-30 per week,' they
recall. 'And this was after we had done all the testing.'
The problem turned out to be battery failure, initially denied by Encrypta's
supplier. After threatening to sue, Encrypta won an out-of-court settlement
that paid for replacements.
After eight years in business, Encrypta now has four products including a
version of its Crypta electronic seal that stores data on the last 50 times
that a vehicle's cargo hold has been opened. This can be downloaded on to a
portable computer, providing fleet management information as well as a data
trail that has been used to catch more than one thief.
Some 40 per cent of Encrypta's sales are outside the UK, in the US, Europe
and the Far East. To date, Encrypta has no competitors, although the
Haywards suspect that other companies will enter the field as the potential
scope of the market for electronic seals emerges. Although they are coy
about details, the couple is currently in the final stages of testing a new
product for applications outside the transport field.
'We are going to step on some toes and steal markets,' says Pippa. Uppermost
in the Haywards' minds today, however, is the dilemma that faces many small
businesses; whether to seek additional financing to expand their business.
To do so would necessitate a move to larger premises and the end of their
cozy 'work at home' arrangement. They would also be faced with management
challenges and the need to take on more staff and are pondering whether to
set up their own manufacturing operation, rather than sub-contracting
production as they currently do.
The Haywards' ambition is to build Encrypta into a Pounds 5m company with
annual profits of around Pounds 1.5m over the next two or three years, but
they face some resistance from board members, they acknowledge.
'The question is how do we take this forward,' says Mark Hayward. Turning
again to the WDA for financial support, the Haywards have brought in
business consultants to undertake a review of their operations and
prospects.
'We are hoping something radical will come out of it,' says Mark Hayward.
Although they are being careful not to 'direct' the consultants, they hope
that the analysis will result in a plan for expansion.
This may mean selling equity to venture capitalists, and might even involve
the appointment of more seasoned management, or in the long term the sale of
the company, the Haywards acknowledge. 'We are not in this just to build a
nice little business,' says Mark Hayward. 'You cannot stand still.'
Despite all of the efforts that the Haywards have put into Encrypta, this
entrepreneurial couple claim that they would have few qualms about moving
on. 'We are good at kindling fires. It may take somebody else to build it
up.'
If the Haywards were to start another business venture, would they again
locate in Wales? They note that they have been able to find most of the
services and sub- contractors needed by Encrypta in Wales and speak highly
of the assistance of the WDA.
Gazing out of the window of their dining room/ boardroom, watching their
horses grazing in the meadow of the four and a half acre property that
surrounds their home and offices it is difficult to imagine a more idyllic
work setting.
But there is one catch, the Haywards acknowledge - isolation. There are few
entrepreneurs in the region with whom the Haywards can share their
experiences or swap ideas. Regular trips to London help to 'keep your finger
on the pulse' says Mark Hayward. 'And stop you going crazy,' Pippa echoes.
The series will continue next week.

FT  07 AUG 92 / Management: Experience counts as trainees go back to basics
 -Pioneering approach to gaining National Vocational Qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEGARTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until he was made redundant last November, John fitted radios into Jaguar
cars at one of the luxury carmaker's Coventry plants. Now he is back at
Jaguar again - this time as a trainee. John, 45, is one of more than 30
engineering trainees on the Jaguar project, a joint venture between the
carmaker, Coventry and Warwickshire Tec and the local chamber of commerce.
The idea came up at the end of last year after falling sales had forced
Jaguar to make one-third of its 12,000 workforce redundant and suspend its
annual intake of trainees.
That left the company's training workshops empty - and expensive machinery
gathering dust awaiting an economic upturn.
'We were committed to the training centre and wanted to keep the facilities
open and operating,' says Mike Kinski, personnel director.
The local Tec suggested a training partnership to use the empty space, and
with training provided by the Coventry Chamber of Commerce, the Jaguar
project officially opened at the end of April.
It is running two courses, leading to National Vocational Qualifications
(NVQs) in business administration and engineering manufacturing.
To recruit trainees, the company wrote to 1,400 of the workers laid off at
the end of last year, telling them about the training facilities and the
chance to study for NVQs. It says that 193 responded, of whom 73 opted for
the courses after initial counselling. There are currently 20 on the
business administration course and 34 on the engineering course.
Trainees are also referred to the project by the local employment service,
and local miners laid off by British Coal have signed up to learn
engineering skills. John Fitzpatrick, training manager and also a former
Jaguar employee, now runs the project for the chamber of commerce.
He says that at first it was difficult to get trainees on to the engineering
course. 'Some of them have been made redundant three or four times - they're
getting a bit cynical.'
In the computer room, John is finding the word processing program very
different from his previous experience fitting car radios. 'At first I
wondered what I was doing here. It was so different and seemed really hard.
But now I'm starting to get used to it.'
Although he admits to feeling confused at present, he would like to 'get
into something using computers'.
In one of the engineering workshops, Bernard, 50, is learning how to program
machine tools using a computer. A skilled engineer, he was made redundant
from a local company at the end of last year.
Before starting the course in April, he had applied for 40 jobs - only to be
told he was too old. 'I heard about this from a friend who has done it. I
know I'm not too old. I hope with this experience to be able to get into
engineering planning work.'
Fitzpatrick is adamant that the training is not billed as an automatic route
to a job. 'We make it quite clear from the start that we can't guarantee a
job,' he says.
'The whole point is equipping the trainees with skills and knowledge to make
them more marketable.'
Part of the project is pioneering a new approach to gaining NVQs,
specifically targeted at older, experienced workers. Accreditation of Prior
Learning (APL) aims to get away from traditional paper qualifications and
use candidates' previous experience to prove their competence.
The Engineering Training Authority (EnTra) has just launched a national
system of APL for the engineering manufacturing industry and is confident
that APL gives employers and employees the means of assessing experience.
'The whole system of training is moving from being process-based to
output-based - one that recognises standards achieved, not courses
completed,' says EnTra regional manager Ron Law.
Using APL, candidates submit a portfolio of their competence, based on
course certificates, employers' letters or historical records, to qualified
assessors. Depending on the result, they are awarded either the relevant NVQ
or units towards it, or recommended for further training.
The notion of APL seems to be receiving a cautious welcome in the
engineering industry, although there is concern that its emphasis on
individual assessment and tuition may prove too demanding for many employers
or colleges to provide.
Peter Swindlehurst of the Engineering Council says: 'It is a viable
approach, although it's much more easily done when you have a number of
people from one major source going through it together. Individual
institutions might find it very difficult to provide the bespoke training
people need.'
The various levels of competence for the engineering APL are contained in
four thick blue manuals in John Fitzpatrick's office.
He concedes that the system can seem complicated, but adds: 'Once people
understand what APL means they will take it seriously. It gets rid of the
problem for employers of taking on someone who says they can do the job -
then finding they can't'
EnTra is currently testing APL with 16 Tecs around the country. It is
confident that once the pilot projects have 'ironed out the glitches', the
guidelines for engineering, to be issued early next year, will provide a
workable approach to training for the industry.
But what is in it for employees? They may have their skills documented and
be able to complete NVQs more quickly, but unless the APL approach is
recognised - and adopted - across the industry, going through the process is
unlikely to win them better jobs - or, indeed, any job.
Jaguar, however, reports waiting lists for its courses. According to
official figures, Coventry's unemployment rate is currently around 11.2 per
cent.
It remains to be seen whether accrediting redundant workers' skills can
really help them get another job - or whether it is just raising false
hopes.

FT  07 AUG 92 / The Property Market: A mountain of debt - How will banks be
repaid? A look at a revealing report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took more than three years to clear the pile of debt and unlet properties
after the property crash of 1973-74. Mopping up the damage from the current
property slump will take longer.
The predicament facing lenders to the industry may not be as acute as it was
in the 1970s, when it triggered a crisis in the secondary banking sector.
But it is more severe in several respects. The scale of the property debt
mountain, the deepness of the downturn and the impact of economic policies
suggest that recovery will be more drawn out than that following the 1973-74
crash.
The dilemma facing property lenders stems from the heady days between 1985
and early 1991 when loans to the property industry grew at twice the rate as
for the market as a whole. Banks assumed that when their loans matured,
investors would provide the funds to repay the loans.
That assumption has proved mistaken. Banks are being forced to refinance and
roll over loans on a previously unimaginable scale. A report on property
finance by Debenham Tewson Research* - based on interviews with 20 banks
which account for more than half the outstanding property debt in the UK
market - found that up to 75 per cent of some banks' loans have failed to be
repaid on maturity.
The report says that investors have been reluctant to bail out the banks.
'The large influx of debt into commercial property over the last five years
has so radically affected the market structure that, rather than converging,
the debt and equity sectors are polarising . . . Current institutional
preferences are focused on markets unaffected by recent bank lending, thus
leaving bankers in relative isolation to resolve their problems.'
If loans are paid back at their current rate - in the year to May, loans to
the UK property sector fell by Pounds 2bn to Pounds 38.6bn - it will take
more than six years to reduce the burden to a comfortable level - about
Pounds 25bn or 8 per cent of the banks' industrial and commercial loan book.
At first sight, the investors' reluctance to come to the rescue of the banks
is surprising at a time when property is widely considered to be cheap, both
on a historical basis and relative to gilts.
The explanation partially lies with the investors' avoidance of the type of
property held by banks. They know that the banks control a large level of
supply, which could be dumped onto the market if their patience runs out.
'At present there is a stand-off between the banks which control a large
level of supply and are seeking to preserve values, and investors who are
discounting prices because they perceive that the potential supply is so
large,' says Debenham Tewson.
In addition, much of the property on which banks have made loans is unlet,
thus detering investors. Debenham Tewson estimates that Pounds 17bn-Pounds
18bn of the outstanding debt was for speculative development loans. The
banks' tendency to crowd into the same areas of the market (central London
offices) means that many of their buildings are chasing the same limited
supply of tenants.
Investors' are unlikely to repeat their performance of the mid-1970s when
the UK pension funds and life companies bought property enthusiastically.
Take-up has, however, increased, with a growth in institutional net
purchases from a little less than Pounds 600m in 1990 to Pounds 2bn in 1991.
But this trend may not continue in the face of static institutional cash
flow, competition from gilts and a decline in institutional commitment to
property.
Overseas investors will be an increasingly important source of funds. Their
investment of more than Pounds 1.5bn during 1991 was barely half the totals
for 1989 and 1990, but it was from a wider variety of sources and promises
to be more sustained.
The UK corporate sector is another potentially important source of funds.
However this is likely to be limited by the overgeared state of most
companies. The bulk of the Pounds 1.3bn raised on the stock exchange during
1991 by property companies was devoted to repairing damaged balance sheets.
Banks are unlikely to prove a useful source of liquidity. Banks are
'negative' about requests to refinance existing debt held with another bank,
says Debenham. 'To many bankers this was a sign of a borrower whose problems
had got out of control and in search of a lifeline.'
The Debenham report states that banks are expecting a sizeable contraction
of their property loan book, fuelled by problem loans and tightening capital
adequacy requirements. Three-quarters of lenders surveyed have reduced their
potential funds. About a third, overwhelmingly overseas banks, are closing
their property loan book. European banks, chiefly German, are widely seen as
active lenders.
One aspect of the property lending problems that contrasts with that of the
1970s is the relatively small number of receiverships. This is because in
the 1970s the debt was mostly held by secondary banks; this time round
lending is focused on larger and more stable banks, which are unwilling to
put lenders into receivership because of the potential loss of asset value.
That said, it is still not certain that syndicates of banks that made large
collective loans will hold together. Some of the larger banks interviewed by
Debenham feared that as patience reached its limits, syndicates would cave
in.
If the consensus view of banks is correct, there will be a slow upturn. On
this view, it seems likely that the resolution of their problems will be
quicker than many analysts currently predict. As the economy improves, the
supply of desirable property will increase. Banks are also likely to find
innovative solutions to their lending problems, such as debt-for-equity
swaps.
But it seems highly improbable that the problem could be resolved as rapidly
as in the 1970s. High real interest rates are widening the shortfall between
revenue and borrowing costs, increasing the real cost of the debt burden.
During the recovery from the 1970s crash , it was possible to borrow for as
little as 13-14 per cent below inflation. This time round, interest rates
are 7 per cent above inflation, one of the highest levels since the 1945.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, yesterday reported a 26 per
cent fall in second-quarter net income to Pounds 481m (Dollars 918.7m)
excluding inventory gains and losses.
Over the first half, net income measured on the same current cost basis fell
24 per cent to Pounds 1.44bn, on sales down 4 per cent at Pounds 34.43bn.
A second-quarter improvement in upstream profits from a higher crude oil
price was offset by a reduction in downstream margins and further falls in
chemicals as a result of weak economic demand.
The figures included Pounds 216m of non-operating profits, most of which
related to sales of assets and the settlement of tax affairs in the US.
These special gains were only partly offset by foreign exchange currency
losses of Pounds 102m which were also included in the net income figures.
The comparative figures for the second quarter of 1991 were a Pounds 21m
gain from special non-operating profits and a currency gain of Pounds 120m.
Royal Dutch/Shell said these special benefits were exceptionally high and
unlikely to be repeated this year. The group's net income including
inventory gains rose 8 per cent in the second quarter to Pounds 576m and 4
per cent over the first half to Pounds 1.44m.
Royal Dutch's share of group net income in the first half rose from Fl 5.60
per share to Fl 5.71; Shell Transport's share rose from 14.3p to 14.8p per
share. The dividends for the two parent companies will be set on September
10.
Cash flow from operations in the first half fell from Pounds 3.73bn to
Pounds 3.06bn, with the swing arising largely from a sharp increase in
working capital utilised. Capital spending and exploration costs in the
first half fell 17 per cent to Pounds 2.5bn.
The group's share of crude oil production from its own and shared ventures
rose 7 per cent to 2.15m barrels a day while natural gas volumes were 8 per
cent higher at 7.1bn cu ft a day.
In chemicals, group earnings fell from Pounds 101m to Pounds 3m in the first
half with the main losses outside the US and heavy inventory losses in both
quarters.

CAE Industries, a leading international flight-simulator maker, posted lower
first-quarter profit, but a CDollars 35m (USDollars 29.6m) order for Cathay
Pacific will bolster its order-book.
For the June quarter, CAE earned CDollars 5.7m or 5 cents a share, down 15
per cent from CDollars 6.7m, or 7 cents a year earlier, on revenues of
CDollars 240m against CDollars 273m.
The slowdown in world aviation has reduced commercial simulator orders and
revenues will be flat this year, the company said.
Earnings for fiscal 1993 should improve slightly over fiscal 1992, said Mr

THE Rome government pushed a package of anti-Mafia laws through parliament
yesterday after measures to break the gangsters' ties with politicians were
watered down, Reuter reports from Rome.
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato drafted the bill to give police wider powers
after bombs killed two leading judges in Sicily.
The laws, passed by a large majority, allow police to use undercover 'sting'
operations, wiretaps and infiltrators.
The anti-Mafia La Rete group, based in Sicily, protested after the ruling
parties watered down a clause aimed at politicians who trade votes for
promises with the clans.
Opposition from Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, cut the list of
offences down to one - politicians caught paying for votes from gangsters

FT  07 AUG 92 / Kinkel calls for SPD to ease stand on military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Klaus Kinkel, Bonn's foreign minister, yesterday turned a UN request for
more support from Germany into a renewed plea for German military
involvement in the world arena.
'The appeal to Germany from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary general, to take part in a UN rapid reaction force shows how
pressing expectations are,' he said.
The UN leader said in an interview published yesterday that he would welcome
German troops in the UN stand-by force he proposed in a recent report,
Programme for Peace. 'One of my aims is to win more support from Germany,'
he added.
Mr Kinkel called on the Social Democrat (SPD) opposition to give up its
resistance to the constitutional changes needed for Bundeswehr forces to
operate outside the Nato area.
He said he found recent calls from SPD foreign policy experts for Germany to
seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council 'especially interesting'.
Their proposals indicated that the SPD was coming to accept that the
enlarged Germany had increased international responsibilities, and could no
longer stand aside.
However, he added, Germany's voice in the UN could only carry the necessary
authority if the country fulfilled all responsibilities. 'These include
readiness to take part in peace-keeping. . . and peace-making actions under
UN auspices.'
International observers considered Mr Kinkel's reaction 'predictable', a
sign of the newly-appointed minister's frustration, and unlikely to yield
any early results. However, they had detected a change in the government's
tack on the issue of possible membership of the Security Council.
Formerly shrugged off as 'not a priority', the issue, according to Mr
Kinkel, would now be given 'suitable consideration' if raised. The change
follows Japan's declared interest in the event of a reform of the UN
Charter.

THE conservative president of France's Riviera region was charged with fraud
yesterday in the latest of a spate of French corruption scandals, Reuter
reports from Grasse.
Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, the head of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region and
member of the Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF), is accused of
creating a false job in his cabinet for an employee who did not do the work
for which he was paid and abused his position and contacts to peddle
influence.
Mr Gaudin's chief of staff, Claude Bertrand, has also been charged in the
case on three counts of fraud and complicity in peddling influence.
Mr Gaudin said he was innocent and the charges were politically motivated -
the 'last episode' of elections last March which returned him as regional

   LONDON, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the United Nations to stop the fighting in Bosnia mounted
yesterday amid increasing international condemnation of Serbian aggression
in the former Yugoslav republic.
The pressure, fuelled by media reports about detention camps and an
escalation of violence, coincided with the release by the Bosnian government
of the latest casualty figures.
The Bosnians said at least 8,272 people had been killed in the four-month
war following the republic's declaration of independence. At least 1,569
people had died in Sarajevo, where 380,000 people have been besieged by Serb
fighters.
About 35,000 people have been wounded in fighting throughout Bosnia between
mainly Moslems and Croats on one side, and Serbs opposed to independence on
the other, the Bosnian statement added.
The European Community condemned what it called 'repulsive and despicable'
Serb camps used to detain Bosnian civilians in Bosnia.
A statement issued by the British EC presidency demanded that the government
in Belgrade press Serbs in Bosnia to allow international observers, above
all members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, immediate
access to the camps.
In an article in the New York Times, Lady Thatcher, former UK prime
minister, called for military action against Serbia, in an attempt to
influence US policy.
'A clear threat of military action would force Serbia into contemplating an
end to its aggression,' she said. Weapons should be supplied to the Bosnian
government, she added.
In New York, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which groups 46
Moslem countries, pressed the UN Security Council to draw up tougher
measures to stop the forcible deportation of Bosnia's Moslem population.
The OIC wants the UN to exempt Bosnia from an arms embargo. Tehran radio
quoted President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as pledging Iranian co-operation
with other Moslem countries to end the 'savage massacre of innocent and
defenceless Moslems in Bosnia'.
In spite of mounting demands for action, western governments remain
reluctant to respond militarily. President George Bush has ruled out
military intervention unless it has the backing of the UN, and is aimed at
supporting humanitarian relief convoys.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, played down the significance
of Lady Thatcher's remarks. 'They are not new, and they are not secret,' he
said.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, again ruled out military
intervention. 'All the advice I have tells me that we

FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: BT rallies on pricing hints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN BT, Britain's privatised telephone and telecommunications network,
rallied at the close of trading yesterday on sudden hints that the group was
about to accept the recommendations on pricing policy put forward by Oftel,
the regulatory pricing body.
The Oftel regulations were put forward in June, when BT was given the choice
of accepting the terms or risking referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Oftel's proposed new terms set BT's pricing formula at the inflation rate
minus 7 per cent, compared with the present inflation minus 6.25 per cent
which ends in June 1993. The new rate would take over until July 1997.
Acceptance of the Oftel proposals by BT would be welcomed by the stock
market, which would not relish a wholesale inquiry into the telecoms sector,
provoking a situation similar to that faced by British Gas.
'Any MMC inquiry would rebound badly on BT,' says Mr Chris McFadden at Smith
New Court. 'The City has already discounted the cost of the new formula in
the share price, so acceptance would be a positive move.' The shares
finished 2 ahead at 336p.
Standard weak
Banking analysts were yes-terday re-examining forecasts after Standard
Chartered announced a fall in half-year profits to Pounds 64m from the year
ago Pounds 83m. Standard shares, which fell 11 at the start of trading, were
finally 20 down at 420p after 2.3m traded.
The principal disappointment came from India, where the bank has suffered
heavily as a result of exposure to fraud in the Bombay stock market. Ms
Alison Deuchars of Smith New Court said: 'An operation that in a good year
can make Pounds 15m has so far cost Pounds 118m.'
The profits setback was not far from brokerage estimates, although one
analyst said the decline would have been greater if the Pounds 25m taken
from a law suit was stripped out. Smith has kept its profits estimate
unchanged, but is now looking for a flat dividend and believes a yield of 7
per cent, implying an underlying share price around the 380p level, would be
realistic.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has reduced its full-year prediction by Pounds 25m to
Pounds 210m, although the house is said to believe that the situation in
India is already in the share price.
GKN reverse
The effects of better interim figures than expected from GKN, the motor
components and industrial services group, were blunted in the market because
analysts advised taking profits or switching into other stocks.
The shares jumped 17 to 412p at first after the company announced a rise in
half-time profits to Pounds 65.1m, compared with market forecasts of between
Pounds 50m and Pounds 56m.
The advance was halted as several securities houses advised investors to
take profits. At County NatWest, Mr Sandy Morris said: 'At over 400p, the
yield relative is towards the bottom of its ten-year range and it no longer
provides support.'
At Strauss Turnbull, the recommendation was for a switch from GKN to BBA
Group, although the brokerage house raised its full-year forecast for GKN by
Pounds 10m to Pounds 125m. The shares ended 12 down at 383p, while BBA
closed unchanged at 132p.
Properties hit again
Property stocks suffered another savage downgrade as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew cut
its estimates across the sector and sent leading shares tumbling. UBS
reduced asset value forecasts for the next 12 months by an average 9 per
cent and by a further 7 per cent for the year after.
UBS analyst Mr Carl Gough said: 'All the industry data shows rental values
continuing to decline. With signs of GDP recovery disappearing and evidence
that property yields will stay above gilts for the next two years, the
outlook is depressing.'
The brokerage remains a seller of Great Portland Estates, off 6 at 112p, and
Land Securities, 6 cheaper at 377p, but County NatWest reaffirmed its buy
stance on the latter.
Last-minute nerves ahead of British Petroleum's second quarter figures,
scheduled for today, prompted furious trading which left the shares 4 1/2
down at 206 1/2 p, a level believed to be close to a 20-year low when
measured against the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. Turnover was very heavy,
with 23m shares traded in the UK, and the US said to be losing its
enthusiasm.
There is still strong belief that the oil group may halve its dividend and
disclose its first-ever net loss, on a replacement cost basis. Traders were
unwilling to take up positions because of the intense nervousness over the
outlook for the shares this morning.
If there is a hint of optimism from the BP boardroom, the shares could
bounce, perhaps as a result of buying from the US, where negative
perceptions are not quite as pessimistic as in the UK. However, some
analysts feel there is still significant downside. The first impact is
expected at 11.30am when the figures are released.
A rise in half-year profits and dividend for Smith &amp; Nephew helped the
shares. The company also said it expected to maintain solid growth in its
healthcare division. Hoare Govett reiterated its positive stance and the
stock firmed 1 1/4 to 137 3/4 p.
Abbey National was one of the few bright spots as analysts took a more
positive line on the stock following further consideration of Monday's
trading statement. The shares rose 7 to 266p on healthy turnover of 2.4m.
Yorkshire Chemicals declined 7 to 283p after a number of houses, including
BZW and Goldman Sachs, cut profits forecasts. BOC slid a further 7 to 584p
ahead of third quarter figures, due today.
Hotel group Forte remained friendless in a sector unhinged by a wholesale
downgrade by a leading securities house, said to be James Capel. Forte ended
7 lower at 142p after hefty trading of 4.7m.
Market watchers discounted press reports of a tax row with the government as
the reason for the day's rise in P &amp; O, attributing the performance to
bear-closing and increased demand for several transport stocks. The shares
gained 14 to 354p on 1.8m traded.
British Airways was lifted 4 to 259p by news that July traffic rose by 15.2
per cent from the year earlier level.

FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency worries upset share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON stock market growing increasingly nervous over the outlook for the
UK economy and interest rates took a turn for the worse late yesterday
afternoon. The downturn came when sterling extended an earlier loss against
the D-Mark follow-ing the announcement of the latest French opinion poll on
prospects for the Maastricht referendum.
While readings of the French poll by London analysts differed, any threat to
support for the Maastricht treaty is regarded as unsettling for UK interest
rates. London was already nervous ahead of today's meeting of the
Bundesbank's policy council, which has revived concern that interest rates
could be forced higher in Europe.
UK equities moved erratically on the downside throughout the session as
sterling moved lower. Attempts by share prices to rally failed, ultimately
as the pound weakened further in late dealings.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at the day's low of 2,392.8, down
14.7, with the 2,400 mark again abandoned. Worries over the collapse of the
domestic housing market, seen as a key factor in the lack of consumer
confidence behind the woeful state of the UK economy, increased after the
Halifax, Britain's largest building society, reported a further fall in
house prices last month.
Company results, also an important key to stock market confidence at
present, continued to discourage investors. Standard Chartered, the UK-based
bank with substantial overseas operations, disclosed a sharp fall in
first-half profits. GKN, the leading motor industry component supplier,
announced higher interim profits but provided little encouragement for the
near-term outlook. Equity strategists look to company news as the likely
harbinger of a break in the recession in the UK economy.
The Footsie 2,400 level was soon lost and the first attempted rally was
scotched when London caught the hint that Wall Street, which had eased
overnight, would face a brokerage downgrade on IBM when it opened for the
new session. In the event, Wall Street's loss was held to a mere 9.72 Dow
points in London hours, and UK shares rallied until reports of the French
poll crossed the Channel.
Once again, the only saving grace of the UK stock market was the low level
of turnover. Seaq volume totalled an almost derisory 383m shares yesterday.
Tuesday's 466.8m shares was worth Pounds 988.7m in terms of retail, or
customer, business in UK equities.
The official decision to cut interest rates on a range of UK National
Savings products came well after market hours and too late to influence
share prices. From the opening of the trading session, property,
construction and building shares, which have already suffered severely as
bad news has flowed from the property and housing industries, had taken a
further and substantial setback. Retail issues, vulnerable to interest rate
worries, eased.
The stock market is likely to be dominated today by the trading report from
British Petroleum, incorporating the decision on the quarterly dividend
payout.

FT  06 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING IN stock index futures was dull as worries about the outcome of an
opinion poll in France over the Maastricht agreement overhung the market for
most of the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The sombre mood took hold early on, and having opened at 2,410 the September
FT-SE contract retreated to 2,403 by 11.30am as independent traders led the
contract lower ahead of news on the poll. Nerves about the outcome of
today's Bundesbank meeting also added to the general feeling of unease in
the market.
However, a lighter mood combined with a squeeze caused a turnround in the
September future at lunchtime, sending it rising to 2,420.
A weak Wall Street opening and profit-taking saw the contract once again
drift lower, though another squeeze as independent traders went short
ensured the contract closed above the day's worst.
September ended at 2,415, down 3 from Tuesday's finish but around 10 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover at
5,259 lots was poor.
Traded options had one of their worst day's in recent times. Total volume
was a mere 14,941 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option having only 3,388
lots dealt.

downgrade

Wall Street
A SHARP decline in the IBM share price caused stocks to decline across the
board in light trading yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19.18 at 3,365.14.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.17 to 422.19, while
the American SE composite shed 1.92 to 389.90 and the Nasdaq composite lost
4.45 to 576.87.
Turnover on the New York SE totalled 172m shares and falls outpaced advances
by 1,023 to 717.
Most analysts were unperturbed by yesterday's decline, arguing that it was
natural for the market to undergo a short period of consolidation and
profit-taking following last week's strong advances. They also said the fact
that share prices have only given back a few points suggested that the
market is resilient, and may have room for further gains over the next week
or so.
The day's only economic news was the release of the Federal Reserve's Beige
Book report on economic conditions, which had little effect on the stock
market. The report found that economic activity remained 'uneven', but it
noted some improvement in retail sales and manufacturing.
IBM was the feature of the day after broking house Smith Barney downgraded
its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'hold' and reduced its estimate for
earnings in 1992 from Dollars 6.85 a share to Dollars 5.80; it also reduced
its forecast for 1993.
An explanation for the downgrade was not forthcoming, although it may have
been linked to comments from an IBM executive, who said revenues from
mainframe computers and related operating systems will be flat to lower in
the second half of this year. IBM finished Dollars 2 3/4 down at Dollars 91
5/8 after turnover of 2.6m shares.
News that the recovery in the auto industry had stalled in late July hurt
car shares; figures released on Tuesday showed flat sales of domestic cars
at the end of the month. Ford Motor retreated Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4
and General Motors slipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 , while Chrysler
eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 21 7/8 , all in active trading.
Clorox dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 after the company announced
that it was taking a Dollars 32m pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter for
write-downs and a Dollars 36m total charge for the full year to cover the
cost of accounting adjustments.
Global Natural Resources firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 after the
company said that a new export tax exemption granted by the Russian
Federation will have a positive effect on its venture in Tatarstan.
On the Nasdaq market, leading issues led a retreat. The most notable
declines were Microsoft, down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 72, Amgen, Dollars 1
cheaper at Dollars 66 1/4 , Apple Computer, Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 44
3/4 , and Borland International, Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at Dollars 42 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks kept pace with a lacklustre Wall Street to close moderately
lower after thin volume. Cuts in prime rates by Canada's leading banks to
6.50 per cent from 6.75 per cent had little effect on the market. Bank
shares ended broadly lower.
The TSE 300 index was finally 19.8 off at 3,406.2 and declines led rises by
310 to 197 after turnover of 22.5m shares.
Mitel, which jumped to the top of the actives list on Tuesday and climbed to
a 52-week high, lost 18 cents to CDollars 2.38 after disappointing the
market with a first-quarter loss of 10 cents versus a deficit of 8 cents in
the year-ago period.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Firmer at long end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-DATED rates in the sterling cash market firmed yesterday as the pound
continued to weaken on the foreign exchanges and the market remained jittery
about the prospects for European economic union.
Although trade in cash was thin, the pound's slide to a low of DM2.8247 in
Europe underlined expectations that a cut in UK base rates is a distant
prospect. The Bundesbank compounded the gloom by draining more funds from
the German money market than had been anticipated. In its weekly
intervention, it drained more than DM8bn after only DM1bn to DM3bn had been
expected, and German call money rose to a level just below the 9.75 per cent
Lombard rate.
Both six-month and one-year sterling cash firmed  1/16 on the offered side,
to 10 7/16 and 10 1/2 per cent respectively. Trade in sterling futures
matched the trend in cash as the 1993 'back month' contracts fell heavily.
The June 1993 short sterling contract closed 12 basis points down at 90.27
from its opening level.
Shorter-dated cash and futures prices were steadier. The Bundesbank calmed
the atmosphere by announcing that there would be no press conference after
its council meeting today, virtually eliminating the prospect of a Lombard
rate rise. The Paris Match opinion poll on the French referendum, which
showed a small majority in favour of ratifying the Maastricht treaty, also
raised hopes that the much-feared crisis of European Monetary Union will not
be taking place for another six weeks at least.
Three-month money closed unchanged on the offered side at 10 3/8 per cent,
and one-month money was softer at 10 1/8 per cent from a previous close of
10 3/16 . The September short sterling contract was down two basis points
from its opening level at 89.59, although this is still a bearish price by
recent standards.
The Bank of England helped to ease the short dates by forecasting a small
shortage of Pounds 400m. It dealt, as usual, at 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1
and 2. It purchased Pounds 50m of Band 1 treasury bills in the morning
before revising the forecast to Pounds 500m. In the afternoon it bought
Pounds 86m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 13m of Band 2 bank bills and
provided late assistance of Pounds 100m.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling/D-Mark hits new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING yesterday dipped to its lowest level against the D-Mark since
Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism, as traders grew
increasingly disenchanted with the prospects for the UK economy, writes
James Blitz.
In early London trading, the D-Mark firmed against most European currencies
as dealers feared the results of another opinion poll on how the French will
vote in their referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20. As it
turned out, the poll showed a slight majority in favour of ratifying the
treaty, with 56 per cent saying they would vote 'yes' and 44 per cent saying
they would vote 'no'. But the result proved too inconclusive for most
dealers, and the German currency drifted further upwards.
The pound was the worst hit, dropping to a low of DM2.8247 and finishing a
pfennig down on the day at DM2.8250. Traders said there had been a spate of
heavy corporate selling of sterling in recent days. Underlying this was
deepening gloom about the UK economy, including more bad news about the
state of the UK housing market. The Nationwide Building Society's recent
survey showing that house prices had fallen on average by 0.6 per cent in
July is one of several indicators making sterling investors more bearish.
The UK currency's slide may be halted in forthcoming days for several
reasons. First, the pound is at its lower limits against both the Portuguese
escudo and the Spanish peseta in the ERM. In the last two days, the Bank of
Portugal has bought sterling to keep the pound within its limits, slowing
down its descent against the D-Mark. Traders have also reported that the
Bank of England is lightly intervening in the market to keep the pound above
its lows.
Friday's US non-farm payroll figure for July may also ease tensions in the
European exchange rate mechanism. Analysts believe that this should show a
big rise in US employment, by around 100,000, firming the dollar towards
DM1.50. This, in turn, would weaken the D-Mark in intra-European Monetary
System trading, making sterling's position more comfortable.
Yesterday, dollar/D-Mark trading was confined to narrow ranges as the market
awaits Friday's jobs figure. The US currency closed fractionally up on the
day in London at DM1.4760. In New York it ended higher at DM1.4815.
The D-Mark finished at FFr3.3800 in Europe after a previous FFr3.3780 and at
L756.5, up from L755.9. One analyst suggested that Italy's reduction in its
discount rate earlier this week may prove to be premature. 'If the
government's budget measures are not implemented and the coalition has more
difficulties, the cut may have to be reversed,' he said.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungarian plant closes as
alumina deal falls through
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FAILURE to reach an agreement with Russian alumina importers has triggered
the closure of a Hungarian alumina factory with an annual capacity of
180,000 tonnes, reports Reuter from Budapest. Alumina, or aluminium oxide,
is the intermediate material refined from bauxite ore for smelting into
aluminium.
'The closure is a decided fact. We stopped feeding the works with bauxite on
Monday,' said a factory official.
The factory, called Ajka-I, will come to a standstill by September 30,
costing 700 of the 2,400 workers their jobs, the official said.
The Ajka-II plant, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, will continue
its production.
A dispute over prices wrecked a planned barter deal between Hungary's
HungAluker and Russia's Raznoimport last month.
In a traditional alumina-for-aluminium barter, Hungary has exported 600,000
tonnes of alumina annually to the Soviet Union in exchange for aluminium. It
planned to import up to 120,000 tonnes of aluminium this year.
But rising costs of electricity and steam energy made Hungarian alumina
prices high compared with Australian competition. Australian alumina was
Dollars 20 to Dollars 30 a tonne cheaper than Hungarian, HungAluker's
general manager Mr Ferenc Windisch told the economic weekly Napi last week,
although Russian ports were not technically capable of receiving shipments
from Australia, he added.
However, Mr Windisch said only plans of a barter deal were wrecked. The two
sides still hoped to reach a cash deal.
The equipment at Ajka-I will be mothballed, ready to restart production if
necessary, the plant official said. '(But) knowing the Russian market, I
don't think production will start again. It stopped for good.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon farms blamed for
parasite problem - An infestation outbreak that is irritating anglers in the
west of Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HUMBLE sea-louse with a gourmet's taste for the tender flesh of salmon and
sea trout has succeeded in producing a rash of invective, verbal
inflammation and much scratching of heads among homo sapiens in the west of
Ireland.
Lepeoptheirus Salmonis is a parasite of salmonid species such as salmon and
sea trout, which was largely unheard of until salmon farming started
becoming an important industry in the region in the mid-1980s.
In 1989, however, the wild sea trout fisheries in the west of Ireland
collapsed. Catches by anglers on rivers between Galway Bay and Clew Bay fell
to less than 10 per cent of the levels they had been just a few years
before. Many of those that were caught were found to be in poor condition
and heavily infested with sea-lice. On some rivers the return of adult
spawning fish from the sea fell to less than 20 per cent of previously
recorded minimum levels.
'It is disastrous. In Connemara, there used to be 500 rods a day fishing
over a 100-day season. It's all gone,' says Mr Vincent O'Reilly, chairman of
the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland.
The finger of blame was quickly pointed at the salmon and trout farms. There
are 34 in Ireland, most of them concentrated in the bays and estuaries along
the Galway and Connemara coastline. They produce almost 10,000 tonnes of
fish a year, most of which ends up as smoked sides on dinner tables from
Nice to New York. Big companies have invested millions of pounds in the
industry.
The floating cages in which tens of thousands of salmon are kept together
for fattening are like five-star hotels to the lowly lepeoptheirus, the
concentrated shoals of their favourite food offering ideal grazing and
breeding grounds. Lice control has become one of the major management
problems on the farms.
The adult lice release millions of larvae into water, ready to reinfect
other farmed salmon and, it is alleged, the wild sea trout. Efforts to
control the lice with chemicals such as dichlorvos have upset shellfish
farmers and ecologist groups, who claim that damage is being caused to the
marine environment by their use.
A study carried out by the Sea Trout Working Group, an ad hoc body set up by
the government last year to draw together all the scientific data available
on the problem, found that 94 per cent of lice larvae production in the
worst-affected western region originated from farmed salmon.
The study concluded that 'on a broad geographic scale there was a broad
correspondence between total larvae production estimates and the level of
infestation of sea trout.'
That was sufficient prima facie evidence for the angling and specialist
hoteliers' lobby to demand that the farms either be relocated or the
sea-lice problem brought under control.
But the fish farmers did not agree, and the working group itself pointed
out: 'It is still not possible, on the basis of larval production figures,
to demonstrate a significant correlation between production of sea-lice
larvae from salmon farms and subsequent infestation of sea trout in
individual embayments, despite the large numbers of sea lice being produced
at salmon cages and the small numbers originating from wild salmonids.'
With the scientific evidence inconclusive, the sea-louse war has degenerated
into a welter of mutual recriminations and mud slinging with the government
uncomfortably trying to straddle the line dividing the salmon farmers on one
hand, and the anglers, hoteliers and even its own fisheries officers on the
other.
Mr Michael Woods, the minister for the marine, in announcing stop-gap
measures authorising additional research and monitoring last May told
parliament: 'My objective is to ensure the well-being of the wild fishery
and the angling tourism industry, which is worth IPounds 74m (Pounds 70m) a
year, as well as of the salmon farming industry, both (of which) make a
major economic and social contribution to the community in the west of
Ireland.'
A recent study by the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin
estimates that some IPounds 80m has been invested in the Irish fish-farming
industry over the past 10 years, producing an output worth some IPounds 25m
a year. Interestingly, the ESRI study also found that many of the farms were
being run at a loss.
On the other hand, a lucrative up-market tourism industry is being badly
hit. Mr Brian Flynn, the western regional manager of the government's
Tourism Board says: 'It is largely a market for high-spending overseas
visitors. The sea trout fishing has been very important for this area but we
can no longer promote what was a quality product. It no longer exists here.
People who have invested for that market have lost it.'
One such person is Mr Peter Mantle, the owner of the 'Delphi Lodge' in
Connemara. He has invested IPounds 1m in developing a wild fishery and
luxury accommodation for anglers over the past seven years. 'Bookings have
completely collapsed in the past two years,' he says.
Mr Michael O'Brien, the owner of the 'Angler's Paradise' in Killarney, south
of where the principal problems have occured says: 'Our sea-trout fisheries
around here have gone to the dogs as well.' His bookings are down by 70 per
cent this year. Similar tales are told by hoteliers catering for the market
throughout the western region.
The regional fisheries boards have largely endorsed the anglers' and
hoteliers' perception of the problem. Mr Michael Kennedy, regional manager
of the Western Region Fisheries Board, says: 'As far as we are concerned the
lice from the farms are the cause of the problems. In a bay there might
normally be between 2,000 and 5,000 wild salmon. If each has five lice,
that's only 25,000 in total. On one farm you may have 1m fish, and if each
has five lice that's 5m. There's the problem.'
The Irish Salmon Growers Association, the lobby group for the fish-farming
industry, which now shares offices with the powerful Irish Farmers'
Association, is counter-attacking by alleging that the wild salmon are the
cause of louse infections in their otherwise healthy farmed fish and are
demanding seats on the regional fisheries boards, which they feel have
turned against the farmers. 'That would be like letting the fox look after
the hen house,' remarks one hotelier who has lost many angling customers.
Mr James Ryan, the owner of a fish farm in the estuary of the Delphi fishery
and a key figure in the ISGA says: 'The sea-lice are a red herring. There
are always fluctuations and cycles in wild fish stocks. Those that have
invested in angling lodges and are losing money are looking for a scapegoat
in the fish farming industry'.
He admits that 'there may be a problem' in the scale of the current collapse
in the western fisheries, but points out that climatic, environmental and
disease problems could also be the cause.
However, disease and environmental problems have largely been ruled out as
the cause by the STWG and Dr Ken Whelan, head of the Salmon Research Agency
in Galway and a member of the STWG, says: 'I don't think anyone can deny
that lice are the major factor in the collapse of the fisheries.' He and Mr
Kennedy point to the experience of Clew Bay where a salmon farm was closed
in 1990 because of disease problems. The sea trout numbers recovered in
1991. A new licence was then granted to reopen the farm in 1992 'and the
lice problem on the sea trout has recurred in a very serious manner,' he
says.
The problem with proving their case, however, is that the ways of the
juvenile sea-lice remain a mystery to the scientists. Their survival times
and distribution patterns in tidal waters are largely unknown. The
conclusive link remains elusive.
Until further research is completed, it seems that lepeoptheirus will
continue to be a major source of irritation not only to the salmon and
trout, but to their farmers and anglers as well.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outokumpu in Karelian metals
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the state-owned Finnish mining and metals group, is joining
forces with four organisations in the Karelian republic, formerly part of
the Soviet Union, to develop the republic's base metals resources.
The first targets are copper-nickel deposits in the Kivijarvi area,
north-east of Aanisjarvi. Present estimates show these deposits have about
10m tonnes of ore containing 1 per cent nickel.
Mr Jyrki Juusela, Outokumpu's chairman, said recently he was optimistic
about the potential for his group to do more business in the Commonwealth of
Independent States. 'They are finding a way to sell raw materials and so
need technology to produce them in an economic way. Outokumpu can provide
the technology and equipment to help.'
He said that Outokumpu could also help by providing barter opportunities,
taking materials for sale through its own trading organisation.
'We have a head start over other western companies in dealing with the CIS
countries because we have had a long-term relationship. We at Outokumpu have
visited the CIS plants for many years, not just gone to the ministries in
Moscow. We know the plants and the people there know us. And the people at
the plants are making more of their own decisions,' he added.
While for the next five years most of Outokumpu's operations would be in the
OECD countries, 'we will gradually increase our activities in the CIS,' Mr
Juusela said.
Outokumpu Mining said yesterday that for two years it had been making
studies, mainly geological and ore dressing studies, at the Kivijarvi
deposits in co-operation with the Karelian Geological Expedition. The
establishment of a new joint company, Kivijarvi Oy, 'reflects the more
concrete co-operation between Outokumpu and the Karelian Republic. It also
provides the latter access to a vast mining expertise.'
The Kivijarvi joint company would mine the deposits if that proved
economically viable - studies should be completed by the begining of 1993 -
and at a later stage it would be involved in other base metal ores in the
republic.
Outokumpu is particularly keen to build up its nickel and copper resources.
Most of its current capital expenditure is going towards nickel projects in
Australia and copper projects in Chile.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IEA report highlights doubts
over oil demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT the expected increase in oil demand may not occur are heightened
by the latest report of the International Energy Agency and have helped to
push crude prices below Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time since May.
Brent crude for September delivery closed at Dollars 19.90 yesterday,
compared with Dollars 20.35 at the end of last week. The price had remained
above Dollars 20 since the last meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in May.
The latest Monthly Oil Report from the IEA, the west's energy monitoring
agency, said July output from members of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was 24m barrels a day. That was well above the agreed
output ceiling of 22.98m b/d, although the agreement did allow for an
increase of about 300,000 b/d in Kuwaiti production, and Saudi Arabia said
it would continue to produce slightly more oil than it was officially
allocated.
The IEA said Saudi production remained steady in July at around 8.1m b/d.
But production in Iran rose slightly to 3.3m b/d from 3.2m, and there were
small rises from Nigeria, Kuwait and Venezuela.
The IEA also said that while oil production in the former Soviet Union had
continued to decline, averaging only 9.1m b/d in May and June, oil exports
had increased to 2.25m b/d in June, and an estimated 2.4m b/d in July. This
was due to a larger-than-expected decline in domestic consumption, and a
fall in Russian crude supplies to other former Soviet republics.
These factors, together with a decline in demand from refineries and the
sluggish recovery in western economies have led to a larger supply overhang
than previously expected.
Weekly figures from the American Petroleum Institute showing that US crude
oil stocks had jumped by 6.28m barrels to 330.21m barrels also pushed prices
down slightly.
But Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London, said the
decline in price was partly seasonal.
'The IEA's Opec figure is what we might have expected, and is a figure the
market can live with. The next couple of weeks will see the price drift
slightly, but I would expect it to pick up again after that.'
Mr Gignoux said trading was thin in what was always a quiet period of the
year.
Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, said in Turkey yesterday
that an oil pipeline to carry Kazakh crude to the Mediterranean sea would be
completed within three years.
The pipeline would carry 40m tonnes of oil a year through Turkey to the
Mediterranean. It could also carry oil exports from other republics such as
Azerbaijan.
In Moscow, Russian officials said oil, gas and minerals in the resource-rich
but comparatively undeveloped Demyan zone of the western Siberian Tyumen
region would be put up for international bidding.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: British Gas downgraded due to
regulatory fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas yesterday lost its triple-A debt rating, prompting speculation
that the credit quality of the UK's privatised utilities may be on a
downward slide, due to a stricter regulatory environment.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, lowered the credit rating of
British Gas's Dollars 5.2bn of long-term debt to double-A plus, citing
'growing regulatory pressures on the company's core UK gas business' as well
as the risks of diversification into gas and oil exploration and production.
The company's triple-A debt rating from Moody's, the other leading rating
agency, was placed under review for possible downgrade in May.
S&amp;P said the regulatory protection afforded to British Gas's national
monopoly has diminished since privatisation in 1986.
Yesterday's downgrade raised concern among dealers that similar action could
be taken against other privatised UK utilities.
An official at S&amp;P said the agency was 'following the regulatory situation
very closely in all the utility sectors'. S&amp;P is about to conduct its
regular annual review of British Telecom's triple-A debt rating, and will
focus on the implications of a stricter regulatory environment on the
telecommunications industry.
Secondary market prices in British Gas Eurobonds suffered in the wake of the
downgrade. The yield spread of the company's Pounds 350m issue of Eurobonds
due 2001 widened by three basis points to 17 basis points, relative to the
comparable UK gilt.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: French bonds rally on opinion poll support
for Treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH government bonds rallied to close higher yesterday as the latest
opinion poll indicated strong support for the ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty on European economic and monetary union.
The opinion poll for Paris-Match magazine showed that 64 per cent of
respondents were certain to vote at the referendum on September 20. Of
these, 56 per cent would vote for the Treaty and 44 per cent against.
French bond prices picked up on rumours of the poll results before the
figures were released officially, and dealers warned the French bond market
was likely to be focusing closely on the polls in the run-up to the
referendum. Although the bond market slipped after the official
announcement, bond prices closed higher, with the Matif futures contract
trading at 105.54 by late afternoon, against the opening level of 105.32.
THE results of the French poll helped to lift German bond prices yesterday
afternoon, but the market ended the day little changed.
News that the Bundesbank had drained DM8.3bn - a larger amount than expected
 -depressed bund prices in the morning. The central bank drained cash out of
the system and allocated all of the one-month funds at its repo at 9.70 per
cent or above. The news heightened concern that the Bundesbank may consider
raising the Lombard rate at today's Council meeting.
The Lombard rate was left at 9.75 per cent on July 16 when the discount rate
was raised from 8.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent. The Liffe bund futures
contract moved in a range of 86.82-87.12, ending the day at around 86.97.
A further DM1.3bn of the Bundespost's 8 1/4 per cent 10-year bond issue was
sold at auction with bids of 99.40 and above accepted. On Tuesday, DM3bn of
the bonds were sold.
THE UK government bond market slipped yesterday as sterling weakness held
the short end of the market in check and expectations of an auction
announcement pushed longer-dated issues lower.
The 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 102 27/32 to 102 while in the
futures market, the Liffe gilt contract edged up from 96.21 to 96.26 by late
afternoon.
News that interest rates on National Savings products were to be cut had
little impact on the gilt market, dealers said, adding the move was taken as
a sign that the government is trying to prevent a rise in mortgage rates.
US government securities fell from early gains at the long end yesterday
amid mild disappointment that the Treasury's latest quarterly refunding
programme did not include a cut in the size of its long bond offering.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond, which had been up
1/4 point at midsession, was down  1/32 at 106 23/32 , yielding 7.427 per
cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 15/16 to carry a
yield of 4.266 per cent.
Dealers reported light activity in the market throughout the morning
session, although there was some overseas buying at the short end early on.
Attention was otherwise focused on the refunding package, which analysts
expected to come in around Dollars 36bn.
Their forecasts were spot on, but the hoped-for cut in long bond issues
never materialised. Consequently, those dealers who had readied themselves
in early trading for a rally at the long end sold off some of their bond
positions quickly, bringing bond prices down.
JAPANESE government bonds tried to test new highs in the cash and futures
markets, but profit-taking trimmed early gains and the markets closed lower
on the day.
The September futures contract, which opened at 105.05, reached a high of
105.18 before falling to close at 104.88.
Dealers said the futures contract has approached last week's high of 105.23
 -the highest level since October 1989 - on a few occasions recently but has
failed to breach this level so far.
In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 4.91 per
cent and moved to 4.96 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day.
The bond traded at a yield of 4.94 per cent in the London trading session.

<TEXT>
BRASCAN, a key holding company in the business empire controlled by
Toronto's Bronfman family, has reported slightly lower second-quarter
earnings but maintained its quarterly dividend.
A greatly improved performance by natural resource subsidiaries and lower
interest charges were offset by a smaller contribution from financial
services and investments. Second-quarter earnings dipped to CDollars 8.3m
(Dollars 7m) from CDollars 9.8m.
Earnings per share rose to 2 cents from 1 cent, reflecting lower preferred
share dividend payments. Brascan's share of group revenues climbed to
CDollars 2.63bn from CDollars 2.42bn.
The company, whose interests include controlling stakes in Noranda, the
mining and forestry group and Royal Trust, a large Canadian financial
institution, said its performance should improve as the business recovery
gathers momentum.
Some companies under its wing have recently cut dividends, but Brascan
maintained its own quarterly payout at 26 cents a share.

results in second quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL RE, the biggest US reinsurance group, reported slightly weaker
results, with second-quarter net earnings slipping to Dollars 158.5m, or
Dollars 1.80 a share, against Dollars 160.5m, or Dollars 1.82, in the same
period last year, agencies report.
Second-quarter revenue was Dollars 829.2m against Dollars 780.9m.
For the six months, net earnings were Dollars 366.3m, or Dollars 4.18 a
share, against Dollars 310.9m, or Dollars 3.52. Revenue rose to Dollars
1.679bn from Dollars 1.574bn.
General Re said its underwriting results for the latest quarter were weaker
than the year-ago period, but better than the first quarter.
The group said that given the magnitude of the insurance industry's
catastrophic losses in the latest quarter its losses were lower than
anticipated.
General Re said its realised capital gains in the latest quarter totalled 29
cents a share compared with 28 cents a share a year ago.
The company's 1991 second-quarter earnings also included a gain of 3 cents a
share on 'fresh start' tax benefits.
For the latest six-month period, realised capital gains were 64 cents a
share against 45 cents a share a year ago. Also included in net income for
the latest six months is a gain of 70 cents a share from the company's
adoption of SFAS 109, which changes the method of accounting for income
taxes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRUDENTIAL Securities, the third-largest brokerage house in the US,
announced yesterday that it will be keeping its headquarters and back office
operations in Manhattan.
The company had considered relocating outside New York, but a Dollars 106m
incentive package of tax and energy rebates provided by the city and state
government, and the reduction in rental costs linked to the local commercial
property slump, persuaded Prudential to stay in the Wall Street area.
Prudential's decision is a victory for the administration of Mr David
Dinkins, New York's mayor, which has fought hard to persuade big companies
to stay in the city despite the cost, the high crime rate and the crumbling
infrastructure.
If major corporations and their employees leave New York, the city's tax
base declines and local government finances, already damaged by federal cuts
and the impact of the recession, would come under further pressure.
Delighted city officials said yesterday that Prudential's decision would
generate Dollars 830m in revenue for New York.
In recent years, several big Wall Street firms, including Merill Lynch,
Salomon Brothers, and PaineWebber, have moved their back office operations
out of New York to cheaper locations in the suburbs or in other states.
Kidder Peabody, Smith Barney, and Morgan Stanley have also recently
considered relocating part or all their operations elsewhere although none
have yet made a final decision.

<TEXT>
SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations,
yesterday unveiled an unexpected 43 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net
income in spite of posting record revenues in the period.
Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 37.7m, or 37 cents a
share, against Dollars 66.4m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 3
per cent to Dollars 972.7m from Dollars 942.5m last year.
On Wall Street, shares in Sun Microsystems eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 27
1/2 . The results were released after the close of trading. The company's
share price has been subject to spurts of volatility this year reflecting
some concern that Sun would not be able to live up to expectations of very
strong growth. Sun has been one of the fastest-growing companies in the
computer industry.
A number of analysts reduced their earnings projections for the company
earlier this year, but most had expected fourth quarter earnings of about 51
cents a share, with essentially flat earnings for the year.
Instead, Sun posted annual net income which slid almost 9 per cent to
Dollars 173.3m, or Dollars 1.71, compared with Dollars 190.3m, or Dollars
1.85, in fiscal 1991. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars
3.22bn.
Operating income tumbled 51 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 49.3m from
Dollars 100.8m. For the full year, operating income was off 11 per cent to
Dollars 261.1m from Dollars 294.9m.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Losses force Lufthansa to trim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LUFTHANSA is planning further staff reductions, cost cuts, and a slimming
down of its route network after a sharp rise in the German airline's loss
for the first half of 1992.
In spite of higher revenues and passenger volumes, Lufthansa, 51 per cent
state-owned, made a pre-tax loss of DM550m (Dollars 367m) in the
January-June period, 66 per cent higher than in the same period of last
year. It has said it expects to remain in the red this year.
Prompted by the severity of Lufthansa's problems, Mr Jurgen Weber, the chief
executive who took over last September from the expansion-minded Mr Heinz
Ruhnau, has called for more drastic measures to stem the losses. Like other
German industrial companies, its cost base is much higher than that of its
competitors.
Details of the programme are still being worked out and may be announced
next month. The airline's freedom of manoeuvre is limited, however, by
pensions available to long-serving staff; these would be costly to buy out.
This year, it is shedding 1,000 employees and has stopped hiring. It
employed about 50,000 people last year, a rise of 3,200 on the previous
year.
Like other airlines, Lufthansa has been hit by the slack pace of world
economic growth which has led to tougher competition.
The pay strike called earlier this year by the public sector workers' union
also affected German airports, notably Frankfurt, and inflicted a loss of
some DM60m on Lufthansa.
Tourist traffic to Thailand suffered from the recent political troubles
there, while Lufthansa's results have been further hit by the steady
increase in traffic fees at German airports. The recent slide in the US
currency has added to Lufthansa's difficulties by cutting the D-Mark value
of dollar earnings.
Lufthansa has long been pressing for a change in the German air agreement
with the US which, it says, puts it at a considerable disadvantage against
other European airlines operating across the north Atlantic. Some 30 per
cent of Lufthansa's revenues emanate from the route, but it is losing
heavily there.
Mr Weber has criticised the US government for 'blocking us totally' on
attempts to have the bilateral accord made more favourable for Germany.
'They are not willing to budge even a millimetre,' he said in April.
Lufthansa is limited to 10 cities in the US, while US airlines have wide
access to airports in Germany and the rest of Europe.
Lufthansa, which will produce its half-yearly report next week, said traffic
revenues rose by 9 per cent to DM7bn in the first half, with passenger
numbers up by 19 per cent to 13.4m.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Lindt executive quits as
marriage wrangle deepens
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of Lindt &amp; Sprungli, the Swiss fine chocolate makers,
has resigned two days after the 72-year-old chairman, Mr Rudolph Sprungli,
announced his marriage to a 44-year-old member of an obscure religious sect.
The resignation puts a serious twist on a story which has in recent days
brought some levity to a depressed summer in Zurich, sparking speculation
about the family-controlled group's future.
Mr Ulrich Geissmann is the latest in a long line of executives to fall out
with Mr Sprungli, who has led the secretive company for 30 years.
A joint statement said only that the respected former executive with the
Migros retail group would leave tomorrow 'by mutual agreement'.
Zurich analysts suggested that the marriage was the last straw for Mr
Geissmann, who was appointed in June 1991 with a mandate to cut costs and
update the group's slightly dowdy product range.
They said he had been given assurances that, unlike his four predecessors in
the previous six years, he would not be faced with constant interference
from the chairman.
However, last spring it became known that Mr Sprungli had divorced his wife
and become engaged to Ms Alexandra Gantenbein, a sometime member of an
obscure religious sect called 'I am'.
Simultaneously, allegations surfaced that Ms Gantenbein, who was not
employed by the group, had improper influence on its executive appointments.
Mr Sprungli promptly called off the engagement and appointed accountants
KPMG Fides to investigate.
Last Thursday, the group published the results of the investigation,
claiming that they showed that all was well. But one sentence quoted from
the report suggested otherwise. 'Mrs A. Gantenbein, occasional member of the
'I am' movement, gained some importance and influence in decisions over top
manager positions,' it said.
On Monday afternoon, the couple's marriage was announced, and by last night
Sprungli shares had lost one-tenth of their value.
The departure of Mr Geissmann creates a serious problem. No one of any
stature will want to replace him under the present leadership, said Mr Rene
Weber, analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich.
Exact details of how the family controls the group are unclear, but its
total holdings have slightly less than half the voting rights and are split
mainly between Mr Sprungli and his ex-wife.
The three Sprungli children are set to inherit the business, but that could
change, analysts said.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Institutional concern over a top banker's
dual role - A look at efforts to split the jobs of chairman and chief
executive at Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF Barclays' biggest shareholders plan to meet senior management after
the bank's half year results are announced today to voice concern about Mr
Andrew Buxton combining the two roles of chairman and chief executive.
Heavy provisions are likely to have driven first half profits well below the
Pounds 378m pre-tax figure returned at the half-way stage last year.
While Barclays normally talks to its shareholders after its results are
announced some of the institutions are planning a 'vigorous campaign' to
persuade the bank to split the two top jobs.
One of the bank's institutional shareholders said: 'Barclays is the only UK
bank to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive. We will not be
content until the roles are split.'
Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment
banking subsidiary of Barclays where he is also deputy chairman, believes
the issue is only one of semantics.
In a recent interview he said: 'The words chairman and chief executive do
not mean anything. Simply using these words does not give you any clue as to
how management works.
'To say that Andrew Buxton is chairman and chief executive of Barclays does
not mean he will take every decision. I think he would be shocked if he was
expected to do it all.'
Mr Buxton, a descendant of one of Barclays' founding families, became chief
executive in May after the bank's non-executives put pressure on Sir John
Quinton to reduce his responsibilities. Mr Buxton, who had been managing
director, will assume the role of chairman at the end of the year.
Since 1896, there have only been two exceptions when the chairman was not
drawn from one of the founding families - one of them being Sir John - and
in all cases they have combined their role with being chief executive.
Sir Peter, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury whose civil service
career began in 1962, was appointed chairman of BZW in November. He plans to
take a greater role in the group, akin almost to being Mr Buxton's partner.
One of Barclays' biggest institutional shareholders said that while it
welcomed Sir Peter's new role, precedent warned that 'enormous problems'
could occur when one person combined both roles of chief executive and
chairman.
Sir Peter believes the shareholders' arguments boil down to two main issues:
that the roles should be split because chief executives run business while
chairmen plan for the future;
the fear that anyone combining both roles becomes too powerful.
As to the first argument Sir Peter believes there are management
similarities to the planned demerger of Imperial Chemical Industries and
Barclays.
'Just as ICI is planning to have one chairman and two chief executives (when
it demerges into two companies) so Barclays has one chairman and three chief
executives of its three main divisions, Mr Alastair Robinson at banking, Mr
David Band at investment banking and Mr Joseph De Feo at service
businesses.'
Mr Buxton, however, remains chief executive of the overall group.
In countering the second argument Sir Peter points out that Mr Buxton's
powers are kept in check by a strong executive committee and by him. 'I have
a powerful role in the bank and he (Mr Buxton) listens to me.
According to Sir Peter the most important thing for shareholders is to
explain how the group is organised and what powers the various individuals
have in the organisation. 'I think this is more important than who has what
title', he says.
Some of Barclays' institutional shareholders have yet to be convinced. Some
have other strategic concerns. In particular, they are unhappy at the bank's
hefty exposure to troubled property companies. In the current year, some of
Barclays' big corporate customers, such as the property companies Heron
International, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Olympia &amp; York, have run into
difficulties.
As a result, Barclays is likely to face big losses on loans to some of these
companies.
Sir Peter believes there is a simple lesson to be learnt. 'The banks are
primarily in the business of taking risks. The banking system did not think
hard enough about the risk. You can easily fool yourself about the risk.'
In the US Sir Peter does not believe the group should try to compete with
the well-established domestic banks in commercial banking. 'I think we need
to try to become more specialised in which clients we want to look after.'
He says the great lesson that Barclays has learnt is that it needs a clear
strategy about what businesses it wishes to offer and in how many countries.
Part of that strategy is deciding how far the bank can spread its resources
in offering any one particular service. In retail banking, for example, Sir
Peter says the group has no ambitions to offer a European-wide service.
Instead, the group is to concentrate its resources in the UK and in selected
areas on the continent, such as Spain and Portugal.
The first thing he decided to do when he took up his post was to streamline
BZW.
One of the most important decisions was to merge investment banking with the
bank's international treasury operations.
'We shall be offering a complete range of services to our clients,' says Sir
Peter.
This is an area where Sir Peter said the group did want to be everywhere in
terms of the range of services offered.

the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Department of Trade and Industry
announced.
British Manufacturing was sold for about Pounds 8m by Cork Gully, the
receivers of Astra Holdings, in April this year. The purchase gave BAe
ownership of the two largest munitions factories in the UK.
The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation into the deal after
failed rival bidders complained that they had made higher offers, and that
Cork Gully had withheld financial information about the company. The
competition implications of the deal were also considered.

pre-tax for the six months ended June 30.

being lifted from 1.9p to 2.1p.
Mr Peter Wardle, the chairman, said the group was well supported from its
activities in selected sectors of industrial construction, shipbuilding and
offshore oil and gas.
He added that his 1991 year-end forecast that 'we would see some improvement
in market conditions in 1992' was late in coming. However, he went on to say
that 'given that there will be some improvement, we anticipate the progress
achieved in the first half of 1992 will be maintained for the full year.'
At the half year-end the order book was standing at Pounds 12m.

ANGLESEY MINING, floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 to develop
Britain's first base metals mine for decades, at Parys Mountain, Anglesey,
is raising another Pounds 620,000 (Pounds 515,000 net of expenses) from
institutional investors and its biggest shareholder, Imperial Metals of
Canada.
Work at Parys Mountain came to an abrupt halt at the end of last year when
Anglesey, which had spent Pounds 8.5m on the zinc-lead-copper project,
failed to raise another Pounds 25m to take it through to production.
Imperial's holding in the UK company would remain at about 43 per cent
following the latest share issue. It is proposed - provided shareholders
agree - that Anglesey issues 12.4m new ordinary shares at 5p each to
Imperial and the institutions.
Imperial would also take another 4m new ordinary shares at the same price
(worth a total of Pounds 200,000) in satisfaction of part of a loan made to
Anglesey.
The shares fell by  1/2 p to 4 1/2 p.

buy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MADDOX, the network and cable group run by Mr Hugo Biermann, has acquired
Wakebourne Group Holdings, a specialist computer services company, for
Pounds 10m.
The acquisition is being financed by a Pounds 16.5m placing of new shares at
8p each.
Mr Biermann, the South African-born entrepreneur, who sold the
mini-conglomerate Thomson T-Line to Ladbrokes for Pounds 186m in 1989, said
the acquisition took Maddox into the top end of the market in cabling and
network sys-tems.
Maddox, which first acquired its listing in March, has two main businesses,
Cables and Flexibles, a UK distributor which Mr Biermann bought back from
Ladbrokes last year, and Seacoast Electrical Corporation in the US.
The Wakebourne acquisition is part of the group's strategy to expand its UK
businesses. Further bolt-on acquisitions in the range of Pounds 200,000 to
Pounds 4m are expected over the next six months.
Wakebourne, which specialises in connecting different computer systems
together, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m for the year ended May 31
1991.
Mr Biermann said the number of corporate users of computer systems had been
growing.
Wakebourne's Pounds 3.5m debt will be paid off by the placing of new shares
which has more than doubled Maddox's total number of shareholders.
'Raising money in a recession means that you have to talk to many more
institutions that in the good years', Mr Biermann said. Maddox talked to 80
institutions, 20 of which decided to take up the new shares.
Shareholders who wish to take part in the placing will be offered 81 new
shares for every 88 existing shares.
Maddox's shares were yesterday relisted, closing at 8p, after being
suspended on June 29 at 8 3/4 p soon after Mr Biermann disclosed that he was
close to making the acquisition.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Richmond inquiry finds no evidence of cash
circle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHMOND Oil &amp; Gas, the natural resources company, yesterday sought to lay
to rest questions over the underwriting arrangements of the company's
flotation in July 1989. Matters arising from the flotation are being
investigated by the Serious Fraud Office,
Mr Robert Fox, chairman, said an internal investigation of the company's
files had not revealed 'any evidence of any irregularities on the part of
the company or any member of the board of directors' at the time of the
flotation. Nor had the company found evidence of a circle of funds, he said.
However, Richmond is expected to make a further announcement later this week
about a change in the role of Mr David Wilkinson, chairman at the time of
the flotation and currently joint managing director.
The inquiry was carried out by Richmond's company secretary, Mr David Webb.
He has held the post since May 1989.
Richmond's inquiry confirmed that Pounds 15.8m - the proceeds from the
original offer - had been deposited with Jersey-based Oakwood Management
Enterprises on the advice of brokers, Corporate Broking Services. Mr
Wilkinson was a director of CBS at the time.
The decision to deposit the money with Oakwood had been taken by
'disinterested' members of Richmond's board, Mr Fox said. These were Michael
Hayes, then-finance director and Mr Michael Hogue, formerly chief executive
and now joint managing director. Mr Hayes left the company earlier this
year.
Mr Fox said the company had received Pounds 1.2m in interest from Oakwood,
which had been accounted for in the 1990 results.
An investigation by Price Waterhouse in May cited evidence that Oakwood was
involved in a 'cash flow circle' which appeared to give the impression that
the sub-underwriting had been fully financed. According to PW, various
amounts of money totalling Pounds 15.8m were pumped repeatedly around the
circle via three banks in the days after flotation.
PW's inquiry - described as a preliminary investigation - was based on
documents discovered at Jersey accountant, Bryant &amp; Co. Bryant managed
several sub-underwriters for the flotation. Mr Kelvin Myles, a former Bryant
manager who supervised some of the sub-underwriters, appears as a signatory
for Oakwood.
Documents appeared to show that money flowed from Bryant's account at Royal
Trust in Jersey to Richmond's underwriting account at Barclays Bank in
London. Richmond then lent a similar sum to Oakwood, which transferred funds
back to Bryant.
The PW report prompted an SFO investigation into dealings in Richmond and
another company, Butte Mining.
The SFO confirmed it was not investigating the current activities of
Richmond. 'We are investigating certain share transactions . . . over 18
months ago,' the SFO said.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Fujitsu braced for first-half loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and electronics company, yesterday said its
first ever interim loss would be 'unavoidable' in the current half year. The
company blamed the continued slowing of the domestic economy and the
weakness of international electronics markets.
The admission by Fujitsu is likely to be the first of many downward profit
revisions for the six months to the end of September. Japanese electronics
companies had expected domestic sales would recover during the summer but
sales have continued to fall.
Fujitsu, which owns 80 per cent of ICL, the UK-based computer maker, said
consolidated net losses were likely to total Y10bn (Pounds 41m) in the first
half, but the company expects demand will improve and it is still aiming for
a Y40bn profit for the full year. The company hopes that signs of an upturn
in the US computer market will lead to increased sales of its products.
As part of its plan to increase profitability, Fujitsu said earlier this
week that it would close a memory chip assembly plant in San Diego, one of
two US chip facilities.
The group has invested heavily in a newly opened UK plant making 4-megabit
D-rams but this has been incurring losses, as demand has fallen below
expected levels.
Fujitsu indicated that in the longer-term, production would be increased at
plants in Malaysia and Singapore.
Fujitsu's consolidated net profit fell 85 per cent to Y12.2bn in the year to
the end of March. This trend is typical of Japanese semiconductor makers,
most of whom reported profit falls of 40 per cent and more.
Apart from the weak semiconductor market, the company has blamed its poor
performance on higher interest charges and declining product prices.
Demand within Japan for computers has been hurt by the downturn in capital
spending. A survey by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said manufacturing
companies would reduce their capital spending by a further 2.8 per cent in
the second half this year.
Fujitsu planned to cut its spending on plant by 30 per cent this year, and
reduce investment in semiconductors by 50 per cent. However, research and
development spending was forecast to rise to Y345bn from Y317.8bn.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Bank's shares fall on provision warning: Standard
Chartered's expected losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Standard Chartered fell almost 5 per cent yesterday after the
group disclosed that it was making provisions of Pounds 100m to cover
expected losses stemming from its involvement in the Indian securities
trading scandal.
The international banking group had already disclosed that it would make a
Pounds 50m specific provision to cover the losses. Mr Rodney Galpin,
chairman, said yesterday that it was adding a further Pounds 50m to general
provisions because of the 'continuing uncertainty'.
As a result of these charges, Standard Chartered's pre-tax profits fell 23
per cent to Pounds 64m in the six months to August 5. Mr Galpin admitted
that he was bitterly disappointed that profits had fallen, because of the
progress the group had made in its worldwide operations outside India. He
was confident that the Indian problems are 'unique and isolated'.
Nonetheless, Standard's share price fell from 440p to 420p.
Standard's Indian losses stem from its exposure to 'bank receipts' - an
unusual form of IOU by which a bank promises to deliver government stock or
equities to another bank on a due date. At the beginning of the year, when
Bombay share prices began to soar, there was a surge in the creation of
these receipts. Some of the transactions were allegedly fraudulent.
Standard has filed 'a complaint for Pounds 162m' with the Central Bureau of
Investigation, the Indian government department investigating the scandal.
The complaint alleges criminal fraud and conspiracy against several
individuals, including stockbrokers and two of Standard's dismissed
employees.
Standard's first half profits were depressed by a further Pounds 18m because
of a sharp rise in Indian interest rates, which followed the trading
scandal, and other related costs. The bank's managing director, Mr Malcolm
Williamson, said that - without the Indian losses - the group's profits
would have risen from Pounds 81m to Pounds 185m before tax.
Profits received a Pounds 25m boost from an out of court settlement of
Standard's case for damages against the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the
US.
Coopers had been sued by Standard over losses the bank incurred from the
collapse of a computer disk drive manufacturer, Miniscribe.
The biggest contributors to Standard's profits were its Asia Pacific
operations, which made Pounds 146m, including the Pounds 25m Miniscribe
credit.
There was also a modest increase in the profit of the Middle East and South
Asia businesses, from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19m, if the Indian losses are
kept separate.
African profits rose from Pounds 19m to Pounds 20m, but the UK made a Pounds
3m (Pounds 55m) loss. The dividend is being maintained at 7p.

FT  06 AUG 92 / ICI comes to grips with the tax tangle: UK chemicals group
looks set to clear one obstacle to itssuccessful demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A weighty document lies on the desk of Mr Colin Short, finance director of
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK chemicals group. 'Project Mortar. Legal
steps analysis. Company secret', which runs to several hundred pages,
details arrangements over the next few months for the demerger of ICI's
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality chemicals businesses.
It is the masterplan for untangling the tax implications of the demerger.
While the rationale behind unscrambling a group of nearly 500 subsidiaries
created over more than 65 years may have been business strategy, the key
question determining whether the plans will proceed is if the group can
escape substantially higher taxes.
'The tax aspects were the major things we needed to clarify before we could
feel comfortable that we could succeed,' says Mr Short. 'After 65 years of
history there was clearly a very complex tax structure. The question was
whether we could come up with a route to demerge without horrendous tax
implications.'
That risk has been substantially reduced now that ICI has received
'pre-clearance' from the Inland Revenue in the UK and strong favourable
indications from ICI's US legal advisers.
At stake were three issues. First, whether the demerger was allowable under
demerger tax provisions. Second, whether the planned issue of shares in ICI
Bioscience, the drugs and pharmaceuticals side, would give rise to extra
Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) - the tax paid on dividends - as the issue is
technically a distribution to shareholders. Third, whether the distribution
would result in a taxable capital gain for shareholders.
Mr Short said the indications from Inland Revenue were 'yes', 'no' and 'no'
to the three questions, leaving the demerger broadly tax neutral.
Nevertheless, ACT will be an increasing problem for ICI, as a growing
proportion - currently more than 80 per cent - of its profits comes from
overseas and there are smaller UK profits against which to offset the tax.
The IRS does not grant pre-clearance in the same way as the Inland Revenue,
but Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, ICI's US legal adviser, has issued a 'strong
opinion' suggesting the IRS will approve the scheme.
Details of the steps to be followed by the ICI operations in all 150
countries in which it operates, from Angola to Zimbabwe, were circulated at
the end of last week. Staff will prepare plans for submission to their tax
authorities during September, with the aim of gaining initial approval
before Christmas.
Meanwhile, ICI has other hurdles to overcome, says Mr Short. The group is
negotiating with the pension trustees about splitting the present scheme
into two. Legal agreements also have to be concluded to allow the new groups
to share 15 sites in the UK. And works councils in Germany and the
Netherlands will have to agree the demerger.
Once the demerger is completed, ICI Bio will make a rights issue next April
or May. Its size will depend on the allocation of debt between the two
groups at the time of the demerger, says Mr Short. The allocation itself
will partly depend on the timing of the swap of ICI's nylon business for Du
Pont's acrylics operations. ICI will receive about Pounds 250m cash if and
when the deal is concluded.
Mr Short says both ICI Bio and the new ICI will want to use cash to take
advantage of growth opportunities. After the issue, ICI Bio would have the
freedom to take stakes in biotechnology companies and issue paper to pay for
acquisitions or a merger.
As for the new ICI, its paints operations need to expand on the continent
and Asia, says Mr Short. The group will also want to expand the pure
terephthalic acid business in which the company has a commanding position
and proprietary technology.
Meanwhile Mr Short is setting new targets for return on capital. He sees
more disposals in industrial chemicals. 'We need to focus our industrial
chemicals in Europe, North America, including Mexico and Canada, and the Far
East. That excludes certain parts of the world. South American, India,
Pakistan, Australia will have to wash their faces. If they generate cash,
fine. If not we will have to consider getting rid of them.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / UN forces may quit Sarajevo: Peacekeeping role in doubt as
rival Bosnian factions step up violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS peacekeepers threatened to pull out of Sarajevo yesterday
following several days of heavy bombardment in and around the Bosnian
capital.
Mr Mik Magnusson, the UN spokesman in the city, said the UN could not go on
with its peacekeeping activities indefinitely if this level of violence
continued. 'There comes a time when we have to assess the situation. I guess
that time comes now,' he told reporters.
The upsurge in violence caused the UN on Tuesday night to suspend
humanitarian aid flights into the airport for three days.
Fighting has intensified as Moslems attempt to break the four-month siege of
the city by Serb irregular forces. The opposing sides have thrown tanks,
rockets and artillery into fierce battles.
The UN warning coincided with increasing confusion inside the US and other
western governments about how to end the bloodshed in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
President George Bush said yesterday that he did not rule out some form of
US military intervention but that he would not commit US forces 'to a
battle' until he knew 'what's the beginning, what's the objective, how's the
objective going to be achieved, and what's the end'.
But Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, said last night the defence
forces of Bosnia should be armed and provided with military aid to prevent
'an even greater catastrophe'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has ruled
out military intervention.
The US yesterday called for an extraordinary session of the Geneva-based UN
Human Rights Commission, to 'examine the dangerous deterioration of the
human rights situation in the former Yugoslavia'. The US also said it wanted
evidence of any 'war crimes' to be collected and given to the UN Security
Council.
The US moves follow claims and counter-claims about the existence of Serb,
Moslem and Croat detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, yesterday dismissed as
'propaganda' reports that the Serbs were holding, executing and torturing
tens of thousands of Moslems and Croats in concentration camps.
But Bosnian Moslems and Croats forced to flee their homes after Serb forces
attacked them claim the Serbs run 45 detention camps holding at least 70,000
people. Serbs claim the Moslems and Croats are holding about 40,000 in the
same number of camps.
Mr Karadzic said the International Committee of the Red Cross was 'welcome
at any time' to visit the camps, which he said housed prisoners-of-war.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Courts urged to speed up recovery of bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS AIMED at halving the time courts take to deal with bad debt cases are
to be presented to the government next week by the Confederation of British
Industry.
The proposals would mean the establishment of special debt recovery
tribunals under the aegis of the High Court. County courts would be
bypassed, except for the very smallest claims.
The CBI is highly critical of the time taken to process bad debt cases -
undefended cases take about 60 days in the High Court and 114 days in the
county court.
These figures could be cut to about 38 days, the CBI says. For defended
cases, the time taken could be cut to 66 days from 100 days in the High
Court and 128 in the county court. A CBI survey last year found that nearly
60 per cent of small businesses were finding late payment of bills and bad
debts a significant hindrance. Nearly 20 per cent said they were at risk of
failing because of the problem.
Court procedures for recovery of debts are so cumbersome that some
businesses are deliberately delaying payment, says the CBI, and 'feeling
they can get away with it'. Payments to one in five businesses regularly
exceed 75 days according to the CBI research.
The latest proposals for speeding court procedures are due to be submitted
by the CBI's smaller firms council to the lord chancellor's department and
to Baroness Denton, small firms minister, early next week.
The plans have been drawn up in conjunction with Davies Arnold Cooper, the
City firm of solicitors.
The CBI is also proposing the greater use of incentives for court officials
to recover debts. Mr Richard Brucciani, CBI smaller firms council chairman,
said yesterday that, under the present system, High Court sheriffs who were
paid according to results 'are far more effective than county court bailiffs
who are paid a fixed salary'.
A Pounds 500 ceiling for county court bad debt claims should be set, says
the CBI, with larger claims pushed into the High Court 'where better results
can be achieved'. It should also be possible to start legal action without
first sending a solicitor's letter, argues the CBI.

THE government yesterday reported that its longer leading index of economic
activity fell by 0.9 percentage points last month, adding to the evidence
that recovery has been deferred.
The Central Statistical Office said the index, which is supposed to identify
turning points in the business cycle about 10 months in advance, declined to
103.3 in July from 104.2 in June, after having fluctuated downwards from a
recent peak of 106 in October last year.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Fraud probe cuts benefit claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 50,000 people withdrew claims for unemployment benefit last year -
with a saving of Pounds 34m to the taxpayer - after investigations by fraud
teams, the government announced yesterday, Lisa Wood writes.
The figures were criticised as 'greatly exaggerated' by the Unemployment
Unit, a watchdog organisation for claimants. It said many of the 50,000
could have left of their own accord, with 13 per cent of all claimants
leaving the unemployment register every month.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said: 'While the vast majority
of benefit claims are genuine, these figures show there continues to be a
large number of people who are working and claiming benefits intended for
the unemployed. We owe it to them - and the taxpayer - to crack down on this
fraud.'
Forty-nine employers - three times as many as in the previous year - were
prosecuted for conspiring with workers to claim unemployment benefit
illegally so they could pay them low wages.
Between April last year and March this year the total number of claims for
unemployment benefit was 4.947m, with the Department of Employment
estimating an underpayment of Pounds 29.6m. According to the Employment
Service 780 inspectors last year launched 232,000 separate investigations,
resulting in 2,265 prosecutions.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Fall in job-related training admitted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPORTION of workers receiving job-related training has declined
noticeably during the recession, a Department of Employment analysis
acknowledged yesterday.
The report in the department's Employment Gazette also suggests that many of
the participants in the government's Employment Training and Youth Training
schemes do not believe they are receiving significant amounts of job-related
training.
The analysis, which draws on statistics published earlier this year in the
annual Labour Force Survey, will heighten fears that skill shortages will
emerge as a restraint on economic growth once the present recession ends.
Although this happened in the previous recession in the early 1980s, the
government had hoped that companies would heed its calls to maintain
training budgets at their pre-recession levels.
The Employment Gazette report shows that 14.9 per cent, or 3.16m employees,
of working age in Britain reported receiving training related to their jobs
in the four weeks before the Labour Force Survey in the spring of last year.
Although this represents a significant increase on figures in the early
1980s - it compares with 9.2 per cent in 1984 - it is down on the 15.4 per
cent of 1990.
The likelihood is that the proportion will have decreased considerably
further since the spring of last year because the recession has continued
for longer than many analysts and employers expected.
The gazette's report also charts a decline in apprenticeships. On the basis
of responses to the survey it is estimated that 330,000 people in Britain
were doing an apprenticeship last year, against 367,000 in 1989, when they
were at their peak following the recession of the early 1980s.
An encouraging statistic for the government is that training programmes such
as YT, ET and apprenticeships account for only about 10 per cent of training
activity recorded by the survey.
This indicates that the other 90 per cent of people who said they had
received job-related training in the four weeks before the survey were
getting it on a continuing basis as part of their employment.
However, the analysis notes that nearly 200,000 of the 738,000 people who
said they were participating in YT, ET or trade apprenticeship did not feel
they had undertaken any job-related training in the four weeks before the
survey.
This will fuel fears about the effectiveness of some of the training
schemes.
The analysis says there are no obvious reasons for the responses, although
'variations in individuals' perception of what constitutes job-related
training is a possible explanation.
'For example, some may not consider work experience or on-the-job learning
as being related to training.'
The analysis also notes that off-the-job training was the most common format
and the incidence of training generally declined with age.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Financial advertising attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE standard of financial advertising has been condemned as 'abysmal', with
many adverts attacked for being misleading.
In the latest edition of its magazine Which?, the Consumers' Association
says: 'In general the quality of information on financial products is
abysmal. Breaches of the rules governing financial advertising are
widespread.'
The association's examples include two advertisements from different
building societies which each claimed they had the best-performing Tessa
(tax exempt special savings account) of 1991. Britannia's claim was based
only on the 10 largest building societies, while Yorkshire's ranking was
based on the larger banks and the 13 largest building societies.
The association also says the Britannia advert failed to mention
restrictions on its accounts such as the inability to withdraw interest.
Britannia responded: 'Whenever an investor applies for one of our products
he or she receives the relevant product literature detailing the full terms
and conditions.'
A newspaper advertisement from Robert Fleming included statistics showing
that over 10 years its investment trusts had performed better than average.
In the same newspaper a table showed that the company's trusts had
underperformed over the past three years. Which? says that consumers should
treat claims and statistics with caution.
Midland's advertisement for its capital bond fails to mention that the bond,
while matching the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index over five years, fails to pay
investors the dividend yield, an important component of equity returns.
Midland said that it was adjusting the advertisement to refer to stock
market 'growth' instead of 'returns'.
Imro and Lautro, the financial-service regulators, are criticised for
secrecy. The association says: 'Imro and Lautro deal with complaints in
private and only rarely publish details of decisions.' Substantial savings
can be made by private motorists importing a new car from some continental
European markets rather than purchasing it in the UK, according to Which?
After research among car dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands the magazine
says that savings of up to Pounds 2,131 can be made on the UK price of a
Ford Fiesta 1.3iLX.
Price quotes made by two Audi dealers offered a saving of Pounds 2,176 over
the UK price of an Audi 80.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Crown offers deal in ferry dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROWN Estate yesterday attempted to settle a dispute which threatened to
close one of the oldest ferry services in Europe by offering a new franchise
to the operator.
The Crown Estate, which manages property on behalf of the sovereign and owns
the ancient rights to the Tilbury-Gravesend river crossing on the Thames,
east of London, has abandoned plans to increase the annual licence fee from
Pounds 200 to Pounds 9,000.
White Horse Ferries, the operator, has been offered a 150-year franchise at
a fixed annual fee of Pounds 200.
The proposed terms were welcomed yesterday as a partial victory for the
ferry operator, which last month suspended services from Tilbury after Crown
Estate warnings that it was breaching the sovereign's 'ancient rights to run
a ferry' on the river.
However, the company said: 'We are continuing talks with the Crown Estate
commissioners. We are still not satisfied.'
The dispute centres on the right to operate the service, which White Horse
purchased last year from Sealink Stena, the ferry operator. The Crown Estate
said Sealink Stena's franchise was non-transferable.
Franchises from Tilbury are issued at the discretion of the sovereign. White
Horse owns the rights for services in one direction only, from Gravesend to
Tilbury. The Crown Estate said it would be 'amazed' if White Horse turned
down its 'generous' offer.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Congress set to rewrite parts of the Nafta
pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US House of Representatives will today lay the groundwork for a partial
re-writing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which US,
Canadian and Mexican negotiators are working to wrap up.
The House is due to vote on a resolution, sponsored by more than half the
members, warning that no trade pacts will be approved that jeopardise US
environmental, public health and labour standards.
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, argues forcefully that the final
pact will provide all the safeguards Congress desires. But Nafta is caught
in the cross-fire of presidential politics and there it will remain
throughout the election.
The White House is apparently convinced that Nafta will provide President
George Bush with a tangible link between foreign and domestic policy and an
achievement which he can argue will create jobs and stimulate the US
economy. Mrs Hills has been allotted a speaking role at the Republican
convention later this month, where she can put the case for Nafta before the
country.
Governor Bill Clinton, Mr Bush's opponent, has praised the proposals put
forth last week by Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader. In a
speech co-ordinated with other leading Democrats and the presidential
campaign, Mr Gephardt called for a cross-border tax to help finance worker
retraining, environmental clean-up and building infrastructure along the
border.
If the pact does not contain 'better wage and benefit replacement proposals'
and a number of other conditions, Mr Gephardt suggested the Congress would
write them into the implementing legislation.
Congressional revision of Nafta would put Mexican President Carlos Salinas
in an awkward position. He has sold the treaty to the Mexican public as a
mechanism to push incomes up to the levels in the rest of North America.
But the prospect of having to renegotiate a supposedly 'done deal,' combined
with an explicit US role in drawing up Mexican environmental and labour law,
raises its own problems. The overriding principle of Mexican foreign policy
is non-intervention in the affairs of other countries, used largely as a way
of defending itself against US interference.
Unless Mr Gephardt waters down some of his more interventionist proposals,
there is a possibility the Mexican government would refuse to go along with
his revisions to the treaty.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Europe hails gear dispute victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN gear manufacturers were celebrating victory yesterday in a two-year
trade battle with the US that ended this week when the Commerce Department
decided that gear imports do not threaten national security.
Eurotrans, the umbrella organisation for nine large European industrial
countries, said the decision had averted the introduction of crippling
import levies. It had prevented the loss to Britain alone of around Pounds
100m of gear exports a year.
Mr Michael Opperman, Eurotrans president and chairman of Birmingham-based
Cross &amp; Morse, said: 'The success of these negotiations was critical to the
European gear industry. Exports to the US are essential to our industry,
particularly at present because of the recession in our home markets.'
Gears, toothed parts which transmits an engine's power to its work, are
integral to both the construction and performance of nearly all weapon
systems and the Gulf war focused attention on the US defence industry's
increasing reliance on foreign-made parts.
Last October the American Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) filed a '232
petition' claiming imports were causing a decline in the US gear industry
and impairing the US ability to go to war.
Eurotrans maintains the US spends too little on research and development and
manufacturing technology, and does not operate to international standards.
Mr Joe Franklin, AGMA's executive director, said yesterday he was not
pleased by the result, but stressed that the association had never intended
the petition to produce broad-based tariffs or quotas across the gear
industry.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN did well and incumbents poorly in the latest round of state primary
elections for Congress on Tuesday, confirming trends apparent all year.
Victories by two Democrats, Gloria O'Dell and Geri Rothman-Serot in Kansas
and Missouri respectively, bring to nine the number of women, eight of them
Democrats, who will be contesting Senate races in November. This is already
close to a record, with many states still to hold primaries.
At present the Senate has only two women members, Barbara Mikulski, the
Democrat from Maryland, who is heavily favoured to win re-election, and
Nancy Kassebaum, the Republican from Kansas whose seat is not up this year.
Two House members - the Republicans Mr Guy vander Jagt in Michigan, a
13-term veteran, and Mr Dick Nichols in Kansas - lost on Tuesday, bringing
to 15 the number of sitting representatives beaten in primaries. The number
of seats that incumbents will not be defending rises to well over 60 when
retirements are included. Total changeover in the House could exceed 100.
Ms O'Dell and Ms Rothman-Serot will do well even to threaten the Republican
incumbents in November. Senators Robert Dole in Kansas and Christopher Bond
in Missouri won their primaries easily and start heavy favourites.
But other women Senate candidates are faring much better. Latest polls in
Illinois give Carol Mosely Braun a 30-plus point lead over a lacklustre
Republican nominee, while in California Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein,
both Democrats, are ahead by 15-20 points. Lynn Yeakel is given a real
chance in Pennsylvania.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has had no hesitation
in hitching himself to the women's bandwagon, which is motoring along on two
major causes; freedom of reproductive choice and opposition to sexual
harassment.
Mr Clinton left Arkansas yesterday with Senator Al Gore, his running mate,
on another bus tour. In three of the six midwestern states on the itinerary
 -Illinois, Missouri and Iowa - his party is fielding women Senate
candidates.
Mr Bush also took to the road yesterday, but to more conventional campaign
events in New York and Nevada in front of Catholic and military veterans'
associations. His appeal to women voters is mostly based on his call for the
restoration of traditional family values.
President Bush's approval rating has dropped to 33 per cent, the lowest of
his presidency, according to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released
yesterday.
Over 90 per cent of Americans approved of him after the Gulf War, but his
rating has plummeted 57 points over 17 months. No president with such a low
rating has won re-election since political polling began in the 1940s.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Brazil ponders radical reforms: A parliamentary system is on
the cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most popular plays showing in Rio de Janeiro is a reconstruction
of the events of August 1954, when President Getulio Vargas was driven to
suicide by a wave of financial scandals surrounding his government and
family.
Not surprisingly, the play provokes parallels with President Fernando
Collor's attempts to hold on to power amid a torrent of corruption
allegations.
The current crisis and Brazil's history of a succession of civilian
presidents failing to finish their mandates, is prompting increasing debate
over the viability of the presidential system.
During the last few weeks, as Mr Collor's position has become increasingly
untenable, the campaign for a parliament-based system has been gaining
weight and political leaders from all sides have been meeting to discuss a
sweeping reform of the political system and electoral laws.
Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of the chamber of deputies, believes reform is
more pressing than the parlous economic situation.
Under Brazil's present system candidates are elected individually rather
than by party on a state-wide basis in a confusing 'open-list' version of
proportional representation.
This has resulted in weak parties divided into factions, and a lack of
accountability in politicians. Representation is skewed in favour of smaller
rural states while, in reaction to 21 years of military regimes up to 1985,
the rules governing party formation are completely liberal.
Any group of 110 people can form a party and gain access to free television
time and this, combined with a lack of ideology and no rules governing party
discipline, has led to the constant creation of new parties.
The 1990 congressional elections were contested by 30 parties and no party
won anything approaching a majority. The president's party secured only 23
out of 503 seats, making governing almost impossible.
Under the current system responsibility lies with the president and
authority with Congress, which must approve his actions. Thus Mr Collor has
had to build new coalitions for every project.
Mr Carlos Garcia, the minister for special projects, says: 'No president can
last five years in this situation - it's crisis after crisis'.
Congressional leaders are now hard at work on new laws changing the
electoral system from statewide proportional representation to district
voting similar to that used in Germany, introducing rules on party loyalty
and insisting on a minimum percentage of votes for a party to be represented
in Congress.
They also hope to legislate on campaign contributions from businessmen. Many
of the allegations surrounding Mr Collor have resulted from the presidential
campaign costs of as much as Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m), yet contributions
over a few hundred dollars are forbidden.
Politicians say this October's muncipal elections will be the cheapest ever,
because in the current climate of suspicion no one dares accept or make
major contributions. The estimated cost of being elected mayor of a
medium-sized city has dropped from Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m to Dollars
100,000.
Brazil is due to hold a nationwide referendum on the form of political
system next April. Voters will have to choose both between a return to
constitutional monarchy or maintaining the republic, and between a
presidential or a parliamentary system. The latest polls show a majority in
favour of the latter.
Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, perhaps Brazil's most respected politician, now in his
44th year in Congress, says: '103 years of presidentialism in Brazil has
been a disaster right from the first president, Marshal Deodoro Fonseca, who
was forced out before finishing his mandate. It's time we accepted that the
system doesn't work.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Milken is likely to be released from a California prison next
March after a federal judge yesterday sharply reduced the disgraced
financier's minimum sentence because of his co-operation with government
prosecutors in a number of recent fraud cases.
Judge Kimba Wood, who in November 1990 sentenced Mr Milken to 10 years in
jail for securities fraud, reduced the amount of time Mr Milken will have to
serve in prison before he is eligible for parole from 40 months to 24
months.
Mr Milken has already served 17 months of his sentence, so he should be
freed, assuming continued good behaviour, in early March 1993. After that he
will still face three years of probation and community service.
Judge Wood said she reduced Mr Milken's minimum sentence because of his
'substantial assistance' in the successful prosecution two months ago of Mr
Alan Rosenthal, a former colleague at securities house Drexel Burnham
Lambert, and because of the help he had given the Securities and Exchange
Commission in bringing other enforcement actions.
The judge said Mr Milken had been a 'model prisoner'.

Mr Walsh has said other indictments against senior figures in the Reagan

Japan's coastguard yesterday detained six activists of the environmental
group Greenpeace for questioning, hours after they hung a banner at a
shipyard (pictured above) to protest at plans to transport plutonium, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
A coastguard spokesman in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, said he did not know if
they would be formally arrested or when questioning would be completed. A
Greenpeace spokeswoman told a news conference the treatment was tantamount
to an arrest.
Riding in rubber boats, the group hung a 10-metre banner across a dry dock
housing the Akatsuki Maru, the ship due to carry one tonne of reprocessed
plutonium from France later this year.
The Akatsuki and an accompanying coastguard cutter are due to transport the
highly radioactive material for use in Japan's ambitious nuclear energy
programme. The timing and route of the shipment have been kept secret.
Rebecca Johnson, Greenpeace's co-ordinator for the plutonium issue, said
that Japan and Britain were giving contradictory accounts of the ownership
of the Akatsuki Maru.
Soon after the Greenpeace activists disembarked they were surrounded by some
25 coastguard officers and police, said Ms Johnson. Two Japanese, two
Britons, a Dutch national and an Australian were then taken to the
coastguard's Yokohama office.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Somalia's children die in the rubble: Appalling suffering is
being caused by the collapse of a nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the hot and dusty streets of one of Somalia's war-shattered towns,
skeletal children close to death feed on grass, roots, and the boiled skin
and bones of camels.
Some of the most appalling suffering in Somalia's war-fuelled famine, where
4.5m people are in need of food aid, is unfolding in isolated places such as
Bardere - a rubble strewn town on the Juga river.
It is towns such as this that must receive supplies by air if a massive
disaster is to be averted. Ten days ago the United Nations Security Council
sanctioned an airlift. So far it has not taken place, although a UN
technical team was yesterday preparing to fly to the capital, Mogadishu, to
assess its feasibility.
Like many towns across Somalia, Bardere, 400km west of Mogadishu, has been
completely looted and destroyed by marauding soldiers who ripped roofs,
doors and windows off the houses and left the people to starve.
Hundreds of people, mostly children under five years old, are dying in
Bardere, far from the gaze of the world's media or the reach of aid
agencies. With no deliveries of emergency drugs or supplementary and
intensive feeding materials, the famine tragedy in Bardere is mostly a
hidden one.
There are no feeding centres yet and therefore no mass concentration of the
hungry and the dying. Instead, children are dying in the bombed-out and
pillaged houses of the town and are buried quietly in shallow graves.
Aid workers estimate that 80 per cent of Bardere's children under five years
old are severely malnourished and that anywhere between 15 to 30 people,
mostly children, are dying in the town every day.
If their figures are correct that would give Badere one of the highest rates
of death by starvation per population in the country.
Human skeletons not yet buried mix with the bones and carcases of donkeys
and cows in the dusty streets of the town.
Outside Bardere itself another 25,000-35,000 people are in an even worse
condition, close to death after dissolute bands of gunmen looted their
livestock and left them without food or sufficient energy to stagger into
the town.
'The ones we see walking here are much better off,' said Ms Brigitte Doppler
of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. 'In these situations many
more people just don't have the strength to walk and are dying in their
homes.'
In Bardere market there is some camel meat, cigarettes and salt. But there
is no maize or millet or anything to stave off the worst signs of
malnutrition. Fresh leafy millet stalks are sold in bundles to the hungry
who can still afford to buy food. Most cannot.
Hundreds of emaciated people carrying sacks and looking desperately for food
poured into the disused hospital yesterday as aid workers brought the first
drugs in to the town in a twin-engined aircraft.
Once again the starving Somalis were disappointed and angry that Europeans
had come to the town without bringing food.
For the last 20 months, Somalia's' civil war has disrupted agriculture and
forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homesteads. Many have
eventually reached Mogadishu after a long trek, resulting in many deaths
along the way.
In recent days, international aid agencies have stepped up their calls for a
huge sea and airlift of aid to Somalia, saying the shattered African nation
is a hell on earth that claims hundreds of victims every day. But an airlift
alone would not be enough.
The Save the Children Fund (SCF), one of only a handful of aid organisations
working in Somalia, said the humanitarian crisis there made the Ethiopian
famine of the 1980s look like 'small beer', describing it as far worse than
the mayhem in former Yugoslavia.
The SCF has highlighted security problems in Somalia as a reason for the
wariness of the international community to become involved, but the
organisation said unless the supplies were increased food would continue to
be a commodity worth fighting for.
'People say there can't be food without security, but there will be no
security until there is food,' said Mr Don Redding, who witnessed the
problems at first hand during a trip to Somalia last April.
Amnesty International yesterday described Somalia as a human rights
disaster. It called on Somalis to stop fighting and the rest of the world to
help relieve the suffering. The International Committee of the Red Cross has
warned that 1.5m people could die in Somalia over the next few months.
Help may, finally, be close at hand with Bardere's first airlift of food by
C-130 Hercules transport planes expected on Saturday. Unicef, the UN
children's agency, is planning to fly in 16 tons of food, drugs and shelter
material. In the short run that is bound to exacerbate the situation, as
thousands of people head for the town once they hear food is there. But in
the continuing insecurity of Somalia a big airlift is the only hope of
averting the world's worst looming human catastrophe.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Malaysia stays closure of plant said to be emitting
radioactive gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Malaysian Supreme Court has ruled that a Japanese-controlled company
allegedly emitting quantities of radioactive gas can continue operations,
pending an appeal against an earlier shut-down order.
The Asian Rare Earth company, 35 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi Kasei
group, Japan's largest chemical company, produces minerals used mostly in
the manufacture of electronic components.
Its factory is near the town of Ipoh, in northern Malaysia.
Last month the Ipoh High Court ordered the factory to stop operations within
14 days, citing evidence showing that the health of local residents had been
threatened by emissions from the plant.
Supreme Court judge Mohamed Yusof Mohamad said it was impossible to switch
off the entire manufacturing process at the plant in the time imposed by the
original court order.
'The mandatory injunction to remove toxic waste and radioactive waste within
a period of 14 days is not adequate, as this removal involves scrapping of
the plant which has been in operation for more than 12 years,' the judge
said.
'These factors alone would cause harm to the appellant and hardship to its
183 employees if injunctions were allowed to operate before the appeal is
heard and disposed of.'
Local residents who have fought for the plant's closure for several years
were upset by the verdict. They were particularly angry that the judge had
criticised a member of the local residents' committee for trying to dissuade
Mitsubishi from taking part in a court appeal.
The original Ipoh High Court judgment had accepted evidence of a growing
number of cases of leukaemia, infant deaths and congenital disease in the
vicinity of the factory. Lawyers for Asian Rare Earth say they will make a
full appeal to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Ipoh court ruling.
Mitsubishi Kasei said in Tokyo that the company did not want the plant to
operate until local objections had been resolved.
However, it had only a one-third stake in Asian Rare Earth, and the six
Malaysian shareholders would have a strong role in making any such decision.
An official acknowledged that the negative publicity - and a threatened
boycott of all Mitsubishi group products in Malaysia - had hurt the Japanese
company's image. But he insisted it had behaved correctly and disputed the
evidence of contamination.
The Japanese government, embarrassed by the affair, has been seeking to
project a tougher attitude over the country's multinationals which,
environmental groups argue, are exporting dirty industries to countries with
less stringent regulations.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) unveiled this week a
draft 'green code' for Japanese businesses operating abroad, seeking their
compliance in adopting environmental protection measures of a higher
standard than local law might require.
The code, if approved, could be backed by aid and tax incentives but would
carry no sanctions for offenders.

FT  06 AUG 92 / US shrinks from role in Bosnia: James Baker may be angry at
the Serbs, but Washington sees the conflict as Europe's problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE an increase in the violence in war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, the US
appears determined not to get embroiled in a conflict which it sees as a
European problem, in a 'backwater' for the administration.
If European governments were prepared to commit ground troops or air support
to back up relief efforts, Washington would assist. But congressmen,
senators and state department officials said this would only be with air
power and only with UN authorisation.
'The area is now a political backwater for us,' a staff member of the House
committee on foreign affairs said. 'It was important under Tito (the former
Yugoslav president), but what interests do we have in the region now that
the cold war is over?' he added.
He said that with the end of the cold war there was growing isolationism in
the US. 'The feeling among public opinion in the US is that we have poverty,
unemployment and budget problems on our own doorstep,' he said. 'And isn't
it time to turn our attention to these matters. Besides, people still do not
know where Yugoslavia is, or what the war over there is about. In a
presidential election year, everybody is going to be cautious.'
Despite the impact of the media on US public opinion, both Republicans and
Democrats said security in the Balkans and the Yugoslav crisis was the
responsibility of Europe, even though repeated internal disagreements within
the European Community has often prevented it from adopting a coherent
strategy towards the region.
'After the republics of Slovenia and Croatia declared independence (in June
1991), we thought Yugoslavia was a European problem,' said Republican Mr
Richard Lugar, a member of the Senate foreign affairs committee.
'Of course we consulted with our (European) allies. But now it seems to us
that Europe has had problems in deciding what to do. My own view is that the
problem of violence has to be addressed. Until we have a commitment from the
EC countries that they will supply ground forces of some kind, we are not
prepared to use air force. In any case, we would only use air force through
the authorisation of the United Nations.'
But as Britain prepares to host an EC-UN conference on the former Yugoslavia
later this month, US officials are increasingly critical of the EC's
year-long role in the conflict.
Administration officials said Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state,
became exasperated with Serbian aggression against Sarajevo, the Bosnian
capital, and the attempts by the EC-sponsored peace conference to implement
any lasting ceasefire. 'TV coverage, especially of the mortar attack on the
bread line in Sarajevo, made him furious with Belgrade,' an official said.
This impatience with the EC peace process was expressed at the EC Lisbon
summit in June, where the US called for tougher measures against Serbia, and
even referred to the use of military force.
'We spoke about some form of military intervention. But the Pentagon was
against it, and many of us were divided about its goals. It would have meant
going to war against Serbia. In any case, there was an agreement thrashed
out at the Munich G7 summit in July, an administration official said.
He said Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, asked Mr Baker to 'give
(Lord) Carrington and the EC peace efforts one more chance'. 'Britain was
about to take over the EC presidency. It did not want France to expand the
peace conference. . . Baker said: 'OK. We'll give Carrington another
chance'.'
The failure of the London talks on Bosnia last month has now forced the EC
to broaden the conference into the ambit of the UN.
Mr Tom Lantos, a Democrat, who is also a member of the foreign affairs
committee, said: 'Europe's response to the war in the former Yugoslavia has
been a complete shambles. Its response is shameful.'
Yet few US officials are prepared to spell out how they would stop the war
in Bosnia, and prevent it from spreading to neighbouring republics.
'Tragically, the world community response has been too little and late,' Mr
Robert Dole, the Republican Senate leader said. 'Why didn't we respond to
this aggression 12 months ago?'
Last June he asked the senate to authorise the use of Nato forces to
re-establish peace in Bosnia, to close the airspace over Bosnia, to protect
humanitarian air convoys, and to plan for airstrikes 'if feasible against
Serbian positions in Bosnia, and in Serbia'. Support for these proposals has
been muted.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Call for banks to act on CIS debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITOR banks to the former Soviet Union should strive to head off a
government-to-government solution to the debt crisis which would work
against the commercial interests of private sector banks, Germany's second
biggest bank said yesterday.
Mr Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief economist of Dresdner Bank, said the 600 or so
private sector creditor banks should negotiate a complete rescheduling of
the debts owed by Russia and other former Soviet republics, rather than
settle for a government-to-government deal that might force creditor banks
to accept substantial write-offs.
Total ex-Soviet debt, including capitalised interest, is believed to be
around Dollars 80bn, mostly owed to governments or international
institutions.
The former Soviet Union is believed to owe only DM10bn-DM12bn to commercial
banks, which have been steadily reducing their exposure over the last three
years.
Governments and banks announced a 90-day rollover of the debt at the end of
June after receiving interest payments of only Dollars 170m out of a total
of Dollars 1.2bn due in the first five months of the year.
The call, which amplified comments by Mr Wolfgang Roller, the bank's chief
executive, in Hamburg on Tuesday, comes ahead of next month's meeting of the
Paris Club of government creditors. Dresdner fears the Paris Club may do a
direct deal with the former Soviet Union involving a reduction of total debt
payable.
A better solution, according to Dresdner, would be formal rescheduling of
the debt over 2-3 years, avoiding a repetition of a government debt deal
with Poland in 1990.
Under government pressure at the time, banks were obliged to accept a 50 per
cent write-down of their debt, although on their own the banks had been able
able to negotiate better terms.
The International Monetary Fund yesterday formally announced it had approved
a Dollars 1.04bn loan for Russia to help it modernise and open up its
economy, Reuter reports from Washington.
The loan is expected to pave the way for further western assistance for
Russia, including World Bank credits and a rescheduling of debts.

A TREASURE trove of fish, gold and natural beauty, the South Kuriles' gently
sloping hills rise up under the mist as in a Japanese print. On the ground,
however, the islands which Japan wants back from Russia could not look more
Soviet.
As soon as you set foot on Kunashir, which is just 9km from Japan, a
fish-processing factory greets you with a huge slogan saying 'Glory to the
Working Class'. Rusting fishing boats and assorted rubbish litter a
makeshift harbour. An outsize bust of Lenin is the main attraction of the
local town's shapeless windswept square.
The island was seized by Soviet troops in the closing days of the second
world war, along with Eturup, Shikotan, and the Hobbemai group of islets. A
neglected outpost of the Soviet empire for 45 years, the four islands are
now at the centre of a bitter international dispute, with Japan making
large-scale aid and investment for Russia conditional upon their return.
While most of the 25,000 islanders, who came from all over the Soviet Union
after the Japanese population was deported en masse, oppose the islands'
return, most also favour extensive economic co-operation and open borders
with a country they see as an instant source of wealth. (Today, the only
Japanese presence on Kunashir is a 30-year-old teacher who is providing
Japanese language courses via the local newspaper).
Up to 30 per cent of the islanders would even welcome a handover.
'We should give the islands back to the Japanese and the sooner the better,'
exclaimed Mrs Zoya Ashurova, a native of Shikotan who was visiting her
conscript son on Kunashir. 'We live like beggars.'
Travelling on a Russian cruise ship for two days and nights to reach the
island from the closest bit of Russia - Sakhalin Island - underlined just
how cut off the islanders are.
Emphasising the impression that the Russians have been camping out despite
Russification - which has extended to giving local volcanoes new names such
as Ivan the Terrible - none of the islands has a harbour capable of
accommodating the passenger ships which are the main form of transport from
the islands.
Some moderates fear that even giving up the two smallest islands could set a
precedent for other claims on Russian territory. The islands are surrounded
by some of the richest fishing grounds in the world.
(In contrast to conditions for civilians, no expense has been spared for the
military, who have their own port for navy vessels at Shikotan.)
Dirt tracks substitute for roads (which cost four times as much to build
than on the mainland), social services and telecommunications are primitive
even by Russian standards and supplies of food are erratic and expensive.
The luxury liner I sailed on, for example, was lined with dozens of
cardboard boxes containing live chickens. Although many died on the way,
their owner's intention was to set up a chicken farm on Eturup, the largest
island. ('If I don't help him, who will?,' was how the ship's captain
explained his decision not to charge for the service).
For all the hardship, life on what Japan calls its Northern Territories
still has its attractions. Mrs Liudmila Danilova, 45, left Russia's sordid
Kuzbass mining region seven years ago to work in Kunashir's fish factory.
'The air is clean and the environment is beautiful. In the Kuzbass, the snow
turns black five minutes after falling to the ground, and now that I am used
to walking everywhere, the buses there seem stuffy,' she explained, saying
she did not think the islands should be given up.
Mr Valentin Fyodorov, the governor of the Sakhalin and Kurile region who
fiercely opposes ceding any territory, has staked his promises of a better
life for the islanders on a draft decree which, if signed by President Boris
Yeltsin, would provide substantial tax benefits and deploy the military to
build up infrastructure.
As he admitted in a letter to President Yeltsin earlier this year: 'The
socio-political situation of the Southern Kuriles has got even more acute at
the present time, a fact which is no secret to the Japanese side and serves
as an additional argument to strengthen its position in negotiations with
Russia.'
President Yeltsin, who visits Japan next month, has said the issue - which
differs from other territorial disputes in so far as Russia's borders with
Japan were never sealed in a peace treaty - should be resolved on the basis
of justice and legality.
Mr Mikhael Poltoranin, the deputy prime minister who is helping to prepare
the trip, said in Tokyo yesterday that Mr Yeltsin would announce his support
for the 1956 declaration in which Moscow agreed to return Hobbemai and
Shikotan but that it would be difficult for him to hand over territory in
the near future.
This is because of a conservative wave sweeping Russia which makes it
unlikely that the country will be parting with any territory in the near
future.
Even moderates fear that giving up the islands, even the two smallest ones,
could set a precedent for claims on Russian territory.
At parliamentary hearings last week military leaders reiterated that the
islands were strategically important for Russia because they control access
to the Pacific and because of the presence of US troops on Hokkaido island
in Japan.
Despite a thaw in relations which has translated into visits by Japanese
groups to the tombs of their ancestors, Mr Nikolai Pokidin, Kunashir's
mayor, says that he has given up waiting for the Japanese to bring money and
know-how to the islands.
'We smile politely like they do, but the more we orientate ourselves towards
the Japanese, the worse it will be for us,' he explained. 'They don't want
the islands to develop. They want to show that the government and the people
can't do anything here on their own and have to give them up.'
He says his aim is to attract foreign investment from North America, Europe,
and South East Asia to develop the fishing industry, plus unexploited areas
such as tourism and so far untouched mineral wealth, which includes 500
tonnes of gold and silver.
Despite the fact that rapid improvements are unlikely unless Japan ends its
embargo on any finance for the islands ('this is our only means of
leverage,' explained a Japanese diplomat), Mr Pokidin and others hope that
market reforms will do the trick. 'The real problem is not which country
these islands belong to but the fact that there has been no private
property,' says Mr Givi Kesayev, one of Kunashir's budding entrepreneurs,
who bought the island's first private fishing boat and plans to open a hotel
next. 'Everything will be fine once the island has real owners.'

The Luxembourg Bankers' Association (ABBL) has complained to the European
Commission that it tarnished Luxembourg's reputation as a banking centre by
releasing information prematurely about a probe into interest rate-fixing,
write Andrew Hill and Reuter in Brussels.
The Commission said last month it was 'urgently investigating' one unnamed
national banking association which recommended a level of commercial
interest rates to its members. Brussels cleared all other national
associations of illegal collusion.
Mr Charles Ruppert, the ABBL president, has complained to the Commission
that journalists received the information before they did.

Swedish unemployment soared in July to 307,000 or 6.5 per cent of the
workforce, the highest figure in half a century, writes Robert Taylor in
Stockholm.
Mr Gote Bernhardsson, head of AMS, the labour market board, warned that
Sweden's internationally famous labour market system with its emphasis on
training and work for the unemployed was under threat as a result of the
rapid escalation in the jobless total. The figure has more than doubled in a
year.

<TEXT>
Swiss political leaders want the referendum on joining the European Economic
Area postponed to next spring, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The poll has been scheduled for December 6. Postponement would mean that the
EEA, a free trade treaty between the European Community and the seven
members of the European Free Trade Association, could not start at the
beginning of next year as planned.
Leaders of the four coalition parties want more time to convince Swiss
voters of the merits of the EEA. To comply with the treaty, Switzerland has
to amend 60 laws in the next few months, many impinging on citizens' rights.
But politicians have yet to begin explaining the merits of the EEA.
The party leaders will put their views to the cabinet on August 24 at the
beginning of a special parliamentary session to deal with EEA-related
legislation.
Other Efta member countries, especially Sweden, have been pressing
Switzerland not to delay ratification.

<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in Germany rose by almost 180,000 in July as the economic
slowdown and the factory summer closedowns took their toll. In the west, a
further fall in utilisation of manufacturing capacity underlined the trend
to contraction.
The federal labour office blamed continuing industrial restructuring for
most of the 65,000 job losses in the east, which took unemployment to
1,188,200 or 14.6 per cent of the workforce.
The western total rose 112,000 to 1,827,700, or 6 per cent, the office said.
A survey of industrial plant usage by the Ifo economics institute showed 15
per cent of all manufacturing capacity standing idle, 0.6 per cent more than
in March.
Areas worst affected were investment goods, with 82.7 per cent of plant in
use, and components makers, with 83.9 per cent. The institute said
manufacturers had become more concerned that they would not be back at
optimal utilisation for another 12 months.
Overall manufacturing industry plant use and order backlogs are now back at
levels last seen around mid-1988.
Conditions in the western German labour market will continue to deteriorate
until the second half of next year, the Hamburg economics institute, HWWA,
said yesterday.
Average unemployment in 1993 would be 1.95m, compared with 1.8m this year,
while the total number employed would stagnate.

FT  06 AUG 92 / National Savings rates cut: Mortgage lenders say move eases
pressure to raise cost of borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD, PHILIP COGGAN, PETER NORMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT cut National Savings interest rates yesterday in a move
apparently aimed at avoiding mortgage rate rises by building societies. This
was the second rate cut by National Savings in just over two weeks.
The reduction comes at the end of a week of repeated warnings by the Council
of Mortgage Lenders and building society executives that they would soon be
forced to put up mortgage interest rates because of competition from
National Savings.
National Savings rates have been cut on a variety of products by between
0.25 and 0.8 percentage points. The 37th issue of tax-free certificates,
introduced only in May, has been withdrawn. The new 38th issue will pay 7.5
per cent if held for five years, against 8 per cent on the 37th issue.
Mortgage lenders welcomed the news, saying it removed the likelihood of an
immediate rates rise.
Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, which earlier in the day called for
the stamp duty threshold to be doubled to Pounds 60,000 to help the housing
market, said the National Savings decision eased some of the competitive
pressures on interest rates but added: 'We will still need to watch the
situation closely.'
Nationwide, the second-largest society, said it might be able to make a
small reduction in its savings rates.
Yesterday's cuts followed a sharp increase in the contribution of National
Savings' products to funding the public sector borrowing requirement in
recent months. National Savings estimated that it contributed Pounds 600m to
funding the PSBR last month, lifting its total contribution to financing the
government deficit to Pounds 2.1bn in the first four months of the financial
year.
The government's official PSBR target for 1992-93 is Pounds 28bn, but the
outturn is expected to be several billion pounds higher.
Treasury officials said this inflow was well ahead of the share of funding
allocated to National Savings. Explaining yesterday's cuts, Mr Anthony
Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government did 'not
wish to see National Savings interest rates kept any higher than is
necessary to make their contribution to funding'.
Treasury officials denied that this third cut in National Savings rates
since the election was a direct result of pressure from the building
societies to make National Savings rates less attractive. But they admitted
that ministers had taken into account the effect of the high level of
inflows into National Savings on building society finances.
The officials added that the decision had no implications for UK bank base
rates, which have been at 10 per cent since May 5. Base rates would be kept
at whatever level was necessary to maintain sterling's position in the
European exchange rate mechanism and to continue to bear down on inflation,
they said.
City economists said the cuts showed that last month's half-point reduction
in the First Option Bond rate had failed to bolster building society
inflows.
Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the cuts, so
soon after the July measure, gave the impression the government was
panicking in its desire to avoid higher mortgage rates. It was unclear that
the latest move would be sufficient 'to do the trick'.
The move was welcomed by senior Tory backbenchers, some of whom have been
critical of the government's economic policy in recent weeks. Mr Terence
Higgins, former chairman of the all-party Treasury and Civil Service
committee, said it was 'entirely sensible' for the government to adopt a
'flexible attitude' in current circumstances.
Mr Nick Brown, Labour's frontbench Treasury spokesman, described the move as
'a very small adjustment' which was 'unlikely to meet the needs of the
present situation'.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Oftel and BT rule outreferral of dispute to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM and Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulator, have
ruled out referring their dispute over a tighter price-control regime to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
An agreement ending the acrimonious row is expected later this week or early
next week.
The apparent solution contrasts with the situation in the gas industry.
British Gas last week decided to seek an MMC referral after failing to agree
with Ofgas, its regulator, over the rates of return on its pipeline and
storage business.
BT is still negotiating with Oftel over details of the new regime, but Mr
Michael Hepher, managing director, yesterday said that a reference to the
MMC was 'not the climate in which the discussions are being held'.
The statement reflects a marked change in the stance of the
telecommunications group, which had resisted strenuously proposals made by
Oftel in June that it should cut the price of a basket of its main services
in each year from 1993 to 1996 by 7.5 percentage points below the rate of
inflation. At present, BT is required to reduce prices each year by 6.25
percentage points below the annual inflation rate.
Oftel had also recommended that BT be required to publish separate accounts
for its main businesses as a means of helping competitors get access to its
network on fair terms.
BT's unhappiness over the pricing scheme came to a head last week at the
company's annual meeting, when Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, accused
regulators of privatised industries of threatening their success and warned
that BT would find it very difficult to accept the tighter price controls.
For its part, Oftel had made it clear to BT that none of the main elements
of the new regime was open to negotiation. Although the regulator had not
changed its stance on that point, 'there is room for interpretation of one
or two points', an Oftel representative said yesterday.
These relate specifically to the separation of accounts, which, from BT's
point of view, would mean making sensitive information available to
competitors.
'The implementation of the account separation has to be discussed,' Oftel
said.
Resolution of the dispute could mean that BT would introduce substantial
cuts in connection charges, as required by Oftel, this year, rather than
continuing to increase connection charges.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Mandela musters 50,000 in peaceful protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFRICAN nationalism peacefully confronted Afrikanerdom yesterday as Mr
Nelson Mandela led more than 50,000 supporters through the heart of Pretoria
to the seat of white government.
A line of heavily armed police stood between the Union Buildings housing the
offices of President F. W. de Klerk and the African National Congress
president, who repeated his demand for an early transition to majority rule.
Hailing the 48-hour general strike that ended on Tuesday night as
'unquestionably one of the great events in our history', Mr Mandela went on:
'The campaign for peace and democracy must become a tidal wave which will
thrust our country into a future where justice prevails, peace is assured
and democracy becomes a way of life.'
The good-humoured crowd, gathered on the slopes below Union Buildings,
responded enthusiastically. 'Forward to an interim government of national
unity,' urged Mr Mandela, a slogan which the crowd clearly found something
of a mouthful, though dutifully shouting the refrain 'Forward.'
It was a day, however, on which the occasion, rich in symbolism, was more
important than the speech itself. The massive turnout will have reinforced
the ANC's status as the country's most popular party and demonstrated its
capacity to marshal its followers. No incidents of violence were reported.
The party itself is in no doubt about its prospects. 'Today we are at the
door of Union Buildings,' announced Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary
general. 'Next time, F. W. de Klerk, we are going to be inside your office.'
The police - black, white, and coloured (mixed race) - listened impassively.
On the slopes below Mr Mandela, the packed crowd engulfed the statue of
Louis Botha, Boer war general and first prime minister of the Union of South
Africa. Sitting astride his horse, the man revered in Afrikaner history
suffered the indignity of being draped in the banners of the Kwathema branch
of the ANC and the South African Communist party.
On a garden terrace above Mr Mandela, another mounted Boer war hero, JBM
Herzog, founder of the party that Mr de Klerk leads and prime minister from
1924 to 1939, gave shelter to bearers of more ANC banners.
Unfurled above Mr Mandela was the black, green and gold ANC flag; fluttering
behind it the orange, white and blue of the South African counterpart.
His amplified voice reverberating in the natural amphitheatre, and certainly
audible to the occupants of the horseshoe-shaped, pillared building a
hundred yards behind him, Mr Mandela called on the government to take
'practical steps' to curb political violence, agree to form an interim
government and demonstrate a 'commitment to a sovereign, democratically
elected constituent assembly'.
If the demands were not met, negotiations could not be resumed, he warned.
Most observers, however, believe that sufficient progress has been made
since talks were broken off last June to allow an early resumption.
Mr Mandela's speech broke little, if any, new ground, barely touching on the
party's strategy should talks remain deadlocked. Instead he left the issue
hanging, saying: 'What happens next, and what form the campaign for peace
and democracy takes, depends on how the government responds to our demands.'
The third day of a week of action that is intended to force an early
transition to majority rule was marked by marches and demonstrations in
other important centres.
The heart of Durban, Natal, was brought to a standstill as thousands of
protestors gathered in and around the main post office, a government
building and a leading department store.
In Cape Town, an estimated 50,000-strong crowd blocked the city's streets,
lit a freedom flame and protested against 'taxation without representation'.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Futures buying lifts Frankfurt
and Paris
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRATEGISTS were not inclined to take Frankfurt's improvement to their
hearts yesterday, especially given indications that futures-related trading
lifted both German and French shares yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT turned an early decline into a slight gain on futures-related
buying. At midsession the FAZ was just 0.99 lower at 636.62 and by the
close, the DAX index, hovering above 1,600, stood 17.30 or 1.1 per cent
higher at 1,628.81. Turnover rose from DM4.1bn to DM5.0bn.
Deutsche Bank's 3 per cent decline in first-half operating profits were
below the trend for banks in general, but indications of a softening economy
raised hopes that the Bundesbank would not increase the Lombard rate at
today's meeting.
Strong points included the interest rate-sensitive Bavarian banks, the
cyclical chemicals and steels and Allianz, the top insurer which came under
pressure last week. Deutsche Bank did not rise in line with the market,
ending DM5 higher at DM635.
Also trailing were the carmakers Daimler and BMW, up just DM1.50 to DM674
and DM3.50 to DM564 respectively. Daimler's denial of rumours of short-term
working at Mercedes-Benz was not reported until after hours.
PARIS was again driven by opinion polls on French voters' intentions in the
Maastricht referendum. The CAC 40 index ended 10.35 higher at 1,797.98, but
fell short of 1,800, in thin turnover of FFr1.4bn. Dealers said that trading
was becoming increasingly technical and driven by the futures market.
Euro Disney continued to recover as some investors sought over-sold
situations and several brokers published buy notes. The stock added another
FFr2.35 or 2.7 per cent to FFr89.10.
Peugeot remained weak, falling FFr10 to FFr667 on news of a 2.9 per cent
increase in first-half turnover to FFr82.61bn.
Ciments Francais dropped FFr15 or 4.4 per cent to FFr325 after reporting a 5
per cent drop in first-half turnover.
MILAN ran out of steam after its two-day rally, although rumours that the
government was planning measures to support the market lifted prices after
hours. The Comit index fell 4.98 to 419.63 in turnover estimated at L80bn
after L67bn.
After hours, Assogestioni said that Italian investment funds had a net
outflow of L794bn in July, compared with a net outflow of L26bn in June.
ZURICH followed Frankfurt to end higher on moderate turnover, as chemicals
and financials led the SMI index to a gain of 14.9 at 1,820.3. Dealers were
also looking for a slowdown in Swiss inflation today, possibly to a July
figure of between 3.8 and 3.9 per cent after 4.2 per cent in June.
AMSTERDAM was firmer ahead of today's half-year results from Philips and
Royal Dutch. Royal Dutch rose 60 cents to Fl 146.40 while Philips added 10
cents to Fl 25.10. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.7 at 118.1.
KLM advanced 70 cents to Fl 32.30 after reporting a 14 per cent increase in
airline traffic in July from a year earlier.
COPENHAGEN fell to a new 1992 low with the all-share index down 2.05 at
303.64, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Banks weakened on expectations
of disappointing half-year results. Danske Bank and Unibank both lost DKr5,
to DKr245 and DKr156 respectively.
OSLO featured a record low in Uni Storebrand, the free shares closing down
NKr1.50 at NKr20.50. The all-share index lost 4.68 or 1.24 per cent to
371.93 in turnover of Nkr150.9m.
STOCKHOLM saw losses in the banking sector offset by Astra and Volvo as the
Affarsvarlden index ended 1.2 lower at 863.1 in thin turnover of SKr224m.
Astra B shares rose SKr6 to SKr551 274 while Volvo added SKr4 to SKr346 on
the back of good US car sales.
VIENNA slipped to an intraday all-time low of 759.32 before recovering
slightly to close down 6.55 at 764.05. Austrian Airlines eased Sch26 to
Sch1,580 after announcing a first half pre-tax loss of Sch251m.
MADRID was mixed with the general index gaining 0.10 to 217.87, but turnover
remained very low. Repsol slipped Pta25 to Pta 2,635 but with only 87,000
shares traded.
BRUSSELS rose at the close of the trading account. The Bel-20 index gained
2.47 to 1,138.75 in low turnover of BFr521m. ISTANBUL retreated in technical
trading. The 75-share index fell 16.33 to 4,174.37 in turnover of TL165bn.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rallies on
government support plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS welcomed reports of the government's economic support measures and
share prices rallied, with the Nikkei average briefly breaking through
16,000, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained a net 291.05 at 15,983.64 on arbitrage- related purchases
by dealers and small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors.
It opened at the day's low of 15,718.09 and rose to 16,074.47 before
profit-taking emerged in the afternoon.
Volume was thin but improved from 143m shares to 180m. Traders noted
increased interest from investors but said buy orders were made in small
lots.
Advances led declines by 512 to 409, with 154 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks put on 13.17 to 1,213.34, but in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.32 at 977.67.
Reports that life insurance companies were shifting cash from money markets
into equities also helped sentiment. Life insurers said the government's
reported plans to buy real estate held by banks as collateral for bad loans
were encouraging. 'It seems that the government is finally becoming serious
about supporting the economy and the stock market,' commented an official at
Sumitomo Life.
Traders said some foreign investors have also started to shift funds from
overseas stock markets to Japan. 'US pension funds are putting long term
money into the market,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg.
Bank issues rallied on the government support measures. Industrial Bank of
Japan advanced Y50 to Y1,760 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,360. Real estate
companies were also higher, with Mitsui Fudosan rising Y11 to Y820.
High-technology blue chips moved forward on bargain hunting, Hitachi by Y30
to Y760 and NEC by Y17 to Y782. Fujitsu, however, fell Y13 to Y575 on
reports that it would incur a consolidated net loss of Y10bn for the interim
term to September. Company officials acknowledged the figure but added that
the group would post a profit for the full year. Fujitsu will also halt
production at its semiconductor plant in San Diego.
Dealers continued to liquidate holdings in speculative theme stocks. Meiji
Milk Products, still the market's leading active, receded Y7 to Y797 and
Mochida Pharmaceutical lost Y110 to Y2,670.
Marui, the department store, firmed Y30 to Y1,030 on speculation that it
would be included in the Nikkei index. Market participants expect a
reshuffle of index component stocks in October.
In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 39.98 to 17,573.87 in volume of 26.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE PACIFIC Basin markets were mostly easier yesterday.
SEOUL fell to its lowest close since December 1987 on rumours that Daewoo
chairman Mr Kim Woo-choong is to establish a new political party to contest
the presidential elections due later this year. The composite index shed
8.15 to 493.33.
Daewoo Group companies declined sharply and the suspension of garment maker
Hyupjin Enterprise further dampened sentiment.
SINGAPORE was depressed by disappointing half-year results from Far East
Levingston Shipbuilding. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 13.72 to
1,442.03. FELS weakened 40 cents to SDollars 3.08 while Keppel, its parent
group, fell 35 cents to SDollars 6.40.
HONG KONG lost further ground in dull trading. The Hang Seng index dipped
18.54 to 5,841.24 in turnover of HKDollars 1.69bn. Hutchison Whampoa eased
20 cents to HKDollars 15.60 on rumours that it will announce a rights issue
today when it reports interim results.
TAIWAN rose on news of a fall in inflation in July. The weighted index
advanced 46.73, or 1.1 per cent, to 4,134.91 in turnover of TDollars 20.7bn.
MANILA declined after Philippine Long Distance Telephone reported lower than
expected first-half earnings. The composite index lost 6.13 to 1,485.85 in
combined turnover of 264m pesos. PLDT fell 20 pesos to 1,060 pesos.
NEW ZEALAND was driven lower by falls in some leading stocks. The NZSE-40
index ended 11.48 off at 1,549.85 after turnover of NZDollars 24m.
AUSTRALIA was dull as investors awaited the federal budget on August 18. The
All Ordinaries index lost 7.1 to 1,605.4 in turnover of ADollars 164.6m.
Retailers suffered, with Coles Myer down 28 cents at ADollars 10.92, while
banks further weakened.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index eased 0.96 to 602.58. RJ Reynolds fell 20
cents to MDollars 3.32 after announcing that it was to cut the price of one
of its cigarette brands.
BANGKOK improved on rises in bank, construction materials and finance
stocks. The SET index put on 7.03 to 761.51 in high turnover of Bt9.84bn.
BOMBAY fell for the third day in a row as institutional demand could not
offset continued nervous selling. The BSE index dropped 56.26, or 2.1 per
cent, to 2,630.23.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: Political setback sparks downturn in
Argentina - But the sharp drop in July has made share prices look
interesting once again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange had little to celebrate on its 138th
birthday yesterday. Prices have fallen sharply over the past six weeks,
abruptly ending one of South America's more impressive bull runs.
After decades in the doldrums, the stock market exploded to life in 1991
with a world record-breaking 396 per cent increase. But so far this year,
share prices have fallen by 11.2 per cent. In July alone, equities lost
one-third of their value, bringing the market's capitalisation down to
Dollars 23.35bn, from a peak of Dollars 32.13bn in mid-June.
Mr Eugenio Reynal, head of equities at Merchant Bankers Asociados, a Buenos
Aires investment house, says: 'The market over-reacted on the way up and it
over-reacted on the way down. It showed that the market lacks
professionalism.' He expects prices to recover, but not to the heights of
late last year.
At first sight there was no clear reason for the decline. The economy is
performing well, with growth forecast at 6 per cent. Government finances are
sound and inflation is low. Business investment is picking up slowly, in
spite of uncertainty about the strength of the consumer-led boom that began
18 months ago.
However, foreign investors are angry at the cheating by some local brokers
and dishonest accounting practices. Insider trading and front-running are
rife, but the government's equity watchdog has done little to impose
discipline. It recently fined one company the equivalent of Dollars 7,917
for deceiving the market, the maximum legal penalty.
It seems that profit-taking and a political setback for the government when
it failed to win a Buenos Aires by-election in June sparked the downturn.
Once the retreat gathered pace, nothing could stop it, especially after
leveraged buyers began to abandon the market.
Many punters had borrowed in March to buy Dollars 1.2bn worth of equity sold
by the government in Telecom, one of Argentina's two privatised telephone
companies. About Dollars 240m to Dollars 300m worth of Telecom shares were
financed by banks, which were left holding the stock when an increasing
number of clients refused to make margin calls.
Telecom shares were offered to the public at Dollars 4.20 each; now they are
worth a little more than Dollars 3. The Telecom flop, as well as a setback
for punters, may make it harder for the government to unload a further
Dollars 5bn worth of privatisation stocks in the future. Furthermore, the
Telecom issue was heavily geared towards individual investors, who now have
little incentive to return to the market.
Mr Juan Carlos Sanchez Arnau, privatisations under-secretary, says there is
no need for concern, but warns that the 'public must be more realistic and
learn to pay the correct price, reducing substantially the margin for
speculation'. He may be right, but his advice will sound cynical to
investors tempted into the market by the government.
After the bloodbath of recent weeks, the outlook for Argentine equities now
looks brighter since the plunge has made prices look interesting once again.
Merchant Bankers Asociados now estimates the prospective price/earnings
ratio for steelmaker Acindar at 13, against its previous estimate of 29. Its
p/e for footwear company Alpargatas is down to 17 from 34.
The slide in the overall market index hides interesting shifts in individual
stocks. Renault, the French carmaker's local subsidiary which has 28 per
cent of its equity on the market, has soared 285 per cent this year.
Smaller, less liquid stocks have outperformed the blue chips. Second-tier
equities have risen 71 per cent in the first seven months of the year.
Optimists point to the expected creation in 1993 of Argentina's first
private pension funds. If legislation clears Congress in time, they are
expected to invest Dollars 7bn to Dollars 8bn of contributions every year,
making them a potentially captive market for new equity issues.

</HEADLINE>

DESPITE RELATIVELY slow buying interest from Japanese brokers, Australian
wool sale reports indicate a generally firm and unchanged market in the
second week of the new selling season. There was some disappointment when
wool sold at virtually unchanged prices after the July recess, but no
downturn followed. The Australian Wool Corporations market indicator, which
closed at 545c/kg at the end of June, was down to 535c/kg on August 5, but
this was only one cent down on the previous day. In the wool using industry
some sectors are busy but others are more directly affected by recession and
continue to find trade difficult.

London COCOA prices closed easier, but above the key support area of Pounds
662 a tonne for the December contract. 'The market's done exactly what we
wanted - slipped back a bit and then consolidated in steady volume.
Everything looks set for another go on the upside,' one trader said. In New
York cocoa futures were narrowly mixed by midday. 'The market is digesting
its recent gains. The weather continues to be dry in the Ivory coast and the
market should maintain a steady tone,' a New York trader said. On the LME
Chinese buying interest helped COPPER, NICKEL and ALUMINIUM. The copper
market showed a marked reluctance to fall, with recent declines meeting good
support between Dollars 2,480 and Dollars 2,490 a tonne for three-month
metal. The Polish copper miners' strike is also a background factor, dealers
said. Aluminium softened in the afternoon on liquidation after August option
declarations, although reports of Chinese buying interest cushioned the
decline, dealers said. New York COTTON futures were lower at midday, with
Japan continuing to stay out of the US export market. Traders continue to be
concerned about the Delta crop, hit by insect infestation.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold struggles to stay above
Dollars 350 an ounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD STRUGGLED yesterday to stay above Dollars 350 a troy ounce, which some
analysts described as 'a pivotal level.' If the precious metal breaks below
Dollars 348 an ounce today, some dealers feel it will quickly fall to just
above Dollars 340.
Analysts suggested that gold's rise in the past three weeks reflected the
work of professional operators who, once they could not push the price
convincingly through Dollars 360 an ounce, decided to take their profits.
'The rise was inspired by the dollar's weakness but, apart from the
professionals, there was no one out there buying. There appears to be little
buying by investors at large,' said Mr Philip Taylor, analyst at SG Warburg,
the financial services group. 'The investment funds are probably
disappointed that the price did not move up further, but there is no
compelling reason for buying gold just now.'
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Durlacher and Company, a stockbroking
organisation, pointed out that operators found it very difficult in what was
a holiday period for most countries in the northern hemisphere to boost gold
past Dollars 360 an ounce. 'There was just not enough steam to take it
through Dollars 361 in August, so they decided to take their profits and go
on holiday themselves.'
He pointed out that August was 'a difficult month for gold' and that even
during the big bull run in 1973 the upward surge in the price halted in that
month.
Some London dealers suggested that early selling yesterday could have been
as much as 250,000 ounces (nearly eight tonnes) to move the market as
quickly as it did. Consistent and sizeable selling had also been evident at
recent London price 'fixing' sessions and this gave the impression that
central banks might have been selling from their stocks.
Fears of central bank sales have been raised again this week by Uruguay's
revelation that it sold 50,000 ounces of gold in July to raise about Dollars
17.9m and as part of a new policy of converting its gold reserves into
dollar fixed-term deposits.
Gold closed in London last night at Dollars 350.35 an ounce, down Dollars
2.40 from Tuesday's close. But after the European close the price dipped
again to Dollars 349.75 at one stage. On the New York Commodity Exchange
dealers at midday were quoting bullion at Dollars 349.55 an ounce.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Strong Asian demand for IADB Dollars
500m paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inter-American Development Bank yesterday launched a Dollars 500m
offering in the Eurobond market which relied on strong demand from Asian
investors to achieve an aggressive pricing.
The deal was priced to yield just 18 basis points above the five-year US
Treasury, a level which London-based dealers agreed was very tight compared
with paper in the secondary market.
For example, a five-year deal launched by the same borrower at the start of
the year was quoted at a spread of 23 basis points over the curve, while
Oesterreichische Kontrollbank's recent five-year issue was trading at a
spread of 21 basis points.
The tight spread proved a deterrent to European investors, but strong demand
from south-east Asia, particularly Hong Kong, proved sufficient to ensure a
strong performance.
Dealers reported particular interest from a number of Asian central banks.
Asian investors have become very bullish on the US dollar, and favour the
five-year area of the yield curve, according to traders. As a result, they
appeared less concerned about spread valuations than their European
counterparts.
In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM300m issue
of floating-rate notes. The issue was targetted at Italian investors, for
whom EIB paper is tax exempt.
Lead-manager Dresdner Bank said some sales were also made in Austria, where
the EIB has the same tax-exempt status.
Strong Italian demand for tax-exempt floating-rate paper created an
extremely attractive funding opportunity for the EIB, which is paying
interest of 85 basis points below the six-month D-Mark London interbank
offered rate.
Dealers said that, if the borrower had launched a fixed-rate D-Mark deal,
the post-swap funding costs would have been about 50 basis points higher.
Elsewhere, more European banks took advantage of Swiss demand for
floating-rate notes offering a minimum coupon level above current money
market rates.
ABN Amro Bank and Bank Austria each raised Dollars 100m of subordinated
debt, which counts as lower tier 2 capital under Basle capital adequacy
guidelines.
Germany's LKB added a further Dollars 100m to its Dollars 150m issue of
floating-rate notes launched last week via JP Morgan.
Two Swedish banks suffered further blows to their credit quality yesterday.
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, had its
long-term debt rating lowered from AA- to A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
rating agency. Yesterday's move by S&amp;P follows a downgrade by Moody's, the
other leading agency, in May from Aa2 to Aa3.
S&amp;P said that its decision reflected the deterioration of the banks' asset
quality and increased pressure on earnings caused by non-performing loans,
especially in the Swedish real estate sector.
Meanwhile, Sweden's third-largest commercial bank, Nordbanken, had its debt
rating cut from AA- to A+ by IBCA, the London-based credit rating agency,
citing similar causes.
A double-A credit rating is a crucial threshold for some investors and
counterparties, who do not accept credits below that level.

resume growth

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S domestic commercial paper (CP) market will grow again, but credit
risks will rise, Moody's Investors Service said in a study released this
week, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Growth will resume because of more liberal market regulations, Japanese
corporations' increased use of domestic CP for working capital purposes and
of Japanese banks' reduced ability to offer either competitive short-term
lending rates or CP investor protection, the study said.
Yen CP outstandings grew to a peak of Y15,800bn (Dollars 124.16bn) in 1990,
falling to Y9,400bn in June 1991, and was about Y9,700bn in March 1992.
Until 1991, about 90 per cent of yen commercial paper was issued for
financial arbitrage, where issuers ploughed the funds back into
higher-yielding investments. Such arbitrage has become more difficult,
causing volume to taper off, Moody's said.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Polls show decline in French support for European union

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government announced the dates of the official campaign for next
month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty yesterday as the latest poll
showed a slightly smaller majority - of 56 per cent - planning to vote yes.
The Paris stock market rose by 1 per cent before the poll results were
unveiled as speculation that they showed a majority for Maastricht dispelled
fears of a negative result.
But shares faltered in the afternoon to close only slightly higher on the
day, with the CAC 40 index up 0.58 per cent at 1,798.
The poll, conducted by the BVA research consultancy for today's edition of
Paris-Match magazine, showed that, of those who had decided to take part, 56
per cent would vote for the treaty and 44 per cent against.
The result marks a new low in support for European union less than seven
weeks before the September 20 referendum, which is seen elsewhere in Europe
as a decisive test of public opinion.
The poll confirms a steady decline in support, following an IFOP poll in
Tuesday's Liberation newspaper which indicated that 57 per cent of the
French planned to vote yes and 43 per cent no, compared with 62 per cent in
favour little more than a month ago.
Most of the French have already taken a final decision as to which way to
vote, according to the Paris-Match poll, with 69 per cent claiming to have
'definitely' decided.
The French government will continue to run its press and poster advertising
campaign in favour of Maastricht until Monday.
A number of celebrity socialist sympathisers, including Mr Johnny Hallyday,
the veteran pop star, have promised to campaign for in favour of a yes vote.
Mr Paul Quiles, minister of the interior, yesterday announced that all
commercially funded campaigns must stop at the end of this month.
Official political campaigning will run from September 7 to 19 with
television and radio airtime allocated to each political party according to
their number of deputies and senators.

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered had prepared the market for its losses in India, though
not perhaps for the additional Pounds 50m general provision announced
yesterday. But there is a natural temptation to scan its interim results for
signs of the next calamity. The bank is now so well marked out as accident
prone that it is legitimate to ask whether its management controls are yet
tight enough for an organisation with such broad international operations.
There must be some risk attached to cumulative loan loss provisions of only
5 per cent of its Dollars 780m South African exposure despite the
deteriorating political climate there. Again, it is curious that the first
half saw no net provisions at all on Pounds 11bn of assets in the
Asia-Pacific region. The bank is also coy about the extent of its dependence
on the Hong Kong market, which is presently strong but vulnerable to a turn
in US interest rates and any shift in China's political climate.
Of course, there may be no further problems in the pipeline. In that case
Standard Chartered could look forward to a steady decline in provisions. The
80 per cent tax charge will also fall as the Indian problem works its way
through. But there is little sign of growth in operating income. The bank
would argue that exchange rate movements mask underlying growth in local
currencies, but it cannot have it both ways. If the dollar were not so weak,
its tier 1 capital ratio would be much less comfortable than the 4.9 per
cent reported yesterday.

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Smith &amp; Nephew
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith &amp; Nephew has promised much over the past two years but somehow failed
to deliver. A string of acquisitions in high-growth healthcare leaves it
poised for earnings recovery: but this has been the story since 1990.
Yesterday's interim figures are respectable, but real earnings growth is as
elusive as ever.
There are plenty of reasons to remain cautious, even assuming a cyclical
revival in demand for premium sun-cream and moisture lotion improves the
dire performance of the consumer products side. With 40 per cent of sales
now in the US, the weakness of the dollar will hit earnings in the second
half and possibly beyond. The tax charge rose to 29 per cent this year. It
will climb higher in 1993 without a remarkable increase in UK profits
against which to offset ACT. In areas of high sales growth, such as
artificial joints and key-hole surgery, there is short-term pressure on
margins as S&amp;N breaks into new markets such as Germany and Japan.
A broader question is whether margins can be protected across the healthcare
business. Sales growth ran at 11 per cent in the first half and may reach 15
per cent by the middle of the decade. If S&amp;N can keep control of pricing,
shareholders could be rewarded for their patience after all. Yet mainstream
pharmaceuticals companies have already suffered the budgetary constraints
imposed on their public sector customers. There is no reason to believe S&amp;N
will be immune. On a prospective p/e of 15, the shares look fully valued.

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: GKN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be churlish to describe GKN's results as anything but good. Strong
control of costs has helped the management overcome flat market conditions,
and the profits increase exceeded most expectations. There are more good
things in the pipeline. The full benefit of staff reductions will come
through in the second half, helping earnings even without a pick-up in the
world economy.
Beyond that, the company has succeeded in getting its drivelines designated
as components on some promising car models, notably the new Audi 80. So it
should be able to increase its market share. With a proven ability to
improve productivity, the company should also be able to cope with
cut-throat pricing of components. The same cannot be said of others.
But much of this has been reflected in the rise of the shares since the turn
of the year. GKN's yield, relative to the market, stands near a 10-year low,
presumably on expectations the company can avoid a dividend cut in the
toughest of conditions. Yet given the low level of cover, and the poor
economic outlook, it will be 1994-95 before there is any realistic prospect
of a dividend increase. That limits prospects for the shares. If its good
performance continues, the company may eventually deserve a lower yield
premium to the market. But that time has not yet arrived.

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Savings grace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Are building society leaders becoming the Arthur Scargills of the 1990s?
Three weeks ago the explicit threat of a rise in the mortgage rate forced
the government to cut the return on a key National Savings product by half a
point. Last night, however, they scored an even bigger victory when fresh
mutterings of the need for higher borrowing costs were answered by the news
that rates on a wide range of other National Savings instruments will now be
reduced.
Lenders, to be sure, are in a pickle. The net outflow of funds from
societies last month was probably at least as great as the net Pounds 314m
which went out of their doors in June. The government has certainly been
partly to blame, being a more aggressive bidder for retail funds at the
moment than at any time since the early 1980s. At the same time the
alternative for the societies of tapping the wholesale market has been
largely closed off because most of the big ones are knocking up against
limits imposed by the regulator. Given the advancing tide of repossessions,
moreover, this is arguably no time to be narrowing margins. Insurance
companies have picked up most of the bad debts so far under mortgage
indemnity schemes - but house prices have now fallen to such an extent in
the south-east that a significant proportion of losses has to be borne by
the lender.
This said, it is curious that the government - given its own pressing
financial needs - should have rolled over so easily a second time.
Desperation to avoid an increase in the mortgage rate is understandable  -
but then the societies would surely have thought long and hard about a
course of action which would also jeopardise the quality of their own
lending. On the face of it, they are still making tidy profits and are
better capitalised than they were four years ago.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The 'upwards only' price mentality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspapers used to be known for Spanish practices - union activities which
enforced above-market rates of pay for mythical work.
There is a similar danger that the retail rental property market will become
known for inflationary practices. There is a parallel to the practices
discussed by David Sawers in the FT on Tuesday which inflate the prices of
some UK goods.
Prevailing property practices increase the costs of reducing inflation and
aggravate the degree to which the impact of a monetary squeeze comes in lost
sales and jobs, bankruptcies and vacant premises, as distinct from lower
prices for the final customer.
As Prof John Burton explains in a new study* the problem arises in retail
rents because only about 4 per cent of payments represent new leases
negotiated in current market conditions. The vast majority paid reflect past
agreements. The 1990 rent level for shops was about 80 per cent higher than
the pre-1985 norm and has since fallen back only slightly. Yet there is
widespread excess capacity in retailing and property values have fallen by
about 20 per cent from their 1988-89 peaks.
The market is characterised by 25-year leases with provisions for
upwards-only rent review every five years. Such leases are a product of the
'never had it so good' Macmillan period of relatively stable economic growth
and inexorable, but creeping, inflation. The institutions wanted a secure
inflation-proof investment; and large retailers security of tenure. Such
leases are, however, out of date in a severe and possibly secular property
depression.
The biggest falls in values have been in office accommodation. But, perhaps
because they find it harder to pack bags and move, the biggest complaints
come from retailers and small businesses.
Most of us know of rows of high street shops remaining vacant because small
shopkeepers have quit rather than pay the rent demanded. I mentioned last
week the initiative by Sir Desmond Pitcher of Littlewoods to enlist the
support of other large retailers to update the commercial leasing system.
Meanwhile, however, a host of campaigns has proliferated among small
businesses. One of the most professional has been Camforr (Campaign for Rent
Reform) run by a doctor and a surveyor**.
Camforr wants to end:
upwards-only rent reviews;
'unfair lease assignment clauses';
'unfair arbitration clauses for rent reviews'; and
confidentiality clauses on rent agreements.
'Unfair lease assignments', refer to a peculiar provision of English (not
Scottish) law known as privity, by which the original lease-holder is
responsible for the debts of successive holders - conjuring up the picture
of the retired grocer in Bognor Regis being presented with the bills of a
defaulting tenth holder, of whose existence he had not previously known. The
Law Commission has itself called for reform.
Confidentiality clauses bring out the conflict between the right to
confidentiality and the need for maximum information in an effective market
 -a specific example of the much-discussed conflict between an open society
and the right to privacy. A compromise would be to enforce disclosure which
would be aggregated into indices before publication.
Reform of upwards-only rent reviews must proceed with care. A county court
has recently held an upwards-only rent review clause void. But there is
still something in the view of Sir Peregrine Rhodes of the British Property
Federation that 'present leases have been freely negotiated. . . It would be
unacceptable to declare such contracts void'.
The main focus of the argument lies with the five-yearly rent reviews which
are supposed to re-establish rents at open-market levels. One reason why
this does not happen is that there is, according to Burton, a 'contrived
contractual inconsistency' between the upwards-only clauses and the
requirement in the same leases to set new rents at market levels. But
second, and more controversially, Burton says that arbitrators and experts
appointed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors instead of going
by standard market analysis - which would concentrate on the excess of
demand or supply and expected future inflation - focus too much on
'comparables'. These include newly agreed rents of comparable premises but
ignore, according to Burton, the zero rents from vacant promises. The
institution's head, Michael Pattison, has said that it will 'respond to
requests for a new look at lease and valuation issues'.
If arbitrators and adjudicators were to do more to bring rents down to
market levels the upwards-only provisions might gradually be negotiated out
of existence voluntarily.
It would then be only realistic that legislation designed to protect tenants
from market forces should also go - an example being the provisions of the
Landlord-Tenant Act, which can provide for up to 14 years' security of
tenure after the expiry of a lease.
A specific landlord's grievance is that business rates are levied at 50 per
cent on vacant property; a belated response to the outcry over Centre Point,
which stood vacant in the 1960s. The result, however, is that landlords have
an incentive to 'strip out' their properties to avoid the charge, something
that a bank with a household name has been seriously advised to do for a
Pounds 1.5m property in the City. The moral is that hasty tinkering can do
more harm than good.
The property market will in any case come out of the recession with a
changing institutional framework. The pension fund and insurance companies
will be less inclined to put property into their portfolios and the gap will
have to be met by other kinds of investor.
That itself need not be a tragedy. Keynes once remarked that if investment
is the by-product of a casino, the job is unlikely to be well done. Is it
likely to be better done if it is a by-product of the pensions industry?
A more serious problem is the Pounds 40bn of bank loans tied up in property
investments of all kinds. If there were ever to be a systemic threat here,
the Bank of England should act directly to maintain bank deposits rather
than countenance restrictive practices.
The intractable issues raised by property rental practices are one example
of the harm done by even modest inflation which would not occur to
undergraduate debaters. They are also an example of how difficult it is to
eradicate inflation once it has taken hold.
What the government needs to do is to give a push to the talks now going on
and to inject a greater market flavour into them. The issue is worth the
personal attention of the Board of Trade president, Michael Heseltine, and
his adviser, Walter Eltis.

Sharp-eyed readers of Banking World may have noticed a slight change in the
recent full-page colour advertisements for prints of Classic Yachts of the

features in them both.
However, the latest version no longer highlights the bankers' special
discount on a Lady Ghislaine print signed by Maxwell's skipper, Gus Rankin.
It appears that some office wallah inside Banking World, the official
journal of The Chartered Institute of Bankers, felt his masters might not be
too pleased by yet another reminder of how much money has been sunk into the
Maxwell empire.
Motto of the above tale: don't make fun of bankers, even when you are paying

Birmingham City Council has decided, yet again, that it needs a new
identity. This time the second city fathers have hired Vincent Hanna, the
chubby television journalist, at a cost of Pounds 20,000, to chase this
elusive grail.
So, over the past six weeks, Hanna has been looking at the communications
emanating from the City Council - Pounds 32m worth a year. He found Pounds
2m of savings by slimming down here and centralising there, all in the
interest of getting value for money.
It looks, though, as if the first sign of the new corporate identity,
Hanna-style, will be a new logo to replace the red, white and blue V sign,
criticised for being masculine, racist and sexist. Given the Council's
predeliction for plastering the logo everywhere, replacing it should happily
absorb the Pounds 2m Hanna saves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Britain's big banks can cut their dividends and replace chief executives
who fail to perform, why can't the City's blue chip merchant banks?
When it comes to dishing out expensive corporate advice, the merchant banks
are in their element. But when it comes to running their own business their
record is pretty unimpressive. Arbuthnot Latham has gone, Brown Shipley all
but disappeared from sight the other day, and several other well known names
haven't been heard of for some time.
Over the past 30 years it is hard to find a sector of the FT-Actuaries
indices that has performed worse than the so-called expert merchant banks.
Today's interim results from the grand old house of Kleinwort Benson are
unlikely to make happy reading. The company has paid an uncovered dividend
for three out of the last four years, and BZW estimates that it will do the
same this year. It should have cut its dividend before now, and if it was an
industrial company its recent performance would argue for a change at the
top. Why do customers take merchant bankers so seriously?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest rendition of New York, New York, comes from an unlikely chorus.
Commonwealth finance ministers are breaking with tradition and holding their
annual September meeting in the Big Apple.
Traditionally, the ministers assemble in a member country for their
get-together, which precedes the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. Last year, Kuala Lumpur did the
honours because the IMF met in Bangkok. The year before, Trinidad did its
bit.
This year, however, not only did no Commonwealth country volunteer to host
the meeting, but the mother of parliaments is not even taking the event very
seriously. The UK will be represented by a junior Treasury minister rather
than the chancellor.
Some unkind souls have suggested that ministers opted for New York because
the cheap dollar and a less than rigorous agenda would enable them to catch
up on their shopping and the latest Broadway shows.
But the Commonwealth Secretariat begs to differ. It says New York is an
ideal venue because it is an important global financial centre and a large
part of the ministers' discussions this year will be about encouraging
non-government finance into developing countries. Sounds a limp sort of
excuse.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Pay restraint and the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government, like the economy, is stuck. There is no shortage of
advice from business and the City, peddling pet schemes for reviving growth
and closing the budget deficit. Some are half-cocked; others are precluded
by European commitments. None offers a release from the current stranglehold
of high interest rates and heavy debts.
But one idea, floated by Mr Howard Davies, the new director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, deserves scrutiny. Rather than cut
infrastructure spending next year in order to meet its spending target, Mr
Davies says that the government should freeze the public wage bill.
Squeezing public sector pay is a tried and tested method for reducing public
spending when the government's budget is in a mess. Mrs Thatcher tried it in
the first half of the 1980s with some success. But the strategy failed the
test of good governance. The consequent fall in the wages of public
employees relative to their private sector counterparts led directly to the
problems of recruitment, retention and motivation which plagued the public
services in the latter part of the decade.
Mr Davies is right to urge the government not to savage its already meagre
capital spending budget; but freezing public sector wages could be an
equally short-term solution. In some areas, there may be scope for wage
increases offset by efficiency gains, although now is not the best time to
cut public employment. But imposing zero increases on the bulk of the public
sector will only cause severe problems when the economy recovers.
Yet the government should not dismiss Mr Davies's suggestion out of hand.
The budget deficit is only one of the economy's current problems. At least
as important is the effect of excessively high wage inflation, in both the
traded and non-traded sectors, on the competitiveness of British industry.
With sterling fixed in the exchange rate mechanism, higher wage inflation
than in other European countries means squeezed profits, fewer exports and
probably higher interest rates too.
UK wage inflation is still too high, even after eight quarters of recession
and a rise in unemployment in excess of 1 million. Over the past six months,
earnings have risen at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent, while pay settlements
are running at below 4 per cent. But these rates must fall to 3 and 2 per
cent respectively if the UK is to hold its own in Europe, let alone regain
some of the lost competitiveness of the past three years.
The public sector must adjust to a low inflation life in the ERM. The pay
review bodies set up since the mid 1980s in response to the recruitment
problems caused by lagging public sector pay have served many public
employees well over the past year: public sector wages increases were 2.5
percentage points above private sector settlements in 1991-92, clawing back
much of the ground lost in the late 1980s. They must now turn their sights
to the future. The government should state categorically that it will not
accept settlements in excess of 2 per cent next year and stick to its guns.
The onus, then, will be on British businesses and their representatives
likewise to adjust to the realities of ERM life. Mr Davies's advice is
welcome; but he is no longer the public sector's auditor. He should now
attend to the inflationary tendencies of his new constituency.

FERNGULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST (U) Odeon West End
THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE (PG) Barbican
MASALA (18) Metro, Edinburgh Film Festival
LIFE IS becoming so confused and congested in the modern rain forest, at
least according to the modern movie, that I suggest the publication of a
special Yellow Pages telephone book. This would allow our fingers to do the
walking as we search out, say, M for mad biologist (Sean Connery in Medicine
Man), P for priest in crisis (John Lithgow in At Play In The Fields Of The
Lord), L for lost boy gone native (The Emerald Forest) or in the new
animated feature FernGully: The Last Rainforest, F for fairy, T for tree
spirit and U for unidentifiable slithery things.
The film is a trades fair of rain-forest archetypes and stereotypes. It
strengthens the Andrews Theory that the next big movie genre will be films
about people trying to escape the overcrowded jungle to find peace in the
inner cities. FernGully is presented as a last, lost haven of Disneyish
greenery, where trees grow to 500 ft, rain-drops sparkle prismatically on
each leaf, lizards sing, pixies dance and insects ride aerial surfboards.
Only - yes - the roar of the not-too-distant bulldozer threatens the perfect
serenity of this teeming Eden.
If it is destroyed, what will happen to the world's oxygen? How many million
rare species will be wiped out? Will we lose our chance to cure cancer? Has
humanity any chance of surviving into the next fashionable Doomsday
scenario?
Directed by Bill Croyer and scripted by Jim Cox from the FernGully stories
of Diana Young (unfamiliar to me), the film is far merrier than these hints
of rhetorical self-importance suggest. Chief thanks go to Robin Williams,
who voices Batty the bat. Williams suggests that 20th century comic despair
has already pierced and pixillated the jungle. Wearing a crumpled radar
antenna and wilting smile, he wisecracks his way from tree to tree,
occasionally missing his branch and frequently missing the propagandist
points made by the eco-conscious fairy heroine in her no doubt
bio-degradable bikini; not to mention, but if we must, her wise old teacher
Magi Lune.
But even without Williams, the environmentalist cliches are prettily clad in
botanical baroque. The demon-king roarings of the bulldozer, doubly
amplified after it has been hijacked by the evil tree spirit (hiss]), set
the eco-pantomimic tone, and the non-stop scenic transformations complete
the picture. Never mind the more brutish aspects of jungle life: no creature
actually eats any other in this fragrant vegetarian Arcady. Just swoon at
the canopied richness of the trees, the trilling of the waterfalls and the
sunlight's golden spears showering down into a world that, far from being
endangered, never existed outside the cinema in the first place.
* * * Luis Bunuel's The Discreet Charm Of the Bourgeoisie, his gloriously
envenomed 1972 comedy (revived as part of the Barbican's Bunuel season), is
also about endangered life forms. But the fauna in this fable about survival
are busy designing and then defying their own historical auto-destruct
devices. The six characters in search of a square meal are a group of
guilt-edged gourmet friends - a drug-trafficking ambassador (Fernando Rey),
his elegantly corrupt cronies (Paul Frankeur, Jean-Pierre Cassel) and their
chic consorts (Stephane Audran, Bulle Ogier, Delphine Seyrig) - who spend
the film processing from one eating appointment to the next, unable to start
or complete their repasts. A dead body in a restaurant; army manoeuvres in a
host's garden; a dining-room turns out to be a stage set . . .
At some point the six are joined by a seventh: a worker-bishop (Julien
Bertheau) who goes unrecognised and insulted whenever he swaps his robes for
a gardener's overalls. The film is all about ceremony and expectation and
the imbecility of allowing ourselves to be fooled or programmed by either.
Every time a new carpet is laid under the filmgoer's feet, it is whipped
away. Scenes reveal themselves as dreams; a complete stranger accosts the
three women at a cafe to tell his life story; terrorists burst through the
windows of Cassel's villa to ruin the gigot d'agneau course.
Imperturbably, the sextet pursue their next and then their next epicurean
sit-downs. The film's only fault, as it polishes each comic image to a
gleam, is that rather than condemning the rascally sextet we identify with
their gracious pursuit of the simple-turned-impossible. Was stoicism ever
funnier and more winning? Was eating ever lent so Homeric, so hieratic a
resonance?
* * * Srinivas Krishna's Masala is something inedible from Canada. Did you
know that there was a thriving Indian community in Toronto? Well, you do
now. And Masala might have been a Canadian My Beautiful Laundrette. Instead
it is more like two hours of watching undersize story ideas spin around in a
greyish lather. The young hero, played by the writer-director, has girl
trouble, uncle trouble (Saeed Jaffrey in one of three roles),
religious-fantasy trouble (Saeed Jaffrey as the god Krishna), priceless
stamp trouble (Saeed Jaffrey as another, philatelic uncle) and mad grandma
trouble (not Saeed Jaffrey).
The battle between youthful Westernised energy and domineering Eastern
culture should have carried and harmonised the story. But the film, a chaos
of themes and styles unyoked by any inner authorial voice, only proves the
old Hindu proverb that fools rushdie in where angels fear to tread.
* * * Never mind east versus west: if you are a southerner coping with
celluloid deprivation in or near London you may wish to flee north. The
Edinburgh Film Festival begins at the end of next week and shows that a city
dubbed the Athens of the North can also pass itself off as the Cannes or
Berlin of those climes.
Though under new management, with Penny Thompson succeeding David Robinson,
this year's EFF combines the traditional choice pickings from the year's
European festivals with the best of British and American cinema. Istvan
Szabo, Hans-Jurgen Syberberg, John Boorman, Michael Apted, Hal Hartley;
feted new actor-directors Tim Robbins and John Turturro; and older
luminaries landing in Auld Reekie to give masterclasses. These include
director-cameraman Freddie Francis (Glory, Cape Fear) and that living legend
of the low-budgeters Samuel Fuller (Run Of The Arrow, Pickup On South
Street, The Big Red One). Fuller, who at age 80 is now cinema's answer to
the Ancient Mariner, will be holding forth to festivalgoers and TV cameras
on August 22. Before that, on Saturday, he talks cigar-wavingly to me and
the Weekend FT.
If you want to mark your cards for specific films at Edinburgh, here are my
top five. Tim Robbins's Altmanesque political satire Bob Roberts; John
Turturro's autobiographical Mac, which won the Camera d'Or for best first
feature at Cannes; Jean-Claude Lauzon's likewise autobiographical and very
funny Leolo; Leos Carax's bizarre Parisian romance Les Amants Du Pont Neuf;
and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, starring Harvey Keitel in a barking,
blazing, B-movie-style thriller that even Mr Fuller might be proud of.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Arts: Summer Lightning - Installation Art / Powerful
exhibition in a historic naval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS LONDON summer continues to bring delights for those prepared to venture
further than the beleaguered shores of Cork Street to seek out works of art.
One of the most rewarding of the crop of site related shows is Summer
Lightning,at the Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital, Romney Road, Greenwich,
until the end of August.
Eleven women artists, five from the UK - Laura Ford, Sharon Kivland,
Virginia Nimarkoh, Rebecca Scott, Kate Smith and six from Los Angeles -
Elizabeth Bryant, Sheila Klien, Lauren Lesko, Yolande McKay, Theresa
Pendlebury and Jennifer Steinkamp were invited by curator Georgie Wise to
create work for the historic site. Founded in the 17th century to provide a
home for naval pensioners, the building became a hospital in 1870. It ceased
to be a hospital in 1986 and the building is now empty.
It is a challenging setting, but the participants rise to the occasion with
an affecting mixture of empathy and style. Offering a wide range of
individual works of varying degrees of excellence, the show also succeeds
overall as an impressive demonstration of how effective such site specific
commissions can be.
This is partly due to the work of Elizabeth Bryant, who has ranged six
separate installations throughout the building. Their continuity of motif -
a painted chair represents the nurses whose work is described on tapes in
each location, while a range of objects symbolises the hopes, fears and
dreams of the patients - the careful research they demonstrate and their
apposite use of the spaces chosen, give coherence to the slightly unnerving
wander through empty wards and silent corridors which viewing the show
entails.
Before reaching her first room, one passes through a truly sinister parlour,
the work of Theresa Pendlebury. Here is her cool description. 'The room is
not historically accurate but reflects the residue of the nineteenth century
in our own time. I selected the microbes and agents of malaria, syphilis and
consumption and turned them into decorative motifs.'
She has turned the domestic decor of Victorian times into a horror show. The
crocheted mats, hanging over black covered chairs, lurking beneath
knick-knacks also painted black, display complex patterns based on the
deadly microbes which the returning sailors passed on in their homecoming
kisses. For them, and for their families, the true souvenir was death.
Some sailors never got back home. Their death was in a far country, a cold
country. If they could stand and stagger to the window, they might have seen
the ships that brought them there, tied up yards from their bed - perhaps
that one 'endowed for the use of natives of India by Brigade Surgeon J Low
MD India Medical Service 1911' as the wall above one empty ward space
declares.
More likely, the patients lay and suffered, fretting about meeting their end
without priest or family for comfort. Their struggles and fears were noted,
in documents such as the '1962-64 Night and Ward Report' or 'The Nursing of
Tropical Diseases ' by Alice M Hall, Matron 1909. Recorded extracts from
these and other texts are played in Elizabeth Bryant's rooms, and it is
remarkable how much can be learned from the quiet voices speaking of daily
routines, nurses' duties, details of symptoms and patient care.
Other, hand written, texts tell about the patients. From them we learn that
sailors are superstitious, that they used to carry babies' cauls in their
pouches to protect them from harm. Paintings of ships, casts of babies'
heads, garlic in nets, broken eggshells are set before us as we listen to
the words of the nurses describing those wanderers whose spells had failed,
whom illness rendered subject to control, returned to the hands of women.
Those professionals sought to make them well, noting their travails and
symptoms in an effort to understand. The descriptions are powerful, the
suffering felt: it is a relief when the tape records that a patient had a
peaceful night. Outside, a video installation by Jennifer Steinkamp gives a
vivid impression both of seasickness and delirium, a square rigged screen
set across the dark corridor making the whole space heave in strobed pink
and blue.
Many of the patients suffered venereal diseases. In a piece by Laura Ford
the floor of one of the upper wards where they were kept apart from the
others has been painted with devices from tattoos, buxom beauties with
improbable names, their images recording those moments of comfort and
pleasure which lead only to a greater pain. But how jolly and alluring they
look, tumbling over the floor, the women and the boys  - for this is a show
of the nineties - and penises, some with little wings, some sporting their
owners' names, join the wreaths of roses and bouncing breasts.
The nurses too had their secrets. Lauren Lesko addresses these in a series
of powerful pieces of which perhaps the best is 'Red Sea'. Here, next to the
first of Elizabeth Bryant's rooms, we peep through a lens set in a sealed
door and see the tiny, sharply focused image of a closed room, its interior
pristine white. Next to a black fireplace a blood red gown, formal, full
skirted, is displayed. What a lot it says, this little tableau, how
hauntingly it hints at hidden desires, richer hopes.
The piece is typical of the subtlety of approach the artists have brought to
their task, the variety of ways in which they have tackled an environment
both historic and intimate, once with so clear a purpose, now derelict. For
despite the heritage industry which now holds Greenwich to ransom, the
future of this particular historic building is uncertain. The opportunity to
explore it, and in such sympathetic company, is well worth taking.
Exhibition open Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holiday from 12 to 7pm

FT  06 AUG 92 / Arts: La Boheme - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YOUNG Bohemians in this production are fortunate, as they have managed
to rent a genuine artist's studio. Its Northern aspect sheds a chill, grey
light across their apartment from a floor-to-ceiling window looking out over
the rooftops of Paris. In the best romantic fashion this is a love-nest open
to the stars (literally so, as its badly smashed glass has never been
repaired).
This summer's La Boheme is the second production by Bath City Opera, which
is aiming to bring opera to the West Country on a more regular basis than
heretofore. To date the company's home has been Bath's Theatre Royal, an
incomparably elegant venue, if on the small side for full-scale opera. With
that in mind, it is possible to imagine a very special La Boheme there,
intimate and poetic, sensitive to the style and manners of the period.
Unfortunately that was not the kind of performance that the company put
before us, whatever other merits it may have had. The producer, John Pascoe,
set out to present a traditional production of quality. And in David
Myerscough-Jones's imaginative and realistic designs, beautifully lit by
Peter Blackmore, he certainly found it: the instantaneous shift from the
attic of the first act to a bustling Parisian street-scene was nothing short
of brilliant.
For the third act the designer produced an atmospheric scene at the gate to
the city, as dawn rose over Notre-Dame in the distance through the early
morning winter mists. Half the work is already done for the singers when the
mood is as well prepared as this and yet, as the dying Mimi and her Rodolfo
worked out the painful twists in their relationship, the drama steadfastly
refused to tug at the heart-strings.
For Mimi, the company had been fortunate to capture Renee Fleming, of recent
Glyndebourne and Royal Opera renown. Now seven months' pregnant, she could
not help looking in the bloom of health, while the voice, once into its
stride, also put strength ahead of wilting soprano frailty. She was matched
by another American guest, Marcus Haddock, a self-confident, almost pushy
Rodolfo with a macho stance, and a robust singer too, long-breathed and
forceful. Theirs, one felt, was a frank modern romance with little time for
19th-century mores.
Even with reduced forces the accompaniment from Klaus Donath and the Bath
City Orchestra (rather untidy - later nights may be better) sounded pretty
hearty in this small theatre. All the singers, including Motti Kaston's
stern Marcello and the phlegmatic Colline of Richard Robson, had to find
reserves of strength to ride the orchestral swell. I liked Elena Vink's
Musetta, though, haughty when her star was in the ascendant at the Cafe
Momus, thoroughly washed-out the morning after the night before.
If any other theatre with a stage of this size wants to put on La Boheme, it
could have a handsome visual production ready-made. For Bath City Opera it
is on to Rossini's La Cenerentola later this year and hopes of success for a
very welcome new operatic venture.
Performances continue at the Theatre Royal until August 8 Box Office

US track star Michael Johnson, hot favourite for the 200 metres title, was
eliminated in the first semi-final which was won by Frankie Fredericks of
Namibia. Johnson, regarded as a virtual certainty to win gold before the
Games began, ran a sluggish race and finished only sixth.
Britain's John Regis came second behind American Mike Marsh in the other
semi-final to win a place in the final. Linford Christie, in fifth place,
failed to qualify.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jud Logan, a surprise fourth-place finisher in the hammer, tested positive
for a steroid and became the first American for 20 years to fail a drug test
at the Games, the IOC said.
Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical commission, said
traces of Clenbuterol were found in Logan's sample. De Merode said the
second part of the sample had been tested but those results weren't
immediately known. No action will be taken by the IOC until both test
results are known.
Earlier women's sprint champion Gail Devers denied using
performance-enhancing drugs and called for disciplinary action against
fellow-American Gwen Torrence for alleging that three competitors in the
100m final were doped.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Olympics in Brief: Gunnell snatches 400m hurdles gold for
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sally Gunnell of Britain made a storming finish to beat favourite Sandra
Farmer-Patrick in the women's 400 metres hurdles final. The flamboyant
American led in the first half of the race but Gunnell, silver medallist at
the world championships in Tokyo last year, joined her on the bend and the
two came into the final straight neck-and-neck.
Gunnell nosed in front and then moved away on the final hurdle as
Farmer-Patrick checked her stride, powering home in 53.23 seconds. The
American took the silver in 53.69sec with her compatriot Janeene Vickers
just holding off a late challenge by world champion Tatyana Ledovskaya of
the Unified Team to win the bronze.
Gunnell, 26, from Chigwell in Essex, became Britain's first female runner to
mount the winner's rostrum at the Games since Ann Packer won the 800m in
Tokyo in 1964.
'It hasn't sunk in yet,' she gasped as she completed a lap of honour with
the Union Jack draped around her shoulders. 'There have been weeks, months,
years of hard work and wondering if it would pay off.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: How decathletes sell shoes - A look
at the all-rounders at the start of their ordeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the decathletes came out to start their two-day ordeal at 9am
yesterday, the temperature was already in the 80s and the humidity was
nearly 80 per cent. At track level the air was so heavy with moisture it
seemed about to liquefy.
Dave Johnson, the favourite from the US, might have been better trying the
front crawl in the first heat of the decathlon's 100 metres. He finished
eighth in 11.16 seconds, nearly 0.5sec behind the winner, Christian Plaziat
of France. But then, as one veteran athletics correspondent remarked,
Johnson's sprinting is 'chronic'. The time left Johnson 21st equal.
The sprinting weakness also hampers Johnson in the second event, the long
jump. But his poor first-day scoring was one of the inspirations behind the
decision by Reebok, the US sports equipment manufacturer, to build its
pre-Olympic advertising round Johnson and his US rival Dan O'Brien.
O'Brien starts fast. He would build a big lead on the first day and then,
with excitement mounting, Johnson would claw his way back on Day 2,
creating, with a little luck, a dramatic show-down in the 1,500m. But
O'Brien failed to make the Olympics, so it is up to others to act as hare to
Johnson's hound.
Yesterday, Robert Zmelik of Czechoslovakia burst from the blocks and into an
early lead. He ran the second fastest 100m in 10.78sec and then jumped the
furthest: 7.87m. This put him on 1,937 points. The barrel-chested Johnson
bulled down the ramp for a jump of 7.33m - a running total of 1,718 points
and 13th position.
Running is the most natural of athletic disciplines. Everyone knows the
technique. The best decathletes generally run between 10 and 20 per cent
slower than the Olympic finalists in equivalent events. But as the events
become more technical the gap widens. Decathletes jump 20 to 30 per cent
less high or long, and their throws are anything up to 40 per cent shorter.
While specialist athletes can concentrate on perfecting their technique and
developing only the right muscles for their discipline, the decathletes,
with 10 disciplines, have to be jacks-of-all-events and develop all muscles.
That is why they are such spectacular specimens.
Once a sprinter has run 100m he can head for the changing room. The
decathlon crowd trudges to the long jump pits and from there to the shot
put. At each stop the athletes spread their gaudy array of shoes and clothes
under a canvas lean-to.
They are trapped for the morning. They can only escape the arena for brief
trips to attend to their most basic needs, and they cannot go alone. An
official scurries alongside them like a Panama-hatted sheep dog.
Between jumps or throws they keep themselves amused in various ways. They
exercise. At the long jump some do hand stands, others bunny-jumps, some hop
or skip.
They ceaselessly change clothes and shoes, clambering in and out of
tracksuits, shorts, tights, T-shirts, cycle shorts, spikes and trainers.
In the more technical events, most decathletes merit scant comparison with
specialists.
Aric Long, for example, galloped down the long-jump runway in the prescribed
manner - then, with an almost audible grinding of gears, shortened but did
not quicken his stride. Somehow he could not produce the explosion of lift
that will carry the long-jump gold medallist close to 9m. His best jump of
7.21m was decent by any standard except that of Olympic long jumpers.
In the shot everything was going more or less as expected until the
Spaniard, Antonio Penalvar, suddenly hurled 16.50m, a throw which would have
left him more than 5.20m behind Michael Stulce in last Friday's shot put
final but which made all the others seem tentative and imprecise.
Johnson was the last to throw in each round. He fouled his first two
attempts, and as the shot dragged into the afternoon any watchers from
Reebok must have felt an awful chill of deja vu when Johnson was called for
a foul on his third and last throw.
He argued, the judges argued. Finally the referee ruled that Johnson should
throw again. Grabbing the life-line, he threw a personal best of 15.28m.
After five events, the German Paul Meier led with 4,510 points, 75 ahead of
Zmelik. Penalvar on 4,357 was third, with Johnson ninth on 4,154.
This evening, Johnson is capable of picking up 300 points on his main rivals
in the javelin, the ninth event. The eighth, the pole vault, can also bring
huge point swings.
'Everything went well, but not extremely well,' said Johnson. 'I'd say I've
had an average first day.'
His problem now is that a lot of his opponents had better than average first
days.

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Raising the stakes for Games of 2000
 -John Major is heading for Spain to hobnob with Olympic royalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR is said to be highly excited about coming to Barcelona tomorrow.
Britain's sports-fan prime minister has never attended an Olympic Games
before.
Two months ago Major invited Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), to London. Immediate warmth between
them led to Major agreeing to press Samaranch's views on the status of
athletes from former Yugoslav states at the G7 summit.
Now the hospitality is being returned. As he is whisked around this Pounds
5bn pageant, the prime minister will see that an IOC chieftain has power and
influence scarcely imagined by the elected leader of a middleweight north
European democracy.
The experience will prove intoxicating. It always does. And the prime
minister will begin to speak softly to the president about Manchester's
worthwhile and energetic claims to host the Games in 2000.
'I know that Samaranch and other senior IOC members are highly impressed by
this government's commitment to our bid,' says Bob Scott, head of the
Manchester campaign.
In the case of an earlier, unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Games (which went
to Atlanta), the IOC was sceptical of the viability of prime minister
Margaret Thatcher's 'hands-off' approach to the subject of government
involvement.
Experience has taught the IOC that outside the US, national rather than
regional private-sector resources have to be used to underpin the Olympics.
Scott and his team have been in Spain for nearly a month now, constantly
studying and lobbying. 'The biggest thing I see is that having the Games in
Barcelona has shifted the geographic and economic axis of this country,'
says Scott. 'Madrid isn't the beginning and end of every story - and never
will be again.'
Could the same thing happen if the Games were staged in north-west England?
'Absolutely,' replied Scott. 'Nothing that is likely to happen in our
lifetimes could do so much to change the damaging imbalance which tilts so
many resources into London and the south-east.'
Whitehall has already pledged about Pounds 50m to help with facilities and
infrastructure related to Manchester's bid, a radically new combination of
money and mouth duly noted by the hard-to-please IOC.
However, seven other cities stand between Manchester and its dream. Before
the IOC vote in Monte Carlo next year, the claims to preferment of
candidates as diverse as Milan and Tashkent have to be overcome, Braslia and
Istanbul vanquished.
Sydney and Beijing are regarded by observers as the front-runners at
present. Berlin was up there with them but has faded after an enjoyable
scandal concerning the Berlin campaigners' use of private detectives to
investigate the lives of the 92 IOC members who will choose the venue for
2000.
Every candidate city admits to keeping dossiers on IOC members: basic and
harmless information useful when hosting them on visits. However, the
Germans focused on the bank accounts and sexual preferences of the IOC
elite.
Anger turned to outrage when a disgruntled ex-employee leaked the
investigators' conclusions to the IOC. Only seven of the members, they
concluded, could not be 'bought'.
Eyebrows were raised at Buckingham Palace when it became known that the
Princess Royal, a former Olympic horsewoman and prominent do-gooder in the
highest reaches of world sport, was not one of the seven.
Sydney attracts everyone. The potential for staging the Olympics in such a
stunning outdoor city is clear to all. But hard-heads always cavil at the
cost and logistical problems entailed in staging the world's biggest
festival in such a remote spot and such an obscure time-zone.
In turn, Beijing has to overcome its status as an international pariah.
Interestingly, its lobbyists and senior figures have been much in evidence
in Barcelona, pushing the line that China needs the Olympics to help counter
its rock-bottom image.
Winning the Games would propel us into the modern world, say Beijing's
campaigners with breath-taking frankness.
'At present, I'm happy to hear people say that Manchester is third and
closing,' says Scott. 'With the two favourites at such extremes there is
considerable merit in being a well-prepared, unglamorous middle candidate.'
All of which will strike a pleasing chord with the British prime minister.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Stewards shop for
new members - A look at union moves to find recruits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do you sell a product to indifferent consumers, via hostile retailers,
when you have virtually no marketing experience? That is the problem facing
the organisers of trade union recruitment campaigns, trying to sell trade
union membership.
Effective campaigns are more important than ever for the unions; last year
the membership of TUC-affiliated unions fell to 8.2m from a peak of more
than 12m in 1980.
Membership figures are like sales figures: they represent revenue for unions
 -which are also small to medium-sized businesses. As membership falls, the
businesses contract, and eventually disappear.
TUC unions recruited more than 500,000 new members last year, but the
majority of those were new workers in companies that were already organised.
The long-term trends working against unionisation, such as the decline of
manual work and manufacturing, mean that there are fewer such organised
work-places taking on significant numbers of workers.
To slow or reverse those trends, unions are forced to reach out to offices
and factories that have never been organised.
Realising that leafleting non-unionised employees outside their workplaces
was not getting very far, some unions, in the early 1980s, began to offer
various personal and financial services as inducements.
TUC officials say that has helped a little but people join unions 'for the
basics', such as better pay, working conditions and job security. Slightly
cheaper car insurance is unlikely to lure them on its own.
But as people have not been joining in sufficient numbers, even for the
basics, unions have been forced to be unconventional.
The GPMU print union is breaking with tradition and trying to recruit young
people in design and art colleges before they go into the printing industry.
And one management union has a policy of offering a bottle of champagne to
every member who recruits a new one.
The most interesting current recruitment effort is in the growing
telecommunications sector where the National Communications Union - the
150,000-strong British Telecom union - must diversify or wither away.
The sharp reduction in BT staffing currently underway means that the union
will lose about one-quarter of its members in the next two years alone. It
is thus tentatively starting recruitment efforts outside BT - primarily in
BT's competitor Mercury and in the 159 cable TV franchise holders.
The NCU is typical of many British unions, especially those with roots in
the public sector, in having virtually no experience of recruitment. It has
enjoyed a protected existence with members handed to it on a plate.
Now, drawing on the experience of its American sister union and of the
British banking union Bifu, it is aiming to recruit 8,000 members outside BT
by the end of 1994. It does not sound an ambitious target given how many
members the NCU is losing, but the union will have trouble reaching it.
Alan Harley, the energetic former BT middle manager who is leading the
recruitment drive, admits that Labour's election defeat will make reaching
the target more difficult.
But he has an annual budget of Pounds 250,000 for at least three years, two
people working under him (one concentrating on Mercury, one on cable TV) and
seems to have got off to a reasonably good start.
The economics look favourable. Every non-BT member recruited pays the union
68p per week of which 50p is pure profit for the union and should mean that
recruitment becomes self-financing within three years.
The profit margin is high because the non-BT members are not benefiting from
the main collective bargaining services provided by the union.
But for the same reason, it is difficult to persuade people to join. 'The
biggest problem we have in Mercury is persuading people that even without
recognition for collective bargaining, it is worth being in a union,' said
an NCU Mercury activist on a special weekend course at the union's country
retreat in Alvescot near Oxford.
In its slick promotional literature - slogan 'big enough to count, small
enough to care' - the union argues that it can provide support in
disciplinary cases, redundancy, and much beside, without recognition, and
claims to have already improved Mercury's health and safety policy.
The medium-term aim is 30 per cent membership in the 8,000-strong company.
So far the NCU has just over 5 per cent, about 450 members, after meetings
for slightly more than half the Mercury offices in the country.
Some of the activists, all of whom have been 'outed' to the Mercury
management, are fresh to trade unionism but most are old hands. They say
that the main recruiting sergeants are job insecurity, the vagueness of
disciplinary procedures, and the pay and appraisal system.
How do you get the message across? The union targets a Mercury site, writing
to every relevant member of staff to inform people of the union's existence,
the case for membership, and the date of an informal meeting. This may be
accompanied by posters and advertisements in the local media. In Milton
Keynes, which has a 1,000-strong Mercury site, and where the union has made
one of its biggest pushes, it had advertisements on local radio and in the
local press, and an NCU hot air balloon hovering over the town at week-ends.
Results have been patchy. In Leeds, where the union had been hoping to do
well, it recruited only 18 out of 200 people, while in Southampton it picked
up one third of the 60 staff. One cultural problem, say former BT activists,
is the much higher proportion of sales staff and lower proportion of
technical staff compared with BT.
In cable TV, penetration has been lower, with one or two exceptions like
Swindon Cable, and the union has scarcely 100 members. The main problem in
cable is that the offices are very small and scattered.
Partly for that reason it is also targeting the cable employers with a
leaflet boasting of the union's political and lobbying influence and
stressing that it will not tell companies how to run their business. The
theory is that with the union's expertise in employment law, the company is
saved the cost of a personnel function. It is a theory that the cable TV
companies seem slow to grasp.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting consumer
spending patterns on the map - A look at a computer system that provides
market information to help decision-making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inclination of leading international companies to spend vast sums on
national network television advertising campaigns is fast disappearing.
With more commercial channels - satellite and terrestrial - on the horizon,
the explosion in home video ownership, and shrunken consumer spending,
throwing money at an audience which is different from, and more
cost-conscious than, five years ago makes little sense. Marketing managers
are waking up to the need to refine carefully the targeting of their
advertising budgets.
GMAP, a company whose majority shareholder (60 per cent) is the University
of Leeds, aims to help. GMAP developed out of research in the university's
school of geography, led by professor Alan Wilson and senior lecturer Martin
Clarke, who together hold the other 40 per cent of the company.
GMAP collects and processes a vast array of technical data concerning
retailing, financial services, the motor industry, healthcare and other
aspects of consumer spending. It feeds the data into a mainframe computer
and superimposes it on to maps of the UK.
Ford uses the system to locate how many dealers it has in an area, and can
judge how well each is performing against a national sales average and
competitors.
Accurate market information and intelligent deployment of that information
may never displace the creative whizz-bangs of glossy advertising images,
but its increasing importance to marketing executives is demonstrated both
by the recent growth of GMAP - its turnover last year was Pounds 2m - and
the quality of its 17-strong client list; besides Ford of Europe, it has
Whitbread, Shell, WH Smith, Leeds Permanent Building Society and three of
Britain's clearing banks.
All these companies supply products and services to a highly heterogeneous
market through outlets which, hopefully, are in the correct location. The
picture is further complicated by competitors who are trying to achieve the
same goals. Where they have outlets has a critical bearing on success.
GMAP's typical clients have between 200 and 3,000 outlets.
In the case of Ford, a top dealership might sell 10,000 units annually;
others perhaps struggle to sell 100. The question facing Ford is: is that
100 a good or poor performance? What GMAP offers is a means of measuring
performance against a company's own historical averages and that of the
competition. GMAP's data is also used by clients who wish to expand or
contract their chain of outlets to maximise profitability.
'What we describe ourselves as doing,' says Clarke, 'is developing decision
support tools - computer systems with information and modelling that provide
intelligence that allows clients better to understand their markets and
their performance in that market; better to understand their competition;
and better to plan what they do in the future.'
That information is crucial but, in Clarke's experience, has rarely been
given much attention in even the largest companies, whose marketing
strategies have been much more advertising than research-driven. 'What we
can do is to predict for Ford, if it proposes to open a new dealership
anywhere in the country, how much business it will take, where the customers
will come from, what the impact on existing Ford dealers will be, and what
the impact on the competition will be.'
Moreover, taking into consideration demographic trends, GMAP says it can
assist companies to hold back from opening a new outlet today, but predict
that it will become worthwhile doing so in, say, five years.
According to Clarke, people think that advertising is effective because
everybody else thinks it is. But he says research shows that people tend to
make purchases from outlets which are close to them, given a general
similarity in the competing product or service on offer.
The implications of this for the planning of marketing decisions are
considerable. For one thing, it is a counter-argument against seeing mass
advertising as achieving much more than brand awareness. As Clarke says:
'People have got mega-bucks to spend on advertising; what they are far less
keen to do is the hard task, looking at an individual dealer's performance,
area by area. It's not glamorous. It can be quite threatening.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / Wallace Smith Trust Collapse: Global labyrinth is explored -
The long and twisting path of the merchant bank's connections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, ANDREW JACK and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLEX network of companies and family trusts centred in Canada and the
UK has been uncovered as attempts are made to trace more than Pounds 100m of
missing assets from the collapsed Wallace Smith merchant bank.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the liquidator, which is suing the Royal Bank of Scotland
and National Westminster Bank, is still trying to determine the extent of
connections between Wallace Smith Holdings, the Canadian-registered company
that received the transfers, and Wallace Smith Trust Company, to which the
payments should allegedly have gone.
Mr Nick Press, a US consultant who has been acting as chief operating
officer of the Canadian-based Wallace Smith Group since June 1991, said that
the Wallace Smith Canadian interests were organised in a complicated series
of interlocked family trusts.
He said he was brought in by one of the group directors to be 'a guardian of
the gate' and that he was defending the Canadian company against litigation
and making claims of its own against others.
Wallace Smith Holdings, the subsidiary which received the disputed cash, is
now Dundalk Investment Company, a subsidiary of Colchester Trust, which is
in turn linked with other Wallace Smith trusts registered in Canada.
The Wallace Smith Group is the parent of a string of subsidiaries, now
mostly in liquidation, in the UK, US, Caribbean, Spain and Italy. The most
important of these subsidiaries appears to have been the Wallace Smith Trust
Company, which specialised in money market operations from its base in
Winchester House, London Wall, in the City of London. The trust was closed
last year amid allegations of fraud.
Dundalk is listed as a creditor in the most recent published accounts of
Herongrove and British Trusts Association, both UK subsidiaries of the
Wallace Smith Group.
The elusive nature of the relationship between the companies is shown in the
auditors' reports in the accounts of several of the Wallace Smith Group's UK
subsidiaries, which draw attention to 'professional advisory services to
corporations controlled by a board of independent trustees of which a
director was a minority trustee and a non-executive director'.
The 1990 accounts for Wallace Smith Trust Group show that one of the
directors within the group was paid more than Pounds 180,000 during the
year, and a further five more than Pounds 90,000.
Mr Smith, who is living in London and awaiting a court appearance on charges
relating to a Serious Fraud Office investigation, was described by former
employees as a quiet man. One former colleague said he had come from a
family with Lithuanian origins which settled in the Alberta area of Canada.
A former banker who had dealings with him said: 'When he was going to speak
he would pause. He takes a long time to say anything.'
Mr Smith spent much of his early career with Nesbitt Thomson, a Canadian
broking company. He pioneered a UK arm of the company before breaking away
in the early 1970s to set up another Canadian based company called McDunn
Silcox.
In recent years the group's most active companies in Canada were Wallace
Smith Securities and Wallace Smith &amp; Co. The former specialised in trading
Canadian securities. Most of the business of Wallace Smith &amp; Co was in the
US, largely in the Euro-Canadian and foreign currency markets.
Mr Press said that none of the Wallace Smith companies in Canada was
actively trading. He said that business dried up last summer after the UK
liquidation.
According to Mr Press the UK liquidators petitioned a UK court a year ago to
wind up two of the key Canadian companies, Wallace Smith Group and Wallace
Smith &amp; Co. The petition was dismissed earlier this year.
Mr Press said the Canadian group was suing Peat Marwick for between Pounds
5m and Pounds 7m, mainly for 'interruption of business'.
In addition, Wallace Smith &amp; Co has a creditor claim of Pounds 1.2m against
Wallace Smith Trust Group in the UK.
Mr Smith's involvement as chairman of Wallace Smith Group Ltd in Canada, and
director of some of the other companies, was severed the day after the
British fraud authorities entered the company in April 1991.
Garstangs, Mr Smith's Bolton-based solicitor, rejected suggestions in
yesterday's Financial Times that its client enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle.
The firm said last night that Mr Smith had made a successful application for
legal aid to defend the criminal proceedings against him and denied that he
had owned property in Chelsea and the Bahamas.
Garstangs added that Mr Smith denied any dishonesty or fraudulent trading
and was strenuously defending the proceedings against him.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced an examination of high-security
psychiatric care in the wake of evidence of bullying and physical and sexual
assault at Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside.
Seven members of the hospital's staff have been suspended. They face charges
of gross misconduct and three are accused of assault.
The health department said that Dr Joseph Sylvester, Ashworth's medical
director, was relinquishing his post and Mr Brian Johnson, general manager,
was moving to other duties.
The inquiry, led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, chairman of the Mental Health Act
Commission, found that managers at Ashworth had little power. As a result,
it said, the vacuum was filled by members of the Prison Officers'
Association whose main priority was security. The association said
allegations of brutality by Ashworth staff were not supported by firm
evidence.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Spending by rivers watchdog up 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of the drought and higher investment in pollution control and flood
defences pushed National Rivers Authority spending to Pounds 445m in the
year to March 31, a rise of 18 per cent on the previous year, Bronwen Maddox
writes.
In its annual report and accounts, published yesterday, the rivers watchdog
repeated its support for recent proposals to combine it with the pollution
inspectorate under a new environment agency.
Earlier proposals had suggested splitting the authority's pollution and
river-management roles, a move it resisted on the grounds that it would
weaken its ability to control river quality.
The watchdog saw its spending on water resources jump 37 per cent to Pounds
77.2m last year, largely because of the drought in south-east England.
Spending on pollution control rose to Pounds 76.4m compared with Pounds
60.5m the year before, partly because of the costs of its survey of 40,000km
of river, published at the end of last year. The survey found a net overall
deterioration in river quality both because of higher pollution and lower
rainfall.
Schemes to recover some of the costs of cleaning rivers from the polluters
generated Pounds 22m in the year to March, and are expected to bring it
Pounds 38m in the current year.

FT  06 AUG 92 / GLC spectre continues to haunt Tories: The rumpus over
London's County Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in
1986 - exasperated by Mr Ken Livingstone's use of it as a soapbox for the
Labour left just across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament - she
thought she had neutered County Hall once and for all.
Six years later, however, the building is causing ministers as much
embarrassment as did Mr Livingstone in his heyday.
The current rumpus, which could soon reach the courts, is of the
government's making. Put bluntly, it has been unable to make up its mind
about the future of the building.
Five months ago it agreed that the London Residuary Body, the quango set up
to dispose of the GLC's assets, could sell County Hall to the Japanese
Shirayama group. The contract included an 'opt-out' clause operable until
November.
Everyone, not least the residuary body and Shirayama, assumed that the
clause was an escape route for the Labour party if it won the general
election. And a Labour victory appeared to be the only hope for the
year-long campaign by the London School of Economics to move from Aldwych to
the grander and more spacious South Bank site.
The Conservatives won the general election. But Mr Michael Howard replaced
Mr Michael Heseltine as environment secretary and Mrs Gillian Shephard, a
strong supporter of the LSE, was one of the new faces at the cabinet table.
Mr John Ashworth, the LSE's ebullient director, also had a route to the
prime minister through well-placed advocates in the No 10 policy unit.
The LSE went into top lobbying gear with its vision of being 'the European
social science university' and achieved a coup last week when Mr Howard let
it submit a bid.
Mr Howard's action, taken after months of speculation, understandably
infuriated Shirayama, which had believed that only the Labour party stood in
the way of its long-cherished plans for a luxury hotel beside the Thames.
It also enraged Sir Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the London Residuary Body,
who felt he had been led up and down the garden path by a dithering
government.
This, plus irritation at the intensity of Mr Ashworth's lobbying and the
belief that the Shirayama deal represented better financial value for the
London boroughs, led to the residuary body yesterday issuing 'advice' in
scathing terms about the LSE's bid, 'strongly urging' Mr Howard to reject it
and to delete the opt-out clause.
Having got so far, the LSE has problems of its own. With a tight public
spending round ahead and university funding particularly constrained, it was
made clear to Mr Ashworth that no handouts were on offer. The LSE had to
produce a realistic bid.
Accordingly, the Pounds 20m bid for the entire site offered by the
university in March jointly with Advanta, a German property developer, has
been increased to Pounds 65m - less than Shirayama's Pounds 60m offer for
the riverside building alone.
There are doubts about the LSE's ability to foot the bill. It is not just
the direct financial side - in particular the optimistic assumption that its
existing site in central London will net Pounds 100m by 1995. The bid also
assumes that the LSE can double its postgraduate numbers within four years -
which means finding another 2,500 fee-paying, high-calibre social science
students, and the staff to supervise them.
One LSE governor said: 'If this were France or Germany they'd be giving us
the building free for prestige.'
The French and Germans, of course, would not have abolished the elected
governments of Paris or Berlin in the first place.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Halifax house prices index fell last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES fell last month after rising marginally following the general
election, according to figures published yesterday by Halifax, Britain's
biggest building society, Andrew Taylor writes.
Halifax said that the average price of a home fell 0.4 per cent last month
after rises of 0.4 per cent in May and 0.7 per cent in June. Halifax said
that in spite of last month's fall prices were firmer than earlier in the
year, when they showed much bigger monthly falls. It added: 'Although there
are few positive signs of any recovery. . . it appears likely that UK prices
will stabilise in the second half of this year.'
Halifax says house prices have fallen 5.2 per cent since July last year.
This is marginally better than in June when the annual price fall was 5.6
per cent. The average price of a home last month was Pounds 65,077. The
price of a new house was Pounds 69,673, just under 2 per cent lower than in
July last year.

FT  06 AUG 92 / National Savings cut will help societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANGES to National Savings products announced yesterday represent the
third cut in returns by the government's retail savings arm since early May.
The first change was in line with May's half-point cut in base rates. But
although base rates have not been reduced since then, National Savings has
made further cuts in the wake of strong lobbying from building societies.
Last month the rate on the First Option bond, a new product designed for
basic-rate taxpayers, was cut from 10.34 per cent gross to 9.67 per cent.
Yesterday's cuts were by between 0.25 percentage points and 0.8 percentage
points.
The changes at National Savings mean basic-rate taxpayers can get a better -
though variable - return at building societies. Last weekend Bristol &amp; West
was offering a gross 10.45 per cent (net 7.8375 per cent) on holdings of
more than Pounds 2,000. The guaranteed income bonds sold by insurance
companies were offering basic-rate taxpayers fixed returns of up to 8.55 per
cent over five years.
The 37th issue of certificates, which paid 8 per cent a year tax-free if
held for five years, has been withdrawn and will be replaced with the 38th
issue, which will pay 7.5 per cent. The 38th issue will be available from
today for those reinvesting matured certificates, and from August 24 for
those investing new money.
The holding limit for new purchases is only Pounds 5,000, compared with
Pounds 7,500 for the 37th issue and Pounds 10,000 for the 36th issue. In
line with the change to the certificates, the return on the yearly plan has
been cut from 8 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
There are also alterations to the rates on Capital Bonds which pay a fixed,
but taxable, return. The Series D bonds, which paid 10.75 per cent per annum
if held for five years, have been withdrawn. From August 24, Series E bonds
will go on sale, offering 10 per cent. The effect is that basic-rate
taxpayers will earn a net 7.5 per cent, the same as the tax-free rate on the
38th issue.
Issue B of Children Bonus Bonds, which paid 10.9 per cent per annum tax-free
if held for five years, has also been withdrawn. The new Issue C, on sale
from August 24, will pay 10.1 per cent.
The gross variable rates on income bonds and the investment account have
been cut by 0.25 percentage points. Income bonds will pay 9 per cent gross
and the investment account 8.25 per cent.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Questions on Belling pension fund money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO directors at Belling, the cooker manufacturer which went into
receivership in May, have come under scrutiny for their actions in relation
to the company's pension fund.
The Law Debenture Trust, which was appointed by Belling's receivers to act
as independent trustees to the pension fund, is considering legal action
over investments made by the scheme and a Pounds 2.1m shortfall in the fund.
In December last year, just five months before the company went into
receivership, the pension fund paid Pounds 5.5m to buy Compound Sections, a
Belling subsidiary. The pension fund was controlled by two Belling directors
at the time. The Law Debenture Trust is questioning whether this was an
appropriate investment. The trust has also taken advice on action to recover
Pounds 2.1m borrowed from the fund. The trust is considering suits against
several possible defendants, including Mr CJ Deacon, a solicitor in
Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stafford-shire. It is understood he undertook to hold
the Pounds 2.1m pending a Dollars 50m loan to Belling.
The loan was arranged last summer through Global Prospect Funding, a client
of Mr Deacon. Belling agreed to pay a year's interest, equivalent to Pounds
2.1m, before receiving the capital. Belling borrowed the money from the
fund.
In April an Isle of Man registered company, Finchley Investments, provided
security for the interest payment when the loan was not forthcoming. The
security was a CDollars 1.75m stake in the Vancouver natural resources
company, Western &amp; Pacific. The shares are now estimated to be worth a
fraction of that. Mr Deacon said he was unaware the trust was considering
action. He said the money would be repaid 'literally any time'. He denied he
signed a receipt on receiving the Pounds 2.1m, promising to hold the money
until Global paid the cash. According to an agreement in April, he said,
repayment was not yet due.

FT  06 AUG 92 / BMA critical of fees for health advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British Medical Association yesterday strongly criticised the government
for employing expert advisers on nutrition and health who accepted payments
from food and pharmaceutical manufacturers.
The BMA said the practice undermined public confidence in the quality of
government advice.
The association was responding to the disclosure by the Department of Health
that many of its 43 outside advisers on food and health had received
personal payments from food and pharmaceutical manufacturers or were
responsible for research projects funded by these companies.
Dr Fleur Fisher, head of the BMA's professional and scientific division,
said: 'The mildest thing one can say is that it looks extraordinarily
ill-advised to involve people with links with these industries. It
undermines the credibility of the experts' reports in people's minds.'
Mr Derek Jackson, director of the Coronary Prevention Group, said experts
should be banned from sitting on government advisory committees if they
received income from any organisation with a vested interest in the results
of the committees' work.
The BMA and the Coronary Prevention Group particularly criticised advisers
who received personal payments from industry. Dr Fisher said industrial
funding of research was unavoidable, while Mr Jackson said such funding
should be accepted only if the research was not intended to serve the
interests of individual companies.
Most of the department's advisers are qualified doctors and academics.
Thirteen of them declared receiving personal payments from food and
pharmaceutical companies for consultancy and other services, while 15 said
they were responsible for research or training projects funded by these
industries. Several advisers declared both types of commercial interest.
Only 19 said they had none.
The advisers sit on the committee on medical aspects of food policy (Coma),
the department's main expert body, and on panels dealing with issues
including cardiovascular work, diets of the elderly, child nutrition and
novel foods.
According to the register of commercial interests published by the
department, one member of its working group on the weaning diet, Mr RA
Hendey, is a full-time employee of Nestle, the world's largest producer of
baby foods. Dr Fisher expressed astonishment that he should be employed as a
government adviser.
The register shows that Dr Roger Whitehead, who chaired a landmark report on
diet and nutrition published by the department last year, is a member of the
council of the Nestle Foundation. Dr Whitehead, director of the Dunn
clinical research centre in Cambridge, is also a paid adviser to the Milk
Marketing Board.
The register does not give the value of payments. Professor David Hull of
Nottingham University Medical Hospital, who received money from Nutricia, a
Dutch food group, said the exact amounts were not of legitimate public
interest.
The department said it required all advisers to register their commercial
interests when appointed and to abstain from discussions on topics in which
they had a personal financial interest. It saw no need for any changes in
the rules.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said publication of the register
marked an advance in open government. However, several advisers said the
information contained in the register was collected more than a year ago.
The department could not explain why the register had not been disclosed
until now.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Brewers increase wholesale beer prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEER prices in most pubs are expected to rise by between 4p and 6p a pint
after increases in wholesale prices by the national brewers. Prices of some
premium beers in pubs in the south-east may be up to 10p a pint higher.
The brewers, which were strongly criticised last year after beer prices, net
of duty, rose 11 per cent, have limited the rise in wholesale prices to
about the level of inflation in the past three months.
Allied-Lyons has raised wholesale prices by 3 per cent, less than the
inflation rate of 3.9 per cent in the year to June. Prices in its managed
pubs will be 4p to 5p higher in the north of England and 6p to 10p up in the
south - an average increase of 4.5 per cent.
Bass, the country's leading brewer, has lifted wholesale prices in its
northern trading area by Pounds 7.50 a barrel for standard ales and lagers
and Pounds 10 a barrel for premium-brand products - an average increase of
4.4 per cent.
Bass Taverns, the group's managed estate, said retail prices had gone up by
between 4p and 6p. 'This includes the 2p a pint higher duty imposed in the
March Budget, and is the first increase for between 12 and 15 months,' the
company said. 'We are doing everything we can to control costs and price our
beer as competitively as possible.' Whitbread's wholesale prices went up 3.8
per cent in May, the equivalent of about 2p a pint.
Courage increased prices of some leading brands - Fosters, Courage Best and
John Smith's - by 4 per cent but has held the prices of Holsten Pils and
some other brands at last year's levels. Prices in Grand Metropolitan's
managed estate, which Courage supplies, have risen by between 4p and 6p a
pint.
The brewers say the increases are necessary to meet higher production and
distribution costs and to improve retailing margins hit by the recession.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Gould defiant on Maastricht ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN GOULD, the defeated challenger for the Labour leadership, has given
a clear signal that the party may face formidable internal dissent over
ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Yesterday he confirmed that he would oppose the accord in the shadow
cabinet. As a senior member of Mr John Smith's frontbench team, this will
make him a rallying point for Labour's Eurosceptics and the growing number
of pro-Europeans who argue that the party should not squander an opportunity
to defeat the government.
Mr Smith wants Labour to oppose a guillotine motion that would cut short
debate on the treaty when the Maastricht bill returns to the Commons in the
coming session.
But as a lifelong pro-European he is against outright opposition to the
treaty. He is determined that Labour must not be seen to block closer EC
union for the short-term tactical gain of a government defeat.
A measure of Mr Smith's difficulty is that earlier this year more than 50
backbench Labour MPs defied party managers and opposed a second reading of
the Maastricht bill.
Mr Gould argues that one consequence of the Danish referendum which rejected
the Maastricht terms is that Labour is free to adjust its pre-election
stance that grudgingly endorsed the treaty.
During his leadership campaign Mr Gould argued that the treaty did not do
enough to enforce greater democratic accountability in EC institutions and
that its criteria for economic convergence - required to complete economic
and monetary union - failed to address the need for growth and full
employment.
This week Mr Gould hinted that Labour's recent calls for 'co-ordinated
action' across Europe to reduce interest rates appeared to be 'shorthand or
code' endorsing a general devaluation against the D-Mark.
With the leadership's position not finalised, Mr Gould has made clear that
he does not feel bound by collective responsibility. 'It would be disastrous
to go into self-imposed purdah,' he said, adding that he thought it highly
unlikely that he would be unable to accept the final position adopted by the
shadow cabinet.

A REVIEW of Conservative party internal organisation is thought to have
concluded that a new board of directors should be set up to improve the
party's effectiveness.
Those sitting on the board would be drawn from the various branches of the

The review - commissioned by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman - is

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Contest to set up European
rating agency intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle to create a new European credit rating agency has intensified,
with two groups competing for the backing of Bertelsmann, the German media
giant which has emerged as one of the main potential sponsors of such a
venture.
IBCA, the London-based agency which has built a strong reputation by
specialising in ratings for financial institutions, has been in recent talks
with Bertelsmann. The German company has also held talkswith a
Frankfurt-based group set up with the backing of German banks to look into
the possibility of a Europe-wide rating agency.
Both groups are trying to build a European ratings agency with the resources
and reputation to compete with the two leaders in the industry, the US
groups Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.
IBCA hopes to complete a merger next month with Euronotation, a French
agency. This will entail 70 per cent of the new group's shares passing to
Centenaire Blanzy, a French publishing group, with the balance remaining
with management, said Mr Robin Monro-Davies, chairman of IBCA.
The intention is then to sell some of Centenaire's stake to other
shareholders later this year, among them Bertelsmann, said Mr Monro-Davies.
The involvement of Centenaire Blanzy has caused concern in some quarters due
to its close links to Compagnie Suez, the French industrial and financial
group.
Any link between a ratings agency and a financial institution could
undermine the belief of companies that any information they give to the
agency would remain confidential. Mr Monro-Davies said: 'There would be no
question of any bank having any direct interest in IBCA - or any indirect
interest either, unless it was so distant as to be meaningless.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Electric earnings rise
23% at halfway

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG Electric, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Victoria Island,
yesterday reported a 23 per cent rise in earnings to HKDollars 1.15bn
(USDollars 149m) for the six months to June from HKDollars 934m a year
earlier, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
The company, which is 34.6 per cent owned by Mr Li Ka-shing's Hutchison
Whampoa, boosted turnover by 7.4 per cent to HKDollars 2.34bn from HKDollars
2.18bn.
Directors declared an interim dividend of 30 cents a share, 15 per cent
higher than the year-earlier period. Earnings per share were 57 cents
against 46 cents.
Mr Simon Murray, chairman, said record rainfall in the colony and cool
weather resulted in a 1.8 per cent growth in electricity unit sales in the
first half. Maximum demand for electricity was 6 per cent higher,
year-on-year.
Hongkong Electric also develops residential property and Mr Murray said that
during the half-year the company's associate Secan received an occupation
permit for the final block of its phase 1 South Horizons development on Ap
Lei Chau. Occupation permits for seven blocks at phase 2 of the development
are expected in the second half. Analysts estimate this development will
contribute nearly HKDollars 700m to pre-tax profits this year.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Highveld down 34% due to poor
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in South Africa and weak international markets caused Highveld
Steel and Vanadium's attributable profits to drop by 34 per cent to R31m
(Dollars 11m) in the six months to the end of June.
The metals manufacturer, which is an associate of the Anglo American group,
is cutting its interim dividend to 20 cents a share from 30 cents a year
earlier, following a 46 per cent drop in earnings per share to 35.1 cents
from 65.3 cents. Earnings were diluted by the issue of new shares to fund
Highveld's 50 per cent stake in the Columbus stainless steel project.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said poor market conditions and the uncertain
socio-political climate meant that second-half earnings would 'at best'
equal those of the first.
Turnover rose by 7.4 per cent to R696.2m from R648.2m, but weaker margins
saw pre-tax profits fall by 28.5 per cent to R35.9m from R50.2m.
Attributable profits fell to R31m from R47.2m.
Mr Boyd said the prolonged South African economic downturn had had a serious
impact on the construction industry and capital investment in general. These
factors, and high merchant inventories, caused a 'substantial decline' in
Highveld's domestic steel sales. The absence of large industrial projects
and a weak order book suggested this position was likely to continue in the
second half.
International steel markets remained weak with consumption and prices
predicted to fall. Consumption and prices of vanadium - Highveld is the
world's largest producer - have also fallen.
Mr Boyd said the board had approved the R2.5bn Columbus project, a joint
venture with Samancor, the South African ferrochrome producer. Talks with
the authorities about incentives and funding must still be finalised.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippondenso in 25% fall as car
demand weakens

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPONDENSO, Japan's largest maker of electronic and electrical car parts
which is affiliated to Toyota Motor, incurred a 25 per cent fall in parent
pre-tax profits to Y30.42bn (Dollars 239m) for the first half to June,
showing the effects of declining domestic car demand.
Sales rose 4.3 per cent to Y681.9bn, but the company blamed the fall in
earnings partly on an increase in labour costs and research and development
spending. It said profits would have been more than halved were it not for
rationalisation moves and efficiency improvements already in place.
Apart from Toyota - its main customer and 23 per cent controlling
shareholder - Nippondenso supplies all Japan's other carmakers except
Nissan. The industry is likely to have been seeking to squeeze supplier
margins to help shield the car manufacturers from the downturn.
For the full year, Nippondenso is projecting flat sales of Y1,350bn and
taxable profits of Y65bn, down 21.7 per cent from the Y83bn achieved last
year. Previously the company had expected to maintain or slightly improve on
the 1991 level.
Nippondenso said equipment investment would be cut to Y100bn from Y120bn
last year and an originally budgeted Y126bn this time.
A breakdown of its interim revenues showed the greatest gains in sales of
electrical parts and electronic control products, its second largest
segment. These showed a 7.2 per cent rise - Japanese makers have been
packing their vehicles with technology as one effort to stimulate customer
demand.
Sales of car heaters and air conditioners, its mainstay representing more
than one-third of business, were a bare 0.2 per cent higher.
Daihatsu Motor, the Japanese compact car and minivan manufacturer, and
Tianjin Automobile Industrial, the mainland Chinese carmaker, are
considering setting up a joint venture, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Daihatsu, 14.7 per cent owned by Toyota Motor, already supplies technology
and parts to Tianjin, while the Chinese company produces Daihatsu's Charade
cars and Hijet commercial vehicles for the local market. It produced about
20,000 Charades and about 14,000 Hijets in 1991.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Shaping a new market from
bank debt - Investing in Latin American Brady bonds is not for the faint
hearted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW will mark the latest stage in the development of a high-yield
sovereign bond market as Argentina moves another important step closer to
transforming its Dollars 31bn of foreign bank debt into bonds.
By the end of this year, if their optimistic targets are met, both Argentina
and Brazil will have succeeded in securitising their combined Dollars 75bn
of bank debts.
The new 'Brady bonds' that result - named after the US treasury secretary
whose debt-reduction proposals have provided a model for successive
developing countries - will create one of the biggest opportunities so far
for international investors to take part in the highly-volatile Latin
American debt markets.
So far, some Dollars 60bn of Brady bonds have been issued, mostly by Mexico
(Dollars 33bn) and Venezuela (Dollars 19.3bn), but also by Costa Rica,
Nigeria, Philippines and Uruguay. Successful conclusions to the Argentine
and Brazilian plans would more than double the amount of outstanding bonds.
One effect of this massive increase in supply could be to depress prices.
For instance, there are currently only around Dollars 10bn of floating rate
notes (FRNs) issued by developing countries: by the end of the year, the
amount will have jumped to Dollars 27.2bn, estimates Mr Paul Luke, an
analyst at Morgan Grenfell in London.
That will put pressure on prices - though, with no immediate need for banks
to sell the new bonds, it should not cause a mass sell-off. Instead, said Mr
Luke, there is likely to be considerable switching between new and existing
FRNs as holders reassess the relative value of different instruments.
The same is likely to be true of the bulk of fixed rate bonds created by the
Brady deals.
The 'stripped' yields on Mexican and Venezuelan Brady bonds (that is, the
yield based on pure country risk, after stripping out the effect of the
collateral backing the bonds) have virtually halved in the past two years,
as the graph shows. The implied yields on the new Argentine and Brazilian
bonds are far higher, with Argentina at around 18.5 per cent and Brazil at
over 30 per cent. Holders who have made substantial paper profits on Mexico
and Venezuela may take the chance to try to repeat the success by switching
into the new Argentine and Brazilian bonds.
The market's long-term future, though, depends on whether new investors can
be drawn into these high-yielding securities. Most institutional investors
have been excluded from the secondary market that sprang up during the 1980s
in the bank debt of lesser developed countries. Some countries' central
banks have restricted the holding of debt to banks, while many institutions
are limited by their internal rules to investing in bonds, excluding them
from the market in traded bank debt.
Even for those allowed to invest, the drawbacks have been extensive.
Settling trades in the secondary market in bank debt is expensive and
time-consuming.
The experience of Mexico and Venezuela, which issued Brady bonds during
1990, shows that a vigorous market could quickly develop in the new
instruments. Both countries' bonds are among the most heavily traded in the
international markets: according to figures compiled by Euroclear, the
largest international bond settlement house, over Dollars 4bn of Venezuela's
step-up bonds due 2007 were traded during June, making these the most
actively traded of any USDollars security in Euroclear.
The process of creating a new bond market out of Argentine and Brazilian
bank debt is already well advanced. By tomorrow, Argentina's bank creditors
will have to elect what type of bonds they want to receive in return for
their debt, signalling the new bond market.
This deadline has already effectively killed off the market in Argentine
bank debt, known as GRA. Trading began to peter out around three weeks ago
as banks moved to settle all their outstanding trades before the August 7
cut-off point.
In its place, a market in the yet-to-be issued bonds has already opened  -
as it has with Brazilian debt. Trading in the so-called 'when, as and if
issued' bonds does not involve any cash changing hands at the time of the
trade: only when the bonds are finally issued will traders settle up for
their losses or profits. That makes it attractive for investors wanting to
play the market but not wanting to have to fund their positions.
The fast-growing high-yield bond markets that have emerged from the LDC debt
crisis are likely to attract only the most adventurous fund managers,
however. For a start, they betray all the signs of immature markets. Prices
across Latin America, for instance, move together in reaction to dramatic
(particularly bad) news in any one country, even if the news has no bearing
on other countries in the region.
'The region is not properly researched yet. It over-reacts to events -
that's part of the risk,' said Mr Marc Wenhammar, a fund manager at Latin
American Securities, a specialist investor in the region.
Also, a Wild West spirit has pervaded the market: big profits and light or
non-existent regulation have given rise to fears about market practices and
concerns that banks have traded on inside information gained from their
negotiations with borrower governments. With the Federal Reserve in the US
and the Bank of England in the UK breathing down their necks, traders have
belatedly got together to form the Emerging Markets Association, to try to
develop rules for, and confidence in, the markets.
However, it is uncertainty about the economic prospects for the region that
will keep most investors away. Ample demonstration of this came from Brazil
yesterday: the country's debt, which had been trading at over 33 per cent of
face value, tumbled sharply to under 30 as renewed fears took hold over the
future of President Fernando Collor, fighting for his political life in the
face of corruption allegations. With volatility like that, the Latin
American debt markets are likely to remain outside the scope of most
investors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Trust Bank, a medium-sized Japanese trust bank, is to close its
representative offices in New York and London later this year.
It will be the first Japanese bank to fold its international network, a move
which could prompt similar decisions by other banks.
In sharp contrast to the Japanese banks' aggressive international expansion
of the late 1980s, they have refocused on their domestic market. The banks
now favour business with established Japanese blue chip companies rather
than overseas groups.
While the banks are burdened with increasing bad loans caused by sharp falls
in the Japanese stock and property markets, they have been slow to respond
to hard times - unlike the Japanese brokers which have implemented
rationalisation programmes.
Leading brokers, such as Nomura and Daiwa, are reshuffling their overseas
operations, while smaller houses, such as Takagi Securities and Kaisei
Securities, have withdrawn from overseas operations.

TRAVELERS, the US composite insurer, revealed that second-quarter underlying
profits had slipped 23.7 per cent to Dollars 74.8m from Dollars 98m in the
same period of last year.
An extraordinary gain in the 1992 quarter and a one-time charge a year
earlier reduced the decline to 14.3 per cent, bringing reported net income
to Dollars 77.7m, or 70 cents a share, against Dollars 90.7m, or 85 cents,
last year.
Results from Travelers' life and pensions businesses are still suffering
from real estate difficulties, with a higher level of underperforming
mortgage loans and lower interest rates reducing net investment income.
Profits from property-casualty operations, however, improved in the quarter
in spite of severe catastrophe losses suffered by the industry as a whole.
Mr Edward Budd, chairman and chief executive, said the decline in interest
rates had increased the market value of Travelers' fixed-income portfolio to
Dollars 23.2bn - or Dollars 1bn above book value.
Catastrophes reduced earnings by Dollars 18m after-tax, compared with
Dollars 11m last year.
Underperforming real estate grew by about 2 per cent to Dollars 5.2bn from
Dollars 5.1bn at the end of this year's first quarter. The real estate
valuation reserves stood at Dollars 871m at the end of the second quarter.
Net profits from the property-casualty commercial lines slipped to Dollars
58.7m from Dollars 62.4m a year ago, while personal lines rose to Dollars
15.9m from Dollars 7.8m.
Life, health and annuities made a net gain of Dollars 15.8m, compared with
Dollars 9m last year, while managed health care/employee benefits produced
earnings of Dollars 16m, against Dollars 20m the previous year.
Premiums totalled Dollars 1.6bn, compared with Dollars 1.9bn last year,
while net investment income fell to Dollars 713m from Dollars 846m. For the
first half of 1992, Travelers recorded a decline in net income to Dollars
140.8m, or Dollars 1.27, compared with Dollars 183.8m, or Dollars 1.74, in
the same period of 1991.
Earlier this week Cigna, one of the largest composite insurers in the US,
unveiled underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991.
Mr Wilson Taylor, Cigna's chairman, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide
property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: US Steel may build plant to
rival mini-mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
US STEEL, the largest integrated steel manufacturer in the US, is
considering building a new steel plant to combat America's fast-growing
steel mini-mills on their own ground.
If it went ahead, the investment would represent an important change of
strategy which other integrated manufacturers would be likely to follow.
US Steel, a division of the USX steel and energy group, yesterday confirmed
reports it was investigating the construction of a mini-mill as one of its
business options.
However, the company said that while the issue remained 'under active
study,' no specific proposals had been developed.
Mini-mill steel companies - small, non-union businesses using less
capital-intensive technology than America's vertically integrated
manufacturers - have captured more than 20 per cent of the US market during
the past three decades and are now invading Big Steel's last bastion, the
market for flat-rolled products.
Nucor, the most successful of the mini-mills, is producing 1m tons of
commodity grade flat rolled steel at a plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and
is about to open a second plant, with similar capacity, at Hickman,
Arkansas.
The plants use a new technology - thin slab casting - which saves time,
energy and labour costs. It allows steel to be cast into two inch slabs and
then rolled directly into coils.
However, some analysts question whether this technology can ever produce
steel of sufficient quality for the more demanding markets.
The current method employed by Big Steel involves creating a slab nine to 12
inches thick, cooling it, transporting it to another site and then reheating
the slab before it is rolled into coil.
US Steel, which previously considered and rejected the method being used by
Nucor, may be mulling investment in another new technology, strip casting,
which some analysts believe may produce steel of superior quality to the
thin slab method.
Many analysts argue that the route US Steel is considering is the path other
integrated steel companies will have to take if they are to beat back the
challenge from the mini-mills, which may bring on 10m tons or more of
flat-rolled capacity over the next decade.
However, the integrated companies will face delicate negotiations with the
United Steelworkers union over the labour flexibility needed to compete
successfully at new plants against the non-union mini-mills.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cathay keeps its long-term plans
on course - The Hong Kong airline's preparations for Chinese rule in 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY last month, the final piece of a jigsaw started in 1984 fell into
place for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline owned by Swire Group.
A 10 per cent stake in the airline passed from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to
China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and China Travel Service (CTS),
two mainland Chinese companies.
The deal marked the fruition of a nine-year plan to secure Cathay's future
after 1997. This not only covered the airline's shareholding structure, but
included since 1987 the way it manages its balance sheet, emphasising the
maintainence of high levels of cash.
Senior Cathay executives believe this twin-track policy will help dispel any
concerns among investors and customers over the airline's future. If so,
then Cathay should be well placed to take advantage of growth in the
Asia-Pacific region, analysts say.
The region is forecast to show the most growth in airline traffic. According
to the International Air Transport Association (Iata) scheduled traffic in
the Asia-Pacific region will grow from 25.2 per cent of the world's total in
1985 to 35.8 per cent in 1995 and more than 50 per cent by 2010.
In 1984, Britain and China signed the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong
providing for the transfer of the colony to China on June 30 1997. At that
time, Swire decided it could not continue to own Cathay outright and
safeguard its future after 1997. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, says: 'We decided
that the shareholding structure of the airline would have to change.
Broadly, we had in mind three steps.'
The first was to take the company public. This was done in April 1986 when
17.5 per cent was sold with 15 per cent floated publicly. The other two
steps required securing mainland Chinese investors. In 1987, China
International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) acquired 12.5 per
cent through an issue of new shares and the purchase of stock from Hongkong
Bank.
Arguably, the most important step was the third: securing a mainland
shareholder with its own aviation interests. 'We are now in a situation
which we would broadly wish to see stay in place for the long term,' says Mr
Sutch. 'We have no intention of changing what we have; I believe that what
we've got in place meets the needs of 1997.'
According to analysts, the biggest threat to Cathay is that after 1997 China
will set up a competitor airline in Hong Kong. The company, however, hopes
that, through the addition of CNAC and CTS to its share register, this
possibility is ruled out.
Mr Sutch says: 'If China is interested in capitalising on what Hong Kong has
to offer, they can do it most effectively through the instrument of Cathay
rather than through starting from scratch themselves. Cathay is the best
positioned to take advantage of Hong Kong.'
He is also content with the second part of the defensive package: strong
cash holdings. Gross cash at the end of 1991 totalled HKDollars 11.4bn
(USDollars 1.47bn), roughly double the level in 1987 when the company
decided to build its cash reserves.
Cathay wanted the protection that liquidity brings if banks shy from lending
to airlines.
'We wanted to be sure that in the event that Hong Kong got put into the
'too-difficult-to-manage-China-risk-basket' then we would have the cash we
needed for development,' Mr Sutch says. 'We've got a 'war chest', if you
like, so that if the banks foreclose on airlines in Hong Kong then we can
keep going.'
However, these policies for securing the airline's future have only laid the
foundations for the years ahead; building on them requires imagination.
Since 1987, the cost of running Cathay has doubled but profits have not.
Last year, it cost HKDollars 16.5bn to produce revenues of HKDollars 20.1bn.
Although the airline is well-positioned geographically, its home base has a
chronic inflation problem, with price rises likely to remain in the low
double digits for the foreseeable future.
Although Cathay has ach-ieved productivity growth of about 3.5 per cent a
year since the late 1980s, Mr Sutch admits there remains a lot to do.
To this end Cathay will relocate half its computing operations to Sydney,
Australia, and transfer more than 200 accounts function jobs to Guangzhou
(Canton), China. It may also base air crew in other parts of the world. The
introduction in the mid-1990s of Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s to replace
ageing TriStars will increase capacity, save on maintenance costs and reduce
flight crew numbers by a third.
The rationale is simple. Land and labour costs - especially in China - are
much lower than in Hong Kong. In Sydney, where land is cheap, there is the
added benefit that many former Cathay computer systems engineers live there.
'In the same way that manufacturers found that Hong Kong was too expensive
and went across the border, so are we,' says Mr Sutch.
But, even with these moves, he admits it is unlikely that Cathay will return
to the levels of profitability achieved in the late 1980s. At that time, it
had gross operating margins of more than 25 per cent. 'I don't think we will
see the very high returns of the late 1980s. They were exceptional and
before Hong Kong's inflation rate settled into the double digits.'
Cathay has remained aloof from the trend in civil aviation to form alliances
with other airlines. But Mr Sutch foresees a time in three to five years
when a loose alliance with a European, US and other Asian carrier might
work.
'But I do not see any need for equity exchanges. If an alliance or
relationship is put in place for good commercial reasons then those good
commercial reasons should make it stick. Any alliance would have to meet the
key requirements of increasing competitiveness, lowering costs and adding
value for the customer. We are not there yet.'

<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of the Maxwell Communication
Corporation (MCC) that discovered a majority of its shares were pledged
improperly last year to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell,
said it was in talks with bidders interested in a possible takeover.
The Princeton-based Berlitz also unveiled its second-quarter net profit of
Dollars 2.9m, down from Dollars 5.9m in the same period of last year.
Revenues in the quarter were Dollars 72.6m, up from Dollars 66m a year ago.
For the first six months of 1992, Berlitz made Dollars 7.3m net income, down
from Dollars 11.8m in the first half of 1991. Revenues for the first half of
1992 were 7.8 per cent improved at Dollars 140.9m.
MCC is operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law in a complex
transatlantic arrangement that requires co-ordination between New York and
UK court-appointed administrators.
At present, most of the 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake that was nominally owned
by Macmillan - the US publisher that was itself owned by MCC - is actually
in the hands of five banks and companies that received the stock as
collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Berlitz, however, said it no longer
considered itself to be part of MCC.
Berlitz said it had retained Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette to advise it on a
possible merger, but the company stressed no agreement had yet been reached.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: BP Canada climbs on improved
gas, oil prices

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BP CANADA, the oil and gas producer formerly controlled by British
Petroleum, has reported improved second-quarter profits and a strengthening
balance sheet.
Net earnings from continuing operations totalled CDollars 3.7m (USDollars
3.13m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 2.3m, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. The latest figure excludes BP's mining assets, which are in the
process of being sold.
Long-term debt has been cut in the past six months from CDollars 183m to
CDollars 148m.
Mr David Claydon, chief executive, ascribed the improvement to higher
natural gas volumes, improved oil and gas prices, as well as a lower
Canadian dollar.
Natural gas output in the first half of 1992 was 34 per cent higher than a
year earlier, but oil and natural gas liquids production dropped by 4 per
cent.
Britain's BP sold its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada last June to a group of
investors.
Norcen Energy, the main oil and gas arm of the Bronfman interest of Toronto,
reported a sharp decline in first-half profits, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
The company saw profit for the period slide to CDollars 21.4m, or 28 cents a
share, down 39 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 480m, a
fall of 6 per cent.
Norcen, however, registered a strong improvement in the second quarter
compared with a year earlier, boosted by higher oil production and prices.
Natural gas output was also up sharply, but prices weakened. Alberta Energy
earned CDollars 23.3m, or 30 cents a share, in the first half, up from
CDollars 6.7m, or 6 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 279m,
against CDollars 265m. Interest costs dropped sharply while oil and gas
sales grew. The forest products side also improved.

MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, saw earnings dip by 2 per
cent in the latest quarter as slightly higher beer and cleaning services
profits were offset by the continuing slump in the hardware distribution
business.
Net earnings fell to CDollars 38.4m (USDollars 32.4m), or 66 cents a share,
in the three months to June 30, the first quarter of the company's fiscal
year. Earnings a year earlier were CDollars 39.3m, or 71 cents a share.
Revenues for the period climbed to CDollars 799m from CDollars 762m.
Molson Breweries, Molson's joint venture with Foster's Brewing of Australia,
managed a 3 per cent rise in operating profits, despite a shrinking overall
beer market.
Molson's market share slipped to 50.3 per cent from 51.8 per cent a year
earlier.
Diversey Corporation, the international cleaning services subsidiary, lifted
profits by 10 per cent, thanks largely to gains in the UK and Germany. But
sales in North America were soft and margins were eroded by stiff
competition.
Beaver Lumber's profit fell by 16 per cent, reflecting the unexpectedly
protracted recession in Canada.
Molson said it expected the business recovery to gain momentum later this
year, but at a 'moderate rate'.

The Treuhandanstalt, the German agency charged with privatising the east's
old state-owned enterprises, said AHP's Wyeth Pharma offshoot was chosen
mainly because it wanted to keep LAW as a self-contained subsidiary in
Leipzig. The company will be expanding production there and selling a wide

The German company was sold for an undisclosed sum.
Wyeth agreed to invest DM24m (Dollars 16m) by 1997 and to guarantee 200 out

expansion

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leading French insurance groups are accelerating their international
expansion with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) agreeing terms to invest
in CAP, one of Chile's largest insurers, and Axa increasing its Asian
interests in a FFr165m (Dollars 32.35m) deal with Sime Darby of Malaysia.
UAP, the state-controlled company which is the biggest single force in
French insurance, has struck a cross-shareholding agreement with CAP. The
French group's Chilean subsidiary will take 51 per cent of La Australe, a
life insurance business formerly wholly-owned by CAP, and 35 per cent of El
Libertador, one of CAP's pension fund management companies.
CAP, which has industrial activities in steel and timber, will take a
minority stake in UAP's Chilean company. UAP has interests in Brazil,
Uruguay and Argentina.
The CAP deal comes at a time when UAP is trying to expand its European
network. The group has for some months been locked in negotiations with
Suez, one of France's largest industrial holding companies, over another
proposed cross-shareholding deal whereby UAP would swap part of its stake in
Victoire, a smaller French insurer, for a share of the latter's holding in
Colonia, a German insurance company.
Meanwhile, Axa, the private sector company which is France's second-largest
insurer, has concluded its second investment in Asia by agreeing terms to
take stakes in two companies owned by Sime Darby, a prominent Malaysian
insurance group. Axa is paying FFr165m for 50 per cent of Sime Shield in
Singapore and 30 per cent of Sime East West in Malaysia.
Axa, which four years ago made its first foray into Asia by setting up a
reinsurance subsidiary in Singapore, said it saw the Sime Darby deal as a
precursor to further investment in the region.

FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Prima seeks two-month debt
moratorium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIMA Inmobilaria, the big Spanish property developer controlled by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), yesterday asked more than 60 creditor banks
for a two-month moratorium on repayment of bank debt estimated to be worth
almost Dollars 500m.
The banks, called to a meeting in Madrid by the KIO, which controls more
than 30 per cent of Prima, are due to respond today. More than half the bank
debt is guaranteed against properties owned by Prima. This makes it unlikely
that the group will file for protection from its creditors as the big
KIO-controlled chemicals group, Ercros, did last month when the Kuwaiti
agency refused to continue funding it.
The meeting nonetheless increases the sense of crisis surrounding the large
industrial empire built up in Spain by the KIO in the second half of the
1980s.
It seems likely that banks unable to recoup loans from Ercros will baulk at
helping Prima unless the KIO is able to offer them some form of assurance
that their exposure in Ercros will be covered.
The KIO has moved quickly to shake up its Spanish empire and to distance
itself from the long-term investment strategy followed by former managers.
By ordering new audits of its Spanish holding company, Torras, and valuing
the assets at market value and not, as previously had been the case, at
purchase price or inflated book values, the KIO claims to have uncovered
financing shortfalls of up to Dollars 3bn in its Spanish investments.
Spanish bankers have been irritated at what appears to be a decision to
change the KIO's investment strategy in Spain from the long to the short
term and the refusal of the Kuwaitis to meet obligations entered into by
their predecessors.
The new KIO management seems determined to distance itself from strategies
followed by earlier KIO leaders and may slowly be gaining the upper hand by
simply refusing to fund assets beyond the scope of their own participation
in them. While many attractive Prima properties would go to banks if the
company defaulted, the property market in Spain is weakening rapidly.
Prima's difficulties are largely tied to the collapse of the Spanish and
international property markets but the evident lack of enthusiasm in the the
new KIO management to fund it through these problems has contributed to a
sharp decline in its share price in the last two months.
Its condition also affects holders of a Pounds 100m Eurobond launched by
Torras in 1988. This bond is partly convertible into Prima stock, and is in
technical default because of the receivership at Ercros. None of the bond
holders has yet asked its trustees to declare a default but the collapse of
Prima shares makes it highly unlikely it will be held for long. Contrary to
earlier reports, the National Bank of Kuwait does not hold any of the bonds.

<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, are split over
whether to endorse a proposal for a new board of directors which will be
voted on at an extraordinary meeting of the board of representatives on
August 10.
UNI's board of representatives is comprised 50 per cent of company employees
and 50 per cent of shareholders, representing some 60 per cent of the
company's share capital. Mr Martin Imbach, representing Geneva-based CB
Capital Bank, Uni's third-biggest shareholder with a 4.28 per cent stake,
has complained that the proposed board includes only two new people.
Uni's board of directors and Mr Jan Erik Langangen, president and chief
executive, resigned at the end of last month. This followed the board's
failure to gain full backing from shareholders for a share issue this autumn
to raise up to NKr2bn (Dollars 343m) in fresh capital.
Shareholders had become disillusioned by Mr Langangen's failed strategy to
create a pan Nordic insurance alliance and the NKr4.7bn investment to
acquire a 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia Forsikrings.
Mr Helge Dietrichsen, a Uni Storebrand spokesman, said yesterday that
although the board of representatives could 'technically' reject the
proposal, it was unlikely to do so because several leading shareholders had
endorsed the proposal before it was publicly announced. Mr Imbach said that
Mr Anders Echoff, an Oslo attorney who was offered the post of chairman,
works in the same law firm as the head of the nominating committee, which
put his name forward.

more than double

AUSTRIAN Airlines' losses more than doubled to Sch251.7m (Dollars 23.6m) in
the first half in spite of a sharp increase in traffic volume. But Mr Anton
Heschgl, president of the majority state-owned carrier, forecast that it
would make a profit in the full year and pay 'a reasonable dividend'.
The airline blamed the sluggish economic performance in its main markets
plus 'the tariff situation' for the loss, which compares with a loss of
ASch107.1m in the same period of last year. The company decided to draw down
Sch125.6m from valuation reserves, thus reducing the loss to Sch126.1m.

SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General
Motors of the US, yesterday announced the appointment of Mr Keith
Butler-Wheelhouse as chief executive.
He will take up his position on September 1 in succession to Mr David
Herman, who became chief executive at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary,
last month after two-and-a-half years running Saab Automobile from its
formation in January 1990.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, 46, is a British citizen. He worked for Ford in South
Africa from 1965 and became the company's sales and marketing director in
1982. Three years later he moved to GM South Africa as director of technical
operations.
He was appointed managing director of Delta in November 1987 after GM sold
its shareholding in the company.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse will have the difficult task of leading Saab Automobile
into viability.
Under Mr Herman, a comprehensive rationalisation programme was carried out
in the company which brought a sharp decrease in its financial losses to
SKr293m (Dollars 54.4m) for the first quarter of the year.
It also doubled productivity performance as well as bringing about a sales
upturn in the all-important and difficult US car market.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels meets forecast with 32% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESORT Hotels increased its pre-tax profit by 32 per cent to Pounds 6.05m in
the year to April 30, in line with the estimate made with the Pounds 20.6m
rights issue.
The improvement, from Pounds 4.58m, came on turnover of Pounds 16.1m (Pounds
12.2m) and after a net Pounds 428,000 (Pounds 127,000) interest receivable.
Earnings per share, however, were depressed to 8.02p (8.98p) as the average
number of shares jumped from 48.1m to 66.9m and the tax rate doubled to 11
per cent.
The 1-for-2 issue, announced on April 30, will raise the number of shares in
issue to about 99m this year. Mr Roland Lewis, finance director, said the
tax rate would continue to increase to about 13 per cent. It had been kept
low by tax losses in acquisitions and the large capital spending programmes
of previous years. This year expenditure would fall from more than Pounds
11m to about Pounds 5m.
Resort, launched in 1984 with the backing of Business Expansion Scheme funds
and floated (initially on the USM) in 1988, said trading conditions last
year were 'among the most difficult we have ever encountered'.
It owns 14 hotels and manages more than 30 others, of which 11 in the County
and Country Resort chains are to be bought for shares over the next two
years, with the rights issue proceeds cushioning the debt to be brought on
board. Mr Lewis said this would amount to Pounds 7.5m this year and about
Pounds 20m more next year, with gearing estimated to run up to 18 per cent.
The immediate effect of the rights issue - the fourth in less than four
years - was to wipe out year-end debt of about Pounds 22m, gearing of 40 per
cent. Resort said no further calls on shareholders were anticipated in the
foreseeable future.
Mr Lewis said the profit improvement came from additional management
contracts and improved trading in refurbished hotels. Opportunities kept
arising to pick up management contracts, especially as the recession led to
banks repossessing hotels - a recent example being the Holiday Inn in
Daventry. About Pounds 3m of last year's turnover had come from management
fees.
The occupancy rate at its predominantly three-star hotels was around 60 per
cent, a drop of three percentage points in the last six months although that
was on a larger stock of bedrooms.
A final dividend of 2.25p makes a total of 3.45p (3.4p).
The shares gained 2p to close at 57p yesterday, compared with the rights
issue price of 63p.

4.7m

<TEXT>
BRITISH ALCAN Aluminium has reduced savagely its capital expenditure as it
continues to suffer record losses because of a world-wide slump in aluminium
prices and the deep UK recession.
The company reported that its pre-tax loss in the first six months had
increased from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 4.7m. Last year's figure was after
exceptional costs of Pounds 7.3m for redundancies and plant closures, but
there were none this year.
Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman, said: 'No significant improvement in
performance is anticipated in the second half, given current aluminium
prices and the weak state of the UK economy.'
Keeping a tight control over working capital in order to generate cash
remained a priority for British Alcan, a subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of
Canada which also reported substantial first-half losses.
The British company's capital expenditure was restricted to Pounds 9m,
against Pounds 20m in the same months of 1991.
Since December debt had been cut by another Pounds 17m, from Pounds 336m,
resulting in a two point improvement in the debt-equity ratio to 34:66 at
June 30.
Mr Ritchie said the benefit of continuing cost reduction schemes also helped
to contain losses.
Volume sales rose by 21,500 tonnes to 172,600 tonnes reflecting increased
volumes of fabricated products and strong export business. Higher recycled
aluminium volumes from the Pounds 28m Warrington used beverage can facility,
which opened last year, helped to compensate for reduced primary aluminium
sales caused by the mothballing of half the Lynemouth smelter's capacity in
1991.
However, due to lower prices, sales revenues fell by Pounds 2m to Pounds
384.8m. . The attributable loss was Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 3.8m.)

A GROUP of present and former employees has acquired the minerals consulting
and minerals processing laboratory business of the Robertson Group for an
undisclosed sum.
Robertson was acquired for Pounds 52m by Simon Engineering in April last
year.
The buy-out group is headed by Mr Malcolm Clews, who between 1984 and 1988
headed Robertson's minerals consultancy business. He said he had been
working since autumn 1990 to arrange the purchase.
The revamped organisation is called Robertson Research Minerals, which he
claims is one of the largest integrated independent minerals consultancies
in Europe.
RRM has acquired all the data archive collected during Robertson Research's
30 years of operations. Current projects include providing advice to the UN
Development programme in the Yemen and two gold projects in Uzbekistan for
Canadian clients.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Walker takes steps to avoid bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS acting for Mr George Walker, former chairman and chief executive
of Brent Walker, yesterday put forward proposals in the High Court in the
hope of avoiding his being declared bankrupt.
Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, completed a Pounds 1.6bn
refinancing package in March this year.
TSB Bank, one of the banks which lent to Mr Walker personally as well as to
the company, had asked for an order of personal bankruptcy against him. The
petition cited claims in excess of Pounds 9m.
The court appointed Mr Raymond Hocking, an insolvency partner at Stoy
Hayward, the accountants, to examine the proposals and report to the court
on August 19.
Mr Michael Coleman of Harkavys, Mr Walker's solicitors, said: 'Mr Walker
believes that he has put forward, with the assistance of his family,
proposals which will benefit his creditors and thus their shareholders
beyond that which they would have achieved had he been made bankrupt'.
'He sincerely hopes that his creditors will carefully consider the proposals
being put forward on his behalf and agree to them.'
Mr Coleman said he could not give any details of the proposals. The thirty
minute hearing was conducted in private and Mr Walker did not attend.
TSB Bank said it had sought the order for bankruptcy after exhausting all
other possibilities. It said it was acting unilaterally in the best
interests of its shareholders.
Mr Walker and his family are thought to owe far in excess of the Pounds 9m
claim the TSB Bank is making. In 1989 trusts acting for his children paid
Pounds 50m for four vineyards which were acquired from the company.
In 1990 Mr Walker and his family borrowed to finance a Pounds 27.5m purchase
of convertible bonds issued by the company in the early stages of its
refinancing talks. The bonds have since been converted into shares in the
company. These are now valued at a fraction of their original cost.
Brent Walker's latest accounts show that Birdcage Walk, owned by trustees on
behalf of Mr Walker and his family, had held 12.4m shares, 3.7 per cent of
the capital. However, Birdcage Walk had gone into liquidation and the
company had not received any notification from the liquidator about the
stake.
Mr Walker had made a Pounds 20m claim against the company and its banks when
he was ousted from his executive role in May last year. However, the company
said yesterday that no progress was being made on these claims.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: WPP restructure proposal gets overwhelming
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in WPP, the marketing services group, voted almost unanimously
yesterday in favour of a financial restructuring plan. Of the preference
shareholders, some of which had earlier threatened to vote against, 99.7 per
cent voted in favour. The vote opens the way for Mr Gordon Stevens, an
ex-Unilever man, to become non-executive chairman today.
WPP will now be working to improve operating margins, with the main thrust
being an attack on the staff costs to revenue ratio. It is aiming for a
further refinancing on more normal terms by 1997. WPP is negotiating the
sale of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, an advertising business, which could raise
Dollars 65m-Dollars 70m (Pounds 37m) and might be completed in the next few
months. The sale or flotation of the market research business, which might
be worth Dollars 150m to Dollars 200m, will take longer, while a plan to
float the South East Asian activites appears to have been postponed.
Under the restructuring plan the group's convertible preference shares are
turned into 160.3m new ordinary shares which will start trading today. The
ordinary shares closed yesterday at 41p, down 4p and the convertibles at 31
1/2 p down 2p.
The group's banks are also subscribing to an issue of 239.5m new shares at
60p each, raising Pounds 143m, which will be used to repay some of the
company's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) debt. Shareholders can buy back these
shares from the banks. The banks have also provided the group with a Dollars
150m bridge facility. The group has its bank's permission to launch a rights
issue, so long as it is priced at 45p a share or more.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wickes stages recovery to Pounds 2.6m but
passes dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WICKES, the European DIY chain which teetered on the edge of disaster after
diversifying into the timber business, has bounced back into the black
recording an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.6m after losses of Pounds
12.9m last time.
Sales for the six months to June 30 slipped from Pounds 259m to Pounds 253m,
but the company scored operating profits of Pounds 9.4m against losses of
Pounds 3.2m last time.
The dividend was again passed but Wickes said it would consider paying a
final dividend if its full-year results justified it. Earnings per share
amounted to 0.7p (5.8p losses).
The company's core DIY business, which is tilted towards the trade end of
the market, saw very strong growth with UK retail profits improving by 28
per cent while those from continental Europe rose by 32 per cent.
Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman and chief executive, said the fierce discount
war in the DIY sector in the UK had not had a substantial impact on Wickes.
'We had a short blip when it hurt us but it did not last for very long,' he
said.
He added that Wickes had concentrated on consistent low pricing which, he
suggested, contrasted sharply with the sporadic discounting tactics adopted
by the other DIY multiples. 'If they say they are going to have a sale on
the Saturday then you could fire a shotgun through their stores on a Tuesday
and not hit anyone,' he said.
Wickes opened eight stores in the UK during the half year and the company
said it continued to see considerable opportunities for growth in mainland
Europe, especially in France.
Losses at the company's Hunter and Malden timber businesses were sharply
reduced. 'I think most of the surgery is now over. It is now a question of
motivation, drive and the market,' Mr Sweetbaum said.
Group debt declined during the half year by Pounds 22.3m and net borrowings
at the period end totalled Pounds 84.7m. The interest charge fell from
Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 6.8m. There was an extraordinary net gain of Pounds
3.9m (Pounds 2.4m charge) largely resulting from the conversion of the
group's remaining Pounds 19m of convertible unsecured loan stock.
Lord Sieff of Brimpton, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, is to
retire as a non-executive director. But earlier this week, the company
announced the appointment of Mr Michael von Brentano, head of investment
banking activities for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Germany, as a non-executive
director.
COMMENT
Over the past few years Wickes has been through the mangle with a vengeance
but is certainly emerging as a leaner, fitter business. Since being saved by
a Pounds 42.6m emergency rights issue last year, the company has
substantially cut the losses at its timber business and continued to press
ahead with its successfully distinctive DIY formula. Wickes is certainly one
of the lowest-cost operators in the sector and has been able to derive
substantial cost savings from its pan-European sourcing policy. Analysts
have scaled back expectations for the full year - because of Wickes's
cautious noises about the economy - but are still looking for between Pounds
12m and Pounds 14m. That puts the company on a prospective multiple of 17
with a token dividend also likely to be paid. After gaining much ground
following the rights issue, Wickes's shares have fallen heavily in recent
months. But its attractions as a recovery play are reviving - at least for
those who still believe in recovery.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Lewinsohn stands back from Card Clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chairman of Dominion International, the collapsed finance house,
has been forced to distance himself from a small credit card security
company, following revelations that the Department of Trade and Industry is
trying to disqualify him from holding company directorships.
Mr Max Lewinsohn, who was chairman of Dominion for 12 years before its
collapse in 1990, last week resigned as non-executive chairman of Card
Clear, which is seeking to raise between Pounds 150,000 and Pounds 250,000
through the Business Expansion Scheme.
Card Clear has written to all the scheme's applicants offering them the
chance to withdraw before the closing date on Friday. The company's advisers
said it was too early to tell if any applications had been withdrawn.
In January the DTI initiated proceedings against Mr Lewinsohn relating to
his involvement with Dominion under section 6 of the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986. The next hearing is set for October.
Mr Lewinsohn retains a small stake in Card Clear after he and other
investors raised Pounds 150,000 for the company last September.
The BES scheme is underwritten by Ellis &amp; Partners, stockbrokers for Card
Clear, and another company in which Mr Lewinsohn holds a minority stake.
Mr Clive Mattock, a director of Ellis, is a long-term friend of Mr Lewinsohn
and was managing director of Oaklands Stockbrokers, which was closed in
1990.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Anglesey Mining raises Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLESEY MINING, floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 to develop
Britain's first base metals mine for decades, at Parys Mountain, Anglesey,
is raising another Pounds 620,000 (Pounds 515,000 net of expenses) from
institutional investors and its biggest shareholder, Imperial Metals of
Canada.
Work at Parys Mountain came to an abrupt halt at the end of last year when
Anglesey, which had spent Pounds 8.5m on the zinc-lead-copper project,
failed to raise another Pounds 25m to take it through to production.
Mr Hugh Morris, chairman of Anglesey and Imperial, said yesterday the latest
financing ensured that Anglesey would be self-sufficient and in a stable
financial position for the next two years. It also showed that Anglesey
continued to receive financial support from Imperial.
He hoped that now metals prices were rising and the world economic situation
seemed likely to improve, the search for more equity capital for Anglesey
would resume soon.
Imperial's shareholding in the UK company would remain at about 43 per cent
following the latest share issue. It is proposed - provided shareholders
agree - that Anglesey issues 12.4m new ordinary shares at 5p each to
Imperial and the institutions.
Imperial would also take another 4m new ordinary shares at the same price
(worth a total of Pounds 200,000) in satisfaction of part of a loan made to
Anglesey.
The shares fell by  1/2 p to 4 1/2 p.

Investors in BET were kept on tenterhooks yesterday after the closing date
of acceptances for the business services company's Pounds 200m rights issue.
The shares ended at 110p, equal to the rights price and some 19p below the
price prevailing before the rights issue was announced on July 14.
BET was guarded last night about the level of acceptances. Some indications
would suggest that while the rights cannot be considered a success it may
not have been the disaster that some commentators have suggested.
The 1-for-4 issue has been underwritten by Baring Brothers. The proceeds
will be used to redeem auction market preferred stock, the hybrid form of
debt and equity.

FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew rises to Pounds 66m -
Healthcare strength overcomes consumer products weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; NEPHEW increased pre-tax profits by 6 per cent in the first half, as
growth in healthcare products overcame weakness in the recession-hit UK
consumer division.
Orthopaedic, arthroscopy and special wound healing products grew at an
underlying 11 per cent, while the mainly UK-based consumer division was hit
by recess-ion - although it continued to produce strong cash flow.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 increased from a restated
Pounds 62.5m to Pounds 66m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 411m (Pounds
384m).
Earnings per share crept up to 4.3p (4.2p) and the interim dividend is
raised to 1.8p (1.75p).
Turnover in the consumer division, where sales of brands such as Nivea and
Elastoplast are concentrated in the UK, fell by 6 per cent.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the key feature of the results was
the accelerating growth in the core healthcare area. That was where the
group would focus its sales drive.
Growth from that source would be sustained at or above the 11 per cent rate
achieved in the first half by greater penetration into international
markets, where the company had existing sales networks but small market
shares.
Smith &amp; Nephew achieved a 15 per cent share of the world healthcare market,
which is worth Pounds 4bn.
'Most of our products are used by the over 60s. The market is growing
because of the basic human need for better health care.'
Mr Robinson said the consumer division would continue to grow a little
faster than inflation, but not as quickly as the medical areas and
hospital-related businesses.
The tax rate paid has risen from 27 per cent to 29 per cent and is likely to
rise to at least 31 per cent next year as the company is paying insufficient
mainstream UK corporation tax against which to offset Advance Corporation
Tax.

FT  06 AUG 92 / GKN beats forecasts with 37% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, the UK automotive components, engineering and industrial services
group, increased its pre-tax profits by 37 per cent in the first six months
of the year to Pounds 65.1m from Pounds 47.5m in the same period a year ago.
The performance exceeded market forecasts. However, GKN's share price fell
12p to close at 383p as Sir David Lees, chairman, warned of little
improvement in its markets in the next few months.
GKN's profits rise follows a 26 per cent increase in profits earlier this
week of BBA, the UK automotive, aviation and industrial components maker.
GKN turnover rose only 1.2 per cent to Pounds 1.258bn. Higher demand in
automotive markets in continental Europe and north America was offset by
weakness in the construction sectors in the UK, Australia and California.
The GKN balance sheet remains strong, and the group had a positive cash flow
in the first six months with net interest charges cut to Pounds 11.9m from
Pounds 16m a year ago.
It is maintaining an unchanged interim dividend of 8p. Earnings per share
jumped to 10.9p from 7.6p in the first half of 1991.
Sir David said the group expected little improvement in demand in its main
markets in the next few months. 'Profit improvement must come from increases
in market share and continued rigorous attention to costs and asset
management.' The workforce has fallen 7.5 per cent in the past 18 months.
Profits from car components were increased by higher volumes and by cost
cuts and improved efficiency.
Its motor components sales outperformed the market in north America, helped
by a sought after variety of models and orders from Mazda, Ford and Nissan.
In Europe, GKN has taken over the supply of drive-line products to the
Volkswagen group for the Audi 80. Sales were also increased by a favourable
model mix, as it supplies components to some of the most successful cars
launched recently in Europe.
GKN will also supply Toyota, Honda and Nissan, the three Japanese car makers
developing assembly plants in the UK.
GKN said it had gained contracts in May and June from US vehicle makers
which would come on stream from 1993.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Deutsche Bank operating profits drop 3.2% to DM3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's biggest bank, yesterday reported total group
operating profits down by 3.2 per cent to DM3.06bn (Pounds 1.05bn).
The figure was worse than expected by analysts and was the poorest result of
the big three German banks. Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank reported
double-digit increases in profits for the same period.
Partial operating profits - which exclude income from own-account trading
gains - fell 4 per cent to DM2.36bn. This compares with a 20 per cent gain
at this level at Dresdner Bank and a 14.7 per cent rise at Commerzbank.
The decline, which Deutsche Bank attributed to a general deterioration in
the world economy, prompted analysts to cut their forecasts for the full
year, predicting partial operating profits stagnation rather than growth of
around 6 per cent.
It also signalled the end of a long period of profits expansion at the bank:
last year operating profits advanced 21.7 per cent to a record DM5.2bn.
Analysts suggested that other German banks would ultimately experience a
similar slowdown.
Deutsche said: 'The restrained pace of the world economy and the slackening
off of economic dynamism at home have had an increasing influence on the
business and earnings situation at Deutsche Bank.'
The bank added that in spite of 'dampened expectations', it was confident of
a satisfactory result for the full year.
Earnings on interest in the Deutsche Bank group rose 6 per cent to DM5.51bn,
while the margin on interest fell from 2.41 per cent to 2.30 per cent. Fee
income was up 5.6 per cent to DM1.97bn.
A bank spokesman said the slowdown had to be seen against the excellent
results for last year. He said it reflected in general higher costs of
servicing depositors and the bank's growing role in low-margin interbank
lending.
Refunding costs rose 11.2 per cent to DM11.34bn as customers moved deposits
from current accounts to term deposits with higher yields.
Some analysts drew comfort from a slowdown in the bank's expenses. These
grew at 6.8 per cent - compared with six months of the total figure for last
year. Over the whole of last year, expenses grew by 18.4 per cent,
reflecting the cost of expansion into east Germany.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Money made available to meter but not to manage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From BO HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So Mr Michael Howard says that up to Pounds 3bn is estimated to be the
cost of installing water meters in England and Wales ('Compulsory metering
of water backed by minister for first time', July 31). Amazing the
government can find such an amount to spend on installing water meters but
cannot find any money to improve the way in which water is managed.
I note that he says the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the
consumer and that the impact of metering 'on poor families clearly needs
attention'. Presumably, by his latter statement, Mr Howard has the poor
homeowner firmly fixed in his mind.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Not clear how UK's borrowings explain large trade
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir ALAN NEALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Walter Eltis (Personal View, 'From debt to deficit', July 29) shows
convincingly how the deficit in Britain's balance of payments reflects the
country's excessive borrowing.
In terms of flows of funds, indeed, it is something of a tautology that when
the private and public sectors in the UK, taken together, are in deficit, it
follows that the outside world - as the only other player in the game - must
be in surplus.
If the country lives beyond its means, it must either draw on its assets or
increase its debts.
It is not so clear, however, that if we are competitive, as Mr Eltis
believes, our borrowing explains the current large deficit in our balance of
trade.
Why should the increasing borrowing requirement of the government in any way
prevent the competitive supplier of widgets from gaining a larger share of
markets abroad and/or displacing imports in the home market?
Some of us can remember a time when improving the trade balance was seen as
a useful step towards the country paying its way and reducing its debts.
It is discouraging that, these days, economic advisers teach that reducing
the debts is itself a precondition for taking practical measures in the real
economy to bring the reduction of debt about.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: BT should stage a strategic retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL STOREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, BT's chairman, Mr Iain Vallance, is a man of great stature. However,
his stature will not be ennobled by confronting Oftel over its market
interventions ('BT chairman attacks watchdogs', July 31) while BT's market
share remains at 95 per cent or thereabouts.
In common with BT, most investors in telecommunication service provision
wish to evolve to a market structure in which price and quality, in its
broadest sense, create a sufficiently competitive market for consumers'
interests to be served without heavy regulatory intervention.
Conceptually, Oftel should regulate itself out of existence, leaving it to
the Office of Fair Trading, the Monopolies Commission, common law and
consumer legislation to protect the interests of consumers and competitors.
This must be a shared common goal.
Meanwhile, the reality is that BT has a 95 per cent market share and it
seems to me that Iain Vallance can forge the relationship with Oftel he (and
the rest of us) seeks when he has implemented a programme of strategic
market share retreat.
This means relinquishing to competitors, in a controlled way, segments of
the market which do not jeopardise future strategic positioning and which
contribute least to BT's return on capital. Michael Storey,

FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: CEOs not encouraged nor trained to lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT BLOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When Andrew Dyke (Letters, August 3) observes that chief executive
officers may copy Roman generals with the team briefings but still lack
their leadership skills, he touches a bigger issue: chief executive officers
are neither encouraged to lead, nor trained in leadership.
There are many styles of leadership, but all strive for the same end - to
get individuals to take personal risks to achieve goals that benefit others.
This is well understood in the military, where the risks are ultimate and
the goal may be survival. In war, leadership demands courage, determination,
vision and the ability to inspire. Management training - taught or
experienced - gives us consensus, 'managing upwards' and the golden
parachute.
For any CEO or aspirant wanting to get back to basics, I recommend a text
that I believe has yet to appear on Masters of Business Administration book
lists. It is Masks of Command (Penguin Books), in which John Keegan, a
Sandhurst lecturer and defence correspondent, analyses the leadership of
famous (and infamous) historical generals, from Alexander to Hitler.
After reading it, I defy any manager to think that addressing his or her
staff once a week is leadership.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Building on frail foundations: The prospects for Britain's
construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers on British building sites are required to wear hard hats to protect
themselves from objects falling from great heights. Such apparel might also
be appropriate for shareholders of UK construction companies, which have
seen the value of their investments plummet during the past three years.
The only thing that has fallen further and faster than contractors' share
prices is their profits. Many companies have been forced to cut or miss
dividends as their earnings have slumped.
Construction shares, based on the most recent earnings of the 28 companies
within the FT-Actuaries Construction Index, are trading on a historic
price/earnings (p/e) ratio of almost 40. The average for UK industry as a
whole is just over 14. This suggests that either construction shares remain
overvalued, in spite of the big falls in prices that already have occurred,
or earnings have to recover much more sharply than the market average in the
next few years to justify such a high rating.
It is hard to see where such a recovery might come from. In particular, the
economic conditions that allowed the industry to bounce back in the past may
not recur.
A large slice of the construction profits reported in the late 1980s came
from inflationary increases of more than 30 per cent a year in land and
property prices. But some senior industry executives believe that the high
real interest rates and monetary disciplines imposed by membership of the
European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) mean that UK housing and commercial
property profits may never be the same again.
For the foreseeable future, the outlook for property prices, and hence
profits, is bleak. House prices in southern and eastern England are on
average 25 per cent to 30 per cent lower than their peak in 1988-89. Most
construction companies do not expect house prices to show any real increase
until 1994 at the earliest. Commercial property prices have collapsed in
similar fashion, and may take even longer to recover given the overbuilding
of offices which took place in the 1980s.
Profit margins on UK contracting, meanwhile, have all but disappeared.
Construction companies, desperate for cash in the form of advance payments,
are taking work which does no more than cover overheads or may even incur a
loss.
Prices charged by contractors for construction work have fallen by up to 30
per cent since 1989, according to a survey of contractors, customers and
building professionals conducted by the Financial Times.
The fall in prices has as much to do with overcapacity in the industry as a
decline in workload which in volume terms is no lower than it was in
1986-87. At the time, these were regarded as reasonable years for the
construction industry.
The sector, with an estimated 200,000 companies sharing a combined annual
turnover of about Pounds 40bn, would appear ripe for rationalisation.
Already large numbers of small to medium-sized contractors, including some
public companies, have failed. More closures, and possibly some takeovers,
seem inevitable.
Syspas, a London-based firm of corporate analysts, calculates that 65 per
cent of building companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange face at least
a one-in-three chance of failing or being forced into a rescue package such
as a merger or large-scale restructuring.
Similar gloom is expressed by the Building Employers Confederation, the
industry's largest trade association. It has warned that a further 40,000
construction jobs are likely to disappear by Christmas, taking the total
jobs lost since the summer of 1989 to more than 300,000.
Judging by the increasingly depressing output forecasts from the industry,
it is going to be some time before prices start to rise again, leaving
margins under ever-increasing pressure. All this points to a further round
of dividend cuts later this year.
Faced with such pressures on revenues and in a bid to reduce borrowings,
larger companies such as Costain, Tarmac, Taylor Woodrow and Wimpey have
been selling peripheral businesses acquired in better times to offset the
cyclical swings in the industry and property markets.
Costain, which made a Pounds 69.2m pre-tax loss last year and passed its
final dividend, recently announced plans to sell a stake in its profitable
Australian mining business.
Wimpey has raised more than Pounds 300m from the disposal of properties,
waste management and offshore engineering businesses. Tarmac has raised
almost Pounds 100m from the sale of its UK bitumen-producing oil refinery
operations and its California contracting and aggregate operations. It has
also put its UK waste management business up for sale.
Such disposals will, however, provide little comfort to those who purchased
construction shares during the late 1980s and have seen the value of their
investments already fall by almost 90 per cent.
Shares in Costain, one of the great names of British contracting, have
fallen by 88 per since March 1990, from 220p to just 26p at last night's
close, reducing the company's market capitalisation from Pounds 505m to
Pounds 62m. The last time Costain's shares were this low was at the end of
1976. At their peak in August 1987 the company was valued at Pounds 840m.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, has also suffered on the stock
market. It has seen the value of its shares fall by 83 per cent from a peak
of 356p in May 1989 to 61p, valuing the company at Pounds 445m. Anybody
bidding for Tarmac three years ago would have received little change from an
offer of Pounds 3bn.
In the current financial year, the expected absence of large property
write-downs which had such an adverse impact on last year's results should
provide some relief. But this does not overcome the basic lack of operating
profitability.
It is therefore difficult to see construction companies returning to the
level of earnings or dividends that the stock market seems to expect. Some
companies are likely to require intensive care for some time yet. Even when
they recover, they may well find that life will never be the same again.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: Shareholders should be more vigilant, active and
demanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD B BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All shareholders will surely agree with Peter Morgan (Letters, July 31) that
the objective of corporate governance is to ensure that companies 'survive
and thrive'. But who does what about it when companies don't thrive and the
directors' remuneration takes an ever increasing share of diminishing
profit, value added or whatever measure you like to use. And let's be clear
about it, there are many FTSE-100 companies in this category right now.
In the same issue, Lex ('ICI does the splits') points to one solution:
'ICI's demerge plan is a splendid example of how a supposedly hidebound
management can be rendered nimble by a sense of threat.' And now we have
ProNed's survey of 491 directors adding damning evidence of the inadequacies
in the present system. No less than 86 per cent of the directors surveyed
were 'dissatisfied with the amateur approach adopted by companies of
appointing non-executive directors'.
Peter Morgan himself has publicly called for 'shareholders to see and
understand the connection between directors' pay and performance'. Every
annual general meeting I have attended recently has had shareholders, who do
not understand the connection, seeking justification for hefty increases in
directors' remuneration against poor performance. The answers are
pathetically inadequate. The real reason, never referred to, arises out of
the 'non-executive director old boy network' (see ProNed survey).
Shareholders have to become more vigilant, more active and more demanding.
United Kingdom Shareholders' Association intends to assist them in this
process.

FT  06 AUG 92 / A paper trail of troubles: The Bush administration is coming
under fire as Congress investigates alleged transfers of arms and money to
Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush might not have imagined it possible, but 18 months
after the end of the Gulf war he has found himself forced to box with the
shadow of Mr Saddam Hussein on two fronts.
Internationally, Saddam's defiance over United Nations nuclear inspection
efforts in Baghdad underscored the extent to which the Iraqi leader could
taunt Mr Bush during a presidential election year.
In the US, the Bush administration has been irritated by a series of
congressional investigations into both the arming of Iraq in the 1980s and
the improper lending of Dollars 5bn to Baghdad by the Atlanta branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The investigations have produced serious allegations that go well beyond the
acknowledged policy failures of the US 'tilt' toward Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war which ended in 1988. Instead, the claims are that officials of
the Bush administration may have been guilty of criminal wrongdoing.
Democratic members of Congress are alleging that for more than a year after
the war ended, top government officials pursued a policy of appeasing Saddam
with illegal transfers of money and arms in an attempt to maintain US
influence in Iraq.
Dozens of documents disclosed in Congress illustrate that nearly three years
ago the White House and the State Department were aware of Iraqi arms
procurement networks operating in Europe and the US. They also catalogue how
explicit government approval was given to the export of technology directly
to Iraqi factories known by Washington to be at work on nuclear and chemical
weapons.
The documents also show that the administration allowed Iraqi-owned
companies such as the Ohio affiliate of Britain's Matrix-Churchill, the
machine tools company, to operate in the US even after the August 1990
invasion of Kuwait. In addition, they confirm that US officials later
altered Commerce Department documents to hide from Congress the fact that
export licences had permitted military goods to be shipped to Iraq. This
willingness to allow militarily useful goods to be exported to Iraq had been
part of a broader policy of co-operation that was detailed in a presidential
directive of October 1989.
Week after week the declassified documents have been placed before Congress
by Mr Henry Gonzalez, a persistent and occasionally cantankerous Democrat
who chairs the House Banking Committee and who has spearheaded the BNL
probe. His accusations form the basis of no fewer than six congressional
committee investigations, but it is only in the past few weeks that leading
Democrats have begun to take a public interest. The US media has dubbed the
story 'Iraqgate'.
Mr Gonzalez and other Democrats have not hesitated to hurl the phrase
'cover-up' at the White House, just as Mr Bush and his aides have sought to
portray the entire investigation as politically biased hyperbole inspired by
the presidential election campaign.
However, congressional Democrats, led by Mr Jack Brooks, the conservative
Texan who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, have created what could be a
potentially more serious problem for Mr Bush and his colleagues. Earlier
this month, Mr Brooks and 19 other Democratic members of his committee wrote
to Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general, demanding the appointment of a
special prosecutor to investigate allegations that high-ranking officials of
the administration had committed crimes in arming Iraq before the Kuwait
invasion and then broke other laws in seeking to conceal information from
investigators. Mr Barr has not yet replied to the request.
At the heart of the Iraqgate allegations is the extent to which the Bush
administration can be shown to have knowingly assisted Iraq with loan
guarantees and militarily useful technology, including government-approved
exports that helped Saddam's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
projects as late as 1990.
US investigators say an estimated Dollars 2bn of the Dollars 5bn of Iraqi
loans made by BNL Atlanta went to help Saddam's weapons programmes. They
allege that both the Reagan and Bush administrations were aware of the Iraqi
loans flowing from Atlanta to Baghdad and found it convenient to permit them
as part of their pro-Baghdad policy. This charge, however, has not been
documented.
Several hundred millions of the unauthorised Dollars 5bn BNL loans were
backed by a US government loan guarantee plan administered by the
Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The
investigators allege that Iraq abused the CCC programme by using money
ostensibly loaned for US farm exports for military projects with the
knowledge of the Bush administration.
US government documents show that money from the BNL Atlanta branch funded
Iraq's Condor 2 missile project as well as components for nuclear weapons
and the 'super-gun' of the late scientist Dr Gerald Bull. BNL also funded,
according to CIA reports in 1989, Matrix-Churchill and other US and UK-based
front companies owned by Iraq and used in its procurement scheme.
The paper trail now in the public domain tells the story of a curious
sequence of events beginning with the initial August 1989 disclosure of the
BNL loans scandal.
In a Federal Reserve memorandum dated September 22 1989, Ms Gail McKenzie,
the Atlanta prosecutor heading the BNL probe, is quoted on the issue of
press allegations that BNL money went to fund the Condor 2 missile project:
'Everything being written about the missile sales is true,' she said.
Other recently released documents include US Customs Service memos written
nearly three years ago that stated flatly that BNL was suspected of having
'provided loans to various US firms for the illegal export to Iraq of
missile related technology to be used in the Condor 2 project'. This is
striking given that Department of Justice officials have insisted in public,
as recently as June 1992, that they cannot discuss any of the military
aspects of the BNL affair, which remain under investigation.
The thesis of US prosecutors in Atlanta, who have indicted only a handful of
Iraqis and some former BNL employees including Mr Chris Drogoul, the former
Atlanta branch manager, is that the entire Dollars 5bn Iraqi loans fraud was
perpetrated between a group of low-level BNL employees in Atlanta and their
Iraqi paymasters.
For his part, Mr Drogoul - indicted on numerous charges of fraud and money
laundering - went public in April, claiming both the US and Italian
governments knew of the BNL loans to Baghdad. The charge has been denied by
the Bush administration. By June, however, Mr Drogoul struck a plea bargain
with the Justice Department. Many charges were dropped in exchange for his
co-operation with prosecutors.
An illustration of the high-level attention the BNL scandal received can be
found in a declassified cable describing a meeting in October 1989 between
Mr James Baker, the Secretary of State, and Mr Tariq Aziz, then Iraq's
foreign minister. It reports Mr Aziz as saying that Baghdad was unhappy
because Washington was dragging its feet on a request for Dollars 1bn more
loan guarantees.
At this time, there was already debate in the White House over the loan
guarantees in light of Iraq's suspected abuse of the CCC programme. Mr Baker
and his colleagues at State none the less lobbied hard and won approval for
the CCC guarantees.
More clues to what the Bush administration knew can be found in a November 6
1989 CIA secret report noting that many US and west European companies
supplying goods to Iraq were being paid through BNL. It sourced the
information to US diplomats.
This report, which was sent to the National Security Council and the State
Department, was dated just 48 hours before the White House meeting convened
to debate whether to approve Dollars 1bn of fresh US loan guarantees for
Iraq. The CIA confirmed how BNL loans had been used to fund Iraqi companies
in the US and Britain that were supplying Baghdad's nuclear weapons and
missile projects. The CIA also said Iraq would be unable to replace BNL
financing 'any time soon'.
Investigators in Congress point to five other items to bolster their claims
that the administration mishandled the BNL case. These are:
A November 7 1989 telephone call from a lawyer on the White House staff to
the BNL prosecutor in Atlanta expressing concern about the 'embarrassment
level' of the BNL affair. Government officials have confirmed the call was
made, but have denied it was improper.
An April 5 1990 Federal Reserve memorandum on BNL which states that the case
was being complicated 'by what is perceived as interference from the Justice
Department in Washington'.
Mr Joe Whitley, the US Attorney in Atlanta appointed by President Bush in
1990, had to withdraw from handling the BNL case because he had worked just
months before as a lawyer for Matrix-Churchill, the Iraqi-owned company. In
early 1991, as the Gulf War was starting, the State Department asked the
Justice Department not to bring any indictment of the central bank of Iraq
in the BNL case, although there was documentary evidence of direct
collusion. The reason given was that the central bank had diplomatic
immunity.
In April 1991 a top White House lawyer convened colleagues from the CIA,
State, Justice, Commerce and other agencies for a series of meetings to seek
ways to avoid providing BNL-related documents to Congress. During these
meetings government lawyers discussed the danger that a cabinet member might
be prosecuted for refusing to give Congress key documents.
The above events remain in the sphere of circumstantial evidence and as yet,
while media interest is growing, the congressional investigations have not
caught fire as a significant campaign issue. For his part Mr Bush has
angrily denied the allegations from Congress, although the White House has
refused to allow key officials to testify.
Informed opinion in Washington, however, is that the attorney-general will
eventually appoint a special prosecutor, if only because the Bush
administration cannot credibly investigate itself. Whether or not a special
prosecutor is named, more revelations and documents are certain to come from
Mr Gonzalez, and possibly from Mr Drogoul. Whatever is disclosed, it will
not be a plus for the president's already troubled re-election campaign.

THE YUGOSLAV CONFLICT By John Zametica
Adelphi Paper 270. IISS/Brassey's, Pounds 9.50
The western response to the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina has so far been marked
by its overriding sense of caution. Because of their lack of decisive
action, the US and European governments may ultimately bear a big share of
the responsibility for the republic's destruction.
Military attaches in London and Washington repeatedly have argued against
involvement in the Yugoslav conflict. The goals of military intervention are
not clear, they say. They fear getting bogged down in a conflict which could
drag on for years. Now that the cold war is over, the international
community has few interests in the Balkans, they claim.
But western interests in the region are becoming increasingly apparent as
the war drags on. As the conflict moves from republic to republic, the
threat to stability of the entire Balkan peninsula looms larger. The vicious
circle of violence in the region is ever-widening, a fact the west cannot
ignore.
In his pamphlet, John Zametica examines the origins of this circle. He is
reluctant to place blame on the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic,
the late President Tito or the 1974 constitution, which effectively reduced
Serbia's powers in the former Yugoslav federation. Instead, he argues that
during the late 1980s 'the processes which had politicised Yugoslavia almost
beyond reason were almost all connected with historical experience and
awareness'.
If Mr Zametica blames the current conflict on historical awareness, then
perhaps it can be argued that the very establishment of Yugoslavia  - the
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes - was fundamentally flawed.
The cultural antagonisms between the three ethnic groups were too great to
be resolved, as were the mutual suspicions about who should control the
political agenda.
Indeed, the distrust between (Catholic) Croats and (Orthodox) Serbs was
evident in the 1921 Vidovan Constitution which stated that the king must be
an Orthodox Christian. Moreover, the debate during the 1920s, during the
Tito era and in the 1980s hardly shifted. It continued to focus on the
extent to which power should be centralised or decentralised in the
multi-ethnic federation.
But there can be little doubt that the rise of Mr Milosevic in 1987
radicalised the debate, because he used the nationalist card to consolidate
his power. By forcibly reintegrating into Serbia the southern province of
Kosovo and by toppling the leaderships of Montenegro and Vojvodina, he
reawakened latent nationalism in Slovenia and Croatia. Both those republics
had seen how Mr Milosevic was keen to shape post-Tito Yugoslavia with a more
confident Serbia at the helm.
Although Mr Zametica gives little attention to this point, Slovenia and
Croatia opted for independence for this reason, but only after they tried to
negotiate a loose confederation of republics within Yugoslavia.
It is evident why Mr Milosevic was not interested in a looser confederation.
It would have reduced the power of Serbia. The realisation that Croatia
would eventually secede encouraged Mr Milosevic to question what status the
Serb minority would have in an independent Croatia.
Mr Zametica is right to argue that the Croatian president, Mr Franjo
Tudjman, played into Mr Milosevic's hand by effectively making second-class
citizens of the ethnic Serbs in his republic. Indeed, Croatia's treatment of
the minorities set the stage for Belgrade's fears about the status of Serbs
in an independent Bosnia.
But it is difficult to sympathise with Mr Zametica's assessment that the
Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, was intent on creating a Moslem
state at the expense of quashing the rights of the minorities. On the
contrary. Mr Milosevic and Mr Tudjman were intent on carving out of Bosnia a
greater Croatia and Serbia at the expense of any status, or homeland, for
the Moslems. It is hardly surprising that the subsequent expulsion of the
Bosnian Moslems by Serb forces served to radicalise a once moderate
community.
Moreover, it is difficult to agree with Mr Zametica that the Moslems 'in
many cases went out of their way to antagonise' the Yugoslav federal army
(JNA). Anyone who was in Sarajevo last spring was impressed with the way in
which Mr Izetbegovic established good relations with Gen Milutin Kukajnic,
head of the JNA's garrison there.
However, Mr Milosevic sacked Mr Kukajnic and promoted Gen Ratko Mladic, who
had a reputation as a hardliner, in a move that led the way to an
intensification of the siege of Sarajevo.
The destruction of Bosnia will likely continue. The debate about whether the
EC contributed to the crisis through the recognition of Slovenia and Croatia
will also continue. But the growing consensus among the inhabitants of
Sarajevo is that the US and EC have betrayed them in their reluctance to
become involved militarily. That reluctance may come back to haunt western
leaders.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Fraud on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLUE ARROW fraud trial was rightly labelled a costly disaster by the
Appeal Court. The blame for its inordinate length and ultimate
unmanageability was apportioned between the trial judge, Mr Justice
McKinnon, and the prosecution.
The Court said if such trials were to be avoided in future, trial judges
would have to take a firmer grasp on proceedings and the prosecution would
have to show restraint in framing indictments. Fear of losing on a few
counts was not a reason for throwing the book at defendants. The Serious
Fraud Office should present only essential evidence. Trial judges should not
be afraid to use their power to split trials in order to reduce cases to
manageable proportions. In addition, Mr Justice Brooke formally acquitting
the remaining four defendants in the Blue Arrow case spoke of the need for
judges to make greater use of new technology in the court and to undertake
training in trial management.
Is this enough to ensure fraud trials stay within manageable limits in
future? The judges have clearly indicated that they intend to do all they
can within the constraints of the present system to rectify the problems of
long fraud trials. Other changes such as time limits on fraud trials,
greater powers for trial judges in preliminary hearings, and the
introduction of a simple fraud offence would require legislation.
Much therefore depends on the attitude of the SFO. It maintains it is bound
by the code of prosecutors not to overload the indictment or charge people
on the fringes of a case. It rejects the suggestion that it includes too
many charges in big fraud cases but says it can not be placed in a
straitjacket.
The trial of Mr Asil Nadir will provide the first test of its resolve. The
former Polly Peck chairman still faces more than 60 charges, but the SFO
says that he will only face 16 specimen charges of theft by the time his
case comes to trial next March.
If the SFO is able in the coming months to produce manageable charge sheets
in this and other cases, it may be unnecessary for the government to
legislate. If not, then the government will need to use this autumn's
planned consultation process on the practice and procedure of fraud trials
as a launching pad for legislation.

THIS WEEK'S agreement between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to put
the disputed Black Sea fleet under joint control for three years and prepare
the ground for wide ranging trade and economic agreements is a victory for
common sense.
Sceptics warn that the agreement reached at Mukhalatka in the Crimea could
be an exercise in papering over the cracks. They point to the rapid
unravelling of the previous accord between the two men at Dagomys two months
ago. But this time both President Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid
Kravchuk have at least gone out of their way to demonstrate their
recognition of the need for a new co-operative alliance between the largest
of the former Soviet republics.
Russia without Ukraine is still by far the largest and most populous country
in Europe. But without Ukraine's people and resources any attempt to restore
the old superpower is unthinkable.
The loss of Ukraine was therefore a bitter blow for nostalgics of empire,
both Soviet and Russian. But independence was achieved without bloodshed and
many of the genuine reformers in the Russian government, including Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the foreign minister, see the end of empire as a liberation for
Russians who have borne its burdens for centuries.
Mr Yeltsin shares this view and has been prepared to make the cultural and
political adjustment required to deal with Ukraine as an independent
sovereign state of 52m people. He negotiated with Mr Kravchuk as a national
leader of equal status and both sides showed their readiness to compromise.
This is good news for Russia and Ukraine, and for the rest of Europe, which
fears instability in the east and receives Russian oil and gas mainly
through pipelines running beneath Ukrainian soil.
The long-term problem of what to do with the 380-ship navy and its 70,000
officers and ratings remains. Many of the ships are obsolescent, the
strategic need for the fleet has evaporated and maintenance is expensive.
When it is divided in three years both halves should be much reduced. In the
meantime, it is important to work out a new command structure and to replace
both Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the present commander, and the more stridently
nationalistic Ukrainian officers, who helped to make the fleet the subject
of rival nationalisms.
Defusing the explosive potential of the fleet question in this way should
free the leaders of both republics to concentrate on the really important
aspects of their future relationship: trade and finance.
It is desirable for both countries to explore other markets and for Ukraine
to introduce its own currency. But nature has linked the two states
umbilically and it makes sense for both to re-establish their economic links
in mutually profitable, not mutually harmful ways. Essentially this means
agreeing prices which reflect the relative cheapness of Russian energy and
Ukrainian grain and a payments system which allows this trade to flourish.

The event of the evening is a repeat: Soldiering On, a monologue by
Stephanie Cole, one of Alan Bennett's acclaimed Talking Heads. She is a
widow confronting the lonely years ahead, which material comfort will do
little to alleviate. As ever in Bennett, the mask slips to uncover the
suppressed undercurrents of despair (BBC 2 at 9.35pm).
The US held tremendous interest, and often fat lecturing fees, for the
literary greats of Victorian England and Early Travellers in North America
(BBC 2 at 10.10) is proving a pleasant anecdotal series. In tonight's
programme, looking at reactions to the native Indians, Dickens meets an
Indian chief who is fond of reading Sir Walter Scott.
This week's mini series is Conspiracy of Silence, which ITV wraps around the
10.00 news tonight and tomorrow. It tells the true story of the murder of a
Cree Indian girl in Manitoba in 1971 and the difficulty of bringing to
justice her four attackers who were protected by their local community.
Men Talk (Channel 4, 10.20) covers that almost unmentionable subject of
male-bonding in a programme entitled 'All Boys Together.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / Arts: Much Ado About Nothing - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Oxford Stage Company's Much Ado About Nothing has arrived at Oxford on
the home stretch of its national and international tour. The production is
bold, colourful and ambitious. At the moment, it jeopardises itself by
trying for too much diversity.
The first ten minutes of the evening, before a syllable of Shakespeare,
offer a battle-scene with Yoruba war chant. Why is it here? why does the
director (Alexandru Darie) change the ending to make the action a respite
between wars?
Much Ado sits awkwardly between the safety of As You Like It and the
seriousness of Hamlet. The Oxford Stage Company looks into the void and
fills it with variety: Benedict is a clean-cut WASP, Beatrice an Irish
ranter, Don Pedro a shaven-headed bully, Don John an Eastern prince,
Margaret a shrieking washerwoman and Borachio a mewling sot.
Shakespeare did bring a range of characters from Padua, Aragon and Florence
to the scene in Messina, so Darie's direction recognises the excuse for
ethnic mix in the characters themselves. In social terms, if you believe
John Stuart Mill, diversity is liberty in theatrical terms, it is a heavy
three hours wrenched from a light play.
The Company courts weakness from strength. The very fine styles available
within the cast impinge on Shakespeare: after the war chant, the pre-nuptial
party is a ceilidh, the song 'Sigh No More' is a Cha Cha, Hero's wedding is
Malay ceremony followed by voodoo necromancy to revive her.
The impact is not diversity but dissipation; other 'politically correct'
productions (Othello at the Liverpool Everyman 1991, and the current RSC The
Odyssey and The Taming of the Shrew at Stratford) make political points
without giving up dramatic integrity; so the fine line between delighting
and instructing an audience can be drawn.
However, this show has two great strengths. First, as a touring idea, with
an eye on the closing dates in Malaysia and Japan, the design works well:
sparse attention to a rough wood frame and fabric hangings, and lavish
attention to the costumes. Set and costumes draw on Far Eastern and Balkan
design, as does Karl James' fine score carried by Jan Alphonse's powerful
singing.
Second, this Much Ado gets along without leaning on Beatrice and Benedict
(both well played by Marie Frances and James Simmons). Shaw thought it a
shocking bad play saved only by Dogberry at the end, when the unfunny
Beatrice and Benedict were exhausted. Unhappily, Dogberry's scenes are
truncated and the character who remains is too stupid to be serious and too
brash to be funny.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Technology (Software At Work): The IT team strikes gold -
Computers are running the show at the Barcelona Olympic Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is one British team in Barcelona with no hope of a medal, though it
may well deserve one. It shares one of the most nail-biting, but tedious
jobs at the Olympics, sitting in a windowless cavern watching ranks of
computer screens on which - it hopes - nothing happens.
If a screen flickers, a problem has to be fixed immediately. Without the
computer systems the 800 commentators and thousands of press and media
people serving millions of viewers worldwide will have no results, no
information.
The entire Olympic 'family' relies on a army of computer experts, supported
from a secret bunker. The Committee for Organising the Olympics at Barcelona
(COOB) has undertaken a vast one-off software project to support the Games,
on a scale that would frighten most commercial organisations.
Its systems run everything to do with transport, accommodation,
administration and security, as well as delivering the results and all media
information. The project is extraordinary for several reasons - its scale,
its scope, and the fact that there is no continuity. This is the first
Olympics for everyone on the project. And there is no chance to improve the
system - it must work the first time.
The media plays an important role in the Games. Although various sponsors
make a significant contribution, such as Coca Cola, and in the case of the
computer equipment, IBM, COOB's balance sheet relies heavily on the income
from media sources. The largest single presence is the US National
Broadcasting Corporation, for whose peak-viewing time many of the events are
scheduled.
A visit to the weightlifting arena demonstrates the amount of IT required to
cover each event. The small stage on which the muscle men sweat and groan is
the central focus for the television cameras. Beyond, ranks of computer
screens slope back from the stage. These prime sites are for journalists.
In front of them are the judges, also at computers linked to the results
system and display boards. Above them sit the sound controllers (even the
national anthems are computerised), and behind them the spectators. Behind
the scenes there is a press room, just for the weightlifting event, served
by another clutch of computers.
The size and complexity of the information network is staggering. Local area
networks (Lans) are installed in converted swimming pools, conference
centres and other sundry buildings pressed into service for the Games. The
network supports 4,400 PS/2 computers in 45 venues, each Lan linked to the
IBM mainframe in the secret bunker.
On the software side, COOB commissioned several different companies to write
various systems, all of which work together. The systems are in English,
French, Spanish and the local variant, Catalan. IBM's sponsorship dictated
that all the systems were developed in IBM-compatible software tools.
Security underpins every project to do with the Olympics. The data support
site is bomb-proof and self-sufficient in power and light. It even has its
own telephone exchange. In case of disaster, there is a second 'shadow'
installation with another mainframe. An IBM banner above the control centre
reads 'El 92 en bones mans' - Catalan for 'Safe in our hands'.
Josef Bertran is one of four information technology managers at the Centre
for Information and Operation Technology (CIOT), located at another secret
site. 'This is all going to happen just once. We simply have to be ready,
and we can't make mistakes,' he explains. 'In the past year we have been
going to hundreds of competitions trying out the system and running it
live.' There have been changes, he says, all along the line, constant
revisions and adjustments discussed with the various software partners.
In setting the specifications for the systems, COOB recognised the
difficulties of the 'clean sheet' presented by the 1992 Games. The
International Olympic Committee only audits the plans, making sure that all
is up to standard in terms of facilities and security. There was no history
of software management on which to draw.
COOB recognised that it would not find sufficient skills, equipment or staff
locally, so it turned to major software suppliers for the bid. The job of
facilities management (FM) - running the computer and all its software - was
won by a consortium headed by pan-European software house Sema. Sema
combined with Spanish software developer T&amp;G (which it has now absorbed) to
beat a French consortium.
The FM team is two-thirds British, one-third Spanish. Sema also won a
development contract for the accreditation system, known as SIGO. This
registers every member of the 140,000 strong Olympic family - competitors,
volunteers, administrators, press, government representatives, technicians
and others. The system issues them with hologrammed badges which serve as
their keys of entry to the venues.
In addition, the system manages COOB's role as a travel agent, meeting,
accommodating, transporting and organising facilities for 50,000 people
daily. The various components manage accommodation in the Olympic village
(24,000 capacity) or in hotels and boats (25,000), plus arrivals and
departures, press facilities, ticketing, medical services and scheduling of
events.
The transport system alone manages 2,500 vehicles operating 8,000 separate
pick-up and set-down points. Another system co-ordinates the 30,000
volunteers, 2,000 staff and 3,000 sub-contractors.
The information system, known as AMIC, gives biographies and details of all
the competitors - right down to the age and breeding of the horses in the
equestrian team. AMIC is available to the entire Olympic family on 2,000
terminals.
The rigorous system auditing seems to have paid off. Morale is high at CIOT
despite dozens of users crammed into a warren of rooms. Telephone
conversations and simultaneous keyboard tests take place in various
languages. Catalans predominate, but there are Yugoslavian, Serbs, Croats,
Mexican, American, French, English and Japanese staff at CIOT.
'The interest in the Games for our people is so high that it's not like an
average company,' says Jordi Lopez, director of telecommunications. 'We have
all been working 14 to 18 hours a day.'
Although the COOB contract is by no means Sema's largest, according to
managing director Pierre Bonelli, it has engaged fierce loyalty from its
participants. Senior project manager Paul Reynolds is angry that such effort
should not be preserved as a facility for the next Games.
'There are so many organisations with vested interests that it will all go
to waste. It's not owned by anybody, so there is no incentive to keep it
going. It could be a valuable asset, the ideal sports information database
for any events worldwide.'
The system will not go entirely to waste, however, since it is being used at
the Mediterranean Games next summer. Although the Atlanta organising
committee is still considering bids, it has expressed interest in parts of
the current set-up.
'They don't want to reinvent the wheel,' says Rupert Deighton, IBM's sports
service manager for Europe. But if any other hardware vendor gets the 1996
contract it is highly unlikely that this particular software will ever run
again.
BUZZWORDS
FACILITIES MANAGEMENT refers to the handing over of an installation and its
maintenance, including software and hardware, to an external supplier.
LOCAL AREA NETWORKS mean the linking together of terminals or PCs, usually
in one location, so that they can share common resources.

The Committee for Organising the Olympics (COOB) at Barcelona was formed at
the time of the bid in 1986, and is composed of local dignitaries and
officials, headed by the mayor of Barcelona.
Nature of Business: Mounting a one-off international event, the 1992 Olympic
Games, 25 July through 9 August. It takes six years to organise the Games.
Income derives from sponsorship, largely from television. It is shared
jointly between the International Olympics Committee and the orgainsing
committee. COOB commissions and afterwards owns the assets which are seen as
the lasting benefits of hosting the games, including improvements to the
city facilities and infrastructure, which in Barcelona's case includes roads
and a new airport.
Turnover: An estimated dollars 4.7bn. The income is fixed, from sponsorship
and pre-arranged media deals. Ticket sales add little to the bottom line.
This makes it essential to estimate costs correctly.
Employees: COOB's IT division employs 5,000 people. For development - four
systems professionals from the Olympic Committee, plus 250 users, supported
by 50 staff from Sema Group and T&amp;G for development. For facilities
management - 16 Sema Group staff, two-thirds from the UK one third form the
Group's Spanish operations.

Regina v director of the Serious Fraud Office, ex parte Smith (FT, June 17)
THE HOUSE of Lords allowed an appeal by the Serious Fraud Office where the
chairman of a company had been charged with the criminal offence of having
been a party to carrying on the company's business with intent to defraud
creditors.
However, under the Code of Practice for the detention and questioning of
persons by the police, a person had first to be cautioned and then told he
did not have to say anything unless he wished to do so - in which case it
could be used in evidence against him.
After he had been given bail, the defendant was served with formal notice by
the SFO under section 2(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, which gave the
SFO power to 'require' a person whose affairs were to be investigated to
answer questions or furnish information. The notice stated: 'Failure without
reasonable excuse to comply with these requirements is a criminal offence.'
The defendant invoked the privilege against self-incrimination. As a matter
of interpretation, the House of Lords held, the SFO's powers were such that
it was entitled to question a person even if he was charged with a criminal
offence.
In the present case the general provisions of the Code of Practice for
questioning suspects yielded to the particular provision of the 1987 Act.
Russell v Northern Bank Development Corporation Ltd and others (FT, June 18)
WHEN THE control of two companies was vested in a new holding company, TBL,
an agreement between the executives, including the plaintiff, Mr Russell,
and the holding company provided that it should have precedence over the
articles of association. Clause 3 of the agreement provided that no further
share capital was to be issued without the written consent of each of the
parties.
The TBL board then gave notice of an extraordinary general meeting to
consider a resolution that the share capital be increased to Pounds 4m.
Before the meeting, Mr Russell issued a writ claiming an injunction to
restrain the shareholders from voting on the resolutions.
At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that article 3 of
the agreement constituted an attempt to fetter TBL's statutory power to
increase its capital and was accordingly invalid.
Allowing Mr Russell's appeal, the House of Lords stated that, while a
provision in a company's articles which restricted its statutory power to
alter those articles was invalid, an agreement outside the articles between
the shareholders themselves as to how they should exercise their voting
rights on a resolution to alter the articles was not necessarily invalid.
TBL's undertaking was independent and severable and there was no reason why
it should not be enforceable by the shareholders between themselves as a
agreement which in no way fettered TBL in the exercise of its statutory
powers.
The Standard Steamship Owners' Protection and Indemnity Association
(Bermuda) Ltd v Gann and another
(FT, June 19)
THE CLUB was a shipowners' mutual assurance association, which issued and
provided insurance on the basis of its rules from year to year. Its claim,
from the defendants amounted to more than Dollars 1.8m for loss and/or
damages arising from non-payment of supplementary calls and relief calls.
Rule 32(1) provided that 'the owner hereby submits to the jurisdiction of
the High Court of Justice in England'. The English choice of law clause was
a significant consideration in favour of English jurisdiction, Hirst J said,
in refusing to set aside an order which granted the plaintiff leave to serve
proceedings on the defendants out of the jurisdiction.
(i) On all main issues the crucial point of contact was in London between
London brokers and the club. The witnesses relevant to those aspects were in
London and the relevant documents would mainly be in London.
(ii) The defendants' claims against third parties, which were by no means
all London-based, would only arise if the club succeeded in its claim.
(iii) It seemed likely that the number of witnesses for each jurisdiction
would be evenly balanced, and that the preponderance of documents would be
in London.
Touche Ross &amp; Co and others v Baker (FT, June 24)
Touche Ross and five other accountancy firms were insured under excess
professional indemnity policies. Substantial lines had been taken by Lloyd's
Syndicate no. 126 on the first and third excess layers.
The policies contained discovery extension clauses giving the assured an
option exercisable before expiry of the policy to prolong cover for a
further period in exchange for additional premiums.
When the assured set about replacing cover, not all insurers were willing to
participate, so the assured invoked the discovery extension clause. With one
exception, the non-renewing insurers accepted invocation of the clause, the
exception being Syndicate 126, which maintained that the clause had to be
exercised against all the insurers or none.
At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that the argument
for the syndicate would mean that the assured would have the right to
exercise the discovery extension option separately against each individual
name, which was a result entirely contrary to the way in which Lloyd's
conducted its business.
Dismissing the appeal, the House of Lords stated that there was nothing in
the words of the policy to compel the result for which the underwriters
contended, and everything in the practical considerations to the opposite
effect.
Regina v Lautro, ex parte Ross
(FT, June 25)
THE COURT of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the sole director of the
Winchester Group plc when his application for judicial review of the
decision by the Life Assurance Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation Ltd
(Lautro) was refused by the Divisional Court.
Lautro had served an intervention notice under its rules on Winchester which
in effect had prohibited the carrying-on of its investment business. On
appeal, the key issue was whether Lautro's failure to give Winchester an
opportunity to make representations before service invalidated the notice.
The Court of Appeal stated that the decision whether to exercise the power
of intervention and to serve a notice before hearing the persons to whom it
was directed or whom it would affect had to be balanced against what Lautro
regarded as the interests of its members. As a general proposition the
decision-making body did owe some duty of fairness to that second person,
which in appropriate circumstances might well include a duty to allow him to
make representations. That would particularly be the case when the adverse
effect was on the second person's livelihood or ability to earn. Although at
the relevant time, Lautro's rules, and thus its procedure, were defective in
the respects outlined, it was not required by law to afford to Winchester
the opportunity to make representations before deciding to serve its notice.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contract to develop the systems for the Olympics is ideal for any
ambitious software house. The client is keen to succeed on a worldwide
stage.
Once the event is over, however, the system never has to work again - no
lengthy support or maintenance problems to contend with. This is significant
since 70 per cent of project costs are incurred in maintenance and updates.
The software house benefits in that it is free to sell its experience and
skills, but not necessarily the original software, to another Olympic
committee - for the Atlanta Games in 1996 - without the responsibilities of
owning the system.
Internationalisation is always an issue. In this case, four languages were
supported and they all share similar letters and accents (unlike
English/Japanese).
However, it is still a complex operation to ensure that all the keyboards
are
handled correctly. French typists, for example, use an AZERTY layout
(describing the keys along the first row of letters), rather than the QWERTY
layout favoured by their English-speaking counterparts.
These risks and complexities gave rise to the enormous fees that were
charged for the software development. The
Pounds 10m for the SIGO system should have bought around 100 man-years of
development and testing. This might appear to be overkill for a one-off
project.
It all seems to have worked. Whether the cost and the event's consequent
effect on the local economy is justified have yet to be seen.

FT  06 AUG 92 / People: Coming out of cold storage to run Boustead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Singaporean businessman Jack Chia's acquisition of Boustead, the British
manufacturing, technical services and distribution group, has caused a board
reshuffle which brings non-executive director Bob Barton into the chief
executive's seat, in place of Michael Noakes who has resigned.
Barton, 52, had run Cold Storage, a Singapore-based food manufacturer,
wholesaler and distributor, before returning in 1990 to the UK, after 29
years in South East Asia, to retire.
'I got bored with retirement in about five minutes,' he says, so he started
to make a come-back as a 'corporate odd jobs man'.
He had got to know Chia and his trading group Jack Chia-MPH some 15 years
ago when Cold Storage entered into a joint merchandising agreement with the
big Singapore MPH bookstore chain. Shortly after Barton returned to the UK,
Chia invited him on to the Boustead board, first as an alternate, and then
as a full non-executive director from last September.
Noakes, meanwhile, was a former BTR troubleshooter who joined Boustead in
1987, well before Jack Chia-MPH had begun stake-building. The following year
he masterminded two important acquisitions, but profits slumped in 1991 as
the recession hit home.
Boustead chairman Sir Thomas Macpherson noted yesterday: 'Noakes felt he had
been connected with the pre-Jack Chia Boustead. And I cannot say he had
established a total rapport with Chia.
'He was under no illusion that when Chia made a bid, that was likely to be
the bell for him.'
Barton acknowledges that Boustead's businesses are currently 'bitty' but
says it is premature to suggest along what lines he will seek to develop the
group. 'I will be surprised if you do not see the company making a quite
significant acquisition in the next nine months,' adds Sir Thomas.
Clement Chia, who had been an alternate director to his father Jack, now
joins the board as a full non-executive director. Non-executive directors
John Fleming and Dick Altham have resigned.
*****
The next chairman of the British Film Institute, for an initial three-year
term, is to be Jeremy Thomas, producer of films such as The Last Emperor and
Bertolucci's The Sheltering Sky. He succeeds Sir Richard Attenborough who
steps down in December after 11 years.
Thomas has been in the film business since the late 1960s and produced his
first film in 1974. He is currently working on a new Bertolucci film, Little
Budda.

FT  06 AUG 92 / People: Baxter's family tradition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Audrey Baxter has become managing director of Baxters of Speyside, the
Scottish company famous for its soups, pates and jams, which her family
owns. At 31 she is following two family traditions.
First, keeping the management in the family. She takes over the post of
managing director from 74-year-old Gordon Baxter, who remains chairman and
was responsible for the company's expansion since the second world war. Her
brother Andrew is vice-chairman and her brother Michael is general manager
of food services. (There have been non-Baxter mds too; Alasdair MacCallum,
chairman of the CBI in Scotland, stayed for a year in 1986.)
Second, maintaining what she calls 'a strong leaning in the company towards
women'. Her great grandmother Margaret made the first jams for the company,
founded in Fochabers, Morayshire, in 1868. Audrey's grandmother Ethel
invented Baxter's royal game soup and her mother Ena is now creates the
recipes.
Audrey Baxter, who is married, worked in the business on vacations while
studying economics, accountancy and finance at university. She then worked
for Kleinwort Benson in merchant banking and equities before joining the
company in 1987. She became commercial director in 1990.
Although Baxter's turnover rose 26 per cent to Pounds 35m last year, she is
proud of the fact that the company takes 'a conservative approach to
growth,' is zero geared and has turned down 168 offers for it to be taken
over. 'The conservative approach is working well and will continue in the
short term,' she says. 'But I suspect that we will become more adventurous
if an opportunity that fits our ethics and strategy comes along.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Hacks struggle in Games cauldron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS I SIT writing in my Press Village room at 10.30am, the thin wall behind
my head is gently vibrating. It is not the heavy transport lorries on the
motorway flyover 50 yards away causing reverberations in the hot, sticky
air.
Nor is it the 23-channel, 24-hour sports-spewing TV set downstairs. It is
Daily Star sports reporter Bill Elliot next door, dead to the world and
edging ever closer to a gold medal for Olympic snoring.
After 12 hectic days the Games are nearing their end. So, too, is the
staying power of the 5,000 journalists crammed into the Village.
Like marathon runners towards the end of their long-distance course, most
journalists here have by now hit the 'wall' - the point where energy
reserves start to run out. Apart from top sports stories such as Linford
Christie's 100 metres gold medal win, unscheduled events like Britain's
drugs scandal have kept the 15,000 media personnel at these Olympics up and
running at all hours.
Even the brightest wits are fading. No one, though, is going to bow out just
yet, because global communications have changed the nature of the Olympics.
If the Games have become a multi-million dollar business; if they have
transformed competitors from amateurs into professionals; and if TV
networks, advertisers and sponsors have raised the commercial stakes
sky-high, it is largely because electronic and print journalism is creating
and satisfying an obsessive sports market in every corner of the world.
One example illustrates the point. In 1960 the US TV rights to broadcast the
Rome Olympics cost just Dollars 394,000. By 1976 US rights for the Montreal
Games had risen to Dollars 25m. This year the US network NBC has paid
Dollars 401m. NBC technicians began arriving here last year to install
Dollars 20m worth of equipment. Currently there are no fewer than 1,300 NBC
staff working in Barcelona.
Apart from the expenditure of individual companies, the Barcelona Games'
organisers have invested huge sums to cater to the hordes covering the
Olympics. But judging from the comments of those journalists who have
attended many Games, Barcelona is not quite a sports heaven.
'Why can't they choose cities where we don't have to work in pools of
sweat?' asked a puffing reporter as we climbed the hill to the Olympic
stadium on Montjuic in Barcelona's near-40`C heat.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of media organisation has been bus
transport to and from the Village. Many of the bus drivers have been drafted
in from other cities, and know as much about Barcelona's streets as a London
cab driver.
Personally, I have found the Catalans excellent hosts. Why, then, the odd
moan and groan? Perhaps it is that journalists, like anyone else working
hard, enjoy a whinge now and then.
Should you sit at a breakfast table in the Village shared, say, by a Spanish
photographer, an American TV technician and a Taiwanese journalist, the odds
are that they are talking sport.
They do so not because they have to, but because they are more obsessed by
the Games than most of us. They even dream Olympics. If Bill Elliot ever
stops snoring, I may dream a little Olympics myself.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Graduates who fail credibility test in
the real world - Why many firms favour recruits with seemingly non-relevant
qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUNJAY KAKAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY firms are turning their backs on accountancy graduates. They are
seeking instead graduates with other degrees, believing they have the skills
and attributes necessary for success in the profession.
In a letter this summer to an accountancy graduate, Mr Martin Rooney, a
partner at FW Smith Riches, a London firm, says: 'From my own experience I
have come to the conclusion that non-relevant (non accountancy) graduates
are best able to cope with the pressures of work and passing the
examinations. I have therefore restricted my firm's recruitment, for the
last couple of years, to non-relevant graduates only. Accordingly, I will
not be in a position to process your application form.'
The graduate in question says: 'I have spent three years studying an
accountancy degree thinking it would help me become an accountant, so their
decision has made me change my mind about the profession. But some firms are
completely out of their heads because they think an accountancy degree is
just about number-crunching.'
But Mr Rooney defends his decision. 'Having a degree shows an indication of
ability to think logically and plan thoughts, but accountancy graduates are
less willing to accept that they have to start at the bottom and learn,' he
says. 'In the first two years, the job can be very mundane and even an
accountancy graduate with a first would have great difficulty in settling
down.'
There are a few exceptions. Mr Wayne Barnett, a partner with Jayson Newman,
says: 'I find accountancy graduates easier to train because at least they
have shown a commitment to their choice of career and have a feeling for the
subject.'
But the firm is in a minority in its willingness to take graduates of
accountancy, in spite of the breadth of the subject, which covers topics
such as company law, psychology and organisational methods.
Accountancy firms who prefer non-relevant graduates point their fingers to
the pass rate statistics for PE1 - the first year chartered accountancy
professional exams - and argue that the best and brightest graduates are in
engineering, science and maths - but not in accountancy as might be
expected.
Just how important the statistics are to accountancy firms can be seen at
Touche Ross, where an accountancy graduate is required to have at least a
2.1 to apply for an interview, but a non-relevant graduate can apply with a
2.2. Only 20 per cent of the firm's intake is accountancy graduates.
Mr Nigel Llewellyn, the national recruitment partner, says he is 'surprised
people are surprised' that the figure is not higher. He argues that the
statistical trend is so consistent that he cannot ignore it. 'Some people
think it is unfair for us to be so strict, but we think it is unfair for us
to relax our standards,' he says.
But why use the pass rate statistics to select graduates? The answer is best
summed up by Mr Stephen Boley, the national director of graduate recruitment
at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'We want the best graduates - even if 75 per cent of
them are not accountancy graduates,' he says.
Several suggestions have been put forward to explain why accountancy
graduates are under-performing at PE1.
Ms Debbie Bryant, senior recruitment manager at Price Waterhouse, says:
'Students with a degree in accountancy can often become over-confident of
passing the PE1 exams. They tend to fall down because they don't appreciate
the volume of studying necessary. They need to understand the question and
apply what they've learnt.'
Mr Richard Parnell, a director at Robert Walters Associates, the financial
recruitment firm, believes that accountancy graduates have the theoretical
grounding but cannot apply this to the practical nitty-gritty of PE1.
'Accountancy graduates are not too hot at constructing a balance sheet in
twenty-five minutes,' he says.
Nevertheless, there is a case that some accountancy firms are getting
carried way with statistics. Mr David Clifford, the National Student
Recruitment Partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, says: 'Obviously it is important
for students to pass the exams, but it can also be very useful to look at
how students approach the exams.'
Ms Jo Magne, national personnel manager at Moores Rowland, says that past
examination performance is the fairest measure so far identified as a
measure for pre-selection. He argues that while the number of applicants
continues to greatly exceed the number of places, firms must use some means
of sorting through hundreds of application forms.
This is disheartening news for accountancy graduates, but there are
suggestions that the situation can be improved. Ms Jackie Wynn, recruitment
manager of The HAT Group of accountants, argues that degree courses in
accountancy should be made more practical.
'We have to unlearn everything accountancy graduates have been taught and
start all over again,' she says. 'They haven't even covered the basics in
enough depth, if at all, especially in double-entry book-keeping.'
Mr Boley says he would encourage more academic departments to teach
accountancy through group work. 'Accountancy is not just about auditing. It
may be about auditing initially, but in the long term students become
business advisers,' he says.
An analysis conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand suggests that accountancy
graduates are a burden on industry because they frequently have an
inadequate ability to discuss, communicate or negotiate with others. This
raises the question of whether the existing degree courses in accountancy
should be overhauled. Yet accountancy courses remain very popular, and not
all their graduates want to enter the profession. Just how popular an
accountancy degree course is can be seen at Manchester Polytechnic, where
last year there were 3,500 applications for the 100 places on an honours
Accounting and Finance course.
Ms Sue Harvey, head of careers at the Polytechnic of North London, says: 'An
accountancy degree is not just a passport to a career in accountancy. I have
seen a number of accountancy graduates go into other financial areas such as
Banking or the Tax Inspectorate, and also commercial areas such as sales and
marketing.'
But what about accountancy graduates that want to become accountants? Ms
Magne stresses that applicants should focus on firms which are sympathetic
to the qualification (the student recruitment department of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales publishes a list each autumn) and
make sure they stress 'not only numeracy, but also other skills and
attributes'.
But, as in any subject, the result is of vital importance. Ms Faith Jenner,
UK director of personnel and recruiting at Arther Andersen, says: 'My advice
is, generally, accountancy graduates with a 1st or 2.1 will probably have
the aptitude for the professional exams, but those with a 3rd should think
carefully about whether they are suited to the profession.'
Sunjay Kakar is an accountancy graduate who decided against a career with an
accountancy firm.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Examination of high-security psychiatric care announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced an examination of high-security
psychiatric care in the wake of evidence of bullying, and physical and
sexual assault at Ashworth Hospital, Merseyside.
Seven members of the hospital's staff have been suspended. They face charges
of gross misconduct and three are accused of assault. The health department
said that Dr Joseph Sylvester, Ashworth's medical director, was
relinquishing his post and Mr Brian Johnson, the general manager, was being
moved to other duties.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said she was 'deeply disturbed' by
the findings of an inquiry led by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper, chairman of the
Mental Health Act Commission. This was set up to investigate the death of Mr
Sean Walton, who died in a locked seclusion room at the hospital in 1988.
Mrs Bottomley said that the report identified urgently needed changes in the
way Ashworth looked after its patients. Some practices described in the
inquiry report could not be defended.
A task force would ensure that changes were carried out at Ashworth. Another
working party, which is studying the care of mentally disordered offenders,
would look at the wider role of top-security special hospitals, which house
offenders and other people with serious mental illnesses.
While mental health organisations generally welcomed Mrs Bottomley's
announcement, Sir Louis described the government's proposed action as a
'less than wholehearted response' to the inquiry's request for a fundamental
review of the special hospital system.
The report's recommendations include ending the use of controversial control
and restraint techniques, setting up a patients' advocacy service, training
staff in handling complaints and urgently reviewing the dress and demeanour
of staff to see whether they are appropriate to a therapeutic environment.
The report describes managers at Ashworth as having little power. As a
result, it says, the vacuum was filled by members of the Prison Officers'
Association whose main priority was security. The POA said that allegations
of brutality by Ashworth staff were not supported by firm evidence. Mr David
Evans, general secretary, said staff had undergone police and internal
inquiries that had failed to produce hard evidence.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Savings found on EC car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUBSTANTIAL savings can be achieved by private motorists importing a new car
from some continental European markets rather than purchasing in the UK
according to Which?, the Consumers Association magazine.
After research among car dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands the magazine
claims that savings of up to Pounds 2,131 could be made on the UK price of a
Ford Fiesta 1.3iLX. Price quotes made by two Audi dealers offered a saving
of Pounds 2,176 over the UK price of an Audi 80.
However, the magazine claims that some carmakers are continuing to flout
European law by preventing British motorists from taking advantage of lower
prices in certain other EC countries.
Carmakers are legally required to supply right-hand drive cars to dealers in
different EC countries for export to the UK, but Which? claims that dealers
often quote unrealistic prices or unreasonably long delivery times.
Researchers from Which? contacted 40 dealers in Belgium and Holland (10 each
from Ford, Fiat, Audi and Rover) in June.
Of the dealers, according to the magazine:
29 could not give a price for the car requested.
14 said it was impossible to buy a right-hand drive model.
One said it was not allowed to sell for export to the UK.
One wanted to charge Pounds 1,000 more than the local left-hand drive price
for a right-hand drive version.
Ford said yesterday it had issued a guide to every salesman in the EC
covering the procedure for the supply of cars to non-resident EC customers.
It was now reconfirming this advice.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Spending by rivers watchdog up 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of the drought and higher investment in pollution control and flood
defences pushed the National Rivers Authority's spending to Pounds 445m in
the year to March 31 1992, a rise of 18 per cent on the previous year,
Bronwen Maddox writes.
In its annual report and accounts, published yesterday, the rivers watchdog
repeated its support for recent proposals to combine it with the pollution
inspectorate under a new environment agency.
Earlier proposals had suggested splitting the authority's pollution and
river-management roles, a move it had fiercely resisted on the grounds that
it would weaken its ability to control river quality.
The watchdog saw its spending on water resources jump 37 per cent to Pounds
77.2m last year, largely because of the drought in south-east England.
Spending on pollution control rose to Pounds 76.4m compared with Pounds
60.5m the year before, partly because of the costs of its survey of 40,000km
of river, published at the end of last year. The survey found a net overall
deterioration in river quality both because of higher pollution and lower
rainfall.
Schemes to recover some of the costs of cleaning rivers from the polluters
generated Pounds 22m in the year to March 1992, and are estimated to bring
it Pounds 38m in the current year.
The authority receives most of its income from licences and levies on those
who use river water and from government grants. Last year government grants
made up Pounds 128.5m, or 29 per cent of its receipts of Pounds 437.8m. The
previous year grants contributed Pounds 127.7m, or 31 per cent, of its
Pounds 409m receipts.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Wallace Smith liquidator says Pounds 100m is missing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS trying to trace funds that disappeared from Wallace Smith Trust,
the financial company closed last year by the Bank of England, have
recovered only a small fraction of the money owed to its creditors.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, said
yesterday he was clear the amount of the missing assets was about Pounds
100m, but he had recovered only a few million pounds. He was speaking after
news emerged on Tuesday of writs being issued against two clearing banks in
an attempt to recover money paid to Wallace Smith Trust which was allegedly
transferred without authorisation to another company, Wallace Smith
Holdings.
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the chief executive of Wallace Smith Trust, was
charged last year by the Serious Fraud Office with offences involving more
than Dollars 50m.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is being sued to recover transfers worth up to
Pounds 418m and National Westminster Bank for Pounds 71m plus interest. Both
banks are vigorously defending the actions.
Mr Hayward said: 'We have an understanding of where the majority of the
missing funds may have gone. We have identified where they were flowing. The
next stage is to find them.' Money had been transferred through 'a number of
related parallel companies' from Wallace Smith Trust. Much appeared to have
then been used either to buy the trust's shares or to provide interest which
needed to be paid on its deposits.
'Either money was siphoned off to a pot of gold or more likely it was used
for the purpose of covering the growing cost of masking a lack of
profitability,' he said.
National Westminster was a banker to both Wallace Smith companies and Royal
Bank of Scotland took over that role in the late 1980s. The payments
referred to in the two writs relate to money earned by Wallace Smith Trust
for the sale of certificates of deposit and other financial instruments.
Wallace Smith Holdings, which received the money, is now called Dundalk
Investment, a Canadian-registered business. It appears to have been used as
one of the principal vehicles through which money was allegedly transferred.
Investigators are trying to understand the relationship between Wallace
Smith Trust and Wallace Smith Holdings. However, a director of the trust is
believed to have had signing powers with Holdings giving him authority to
transfer money from the company.
Mr Hayward did not rule out further legal action in attempts to recover
money. He has already issued a writ against Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, now
part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for its work as auditor to Wallace Smith
companies.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Minister halts Pounds 500m development plans for Kent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has rejected plans for a Pounds 500m package of commercial
and residential developments in an unemployment blackspot in north-east
Kent.
Citibank, the large US bank, and Touche Ross, the accountancy firm - the
promoters of the development - had estimated that the scheme would have
generated about 9,000 jobs on and around the Isle of Sheppey.
The region, for which Swale Borough Council is seeking assisted area status,
has an unemployment rate of more than 12 per cent. This compares with a
national average of 9.6 per cent and a south-east England average of 9.2 per
cent.
The development plan included provision for a privately financed road tunnel
linking Sheppey to the mainland, the expansion of Sheerness Dock and the
construction of 3,300 homes and more than 1m sq metres of industrial and
business space.
Plans for the tunnel were welcomed in 1989 by the Department of Transport,
which said it would be bringing forward road improvements in anticipation of
the tunnel's development.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, rejecting four separate planning
applications, said that he recognised the economic problems of the island
but these had to be balanced against other factors.
According to Mr Howard the plans would have harmed a broad range of nature
conservation interests and would have meant the loss of an internationally
important feeding area for migrating birds.
The scale of the developments also exceeded those proposed in the area
structure plan and would have led to a significant increase in traffic
congestion.
Citibank is estimated to have spent more than Pounds 1m financing the
planning applications after Lionhope, the developer which is part of the
Tudor Grange group of companies, went into administrative receivership in
1989.
Touche Ross, the receiver to Lionhope, said yesterday: 'Without the second
crossing of the Swale, to be paid for by Lionhope, the future development of
Sheppey will suffer. In view of the high unemployment in the area it is
particularly unfortunate. We must now carefully review our options.'
Officials at Swale Borough Council, which covers Sheppey, Sittingbourne and
Faversham, said yesterday that the government had failed to recognise the
serious economic problems in the region.
The four sites where developments were proposed were: Ridham on the south
bank of the Swale, where the existing port was to be expanded and 220
hectares of industrial, business and warehouse space developed.
Lappel Bank, where 100 hectares of land was to be reclaimed for the
expansion of Sheerness Dock.
Queenborough, where 300 homes were to be built alongside a marina.
Minster, where 3,000 homes were planned along with schools, medical
facilities, a golf course and some parkland.
The government's rejection of the plans coincided with last week's decision
by the European Commission to drop legal objections to five UK building
projects, including the M3 motorway extension at Twyford Down, Hampshire.
The EC had opposed the schemes on the grounds that environmental impact
studies had not been carried out.
The Nature Conservancy Council had claimed that an environmental impact
study had not been carried out for the Queenborough development proposals on
Sheppey.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Council may have to shed 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS OF North Tyneside council met union representatives yesterday to
discuss a proposed restructuring which may cost up to 1,000 jobs, or 10 per
cent of the workforce.
The Labour-controlled authority, which has exhausted its reserves, faces a
deficit of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m next year. The reorganisation
is intended to sweep away the departmental structure in favour of service
areas and has been triggered by financial problems.
The authority, which was rate capped in 1985-86 and charge capped in
1990-91, has already made cuts of Pounds 12m this year. It blames its
difficulties on the government's standard spending assessment which, it
says, fails to take account of the level of social deprivation in the
borough. However, Conservative councillors say central government is not to
blame for the problems.
The council has relied on drawing on reserves, and reducing employment to
balance its books for several years. But with an estimated standard spending
assessment of Pounds 134.5m for 1993-94 against projected expenditure of
Pounds 154m, it is having to overhaul its entire structure. The plan will be
finalised in the autumn and implemented once the level of assessment is
known in November.
The authority said yesterday that it was too early to say how many jobs
would go, and what cuts in services would be made. It said, however, that a
10 per cent reduction would be the 'worst case'. An enhanced voluntary
severance scheme, used by the authority in 1990-91 when 600 jobs were cut,
was ruled unlawful by the High Court last year.
Unions, which represent the majority of employees, are sympathetic but have
not ruled out industrial action against compulsory redundancies. Mr Trevor
Johnston, secretary of Nalgo, the local government union, said: 'The council
have a duty to provide employment as well as to service the area.'

FT  06 AUG 92 / Brewers raise wholesale prices of beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEER prices in most pubs are expected to rise by between 4p and 6p a pint
after increases in wholesale prices by the national brewers. Prices of some
premium beers in pubs in the south-east may be up to 10p a pint higher.
The brewers, which were criticised last year after beer prices, net of duty,
rose 11 per cent, have limited the rise in wholesale prices to about the
level of inflation in the past three months.
Allied-Lyons has raised wholesale prices by 3 per cent, less than the
inflation rate of 3.9 per cent in the year to June. Prices in its managed
pubs will be 4p to 5p higher in the north of England and 6p to 10p in the
south - an average increase of 4.5 per cent.
Bass, the country's leading brewer, has lifted wholesale prices in its
northern trading area by Pounds 7.50 a barrel for standard ales and lagers
and Pounds 10 a barrel for premium brand products - an average increase of
4.4 per cent.
Bass Taverns, the group's managed estate, says retail prices have gone up by
4p to 6p. 'This includes the 2p a pint higher duty imposed in the March
Budget, and is the first increase for between 12 and 15 months,' the company
said. 'We are doing everything we can to control costs and price our beer as
competitively as possible.' Whitbread's wholesale prices went up 3.8 per
cent in May, the equivalent of about 2p a pint.
Courage increased prices of some leading brands - Fosters, Courage Best and
John Smith's - by 4 per cent but has held the prices of Holsten Pils and
some other brands at last year's levels. Retail prices in Grand
Metropolitan's managed estate, which Courage supplies, have risen by between
4p and 6p a pint.
The brewers say the increases are necessary to meet higher production and
distribution costs and to improve retailing margins hit by the recession.
Wholesale beer prices have been falling in real terms in recent years as a
result of more competitive discounts being offered by brewers to the growing
number of independent pub operators.
According to the brewers retail prices have been increasing because of
investment in pub refurbishment and increased rents and costs such as the
uniform business rate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday reported that its longer leading index of economic
activity fell by 0.9 percentage points last month, adding to the evidence
that recovery has been deferred.
The Central Statistical Office said the index, which is supposed to identify
turning points in the business cycle about 10 months in advance, declined to
103.3 in July from 104.2 in June, after having fluctuated downwards from a
recent peak of 106 in October last year.
Further evidence of delayed recovery came from the Finance and Leasing
Association, which represents organisations responsible for 80 per cent of
consumer lending not carried out by clearing banks or building societies.
It said 66 per cent of its members expect consumer confidence to improve
over the next three months. Gains in confidence predicted after the general
election had failed to materialise, however.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: French restrict food imports:
Radioactivity suspected in Japanese products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sushi, sashimi and noodle bars of Paris could become the next casualties
of the Japanese trade war as the French government has slapped new
restrictions on imports of Japanese food into France.
The authorities are concerned about the allegedly high levels of
radioactivity in certain imported Japanese foods, particularly mushrooms and
dairy products. Late last month, France said it was tightening controls over
Japanese food imports, worth FFr196m (Pounds 20m) last year.
Since August 1, all Japanese food consignments have been subject to
radioactivity checks on arrival in France. From August 15 the French will
only allow food into the country if it has been tested - and certificated -
in Japan.
This poses a potentially serious problem for anyone buying Japanese food in
France. This includes the 30,000-strong Japanese expatriate population and
the growing band of Japanese restaurants. Japanese food is now very popular
with the French. The area around rue Saint-Anne at the back of the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris has become a tiny 'Tokyotown' with dozens of
noodle bars. It is a common sight on the Paris streets to see motorbikes,
and even rickshaws, delivering sushi ordered by telephone or the Minitel
computer network.
So far the radioactivity checks have caused only a slight delay in Japanese
food supplies. Higuma, one of the rue Sainte-Anne noodle bars, said its
supplies were coming through as usual.
But after August 15, there is a risk that some products will no longer be
available, either because they fail to comply with the new regulations, or
because Japanese exporters divert consignments to other, more accessible
countries. The Japanese embassy in Paris warned that prices might have to
rise to cover the cost of the tests.
Mr Higa Shiuchi, manager of Kinugawa, one of Paris' most exclusive Japanese
restaurants, is concerned about the threat of shortages. Like many Japanese
restaurants, imports all its food from Japan, apart from fresh fruit and
fish.

FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: EC makes new offer in oilseeds dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday offered the US a fresh compensation
package to settle a long-standing conflict over EC subsidies to oilseed
crops like soyabeans, rapeseed and sunflower seeds.
A senior US official said the meeting had ended inconclusively. 'There has
been some evolution in the EC position, but their revised offer is still
well below the level that would be necessary to address the impairment to US
farmers,' he said. Both sides say they are willing to meet again, but no
dates have been set.
Details were being kept secret. However, the package is understood to
contain some compensation on corn imports, which would be of direct benefit
to US oilseed farmers, who claim they have lost billions of dollars of
exports to the EC because of its subsidy regime.
Yesterday's negotiations in Geneva come less than a week after Mr Ray
MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, met Mr Edward Madigan, US
agriculture secretary, in an effort to defuse a potentially explosive farm
trade conflict.
Fears have mounted of a wider trade war, particularly following the failure
of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Munich a month ago to make a
breakthrough in the deadlocked Uruguay Round of talks on world trade
liberalisation.
The US set an August 18 deadline for settling the oilseeds dispute, and is
threatening to impose punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of EC
agricultural exports if its oilseeds subsidy regime is not reformed. The
list includes wine, cheese, biscuits, gin, liqueurs and tobacco. A US
official said yesterday he doubted whether the dispute would be resolved
ahead of the deadline.
The oilseeds dispute arose almost five years ago, when Washington complained
that EC subsidies contrary to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (Gatt) cut into benefits the EC had granted in 1962 when it agreed
to allow oilseeds in duty-free. An independent Gatt dispute panel has twice
declared the subsidies unjustified.
For its part, the EC has insisted that US exporters have lost ground to
third world exporters rather than because of the subsidy regime. Even now,
it refuses to dismantle the regime, instead offering to compensate the US
and other oilseed exporters - an option open to it under Gatt rules of
dispute settlement.
The EC's previous offer was rejected last month.

PAKISTAN'S tiny car market will be supplied with local production from as
many as four of Japan's nine motor groups, following Honda's decision to
begin manufacturing there.
Honda has had a motorcycle joint venture in the country since 1964. It is to
open the car plant in conjunction with the Atlas Group, its existing local
partner. They will together put in PRs400m (Pounds 9.3m), and the Japanese
company will have 51 per cent control.
Production of the Civic model at the facility near Lahore is intended to
reach 6,000 units a year.
Honda said its decision had been motivated by deregulation moves undertaken
by the government of Mr Nawaz Sharif, and expects the Pakistani car market
to grow steadily from current annual sales of 32,000.
Suzuki has a long-established car manufacturing presence in the country
while Toyota has a quarter share in a venture which will begin production of
20,000 Corollas a year from next spring. The local Bibojee group said in
Islamabad yesterday it was near to completing talks on the supply of Sunny
cars in knockdown kit form from Nissan, whose trucks it assembles.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Reagan no longer a judicial target in Iran-Contra case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER President Ronald Reagan is no longer a target in the criminal
investigation being conducted into the Iran-Contra affair.
His lawyer said yesterday he had received a letter from Mr Lawrence Walsh,
the Iran-Contra special prosecutor, stating that he was now regarded only as
a witness, and not a subject, in the investigation.
Mr Walsh has said other indictments against senior figures in the Reagan
administration might be brought by the end of the summer. So far only Mr
Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary, has been charged.
He is accused of concealing from Congress his knowledge of the White House
scheme to sell arms to Iran and use the proceeds to finance the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua, in defiance of the congressional ban on such
assistance.
Last week, Mr Donald Regan, former treasury secretary and White House chief
of staff, said he had been advised by the prosecutor that he was no longer
under scrutiny. Less clear is the status of Mr George Shultz, former
secretary of state, and Mr Edwin Meese, attorney general when the
Iran-Contra scheme was in operation.
The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Frank Carlucci, national
security adviser to Mr Reagan at the time, had been questioned recently by
the prosecutors.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Women succeed as incumbents slide: Congressional primaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN did well and incumbents poorly in the latest round of state primary
elections for Congress on Tuesday, confirming trends apparent all year.
Victories by two Democrats, Gloria O'Dell and Geri Rothman-Serot in Kansas
and Missouri respectively, bring to nine the number of women, eight of them
Democrats, who will be contesting Senate races in November. This is already
close to a record, with many states still to hold primaries.
At present the Senate has only two women members, Barbara Mikulski, the
Democrat from Maryland, who is heavily favoured to win re-election, and
Nancy Kassebaum, the Republican from Kansas whose seat is not up this year.
Two House members - the Republicans Mr Guy vander Jagt in Michigan, a
13-term veteran, and Mr Dick Nichols in Kansas - lost on Tuesday, bringing
to 15 the number of sitting representatives beaten in primaries. The number
of seats that incumbents will not be defending rises to well over 60 when
retirements are included. Total changeover in the House could well exceed
100.
Ms O'Dell and Ms Rothman-Serot will do well even to threaten the Republican
incumbents in November. Both Senators Robert Dole in Kansas and Christopher
Bond in Missouri easily won their primaries and start heavy favourites.
But other women Senate candidates are faring much better. The latest polls
in Illinois give Carol Mosely Braun a 30-plus point lead over a lacklustre
Republican nominee, while in California Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein,
both Democrats, are ahead by 15-20 points. Lynn Yeakel is also given a real
chance in Pennsylvania.
Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has had no hesitation
in hitching himself to the women's bandwagon, which is motoring along on two
major causes; freedom of reproductive choice and opposition to the sort of
sexual harassment evident in the hearings last year for Judge Clarence
Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Mr Clinton left Arkansas yesterday with Senator Al Gore, his running mate,
on another bus tour. In three of the six midwestern states on the itinerary,
Illinois, Missouri and Iowa, his party is fielding women candidates for the
Senate.
His broader hope is to repeat the success of the maiden road cruise after
the New York convention last month, thus keeping President George Bush on
the defensive. But his message of change now thoroughly embraces gender. In
some states, popular women candidates like Ms Braun may help his
presidential ambition, in others his current big lead over Mr Bush
constitute a coat-tail that women may find helpful.
Mr Bush also took to the road yesterday, but to more conventional campaign
events in New York and Nevada in front of Catholic and military veterans'
associations. In New York Mr Bush repeated his opposition to abortion.
His appeal to women voters is mostly based on his call for the restoration
of traditional family values, exemplified by his wife, Barbara, who will
address the Republican's Houston convention in two weeks on precisely this
subject.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest rates provided 'little impetus' for residential and
commercial property in July, despite sparking another round of mortgage
refinancing, the Federal Reserve said yesterday.
In its latest 'Beige Book' assessment of regional trends, the Fed said
economic activity had been uneven in recent weeks. Retail sales and
manufacturing production had grown weakly in most districts but there was no
evidence for the robust recovery predicted by the Bush administration
earlier this year.
Testifying before the Senate banking committee in Washington yesterday, Mr
Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, again criticised the Fed for failing
to provide a big enough stimulus to revive the economy.
He said he was not satisfied with the growth of M2, a broad measure of
money, which has fallen below the bottom of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target
range.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, Mr Brady applied
oblique pressure for further interest rate cuts by expressing support for
congressional demands that the Fed be made more accountable to the executive
and legislative branches of government.
In yesterday's testimony Mr Brady stressed the importance of having an
independent central bank, but he indicated that the right of regional Fed
presidents to vote on monetary policy decisions might need to be reviewed.
The Beige Book survey, which covered the six weeks to July 28, said consumer
and business loan demand had strengthened in a few regions but remained
generally weak.
Lower interest rates had had little impact on either residential or
commercial real estate markets, which remained sluggish.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S trade surplus fell 87 per cent to Dollars 210m (Pounds 109.9m) in
July from Dollars 1.61bn in the year-earlier month, AP-DJ reports from
Taipei.
The Ministry of Finance said the month's total exports amounted to Dollars
6.89bn, down 2.7 per cent from the same month a year earlier, while overall
imports stood at Dollars 6.68bn, up 22.1 per cent.
The country registered surpluses in trade with Hong Kong and the US, while
showing deficits with Japan and Europe. The largest contributor to July's
surplus was the trade balance with Hong Kong, which rose to Dollars 1.15bn,
up 8.9 per cent from the same month a year ago.
The remaining surplus was generated by trade with the US, netting Dollars
810m, down 9.8 per cent from a year earlier. Washington is pressing Taipei
to cut the surplus.
However, Taiwan suffered a trade deficit of Dollars 1.34bn with Japan in
July, 40 per cent wider than the gap a year earlier. The republic also
suffered a trade deficit with Europe of Dollars 160m, in contrast to a
surplus of Dollars 320m a year earlier.
Officials said the strength of the Taiwan dollar, which hit a record high of
24.5070 to the US dollar on July 9, helped to depress exports.
Imports were fuelled by purchases of machinery and materials for massive
infrastructure projects. The government envisaged spending Dollars 300bn on
the projects between 1991 and 1997.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus for the first half of the year rose 94 per
cent from a year earlier to Dollars 56.2bn (Pounds 29.4bn), a record for any
six-month period.
The Ministry of Finance said the surplus for June was 43.5 per cent higher
at Dollars 9.4bn, due mostly to a rapidly growing trade surplus, which was
Dollars 11.4bn for the month against Dollars 9.3bn in the same month last
year.
While the ministry said the surge in the current account surplus was a
temporary result of yen appreciation, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry voiced concern that some troubled Japanese companies appeared
to have increased exports sharply.
During the first half there was a jump in exports of chemical products,
construction materials, cars and electronic devices, as companies attempted
to reduce domestic inventories that have built up as the economy has slowed.
Meanwhile, demand for imports has declined.
Part of the large year-on-year increase in the current account surplus was
due to the transfer early last year of a Dollars 9bn contribution to the
Gulf war effort, but the Japanese government is slowly accepting that the
turnround in the domestic economy is the main cause of the consistently
large surpluses this year.
The Finance Ministry said the seasonally adjusted surplus for June was
Dollars 8.4bn, down from Dollars 10.9bn in May. However, preliminary trade
statistics for July suggest the trade and current account surpluses will top
Dollars 10bn again for the month.
Japan's current account surplus had fallen from Dollars 87bn in 1987 to
Dollars 35.8bn in 1990, leading the government to believe that trade
friction would also be reduced. But the surplus jumped to Dollars 72.9bn
last year and is on course to exceed Dollars 100bn this year.
Balance of payments details showed net Japanese purchases of foreign
securities at Dollars 4.8bn in June, against Dollars 3.3bn in May, while
foreigners' net sales of Japanese securities were Dollars 2.3bn, compared
with net purchases of Dollars 75m in May.
For the six months, the long-term capital account showed a net inflow of
Dollars 650m, down 82 per cent from the same period last year, mainly due to
a slowing of foreign purchases of Japanese stocks. In May, foreigners' net
purchases of stocks were Dollars 837m, although net sales in June were
Dollars 1.95bn, as the Tokyo market continued to fall.
The basic balance of payments in the first six months had a surplus of
Dollars 56.8bn, against Dollars 32.5bn in the same period last year, while
the overall balance showed a surplus of Dollars 58.8bn, up sharply from
Dollars 7.5bn last year.
Japan's trade mix has not remained the same and instead of exporting whole
products, new factories abroad are consuming Japanese components. East Asia
has replaced North America as Japan's most important market.
Last week, talks between the US and Japan focused on the trade surplus and
structural impediments to trade. After the two-day meeting, US negotiators,
under orders from Washington, were determined to portray the Structural
Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement as successful in treating the
underlying causes of Japan's consistently large trade surplus.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Philippines push for investment faces formidable hurdles: A
look at the politically unpalatable measures included in reforms aimed at
boosting economic confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Philippines' new government appears headed for some rough waters in its
attempts to lift investor confidence, vital for sustained economic recovery.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the former army general who became the new president on June
30, has said his administration will aim to attract increased investment and
trade, generating more jobs in the nation of 62m people.
However, a number of politically unpalatable measures - including new taxes
and the easing of protective regulations on domestic industry - are included
in reforms seen as essential for the absorption of increased investment.
Experts believe that unless these reforms are implemented, the economy could
only hope to grow by 3-4 per cent a year.
While the local business sector has generally backed the new government's
economic programmes, support could waver if reform begins to hurt local
industries.
The labour sector, whose plea for legislated wage increases has just been
rejected by Mr Ramos, is also expected to oppose the planned tax measures
and press for pay rises compensating for loss of purchasing power over the
past two years.
The government's difficulties are illustrated by the recent decision to
raise import tariffs on sugar, which the Philippines exports in large
volumes. The tariff increase was prompted by sugar-industry leaders' protest
against the planned opening up of the local market to sugar imports from
October, but the move contradicts Mr Ramos' repeated satements that he would
strive for more deregulation and liberalisation of the economy.
Despite the difficulties, the Ramos administration's economic managers are
confident they can pull off 'the next economic miracle' in Asia. They say
there is a positive outlook among foreign investors and creditors to back up
their optimism.
Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the
Central Bank of the Philippines, are in the thick of a campaign to reduce
the overall public-sector budget deficit to levels required under an
International Monetary Fund-supported economic stabilisation programme.
The central bank has been sopping up excess cash on the streets via
high-yielding Treasury bills. Interest rates on the issues have so far been
only slightly above normal levels, but some bankers see the rates surging in
coming weeks.
Any big jump in commercial lending rates, which could fuel inflation, will
be a drag on industrial activity, which is only starting to recover from the
dampening effect of an import levy early this year.
The IMF has been asking local finance officials to sell off more state
corporations to bring down the government budget deficit, but Manila had
fended off the pressures, opting instead to raise revenues through new tax
measures and improved collection.
Adherence to IMF conditions is crucial for continued access to commercial
and official credit. Any disruption in that, Mr del Rosario says, could
derail recovery efforts.
He hopes that by keeping a stable relationship with the international
financial community, the Philippines could 'again attract flows from the
voluntary capital markets'.
After ensuring continued links with the country's creditors, the government
also plans to present to the IMF for credit support a 'growth-oriented,
medium-term programme'. Senior officials at the policy-making National
Economic and Development Authority (Neda) are focusing on the long-term
objectives, instead of worrying over possible short-term distractions.
Mr Cielito Habito, economic planning secretary and Neda director-general,
says the Ramos administration targets a 'double-digit annual growth rate' in
GNP by the end of its term in 1998. That should put per capita GNP - now at
about Dollars 750 (Pounds 393) - at Dollars 1,000, which would elevate the
Philippines to the upper ranks of the region's newly industrialising
economies.
The aim is also to instil 'world competitiveness' into domestic industry,
according to Mr Habito. For the short-term, he says, there will be no
pump-priming scheme similar to that witnessed in the early years of the
previous administration. But there will be a deliberate move to prevent a
decline in investments in capital expenditures.
In the proposed 1993 budget approved by the Ramos cabinet yesterday, capital
investments are targeted at 5.8 per cent of GNP. The allocations will
include power plants and other infrastructure projects that could attract
more private investors.
Mr Habito says new foreign financing, which costs less than domestic credit,
will be sought for the government's growth-oriented strategies over the next
two to three years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATHENS' commuters face the uncomfortable prospect of riding army lorries to
work for the rest of the summer, after a government decision to privatise
the strike-plagued city bus service.
Legislation allowing private owners to operate the fleet of 1,400 buses was
presented to parliament yesterday. Details of the transfer will take weeks
to work out, according to government officials.
The Greek capital has been without buses for two weeks. Bus company
employees declared an indefinite strike after the government fired 1,024
clerical and technical staff under a scheme to reduce over-manning.
The bus company has debts of more than Dr160bn (Pounds 450m). Its fleet of
ageing buses is blamed for much of the pollution in the city centre.
Private operators who run profitable regional bus services and some Athenian
taxi co-operatives are showing interest in taking over the company's routes,
provided the government goes on subsidising ticket prices.
Meanwhile the army is running a skeleton transport service, using its own
buses and hundreds of lorries. There is reduced demand for public transport
at present because several hundred thousand Athenians have left the city for
summer holidays.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Bankers attack Italy's rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giovanni Goria, Italy's finance minister, yesterday sounded a cautious
note on further interest rate cuts following Monday night's decision by the
Bank of Italy to lower key rates by half a percentage point.
He said: 'I think that the governor of the Bank of Italy has opted for small
steps rather than one isolated big step and that is why the markets are
waiting in this period.'
Mr Goria's comments follow criticisms by some bankers that the Bank of Italy
was hasty in lowering the official discount rate to 13.25 per cent and its
rate for fixed-term advances to banks to 14.75 per cent.
The move was criticised by some economists as being premature because of the
continuing uncertainties surrounding the lira, which lost ground against the
D-Mark yesterday. The Italian currency was fixed at 756.20 to the D-Mark,
against 755.83 on Tuesday.
Shares on the Milan stock market closed lower yesterday in thin trading,
with the Comit equity index falling by 4.72 to 419.63. Meanwhile, money
market interest rates continued to decline, with the Bank of Italy's rate
for repurchase agreements with commercial banks declining to 14.29 per cent
compared with 15.86 per cent at the last tender offer on July 31 and a peak
of 17.56 per cent on July 22 .
Bankers have cautioned that the discount rate cut, demanded by
industrialists after last Friday's agreement to end the scala mobile wage
indexation system, was risky in view of imponderables such as the French
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union and the need for
further detailed negotiations between ministers, employers and unions on a
new wage bargaining system, which the government hopes to conclude by
mid-September.
Meanwhile, strong signs emerged yesterday that the Senate, the upper house
of parliament, would approve the government's L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn)
emergency budget package, passed last week in the lower house. However,
dealers warned that the new government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato,
which has a 16-seat majority, would face a much sterner test when it puts
forward its 1993 budget plans in September.
Uncertainties over Italy's structural economic problems were among the
reasons behind yesterday's decision by a leading Japanese credit rating
agency to lower its rating for Italy's yen-denominated debt.
JBRI, a subsidiary of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun group, reduced to AA plus
from triple A Italy's rating for debt. A similar move has already been made
by the leading US debt rating agencies. Italy is the only G7 member not to
have triple A borrowing status.

FT  06 AUG 92 / ICI demerger given provisional approval by Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND REVENUE has given provisional approval for the restructuring
plans of Imperial Chemical Industries, clearing the way for the UK's largest
ever demerger, which will split the company into two separately quoted
groups, ICI and ICI Bioscience.
The approval - known as pre-clearance - has been agreed in discussions over
the past two months and removes the most important stumbling block to the
demerger.
ICI said yesterday it hoped to launch a secondary share issue for ICI Bio,
which will be comprised of the group's drugs and agrochemicals operations,
in April or May of next year.
Pre-clearance by the Inland Revenue will ensure the demerger is practically
tax neutral, and does not generate greater liability for advance corporation
tax or capital gains for shareholders.
Mr Colin Short, ICI's finance director, said the dividends paid next year
would be decided by the two boards separately after the demerger. He
claimed, however, the move was not a subterfuge to reduce ICI's dividend.
Mr Short said: 'The Inland Revenue was far and away the most significant
potential show-stopper. I believe this is the largest and most complicated
demerger the UK has ever seen.'
He said ICI had also obtained a strong opinion from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell,
its US legal adviser, that the demerger plans should be acceptable to the
Internal Revenue Service.
Details of the demerger - known internally as 'project mortar' - will be
submitted next month to tax authorities in the other 150 countries in which
ICI operates.
'Even with a following wind, it will take until the end of the year to
prepare the demerger,' said Mr Short. The way would then be clear for the
split after the annual results are announced on February 25 and the annual
report is published on March 4. A prospectus for a secondary offer in ICI
Bio will be published shortly afterwards.
'In early March, we'll poke our nose out of the Millbank windows and take a
look at the markets. If they look fine, ICI Bio will raise equity in about
April or May.'
The company will study the recent Wellcome share sale carefully. SG Warburg
will be advising ICI, while Goldman Sachs would probably advise in the US.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Wallace Smith Trust Collapse: Liquidator says Pounds 100m
missing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIQUIDATORS trying to trace funds that disappeared from Wallace Smith Trust,
the financial company closed last year by the Bank of England, have
recovered only a small fraction of the money owed to its creditors.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, said
yesterday he was clear the amount of the missing assets was about Pounds
100m, but he had recovered only a few million pounds.
He was speaking after news emerged on Tuesday of writs being issued against
two clearing banks in an attempt to recover money paid to Wallace Smith
Trust which was allegedly transferred without authorisation to another
company, Wallace Smith Holdings.
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the chief executive of Wallace Smith Trust, was
charged last year by the Serious Fraud Office with offences involving more
than Dollars 50m.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is being sued to recover transfers worth up to
Pounds 418m and National Westminster Bank for Pounds 71m plus interest. Both
banks are vigorously defending the actions.
Mr Hayward said: 'We have an understanding of where the majority of the
missing funds may have gone. We have identified where they were flowing. The
next stage is to find them.' Money had been transferred through 'a number of
related parallel companies' from Wallace Smith Trust. Much appeared to have
then been used either to buy the trust's shares or to provide interest which
needed to be paid on its deposits.
'Either money was siphoned off to a pot of gold or more likely it was used
for the purpose of covering the growing cost of masking a lack of
profitability,' said Mr Hayward.
National Westminster was a banker to both Wallace Smith companies and Royal
Bank of Scotland took over that role. The payments referred to in the two
writs relate to money earned by Wallace Smith Trust for the sale of
certificates of deposit and other financial instruments.
Wallace Smith Holdings, which received the money, is now Dundalk Investment,
a Canadian-registered business. It appears to have been used as one of the
principal vehicles through which money was allegedly transferred.
Investigators are tracing the relationship between Wallace Smith Trust and
Wallace Smith Holdings. A trust director is believed to have had signing
powers with Holdings giving him authority to transfer money from the
company.

FT  06 AUG 92 / Japan's day labourers pay price of recession: Emiko Terazono
reports on the economy's outcasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S 'a recession, it's really hard finding good paying jobs now,' says Mr
Kazuo Hara, a 51-year-old day labourer and one of 8,000 workers in Tokyo's
day-labourer district. He says he sleeps on the streets because he cannot
afford a room.
Unlike Japan's middle-class office workers, who are guaranteed a life-time
job by the company, the outcasts of the Sanya district in east Tokyo are
feeling the impact of Japan's economic downturn.
However, the the number of tehaishi and their mini-vans have declined.
Mr Hara, who looks older than he is as a result of years of harsh labour,
says you need connections to find a daily job. 'If you make friends with one
of the recruiters, he'll take care of you.'
His clothes, a blue corduroy shirt and worn out trousers, were given him by
a nearby Catholic volunteer centre, but Mr Hara says he would rather not
work than be cheated by the recruiters, who are often connected with the
yakuza, or gangsters.
Some of the more small-time recruiters and employers have started to take
advantage of the decline in jobs to exploit the workers. 'They'll give us a
weekly job contract, but will charge unrealistic prices for meals, toilet
paper, and cigarettes, so we'd end up with only Y4,500 (Dollars 36) for a
day's job,' says Mr Hara. Some employers, usually subcontractors of small
construction companies, he says, lock workers up in a room so they cannot
run away.
At the height of the economic boom in the late eighties, day labourers could
earn as much as Y13,000 daily for clearing and digging land. This enabled
them to move into 'business hotels' with air conditioning and television
sets for around Y4,000. However, the business hotels, a luxury by Sanya
standards, are also facing a decline in patronage as an increasing number of
workers opt for cheaper flophouses costing Y800 a night, or the streets.
Those who fail to find a job with a recruiter move on to the district's
employment centre, a grey concrete building where day jobs are posted from
6.30am. However, even at the centres, the number of jobs have fallen, with
employment offers at the three employment centres in the Sanya district for
the last fiscal year falling 16 per cent from the previous year.
A day for a labourer who has not found a job begins with glasses of sake and
beer at one of the drink stands which open as early as six in the morning.
By their sides are sports bags containing their belongings. Many are
alcoholic, some are tubercular. Because of poor living conditions the local
incidence of tuberculosis is more than 20 times the national average.
Mr Hara, who is trying to give up drinking, came to Sanya, second in size
only to Osaka's Nishinari day labour district, at the beginning of the
construction boom in the mid-1960s following the Olympic Games in Tokyo. He
says proudly that he helped build the Budohkan, a martial arts auditorium in
central Tokyo, when he had just started as a day labourer.
'But now it's worse than the oil shock periods,' he says as he queues at the
welfare centre in the centre of Sanya for a food ration consisting of a loaf
of bread and two small cartons of milk. Mr Noriyasu Okamoto, a manager at
the Jouhoku Welfare Centre, says that the number of homeless workers who
have come for counselling and aid have increased during the past year. The
monthly figure rose above 3,000 cases last January for the first time in
eight years.
'What about Miyazawa's (the Japanese prime minister)supplementary budget?'
asks Mr Okamoto, adding that an economic package to boost the economy by
frontloading public works projects should increase jobs for labourers. 'No
way,' says Mr Hara, waving a hand mutilated by past accidents at steel
mills. 'Miyazawa's not going to change anything. Things are going to get
worse next year. I can feel it.'

<TEXT>
A LEADING European reinsurer is taking legal action in an effort to recover
losses of more than Pounds 200m sustained in the London reinsurance market.
Amsterdam-based Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep has started the action after
running up heavy losses at its Victory subsidiary.
The group says that its advisers failed to inform it about the extent of
Victory's exposure to lossmaking spiral reinsurance business - in which
Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposure to
high-level catastrophe loss - when it bought Victory from Legal &amp; General in
1990.
Solicitors Allison &amp; Humphreys last week served writs against Bacon &amp;
Woodrow, the actuaries, accountants Ernst &amp; Young and Swiss Bank
Corporation. NRG alleges breach of contract and negligence against all three
advisers.
Mr Willem Dikland, NRG chairman, said the group had decided to take action
after carefully reviewing the situation. He said the shortfall in reserves
on Victory's marine and aviation reinsurance accounts amounted to Dollars
480m. The claim does not, however, specify any particular amount of damages.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow said it would vigorously resist the action when NRG first
announced the possible action in June. Swiss Bank Corporation said it had
not been asked to advise on the extent of Victory's reserves.

Japan

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government and electronics industry expressed disappointment
yesterday at the US trade representative's finding that there has not been
'sufficient progress' in foreign penetration of Japan's semiconductor
market.
Japan's Electronic Industries Association (EIAJ), insisted that the review
of last year's US-Japan semiconductor pact had overlooked 'significant'
expansion of foreign suppliers' market share since the first semiconductor
pact was signed in 1986.
Japan is concerned that the review's finding will be a starting point for
punitive action against the country's electronics industry, and that the US
administration will come under pressure to take action during the
presidential election campaign.
Under a new semiconductor pact concluded last year, the Japanese government
set a target of 20 per cent foreign share by the end of this year. During
the first quarter this year, however, that share was only 14.6 per cent and
is believed to have fallen since.
Japanese government and industry representatives blame the slowing of the
domestic economy; the US chip industry insists Japan has failed to honour
the agreement.
The US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said yesterday that 'if
maintaining a closed chip market were an Olympic sport, Japan would be the
undisputed gold medal winner'. It warned that Japan had to make an 'all-out,
strenuous effort' if it wanted to 'avoid further confrontation'.
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said it would
intensify its calls on users to purchase more foreign chips. However,
Japanese companies had already tried to do so.
After a bilateral meeting in June, Japanese users said they would give
foreign chip makers access to previously confidential procurement
information. Miti, for its part, is encouraging Japanese companies to employ
foreign producers at the design stage of new products.
However, the largest Japanese chip users are also producers, and an
executive at a leading electronics company said the downturn in the
semiconductor and consumer electronics markets had led his company to reduce
outside sourcing - Japanese and foreign.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Falling raw material costs behind Kalon's
55% rise to Pounds 6.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
KALON, the paint group embroiled in a hostile Pounds 91m bid for its
Wolverhampton rival Manders, announced a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 6.16m for the six months to December 31.
Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said the profits increase had been due
to falling raw material prices and improved efficiencies throughout the
group.
He rejected accusations that it had achieved windfall profits from one-off
price rises led by companies such as ICI.
The group had proved 'beyond all doubt that its performance has been
sustainable and has been sustained  .. This is not a flash in the pan,' he
said.
Kalon also announced acceptances totalling 6.5 per cent of Manders shares in
its 8-for-3 paper offer, extended to August 10.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, dismissed the extension in the face
of 'overwhelming rejection' of the offer. He said the increase in
acceptances was 'fractional', excluding the undertaking from one
institutional investor for 5.93 per cent at the first closing date.
During the first half, Kalon increased sales by 9 per cent to Pounds 52.4m.
Mr Hennessy said the company had boosted its share of a declining trade
paint market as well as increasing its hold on the retail sector, largely
through supplying the big DIY retailers.
Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 5.93m, largely due to a
42 per cent increase in decorative paints to Pounds 6.01m.
There were three loss-makers: chemicals, industrial coatings and
Smyth-Morris in Spain. Mr Hennessy admitted the company's record outside of
paints had not been good, and there was some way to go in stemming the
losses. But steps had been taken, and losses had been cut by 12 per cent to
Pounds 242,000 in industrial coatings, for example.
During the first half, Kalon improved its cash position by Pounds 7m to
Pounds 8.1m.
Earnings per share increased from 2.33p to 3.45p. The dividend was raised
from 0.7p to 1p.

<TEXT>
STANDARD Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic), South Africa's second-largest
banking group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in earnings to 245
cents a share for the first half to June 30, from 204 cents a share a year
earlier, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg.
Net profits rose 25 per cent to R259.2m (Dollars 96m) from R209m.
Stanbic expects 'real earnings growth' in the second half because a liquid
money market - resulting from both South Africa's recession and its drought
 -should keep margins high.
The group's loans, advances and acceptances declined during the first six
months even though home loans rose by R1.27bn.
The bank reduced its bad debt provisions by 10 per cent to R173m from
R192.7m a year earlier, while its operating expenses rose 24 per cent to
R608.3m from R492.5m over the same period.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank improves 20% in
first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, HAMBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRESDNER Bank yesterday became the second of Germany's big three banks to
report robust profits for the first six months of the year.
Buoyed by strong lending demand and increased fee income, Dresdner's partial
operating profits - excluding gains from own account securities trading -
rose by 20 per cent to DM1.29bn (Dollars 869m) better than the market was
expecting.
This follows a 14.7 per cent rise in Commerzbank's partial operating
profits, announced last week, and comes ahead of today's figures from
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank.
All leading German banks reported double-digit profits growth in the first
four months of the year, and the figures from Dresdner and Commerzbank
suggest that banking remains, with construction, one of only two sectors in
Germany able to defy the recession and deliver strong profits growth.
However, Deutsche's share price has fallen over the past week on worries
that half-year profits will be flat, signalling the end of a long period of
powerful profits growth.
Commenting on the likely outcome for the full year yesterday, Mr Wolfgang
Roller, Dresdner's chief executive, said that profits were likely to show
double-digit growth over 1992 as a whole. He declined to comment on the
possibility that the dividend would be raised this year.
Earnings on interest in the Dresdner group rose by 12.6 per cent to
DM2.95bn, whilst commission income climbed 14.8 per cent to DM1.13bn.
Operating expenses rose by 10.3 per cent, lower than the increase last year,
reflecting what the bank called 'a return to a more normal trend' following
the pronounced increases in the past two years due to the bank's expansion
in east Germany.
Total operating profits - which include the contribution from own account
trading - rose by 15 per cent to DM1.4bn. Dresdner's shares rose DM7 to
close at DM332 yesterday.
Mr Roller, dismissed talk of a power-struggle between Deutsche Bank, on the
one hand, and Dresdner and Allianz, the big insurance company which owns
22.3 per cent of Dresdner, on the other.
Speculation of such a struggle has been fanned in recent days following the
sharp fall in the Allianz share price - and in the German stock market as a
whole - after it published poor figures for 1991 on Tuesday last week. The
shares fell further on Thursday and Friday, triggered by a sell
recommendation from DB Research, the Deutsche Bank research arm.
Mr Roller said that the sell note had caught the stock market at a delicate
moment. Questions about the motivation for the earnings estimate should be
put to DB Research itself, he said. However, he pointed out that Dresdner's
own equity analysts had downgraded their forecasts for Allianz's earnings as
long ago as December last year.
Deutsche, which last month took a significant step into the German insurance
market with the purchase of a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, the largest
privately-owned insurance company in Germany, has argued that the sell
recommendation was based on a fundamental assessment of Allianz's profits
and was not an attempt to knock a rival's share price. Allianz has, for its
part, denied rumours that it has dumped shares in Deutsche Bank by way of
retaliation.
DRESDNER Bank wants to relieve the former Soviet Union's debt problems by
partially accepting repayments in roubles, Reuter reports from Hamburg.
Mr Wolfgang Roeller, the bank's management board chairman, told a press
conference that international banks should grant the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) a partial delay on payment of interest on its
loans.
He added: 'We are prepared to accept a proportion of the interest payments
in roubles.' One condition of accepting roubles was that banks should be
able to use them to buy stakes in companies and property in the former
Soviet Union, he said.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Christiania Bank losses sharply
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA BANK, Norway's second-biggest commercial bank, said yesterday
that first-half net losses narrowed sharply to NKr162m (Dollars 27.8m) from
NKr1.637bn in the same period last year, writes Karen Fossli.
The bank also reduced the amount its wants as emergency state funding from
NKr750m to NKr685m to enable it to meet stricter capital adequacy
requirements to be implemented by the end of the year. Last year,
Christiania received state funds of NKr7.864bn.
Christiania was acquired by the state last year after its share capital was
wiped out by large losses. The bank was de-listed from the bourse and
shareholders were given an option to acquire up to 25 per cent of the
state's shares. Some 2.3 per cent of Christiania's share capital has been
taken up by private investors. A decision to relist the bank in Oslo could
be made this month.
Christiania lifted first-half net interest income to NKr1.555bn from
NKr1.413bn last year. Profits from foreign exchange and securities' trading
dipped to NKr260m from NKr283m, as non-interest expenses were cut to
NKr1.447bn from NKr1.769bn in last year's comparative period.
Christiania reduced staff by 20 per cent during the last 18 months as part
of a state instruction to reduce costs by 15 per cent. Costs were reduced by
21 per cent by the end of the second quarter.
First-half credit losses fell to NKr1bn from NKr1.9bn.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Monsanto offloads valve division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONSANTO, the large US chemicals company that has been focusing on its core
businesses amid a difficult operating environment, yesterday announced the
sale of its Fisher Controls valve and systems subsidiary for Dollars 1.275bn
in cash.
The buyer is Emerson Electric, the electronic products company that, like
Monsanto, is based in St Louis, Missouri.
Mr Nicholas Filippello, Monsanto's chief economist, said the Fisher Controls
division, which had 1991 sales of Dollars 928m, was no longer viewed as a
strategic asset of the group.
The Monsanto executive said the sale of the division, which employs 7,000
people of Monsanto's workforce of 39,000, would 'help us reach our financial
goals and more finely focus our product portfolio'.
Fisher Controls is a leading supplier of control valves and control systems
for process industries including the chemical, oil and gas and pulp and
paper sectors.
In 1991, its operating income was Dollars 95m, representing 11 per cent of
sales but only 6 per cent of operating profits.
Mr Filippello said that Monsanto's concentration on its core businesses of
high-value chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and food
ingredients 'precluded the level of investment needed to allow Fisher to
grow'.
The group needs cash. The chemicals operations are suffering from the poor
US economy. In addition, some of its strongest revenue earners are slowing.
These include Roundup, Monsanto's herbicide and world's best-selling
agrochemical, whose patents expired in the US and Europe last year. But the
group faces price--cutting and generic competition. It has cut prices by 45
per cent, although Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, claimed
earnings were increasing.
Earnings from Nutrasweet, the artificial sweetener, are set to decline. Last
year, it generated sales growth of only 2 per cent and its patents expire in
December. Sales of Simplesse fat substitute have been disappointing and the
product is in loss, admitted Mr Mahoney.
The trend among leading US chemicals companies, as well as international
groups such as ICI of Britain, is to both restructure and seek a sharper
strategic focus for the 1990s.
Du Pont, for example, recently announced a reorganisation of its electronics
division and plans to sell off its electrical connectors business.
Monsanto declined to say how it planned to use the Dollars 1.275bn of cash
it will receive, although the company noted that in the past excess cash has
been used to make investments in existing operations, to make further
acquisitions or to repurchase the company's stock.
Wall Street reacted very favourably to the news of the Monsanto divestiture;
the company's share price was marked Dollars 3 1/8 higher to Dollars 56 1/2
.
Kidder Peabody, the New York investment house, meanwhile reacted to the
Fisher sale by calling the move a positive one and by raising its rating on
Monsanto shares from hold to buy.
For the first six months of 1992, operating earnings at Fisher declined to
Dollars 31m, from Dollars 51m in the first half of last year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas Lancaster, who built up the Lancaster group of motor dealerships
with his father, is to join the Malaya Group of Mercedes-Benz dealers as
managing director.
Malaya is to come under the control of Lancaster Associates Holdings in
proposals announced for the injection of Pounds 3m net new capital, and new
management expertise, and the simplification of the capital structure.
The Giltrap Group recently acquired voting control of Malaya through the
purchase of preference shares.
Mr Colin Giltrap proposed to increase his management role which, it was
hoped, would lead to a revival of the group's fortunes. In the event, he has
decided on the need for more funding and new management initiatives.
The preference shares are being converted into ordinary. There will be a
2-for-1 rights issue of 17.1m ordinary shares at 10p and the Lancaster
Associates will subscribe for 15m shares at 10p.
Giltrap has renounced its 7m rights shares in favour of Lancaster
Associates, which is underwriting the issue. Giltrap will finish with some
20.6 per cent of the enlarged capital while Lancaster Associates will hold
between 54 per cent and 69 per cent, depending on the underwriting needs.

<TEXT>
Pacer Systems, the US-based electronics and aerospace company quoted on the
USM in London, reported a 50 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Dollars
320,000 (Pounds 168,000) for the six months to June 30. Sales rose 4 per
cent to Dollars 14.5m.
Mr Jack Rennie, chairman, said profits had been depressed by
higher-than-normal marketing and proposal costs. The group currently had
proposals out for about Dollars 90m-worth of business, he said. Some of this
would begin to feed through in the second half.
The dearth of proposals resulted in a 5 per cent drop in the order book to
Dollars 55m.
Earnings per share fell from 7 cents to 4 cents. The dividend was maintained
at 3 cents.
Mr Rennie and other directors together hold about 50 per cent of the shares.

Edinburgh Oil &amp; Gas, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production
group, reported a drop in net profits from Pounds 234,000 to Pounds 5,000 in
the half year to June 30.
The result was in spite of an 18 per cent advance in turnover to Pounds
851,000 (Pounds 717,000) and was because of a higher depletion charge and
higher administration expenses due mainly to a lower level of activity on
the operated licences. Also, profits last time benefited significantly from
the sale of investments.
Earnings per share amounted to 0.02p (1.35p).

<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARTWELL is making a mandatory cash offer for Trimoco following the
conversion of its holding of 11.5 per cent convertible unsecured loan stock.
Its offer of 17.5p per share and Pounds 175 per Pounds 100 nominal of the
outstanding culs values Trimoco, the Dunstable-based motor dealer, at Pounds
25.9m. The announcement was made after the close of the market on which
Trimoco's shares had closed unchanged at 17 1/2 p.
Hartwell, a motor trader ultimately owned by a discretionary trust set up by
Mr Abdul Jameel, believes Trimoco's prospects would be enhanced if it won
control.
Before yesterday Hartwell, and persons acting in concert with it, held a
share stake of 29.8 per cent and 92.1 per cent of the culs.
The conversion into shares raised the holding to 39.4 per cent of the
enlarged capital requiring a bid to be made under the takeover code at a
price set by the code.
The Jameel activities have been raising their holding in Trimoco over the
last year. In December last year Mr John Wei, Hartwell chief executive and
Mr Mahmoud Abdulla, a senior Hartwell executive joined the Trimoco board,
which said at the time that it intended to work closely with the Jameel
organisation on future development.

<TEXT>
MORE THAN 80 per cent of the shares in Cupid's 1-for-2 rights issue were
left at the altar for the sub-underwriters to pick up.
The USM-quoted bridal wear company, which includes the Pronuptia retail
business, announced yesterday that 18.1 per cent of the 82p-a-share issue
had been taken up.
Mr Mike Murray, chief executive, said the result was disappointing, but it
came against the background of a falling market between the June launch and
the closing date.
Cupid's share price closed down 2p at 79p yesterday. On the day the Pounds
2.68m issue was announced it shed 5p to finish at 90p.
Mr Murray said the money was raised to finance retrospectively last winter's
purchase of the Youngs formal wear business from the receiver. That had
pushed up borrowings to Pounds 4.2m - gearing of 93 per cent.
The issue proceeds would wipe out debt during the current favourable period
for cash.

FT  05 AUG 92 / NatWest profits recover sharply: Second-biggest UK clearer
rises 109% despite record losses on lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank's profits recovered sharply in the first half of
the year, even though its losses on UK lending remained at record levels.
The second-biggest UK clearing bank, as measured by the value of its assets,
also said it expected staff numbers to reduce by 5,000 this year and a
similar number next year.
The departures of two senior executives were announced yesterday. Sir
Geoffrey Littler, chairman of NatWest's merchant bank, County NatWest, and
Mr John Drury, County's chief executive, are leaving.
Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said that Sir Geoffrey and Mr Drury
'decided that there would be no long-term role for them'.
NatWest's pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 increased 109 per
cent to Pounds 211m, which was also Pounds 101m more than it made in the
whole of last year.
Its bad debt charge fell from Pounds 902m to Pounds 864m. However, within
this total charge, the loan losses suffered by the UK high street banking
business increased from Pounds 556m to Pounds 638m.
Lord Alexander blamed these losses on the bank's relatively high exposure to
the small business lending market - where it has a market share of almost a
third - and also on the bank's disproportionate presence in the south-east
of England, the region hit hardest by the recession.
NatWest has around Pounds 11bn of loans to small businesses and in the past
couple of years has set aside about Pounds 1bn as provisions against losses
on these loans. However, Mr Derek Wanless, the newly appointed chief
executive, said that the bank had no plans to reduce its share of this
market though it has been striving to charge small business customers more.
Last year, NatWest increased the margin on small business lending - the
difference between the lending rate and NatWest's funding rate - by 0.5 per
cent and this margin has widened slightly since then.
NatWest pushed up profits before loan losses from Pounds 984m to Pounds
1.092bn. It bucked the trend set by rivals Lloyds and Midland, which
announced results last week, by increasing non-interest income or earnings
from bankings commissions and fees and from sales of insurance products.
These non-interest earnings rose 12 per cent. Much of the rise came from an
increase in the tariffs paid by customers and also from an improvement in
the rate of collecting these tariffs, thanks to the installation of a
computer system which made it easier to monitor when charges are payable. On
the other hand, interest income fell slightly for two reasons:
The volume of interest-earning loans held by NatWest has fallen;
There has been a rise in the value of loans classified as non-performing.
Operating costs barely changed at Pounds 2.11bn. Within these costs,
personnel expenses fell marginally. Since December, staff numbers have
fallen by 3,100, in spite of the creation of 1,100 new jobs. Excluding the
creation of new jobs, around 3,000 jobs were lost in the UK high street
branches alone. Mr Derek Wanless said the scale of job losses was likely to
remain close to this rate in the coming 18 months.
The dividend has been maintained at 6.125p out of earnings of 8p against 5p
a share.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Royal Bank of Scotland warns on bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland yesterday issued a gloomy trading statement, which in
part prompted a 12 per cent fall in its share price to 153p, writes Robert
Peston. The bank said it expected bad debt charges in the current financial
year to end-September, would exceed the previous year's record Pounds 351m.
The bank also announced plans to raise Dollars 200m (Pounds 104m) by an
issue of non-cumulative preference shares in the US. Merrill Lynch, US
securities firm will act as adviser.
Royal Bank said it did not expect any improvement in the 'recessionary
environment in the short term' and business conditions for the group would
probably 'remain difficult . . . through at least the remainder of calendar
1992'.
Royal Bank's share price was also depressed by an announcement of a claim
from Wallace Smith Trust, a company in liquidation, for reimbursement of
sums - with a total face value of Pounds 418m - allegedly transferred to the
wrong account. Royal Bank is contesting the claim.

FT  05 AUG 92 / TI Group suffers 7% fall to Pounds 50.2m in first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering group that took over Dowty, the
aerospace company, in June, yesterday reported a 7 per cent fall in
first-half profits amid 'increasingly prolonged depression in business
activity'.
Increases in profits from the John Crane seals and Bundy specialised tubes
divisions - much of which derived from the Pounds 134m spent on bolt-on
acquisitions last year - could not compensate for a halving in operating
profits in the specialised engineering division.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, said the main decline was in Thermal
Technology, a non-core business providing metal treatment services, which is
to be sold.
As proposed during the bid, Dowty's aerospace division will replace the
specialised engineering division as TI's third business leg alongside seals
and tubes.
The figures are the last not to include a contribution from Dowty. In early
October TI will reveal the fair market provisions it will set up for the
Dowty acquisition, a practice for which the City has criticised TI in the
past.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 54.2m in the six months to June 1991 to
Pounds 50.2m - about the level reported in the last half of 1992 - on sales
up 7 per cent at Pounds 471m.
Earnings per share fell from 11.4p to 10.2p and the group is to pay an
increased 3.7p interim dividend, up 5.7 per cent.
TI also attempted to remove some of the uncertainty that surrounded Dowty's
results for the year to March.
Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen, auditors for TI and Dowty
respectively, have now agreed that Dowty will report pre-tax profits of
Pounds 26m, about Pounds 6.7m below the figure forecast by Dowty as part of
its bid defence.
Mr Lewinton said the closure of Dowty's Cognito paging business would
require a Pounds 25m write-off. This will be taken on Dowty's books before
it is consolidated into TI and will therefore not form part of the
acquisition provisions to be announced in October.
Mr Lewington's comments that Dowty's first-quarter operating improvement was
unlikely to continue, as Dowty had suggested, and repetition of the stark
economic background in the group's markets hit TI's share price. After a
number of brokers cut their forecasts, TI's shares fell 31p to 283p.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Walbrook enters liquidation procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALBROOK INSURANCE, the insurance and reinsurance company with net
liabilities of Pounds 170m, yesterday passed into provisional liquidation on
the instructions of the High Court.
The liquidation raises the prospect of an unprecedentedly large payout from
the Policyholders Protection Board, the UK insurance industry's safety net,
which may total more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 104m).
Walbrook, which is a subsidiary of London United Investments, the property
company which went into administration in 1990, was one of the leading
insurers and reinsurers of US liability business on the London market during
the 1980s.
Mr Justice Harman yesterday approved as joint liquidators Mr Christopher
Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Cork Gully, and Mr Gareth Hughes of Ernst &amp; Young,
who will put together a scheme of arrangement under the 1985 Companies Act.
His action follows a winding-up petition lodged by Transit Casualty, a
Missouri-based insurance company, which went into receivership in 1985,
supported by several other large creditors to Walbrook.
It comes after a failed attempt by the directors of Walbrook to produce an
informal plan of arrangement which would have left them in control of the
company and offered large creditors a 40 per cent dividend and a
debt-for-equity swap.
The directors did not oppose the winding-up petition, and the principal
debate in the court yesterday was about a possible conflict of interest over
the appointment of one of the liquidators.
The decision to create a scheme of arrangement on the court's orders is
unusual, and will require approval by 75 per cent of Walbrook's estimated
30,000 creditors at a meeting.
Mr Ian Bond from Cork Gully said yesterday that it would be early next year
before a scheme would be ready, because the liquidators would need time to
analyse new financial information.
He said that one element of the scheme would need to be an agreement from
the Policyholders Protection Board to contribute for the creditors which it
covers. Estimates range from Dollars 200m to Dollars 1bn.
Under a recent ruling in the court of appeal, this would include individual
policyholders and partnerships for policies written to cover the UK and US.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Tough tactics behind the unit trusts: Norma Cohen on
Fidelity's attempts to achieve better returns for its managed funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public confrontation between Fidelity Investments and the lenders and
management of WPP, the worldwide media services group, has brought the
institution's role as an aggressive shareholder into the spotlight.
For Boston-based Fidelity, the world's largest institutional fund manager,
has been exporting US-style institutional activism into Britain with mixed
results.
So far its UK arm, Fidelity Investments International, has helped oust two
managements - at Brown and Jackson, the retailer, and Great Western
Resources, the natural resources company. The share prices of both companies
have since soared. But in no UK takeover battle has it won better financial
terms for shareholders.
Fidelity Investments International has long been a maverick among UK
institutions, both for its perception of its role as a shareholder and its
investment style. Its senior investment director, Mr Anthony Bolton,
engineered spectacular results for the company's unit trusts in the
mid-1980s by concentrating on small companies and recovery situations.
However, the recent recession has particularly hit share prices in those
sectors and Fidelity's investment returns have suffered accordingly.
According to FinStat, the unit trust statistical research service,
Fidelity's Pounds 485m European Fund ranked first out of 88 funds measured
by performance over the past five years, but over the year to this June, it
ranked 83rd out of 125.
Similarly, its Special Situations Fund, once its pre-eminent investment
vehicle, ranked sixth out of 69 funds on seven-year performance but 128th
out of 146 funds over the past two years. That fund's performance has
improved over the past year to June and its one-year returns rank 49th out
of 147 funds in a similar category.
Thus, Fidelity's attempt to achieve better returns for unit holders by
trying to get the most out of the companies in which it has invested becomes
more understandable.
But many other UK fund managers face similar pressures on investment returns
yet few have chosen to flex their muscle in such a visible way.
'We feel its much more effective to do these things in private,' said the
corporate finance director at one large UK institution. Indeed, fund
managers say that the very threat that their hostile actions may be made
public often acts as a disincentive for any action at all.
In the case of WPP, Fidelity led a group of preference shareholders who
threatened to vote against a restructuring unless lenders offered them
better terms. Fidelity was able to gather the support of 30 per cent to 40
per cent of the shareholders after compiling an extensive analysis of the
terms of the deal which it circulated to other investors. In the end,
Fidelity was forced to climb down after it became evident that the lenders
were prepared to send WPP into receivership and render the shares worthless.
But Fidelity says it has no regrets about its role in WPP or in previous
cases where it has challenged management. 'This is the first large company
where we have been the biggest shareholder,' said Mr Bolton. 'In retrospect,
we might have been wiser to retain an investment bank to represent our
interests but we don't think it was a mistake. It doesn't change our view
that as a house, we will stand up for shareholders.'
Mr Barry Bateman, head of Fidelity's UK business, said that perhaps the
company's US parent had encouraged a degree of activism which, while
uncommon in the UK, was increasingly prevalent in the US. 'As an investment
house we encourage this (activism) amongst our fund managers whereas other
firms discourage their fund managers from doing these things.'
Fidelity has played a leading role in more management confrontations than
any of its counterparts. It won two victories last year - at Brown and
Jackson and Great Western Resources, a US-based but London-listed company -
but failed in its efforts to oust the management at Cityvision, the video
rental chain, after it agreed to be acquired by US-based Blockbuster at a
price some shareholders considered too low.
But Fidelity has at times been uncomfortable about such public activism.
Earlier this year, it dismissed a corporate troubleshooter after deciding
that his actions had received too much adverse publicity. His role was to
try to turn losing investments around, frequently through management
changes.
Fidelity has also been active in the share trading settlements area. When a
group of international banks refused fund managers access to Swift, an
electronic worldwide messaging system for bank payments, Fidelity and Morgan
Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, proposed their own system, forcing thebanks
to back down.
Fidelity has also been an activist - generally unsuccessfully - on
continental Europe. In November 1990, Fidelity baulked at selling its shares
in Furness, one of Rotterdam's big shipping service companies, to its rival
Pakhoed, arguing that the price was too low. In the end, it sold its shares
to a third party, saying it believed that most of the remaining shareholders
were likely to accept the deal.
In March 1991, it joined a group of dissident shareholders in NedLloyd, the
Dutch transport group, who unsuccessfully sought to force a radical
restructuring of the board.
But the big question for Fidelity is if, overall, its actions enhance
returns to investors. Without better returns, it is likely to have fewer
investors whose interests need safeguarding.

FT  05 AUG 92 / LSE's County Hall bid attacked: Owner-body urges government
to reject 'highly speculative' Pounds 65m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSY surrounding the bid by the London School of Economics to move to
County Hall grew yesterday when the London Residuary Body publicly urged the
government to reject the bid out of hand.
The LRB, which owns the site on behalf of the boroughs comprising the former
Greater London Council, is adamant that its original decision to sell the
site to Shirayama, the Japanese developer, was right. It dismissed the LSE
bid as 'highly speculative and not worth serious consideration'. The LRB
argues that the LSE's offer, made last week, does not even meet the
university's own agreement with Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, that it would submit an 'unconditional bid'.
'The LSE offer is conditional on the completion of the sale of their present
Houghton Street premises at a highly speculative value in three years' time
and on receiving clearance from the Universities Funding Council,' it said.
The LRB's decision to go public in such forthright terms reflects the
frustration of Sir Godfrey Taylor, its chairman. The government, which has
reserve powers over the sale, changed its mind after the general election to
allow the LSE to bid for County Hall, although the university's desire to
move to the site from its cramped campus off Aldwych had been known for
months before the decision to sell to Shirayama.
Shirayama's Pounds 60m contract is only for the riverside building, facing
the Houses of Parliament, which it wants to develop as a hotel. The LSE is
offering Pounds 65m for the whole County Hall site, less than half of which
is occupied by the building. The LRB believes it could secure 'well in
excess' of that sum for the entire site. Sir Godfrey is advising Mr Howard
not only to reject the LSE bid, but to remove the clause in the Shirayama
contract giving the government until the end of the year to withdraw from
the agreement.
'We want to remove the get-out clause so that Shirayama can get on with
their planning application for the hotel conversion and we can get on with
finding a buyer for the rest of the site', he said. The Environment
Department said Mr Howard would study the LRB's advice 'with care'.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Germany faces huge increase in number of asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASYLUM SEEKERS poured into Germany last month at the rate of more than one a
minute, overburdening resources, threatening goodwill and straining the
patience of Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister.
Announcing a record influx of 46,496 people - bringing the total for the
year so far to 233,000, against 256,000 in the whole of 1991 - Mr Seiters
appealed yesterday for the Social Democrat party opposition 'finally to open
the way for a change in the constitution to stop the uncontrolled flow'.
Abuse of the existing law, which obliges immigration officials to allow in
anyone claiming asylum, limited Germany's ability to help people in real
need: the victims of war, terror and violence, the minister said.
Of the more than 130,000 claims examined so far this year, only 4.3 per cent
had been approved as genuine cases of people fleeing political persecution,
Mr Seiters added.
The SPD, reinforced by allies among the Liberal Democrats, junior partners
in the Bonn coalition, has long resisted constitutional change, which
requires approval in the SPD-dominated Bundesrat, the upper house.
The local authorities face increasing difficulties in handling the flood.
Yesterday, 200 police raided a 'collection hostel' in a former barracks near
Stuttgart.
Four people were arrested and charged with drug offences and burglary. Five
were found to have several sets of identity papers. Around 180 of the 390
people registered as resident in the hostel had disappeared.
In Schleswig-Holstein, 140 asylum seekers, who fled from neighbouring
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Monday to escape harassment from rightwing
extremists, were told they would be returned forcibly if they did not go
back voluntarily.
There has been no repetition so far this year of the large-scale violence
which flared last autumn after a concerted skinhead attack on a hostel in
Hoyerswerda, Saxony. But there are regular reports of assault on foreigners,
and popular discontent appears to be mounting.
Mr Seiters pointed out that, of last month's 10,700 asylum seekers from the
former Yugoslavia, fewer than 1,000 came from areas where civil war is
taking place.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Bumpy transition for a lord of the City: Bronwen Maddox
looks at what life holds for Lord Stevens after his departure from Invesco
MIM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I cross a bridge, I cross it,' says Lord Stevens of Ludgate. He is the
first to remark that last week's boardroom upheaval at Invesco MIM, the fund
management group, brings a radical change in his life.
He will stay as MIM's chairman until next spring but has given up executive
responsibilities immediately. In effect this marks the end of his 30-year
career in the City.
The MIM shake-up - which came as little surprise to its directors - follows
a troubled period in which MIM found it hard to attract new UK clients. A
widespread perception that Lord Stevens had been close to the late Mr Robert
Maxwell did not help. Lord Stevens says he had suggested taking a less
prominent role six months earlier, but 'this isn't the smooth transition I
wish had happened'.
'I don't regret leaving the City, though I do regret leaving some of the
people,' he says. 'The City's not fun any more,' he adds, blaming recession
and regulation - although he hastens to say that he does not disapprove of
the increase in regulation that followed the Financial Services Act of 1986.
His departure leaves him, now 56, still chairing two other businesses:
United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, and Alexander Proudfoot,
one of Europe's leading management consultancies.
After years of juggling his three roles - 60 per cent of his time on United
News, 30 per cent on MIM and 10 per cent on Proudfoot, he reckons - he now
plans to spend more time at his two newer careers. Neither offers a
trouble-free ride.
Proudfoot may present the most pressing demands. Its shares have fallen by
40 per cent in the past month following the sudden departure of its chief
executive and the downgrading of profits estimates by brokers. Specialising
in factory-floor advice on improving production, Proudfoot had appeared to
weather recession well until early this year.
Two recent overseas acquisitions - in management training and strategy  -
will now take the group a step closer to the heartland of rivals such as
Bain and McKinsey. To help the integration of the new acquisitions Lord
Stevens plans to visit Proudfoot's offices in Brussels, Stockholm and Palm
Beach in the next few months.
He says that he loves the business. 'A lot of consultancies don't get their
hands dirty and Proudfoot does.'
More widely known is the combative pleasure Lord Stevens takes in chairing
United Newspapers. 'If I hadn't taken over the newspapers, you'd still be
calling me David,' he said at one City presentation, leaving at least one
hereditary peer and several fund managers spluttering.
A provocative joke, given that the board of United Newspapers has few City
fans: the share price of 392p is stubbornly at the same level as five years
ago, stalled by the group's high debt and the slump in advertising.
This year circulation and advertising have begun to pick up and industry
observers estimate that pre-tax profits will be slightly ahead of last
year's Pounds 85.2m. But the cashflow will be eaten up by interest payments
on the Pounds 400m debt, by capital spending of about Pounds 25m a year and
by the generous dividend of Pounds 42m which has supported the shares.
Lord Stevens says that raising finance to buy small European titles should
still be possible, although his ambitions have clearly been scaled down
since the group's mid-1980s acquisitions of Fleet Holdings, former Express
owner, and Extel, the financial services group.
If some of the excitement has diminished since then, however, so have the
threats; a hostile takeover became less likely two months ago when Mr Conrad
Black, proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, sold his 9 per cent stake.
Lord Stevens says he is at United to stay. 'I became chairman 11 years ago
and at some stage people have to realise I do know something about the
business.'
One of the few remaining thorns is the question of the depth of his
relationship with Maxwell. The latter held stakes in Fleet and Extel before
United Newspapers took over those companies; he also held a stake in
Britannia Arrow, the fund management group, before it merged with MIM; and
he underwrote Pounds 20m of Proudfoot's launch on the stock market.
Critics have suggested that Maxwell's involvement in these deals, which were
crucial to the development of Lord Stevens's businesses, points to a close
relationship between the two.
Lord Stevens argues that the relationship went no further than conventional
business deals, and that it was possible to negotiate with Maxwell in a
straightforward manner. 'OK, Maxwell was shifty, but he never double-crossed
me. If he double-crossed others it was because they're wimps. I liked him.'
He is adamant that the connection did not run deep: 'My diary says we met on
only 17 occasions since 1985.' He points, too, to the fact that he refused
to let Maxwell print the Express, 'because when it came down to it, I never
trusted him'.
He clearly feels that the public preoccupation with Maxwell was partly
responsible for his departure from MIM. 'Since Maxwell, everyone associates
the combination of publishing and fund management with skulduggery and I
knew that wasn't going to go away.'
Aside from fending off speculation about the extent of his relationship with
Maxwell - which is likely to rumble on for years - will United and Proudfoot
be enough to keep Lord Stevens occupied?
His second wife, who died three years ago, suggested in her book, Woman as
Chameleon, that wives adopt a different personality each day to keep their
husbands entertained. Lord Stevens denies that he has needed three
chairmanships to keep his life full. 'Some people do, but I don't. I'm
getting older. My wife died. I remarried. I want an easier life,' he says.
Then he adds: 'There are other things I want to do with my life - perhaps
politics.' That answer is made less surprising by a recent speech in the
House of Lords on the responsibilities of the press. Perhaps because of his
own sensitivity to press comment on his links with Maxwell, he says: 'I
don't like the way the press goes for people who have fallen on hard times.'
He adds quickly: 'I'm not sure yet exactly what I want to do. But there
comes a time when you want to think about something else. Well, I'm
thinking.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / The quagmire of Russian reform: Reformers and industrialists
are heading for a showdown over the direction of economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, is
widely seen as the most powerful man in Russia after President Boris
Yeltsin. That position lends an ominous tone to his gloomy assessment of the
country's political and economic outlook. 'The policy of the reform
government is about collapse,' he said yesterday. 'The attempt to reach the
market in one jump is utopia.'
Mr Volsky was articulating the complaints of managers who have a finger on
the productive pulse of the economy. After a period of growing restlessness,
his statement yesterday may mark the beginning of a showdown between the
radical reformers and the country's industrialists.
Mr Volsky has stepped up his criticism of the government at a time when a
series of interconnected dilemmas are confronting the Russian authorities.
The economy continues to weaken and the impoverishment of the Russian people
is worsening; the political tone of the country grows harsher; and foreign
assistance is becoming more uncertain.
The danger inherent in the current malaise is not so much of total economic
collapse or the sudden seizure of state power by reactionaries. Instead, the
continuing economic and political setbacks, which have delayed both
marketisation and democratisation, threaten regional security and prolong
the impoverishment and hopelessness of millions. The stakes are high enough
for us to take Russia's dilemmas seriously.
The most urgent issues fall into closely intertwined, categories: first, the
economy's performance is worse than forecast. Exports, at just over Dollars
12bn for the first five months of the year, are down one-third on the same
period last year, against a forecast 20 per cent drop. Imports, at around
the same figure, are now heavily skewed towards grain - at the expense of
vitally needed parts and equipment.
Oil production, which accounts for 67 per cent of hard currency exports,
continues to fall. Output in Russia fell 13 per cent in the first half of
this year, and it is unlikely to pick up in the second six months. Last
month, a group of government experts predicted that the production level
might fall to about 228m tonnes by 1995, less than half of last year's level
of 460m tonnes.
The expected level of this year's grain harvest - between 92m and 96m tonnes
 -is not encouraging. Part of the problem is that collective and state
farms, no longer the obedient satraps of the state, are withholding grain,
while demanding higher prices. The likely price the government will have to
pay is currently estimated at about Rbs10,000 a tonne, not too far away from
the world market price of Rbs15,000 to Rbs16,000 a tonne. The poor harvest
will mean that the price of a loaf of bread could quadruple. Consumers have
already been hit with a tenfold rise in bread prices over the last year. The
question is, will the public tolerate another huge price increase?
Pessimists believe the answer is no.
The decline in oil and grain production is a bitter pill for the reform
government of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister who still has 'acting' in
front of his title. Since the beginning of the year, Mr Gaidar and his
colleagues have worked seven days a week, 18 hours a day, to try to pull the
economy out of its structural decline.
Mr Gaidar's team has enjoyed some success: the liberalisation of most
prices; the removal of restrictions on foreign trade, the beginnings of
privatisation; the strengthening of the fledgling market processes initiated
before their accession to office. Further, a growing core of entrepreneurs
and profit-oriented managers has been established. This group may help to
sustain the process of economic reform and bring Russia into the mainstream
of the world economy.
The Gaidar team has not run into a wall, but it appears to have waded into a
marsh, which grows steadily deeper and stickier the more it attempts to
plough on.
Put simply, Mr Gaidar's team is being forced to make ever more costly
compromises to forces which can be called, conveniently, the 'industrial
lobby' - that is, the managers and bureaucrats who struggle to keep
production going in the face of tight credit, high interest rates and the
fraying links between enterprises. Relations between enterprises have
deteriorated because of barriers to trade among the former Soviet republics
and big drops in orders.
These enterprises have top-level representation in Mr Volsky's Union of
Industrialists. Mr Volsky is a clever political operative who has
transformed himself from executive in the Soviet Central Committee under
successive general secretaries in the 1980s to the chief representative of
big business in the post-Soviet era. Three of his supporters from within
industry are now in senior positions in the Russian cabinet, and more are
expected to be appointed. With their 'industrial experience', they are seen
as a counterbalance to the cabinet's 'theoreticians', which dominate the
Gaidar team.
Mr Volsky has also been the moving force behind the creation of the Civic
Union, which groups together his own 'Renewal' party, the Democratic Party
(the largest in the country in membership) and the Free Russia Party, led by
Gen Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. This diverse group -
which Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Saint Petersburg, is joining - is the
largest political bloc in the country, and its partners all have different,
and perhaps incompatible, agendas. However, it shares a determination to
stop radical market reform and replace it with one or other version of
managed change, with the management often more evident than the change.
On top of this, a new, hard-edged political mood has become evident in the
country, even among many politicians who were once radical democrats with a
Western orientation. This mood was best expressed recently by Mr Sergei
Stankevich, a state counsellor and presidential adviser, who called a press
conference to denounce as a 'liberal dream' the rapid transformation to a
market economy. Instead he called for a strong central state as the
indispensable element of controlled reform and national revival.
Inter-republican relationships have got better, but not much. Ceasefires are
holding in two of the 'hot spots' - in South Ossetia and (less surely) in
the Trans-Dnestr area of Moldova. Earlier this week, Mr Yeltsin agreed to
postpone the division of the Black Sea fleet by proposing a joint control
with Ukraine for three years.
However, a solution to the question of the removal of Russian troops from
the Baltics is still no nearer. In Estonia, Russian and Estonian military
exchanged fire at the end of last month in Tallinn, the capital, and
relations remain very tense. Difficulties also persist in Russia's relations
with Ukraine, despite the agreement on the Black Sea fleet. There has been a
sharp drop in Russian supplies to Ukraine, especially of oil. No agreement
has been reached on the introduction of the Ukrainian currency, and
sputtering quarrels over control of the Crimea continue. These tensions have
further hardened the tone of Russian political life.
To cap this, the role of a so-far shadowy body, the Security Council, is now
increasing. It was created by Mr Yeltsin to deal with security issues, and
includes in its membership Gen Rutskoi and Mr Gaidar. Under Mr Yuri Skokov,
its powerful secretary, the council is extending its range. Recently it
sharply criticised Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, for warning of a
coup. More importantly it has decided to review the progress of
privatisation, according to report quoting Gen Rutskoi. This is hardly an
issue thought to require a large security input.
The west, with its store of financial assistance and technical aid, has
proved less a counterweight to these trends than was expected. Indeed,
Russia - and to a lesser extent the other former Soviet republics - often
experience the rich foreign powers not as givers of assistance but as
demanders of recompense - the repayment of the Dollars 70bn-Dollars 80bn
hard currency debt, and from Japan, the return of the four Kurile Islands.
In the short term, it is impossible for Russia to satisfy either of these
demands. The country does not have the sufficient funds even to pay the
interest on its debt. In regard to the disputed islands, political
resistance to their return is so great that it would probably be suicidal
for the government to do so.
The International Monetary Fund has managed to win approval of Dollars 1bn
in aid for Russia, to be formally ratified by its board in the next few
days. However the conditions attached to the aid package - a budget deficit
no higher than 5 per cent of GNP and a 9 per cent monthly inflation target
by the end of the year - are almost certainly unattainable. That means that
the more substantial standby agreement with the IMF is in serious doubt.
Even worse, the IMF has not been able to strike up a close relationship with
its Russian interlocuters, who see it as nit-picking and unhelpful. The IMF,
meanwhile, sees the Russian authorities as untrustworthy and dismissive.
The World Bank, which is developing programmes of technical and agricultural
aid, is hampered in its lending by lack of a substantive agreement with the
IMF (though a Dollars 1.7bn package will go ahead, with the first tranche to
be agreed this week).
Adding to its problems, Russia is no longer a central concern for the west.
Japan is frank in its refusal to assist substantially before a deal on the
Kuriles. Germany is consumed with the difficulties of integrating the east.
Britain, Canada, France and Italy are too weak economically to take a
leadership role. The US, the natural leader, has an administration focused
on its re-election prospects and a Congress which still has not given
authorisation to the main Russian aid package.
It is an overstatement to say that Russia is now on its own, especially
since commercial interest continues to grow. However, at such a crucial
time, foreign governments appear to be pre-occupied elsewhere.
The anniversary of the August putsch is in three weeks. It will be
celebrated with pomp and rhetoric. Beneath the surface, however, the darker
forces that were unleashed by the celebrated victory over the reactionaries
are becoming increasing evident.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: Vadstena - Summer Festivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VADSTENA IS a tiny town on the eastern shore of Lake Vattern in the middle
of southern Sweden. It is historically rich - St Bridget lived and died
there (her relics are in the cathedral), and the magnificent castle built by
Gustav Vasa in the 16th century houses some of the country's most important
archives. It is unspoilt, peaceful, ravishingly beautiful.
Since a room in Vasa's castle was the scene of some of the earliest opera
performances ever put on in Sweden, the town's connections with the medium
are historically intriguing. But recently, they have been revived with
peculiar and notable success: the International Vadstena Academy, founded in
1964 by Ingrid Maria Rappe, the singing teacher, has developed an
international reputation as one of the most valuable of all summer-school
forcing-grounds for young operatic talent.
The roll-call of Swedish singers who have passed through on the way to wider
fame is itself an impressive testimonial (Britt-Marie Aruhn, Helena Dose,
Marianne Haggander, Anita Soldh, Anne Sofie von Otter, Thomas Sunnegardh,
Thomas Lander, Hillevi Martinpelto etc.). The producer Goran Jarvefelt took
early steps here; Arnold Ostman, Sweden's leading 'period' practitioner,
served as artistic director from 1969 to 1982.
The Academy is a finishing school (lessons and master-classes forming the
backbone of the pedagogical schedule) but by no means just that: as the
programme book proudly proclaims, it was set up 'for the purpose of studying
and performing both newly composed music dramas and early operas'. Most
years there is a world premiere; every year there is a rarity from the
byways of the Baroque, Classical or Romantic repertory, researched with care
and often edited 'in house'.
The mixture of new and old, theory and practice, past and present is
obviously an unending source of stimulus. Standards are remarkably high.
Seeing that Rodney Milnes and Paul Driver have previously proclaimed on this
page the virtues and pleasures of the Vadstena experience, I must not build
up my visit there last weekend into a feat of uncharted exploration, or
pretend that the excellence of the single performance I encountered came
without warning.
This year's schedule consists of a revival of last year's Vadstena premiere,
Thine is the Kingdom by Jonas Forsell, and two Tempest operas (both given in
Swedish translation) - Prospero's Dream, a new pasticcio using extant
numbers by Purcell, and Die Geisterinsel, J. F. Reichardt's Singspiel of
1798. I saw the Reichardt, and confidently count it one of the most
arresting evenings on my 1992 operatic calendar.
As a re-discovery it was revelatory (not least because in the standard
textbooks Die Geisterinsel is treated to the most cursory dismissal); as a
production played by a student orchestra and sung by several first-timers on
stage it was astonishing - physically free and agile, joyfully fresh and
imaginative, with a spirit-lifting sense of dramatic and musical wonder.
Gotter's libretto for Die Geisterinsel was admired by Goethe (who had
earlier collaborated with Reichardt on Claudine von Villa Bella) but
reputedly turned down by Mozart. Shakespeare is only a base; the narrative,
which includes non-singing parts for Sycorax and the spirit Maja, is at once
simplified and enriched with the supernatural.
Reichardt's three acts provides a vital missing link between The Magic Flute
and the Romantic energies and excitements of Cherubini, Beethoven, Schubert
and Weber. For a while it is the similarities, influences, period traits
that hold the attention; then the sturdy individuality of Reichardt's
stagecraft makes its mark. Up to now Reichardt's name has cropped up as a
composer of Lieder; his ability to drop delightful song-phrases of folk-like
innocence into long, grandly constructed act-finales (very well sustained by
the conductor B. Tommy Andersson) was therefore no surprise.
In a room entirely without stage platform or machinery, Asa Melldahl's
staging had of necessity to create magic through the simplest of devices -
smoke, lights, comic tricks of burlesque linege (and sometimes hilarious
vulgarity: Caliban, a flasher in a dirty mac, had us all in fits). The
flavour of Peter Pan that she had infused into the text drew a charm out of
the piece that chimed ideally well with the capacities of the young cast.
Among them I predict a particularly bright future for the smooth,
wide-ranging bass-baritone Lars Arvidsson (Caliban), the sweet yet
glittering lyric soprano Karin Ingeback (Miranda), the personable and hugely
promising tenor Staffan Galli (Fernando), and the two high sopranos Kristin
Aabel (Ariel on a bicycle) and Annika Hassel (Fabio, Fernando's page).
Spoken dialogue was here no trial-by-recitation, as young English performers
too often allow it to be. The fluency of the performance made the three acts
and three hours whizz by.
Sweden's most famous summer festival, at the Drottningholm Court Theatre
outside Stockholm, has reached a turning-point. Arnold Ostman's decade as
director has just ended; next year Elisabeth Soderstrom takes over. Rumours
of change - notably the non-renewal of the 'period' instrumentalists'
contracts - are already flying about. Meanwhile, Ostman's final show in this
most glorious and perfectly preserved of 18th century theatres was a typical
piece of adventurousness: Gluck's Orfeo in its 1769 Parma edition, never
before revived.
The crucial point about this version is that, whereas the hero of 1762
original was an alto castrato, and that of the 1774 Paris re-working a
tenor, Gluck's Parma Orpheus was a soprano castrato. Moved up to soprano
pitch, his great, grief-stricken outpourings take on an entirely different
character - they convey a new vulnerability, are charged with a new
intensity. The performance itself, weakly cast, brainlessly staged (with
unwanted set-changes added to almost every scene) and conducted by Ostman in
rather fancy, soft-grained fashion, was disappointing. But the value of the
re-discovery has nevertheless been proved beyond argument.

Elizabeth R attracted almost 18m viewers when first screened earlier this
year. With the Royal Family scarcely off the front pages since there should
be another bumper audience for this wry look at the business of Queenship.
The scenes of the happy home life at Balmoral will be intently scrutinised.
(ITV 8.00).
Death and the Compass, in BBC2's ScreenPlay slot at 9.30, is an adaptation
of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. It is set, of course, in a Latin
American military dictatorship and stars Peter Boyle as the oddball
investigator of a series of murders.
Anthony Holden is a journalist who became a professional poker player good

11.15 he takes us to the event which attracts the best players as well as
the bizarre characters who devote their lives to this mesmerising contest.
Soul singer James Brown always receives laudatory television coverage,
perhaps because of his age, (well into his sixties), perhaps because his
performance is much copied by younger black artists. Expect the same old
footage of his stage show, gold cape and all (Channel 4, 11.05).

FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: A mixed crop from the garden gurus - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENING on TV makes perfect sense on a winter's night, but what about
summer evenings, when most gardeners want to be outside just as long as the
light holds? Pricking out, dead-heading, taking cuttings, catching the
groundsel before it seeds itself - there is a terrifying amount to do. Or
you may relent and simply sit, sniffing the phloxes as you plan the autumn
bulb-order.
Measured against pleasure of such a high order, any summertime gardening
programme has to offer its audience something quite special. At least, it
must do if it is to lure the keen, critically-minded gardener indoors. There
are, of course, plenty of couch-potato viewers who switch to gardening
simply because it offers pretty colours and a soothing break from the sweaty
exertions of the Olympics.
I have been inspecting this summer's crop of horticultural programmes, and
find it extremely mixed. One hardy perennial has been with us for almost 20
years and yet I had never watched it before. Gardener's World (BBC 2,
Friday) is magnificent. Presented by Geoffrey Hamilton and Liz Rigby, it is
completely straight, without any of the tiresome gimmickry programme-makers
so often use to jazz up what they imagine might otherwise be tediously or
frighteningly technical.
Expert talks to expert and to us in a natural, unforced way. The audience is
a large one, fluctuating between 3m and more than over 4m, and the
assumption is that it consists of keen gardeners who thirst to do it better.
Far from being fazed by Latin names, they will have pen and paper poised to
note down Papaver nudicaule 'Constance Finnis' as it is flashed on to the
screen. Where do you find this delectable poppy? Geoff airily refers viewers
to their copies of The Plant Finder, the gazetteer of plants and specialist
nurseries which has become something like a badge of the serious-minded
gardener.
You would have to be a very good gardener indeed not to pick up something
from most episodes of Gardener's World - even if it is only quibbling with
Adrian Bloom's choice of plants which look well grown beside hostas. Good
taste, and not just know-how, is part of the Gardener's World philosophy.
Over its long run, this programme must surely have had a considerable impact
on standards of gardening.
Quite stiff competition on Channel 4 comes from The Garden Club, a relative
newcomer which will be starting a new run on August 28. Some 3m watched it
last year, and there is an actual club with 8,000 members and a newsletter.
Principal presenter is Roy Lancaster, the distinguished horticulturalist and
plant-collector, and each programme takes one region and focuses on a
selection of club-members' gardens - problematic gardens, perhaps, needing a
spot of advice from Roy, but well and interestingly gardened all the same.
The format works beautifully because, as every gardener knows, people love
to chat about what they grow. 'My garden means everything to me', confessed
one lady in a windswept Shropshire garden which was not my taste at all but
was thoroughly admirable in its own way. Compared with Gardener's World,
this more democratic format is more likely to unearth gardeners with
idiosyncratic ideas, in particular splendid money-saving dodges dreamed up
by cost-conscious OAPs.
The two-parter, Le Manoir (C4), has to be one of the most fatuous programmes
of the year. Recession has clobbered garden designers - and not before time
given how perfectly awful your run-of-the-mill designer is. So garden
designer Alan Mason must have been unable to believe his luck when someone
decided it was worth making a film of how he 'created an English garden' at
the medieval manor-house plus eight acre garden he bought in Brittany for
Pounds 100,0000.
Six months was all it took to create what Alan intended as a shop-window for
his talents, the French having recently developed quite a taste for le
jardin Anglais. But the problem was, Alan's garden looked so utterly dismal
at the end of this period that one cannot imagine any self-respecting French
gardener would cross the road to visit it, except perhaps to jeer.
Of course, the idea was misconceived. No garden created from scratch looks
like much inside four years, two if you really go for broke with big shrubs
and trees. Alan's trusty student helpers had created the bare bones, with a
vast lawn and a lake with bubbling ooze and a large population of frogs.
Some nasty colour combinations - lavateras, geums, and red potentillas -
showed Alan had achieved instant colour only at the expense of colour sense.
Presumably whoever had this bright idea was no gardener, and was dismayed by
the highly unphotogenic result. Why else did programme two shift tack so
abruptly, turning into a glorified Breton estate-agent's advertisement to
lure ever more garden-designers and restaurateurs to expatriate while there
are still barns, railway-stations and schoolrooms crying out to be
chintzified - and given English gardens?
However, garden making on TV can be quite interesting, given a spectacular
garden and a sensible time-frame. The World in a Garden (C4, Wednesday), is
a four-part series recording the National Trust's expensive restoration
programme at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire.
The most monstrous, astonishing mid-Victorian garden to have survived,
Biddulph Grange is a fascinating place. Roy Lancaster does a typically good
job of presenting the different aspects of this project, historical,
botanical, and horticultural. Now and then there is tricksy camera work and
the music is absurd. One of the better moments showed the trust's advisers
(oddly, everyone involved in the project is male) locked in heated argument
over which 'authentic' colour to paint the pagoda. I always suspected the
business of analysing paint-scrapes was bogus.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: Coppelia - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE LOVE Coppelia for the marvel of Delibes' score; for the sweetness of the
pastoral world it evokes; for a cunning mixture of classic solos with
dashing folk dance; above all, for a sense of happy rightness - as in the
best folk tales - to its story. And, whatever else may change, Coppelia
proposes certain rules of dance behaviour that have a joyous certainty. Some
ballet companies ignore it - to their own, and their audiences' loss. Some
ballerinas look down on it, as not offering sufficient challenge to whatever
gifts they may believe they possess.
Wise artists, great artists - like the glorious Alexandra Danilova - have
known that Swanilda is a marvellous role, as rewarding as it is taxing in
style and step. We love Coppelia , too, because of its mysteries. Under its
lightness and peasant merriment, something serious is happening. Indeed, two
very serious themes are the armature of its action: we see a girl and a boy
learning about true love and learning to love each other; and we see real
tragedy in the failure of Coppelius' wild alchemical dreams of creating
life.
English National Ballet is playing Coppelia this week on the South Bank.
Ronald Hynd, as producer, has loved the ballet from his schooldays. Like
him, I fell under the spell of Pamela May, that most adorable and elegant
Swanilda, and of Fonteyn, then of Nerina and Beriosova, and of Annette Page
and Maryon Lane, and how many other apprentice ballerinas whose debuts were
at one time so delightful a feature of Saturday matinees.
Hynd's staging is rooted in our best Coppelia, and therein is its security.
Yet I do not think that ENB's cast on Monday night were as convinced as I
was of the importance of the task on hand. The national dances lacked brio,
and for anyone reared on the score as it sounded when Constant Lambert used
to treasure every phrase, and spark every rhythm into life, the orchestral
peformance was sober-sided. Renata Calderini was a Swanilda more
conscientious than witty, but Jose Manuel Carreno has the charm - and the
luscious physical prowess - that are exactly right for Frantz. I liked, too,
Philippa Arrona's Coppelius, who may dodder, but whose sincerity as the
supposed doll comes to life was as genuinely moving as Delibes' score at
this most touching moment in the ballet.
* * * There is an exhibition on the South Bank which ballet-lovers should
not miss. Leslie Hurry's designs for Robert Helpmann's 1942 Hamlet remain
among the greatest decorations ever made for ballet in this country. All the
costume designs - thrilling in their imaginative intensity as in their
command of detail - are on view in the Olivier foyer of the Royal National
Theatre until September 6. The vivid life of the ballet, as of Hurry's
astonishing sensibility to its drama, blazes with undiminished force. It is
a tremendous display of design mastery - and was Hurry's first commission
for the theatre.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: The Mother Tongue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE geography of London theatre, there is an outer triangle of Richmond,
Islington and Greenwich, visits to any of which seldom let you down
completely. In a decentralised London, these are the places where the best
theatre would lie, and sometimes does. But we are not quite there yet, as
the new production at Greenwich shows.
The Mother Tongue is written by Alan Franks, a journalist on The Times who
already has several plays beneath his belt and whose rating is high enough
to have secured Prunella Scales for the main part. For about an hour one was
inclined to give the piece the benefit of the doubt, and not only because of
the slightly scatty and utterly characteristic performance by Ms Scales.
Franks has a good theme: the relationship between a mother who thinks she
knows best and a daughter who thinks that she knows better, yet can never
get her mother out of her hair. There are other family skeletons in the
cupboard, and the bedroom.
The play starts as comedy. Here is that affectation of modern youth - never
speaking properly if it is possible to avoid it. Ms Scales, as mother and
grandmother, speaks immaculately, as she always does: 'tea, scones' and what
sounds like 'sex', but turns out be 'secs' for second helpings. Of the trend
to let it all hang out, she observes: 'Once it has all come out, it can be
so very, very difficult to put it back again.' The first half of The Mother
Tongue is rather a witty play about the changing use of language.
The second half is darker and full of recriminations. The family has a
history of steaming open each other's letters. There has been infidelity and
kinkiness all round. As a child, daughter Harriet looked through the keyhole
at her mother's performance in the bedroom. The widowed mother may have
burned her own house in Kensington to collect the insurance money, only to
find that the policy had not been renewed. In the end, there is no
reconciliation between mother and daughter.
It is a pity that such a promising start should degenerate into such
melodrama. The play contains lots of good lines and social observation, but
becomes stuck between stage comedy and television soap. Gwen Taylor begins
as an excellent Harriet, yet is hardly allowed to develop as a character.
The rest of the cast, through no fault of their own, are pretty well
stooges. There is a very detailed set, designed by Simon Higlett, of the
house where Harriet lives, but its function is more to fill up the stage
than to add to the play.
In short, this is not quite the tops, but it is useful to have Greenwich to
try it out and to draw such a cast. It is worth seeing, but not crossing
London for. Direction is by Richard Cottrell.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Sun, sea and sewage - Michael
Skapinker reports on a Majorcan plan to reap the benefits of mass tourism
without sacrificing the island's natural beauty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In choppy seas off the south-east coast of Majorca, our captain, Juan Diaz,
spots our catch.
Floating half-submerged is a plastic shopping bag, filled with rubbish and
tied by the handles. Our small craft, one of 10 operated by the Majorcan
island council, slowly circles the offending object while Juame Ferrer, the
second crew member, scoops it out with his black fishing net.
Judging by the day's haul - two refuse bags filled with mineral water
containers, wine bottles and bits of plastic - clearing the sea of rubbish
is a labour-intensive business. But this marine litter patrol, which
operates throughout the summer, is only one of a slew of Majorcan
initiatives aimed at demonstrating that mass tourism and environmental
protection are not contradictory objectives.
Majorca's environmental projects have attracted the interest of the
International Federation of Tour Operators (IFTO) which believes the Spanish
island is developing expertise which could be put to work in resorts
throughout the world.
The European Community is poised to give Majorca the financial backing to
pull its various initiatives into a coherent framework which could be
applied wherever airlines disgorge their sun or snow-seeking charges.
Majorca, which attracts 5m visitors a year, is ideally placed to teach the
rest of the world about the benefits and drawbacks of mass tourism, if only
because it has experienced such a surfeit of both.
Its tourist industry, which is more than 30 years old, has brought the
islanders a standard of living that their poverty-stricken forebears could
only have achieved by emigrating - something they once did in large numbers.
For the drawbacks, one has only to listen to local politicians describing
the long struggle to restore the good name of the Majorcan seaside town of
Magaluf after years of the luridly-reported antics of young, impecunious
lager louts.
That Majorca needs tourists is something no one on the island doubts, not
even the local environmental activists who criticise the island's projects
as too timid to overcome decades of uncontrolled development.
Eduardo Gamero is director general of tourism for the Balearics, made up of
Majorca and the neighbouring, smaller islands of Minorca, Ibiza and
Formentera. Born in the Majorcan capital of Palma 50 years ago, Gamero has
fond memories of the days before the tourists came.
'I remember tramways, a city where everyone knew everyone else and where you
could leave your key in the front door. We lost that with the tourist
development. Can you leave your key in your front door in Palma today?
Absolutely not.'
In the early 1950s, the populations of Palma and of Majorca were shrinking.
The capital had a population of 150,000 and the island was home to 300,000
people. Today, the island has a population of 500,000, of whom 320,000 live
in Palma, a sprawling, bustling, but not unattractive city dominated by a
cathedral. The island, away from the main tourist towns, boasts mountains,
coastline and hilltop villages to compare with anything Europe has to offer.
The islanders are among the richest people in Spain.
Tourism has brought them their wealth and nothing else could sustain it,
Gamero says. The island's agriculture is too small and fragmented to feed
the local population. Almost all Majorca's food is imported. As for other
non-tourist options, Gamero says that 'it would be crazy to think that an
island like Majorca could establish heavy industry. We live on tourism. Our
only possible future is tourism.' The question for the island is what sort
of tourism? Not, all sides agree, the low-cost package tourism that has been
and, to a large extent still is, the island's speciality.
First, because Majorca finds it increasingly difficult to compete on price
against resorts in countries like Turkey. And second because young
alcohol-sodden tourists drive away the respectable families who spend more
money and do not rip out newly-planted trees. As Majorca has found, however,
an island that plays host to the London Pub, the Mucky Duck and Lineker's
Bar finds it difficult to move up-market.
All three establishments are in Magaluf, which comes under the jurisdiction
of the socialist-controlled Calvia town council, where Antonio Pallicer
serves as councillor for tourism and security.
Magaluf's nadir, he says, was the mid-to-late 1980s, when summer trouble in
the streets was at its height. 'Our customers were of the lowest sort.
Magaluf had become vulgar. We started to think, to analyse. What could we do
to change the image of this resort?'
Part of the answer was to change the environment in the hope that tourists'
behaviour would show a corresponding improvement, allowing family visitors
to return. The first problem was that tourists could wander through Magaluf
without being aware of the sea. Wide, paved pedestrian paths were built,
making the sea visible from central parts of the town. The council has also
built a sea-front promenade, lined with 450 fully-grown palm trees imported
from Egypt.
The roads have been narrowed to discourage traffic from coming into the town
and the pavements have been widened. Large concrete balls have been fixed to
the pavements to stop cars from parking there. There are fountains, an
air-conditioned first-aid post on the beach and new litter bins everywhere.
The project has cost Pta 1.4bn (Pounds 7.7m), paid for by the central
government in Madrid, the Balearic islands administration and local taxes.
Has it all worked? 'Has people's behaviour improved?' Pallicer asks. 'I have
to be honest. Not as much as I hoped.' In the local bars, they are more
sanguine. The Royal Plaza, formerly the Britannia, has matched the public
expenditure with investments of its own, producing a plush pink interior.
Paco Heredia, a barman there for 10 years, believes Magaluf is improving.
'But it will take time,' he says.
The conservative-controlled Balearic islands government has acted to limit
development on Majorca to ensure that it does not lose its remaining natural
attractions. A law passed last year declared 31 per cent of the island
protected zones, restricting the building of new tourist facilities. Gamero
calls it 'the most protectionist law in Europe'.
All of this is very interesting, says Miguel Angel March, but much of the
damage has already been done. Angel is secretary of the Grupo de Ornitologia
Balear (GOB), founded in 1973 to protect local bird life and now an
organisation which campaigns on environmental issues of all sorts.
As important as tourism is, he says, it is dangerous to depend on only one
industry. Agriculture should not be dismissed out of hand, he argues, when
the island has a summer market of more than 5m people.
The GOB has a surprising supporter in Alfred Koch, recently retired director
of Munich University's tourism institute and now a consultant. He too
believes the island should find other ways of making a living, in addition
to its main industry of tourism.
Koch heads a team which will take Majorca's projects a step further. IFTO
has asked the Munich team to interview tourists and local people to assess
their views of the island's tourism and its effect on the environment.
IFTO has been told that the EC is prepared to support Majorca's environment
projects with a grant of Ecu450,000 (Pounds 320,000) although it has yet to
receive written confirmation. IFTO plans to use the experience gained in
Majorca to upgrade the tourist industry on the Greek island of Rhodes and in
Ireland.
Koch is impressed with what Majorca has done so far, but his long experience
of the industry has instilled a certain caution when it comes to attracting
higher-spending tourists to a resort and persuading more of them to come out
of the high season. 'When I started in tourism 40 years ago,' he says, 'I
was warned that I would work on these problems until I had moss on my back.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / People: Woodhead's homecoming to FOX
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London FOX, the troubled commodity futures and options exchange, is taking
on Robin Woodhead (right) as its new chief executive from October, in
succession to Phillip Thorpe, deputy chief executive of the Securities &amp;
Futures Association, who had been running the market in a caretaker role
since last October.
Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe and chairman of FOX since June,
says he is pleased with the quality of candidates applying for the post
'bearing in mind it is not the easiest market to develop'.
FOX was hit by scandal last year, which cost the jobs of both the then
chairman and chief executive, Saxon Tate and Mark Blundell. It has also
struggled for years to establish credible markets even in its core soft
commodities products such as sugar and coffee.
The appointment is something of a homecoming for Woodhead, 42, who played a
central role in setting up London's oil futures market, the International
Petroleum Exchange, from 1980. He was chairman for IPE's first four years,
during which time he was also managing director of Premier Man, a joint
venture between Premier Consolidated and ED&amp;F Man. In the early days the IPE
used the facilities of FOX's precursor, the London Commodity Exchange and so
Woodhead has worked with a number of staff, some in key positions, who are
still at FOX.
He then went on to form the National Investment Group, a network of regional
stock brokers, which was sold four years later to Capel-Cure Myers Capital
Management. A lawyer who spent part of his childhood in Rhodesia, Woodhead
has recently been a consultant for Swiss Bank Corporation on southern
Africa.
Jenkins, who retires later this year from Liffe after presiding over its
first highly successful decade, says that enthusiasm and open-mindedness
were two of the prime qualities he had been looking for and found in
Woodhead. The latter was yesterday in South Africa and unavailable to
comment on his plans to revive FOX.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Management: Incentive for bosses to rally around the
standard - Lisa Wood explains why managers are finding it valuable to opt
for vocational qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention the initials MCI to most UK managers and you are likely to get a
blank response. At best they will think you are talking about a US
telecommunications company. Yet 130 civil servants at the Driver &amp; Vehicle
Licensing Agency know better. They are using new management standards set by
the Management Charter Initiative in their annual appraisals.
Formally launched in July 1988 to boost management training, the non-profit
and part-government funded MCI has been dismissed by critics as little more
than a talking shop. But now, three years on, it is starting to be able to
point to some tangible achievements.
'Things are starting to take off now that we have something to promote
actively,' says Andrew Summers, the new chief executive of the MCI and a
former managing director of RHM Foods, a Ranks Hovis McDougall subsidiary.
'We have a 10-point code of practice, to which more than 1,300 companies
have signed up.'
The code of practice was a worthy document with signatories agreeing to a
host of good practices such as providing access to training and a framework
for self-development.
However there was no mechanism to judge whether the companies were
implementing the code. By contrast, the new middle-management standards  -
based on the best practice among a sample of 4,000 UK managers - offer
practical training guidelines.
Along with two other standards for first line managers and supervisors, they
have been linked to National Vocational Qualifications. These are are
competence-based qualifications, which themselves are only starting to get
off the ground.
NVQs span a wide span of achievement - from basic competence to the
vocational equivalent of a post graduate degree. The stiffest resistance to
NVQs has come from the professions who resist competence-based
qualifications.
Summers says that one of the attractions of the MCI standards for many
managers is that previous experience and learning can be taken into account
when a person's competence to do a job is judged.
He estimates that it costs between Pounds 800 and Pounds 1,500 for each
individual to be accredited for the middle-management standards.
This excludes the cost a company would incur in training a manager over a
period of years but includes workshops and advice. A minimum time to obtain
accreditation would be about three months with an average time being about
12 months.
It is a considerable investment for an individual - or an employer - to
make. Summers says that employers rarely say that cost is an important
reason for not training their employees.
More significant, according to survey results, is the time that training
takes, with smaller companies in particular finding it difficult to release
individuals from their workplace. NVQs, says Summers, ease this problem as
almost all the assessment process is done at work.
Some 76 'centres', including training companies and colleges, now have
trained assessors who can accredit the new qualifications.
A survey, published by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy and management
consultancy last week showed some 20 per cent of the large companies polled
in May believed the MCI had encouraged the company's human resource
development. Not bad considering that the survey was done around the time
the new standards were unveiled.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Barcelona ripple signals love-in -
Fans in the main stadium make no distinctions for race, sex or talent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS better than the tedious Mexican wave. It is the Barcelona ripple. When
the runners circle the Montjuic track, the crowd applaud as they pass. The
athletes' progress is marked by the patter of 120,000 hands rising to a warm
crescendo in the final straight.
If there is a Spaniard running, the ripple builds to a roar; if it is a
Catalan, the stadium goes crazy. The knots of supporters from other nations
(notably Japanese, American and British) are a little raucous in support of
their boys and girls. Otherwise, this is an equal-opportunity love in: no
distinction for race, sex or athletic ability.
The fans seem to enjoy all the events. They applaud each toss by the hammer
throwers and set up rhythmic applause for every triple jumper. They
sympathetically lament each no-throw and foul jump. Sometimes, there is even
a spontaeneous round of applause for no apparent reason.
Today, when the athletics resumes after a one-day break, there should be
plenty of rippling. It is the first day of the decathlon, and there will
also be finals in both men's and women's 400 metres, the men's 800m, the
women's 400m hurdles and the men's discus.
At a reunion of decathletes yesterday, the experts thought Dave Johnson of
the US would be given a fight. Daley Thompson said Robert Zmelik of
Czechoslovakia and Mike Smith of Canada would run Johnson close, though
Johnson was particularly strong in the second-day events.
One of the most striking things about the reunion was the physical diversity
of decathletes. There was the sheer bulk of Bob Matthias (Olympic gold in
'48 and '52) and Jurgen Hingsen (silver in '84). There were the tall, but
surprisingly skinny, Bill Toomey (gold: '68) and Bruce Jenner (gold: '76).
Thompson seemed almost petite.
Afterwards, Frank Zarnowski, a broadcaster with NBC, said that the decathlon
was the only event 'in which the world record had been held by a red man
(Jim Thorpe), a yellow man (Yang Chuan-Kwang), a black man and a white man.'
If you are sprawling at home on your sofa, a Barcelona ripple or a Mexican
wave is not much fun. So here is another game all the fans at Montjuic are
playing. You can join in. It is called Spot the Druggie.
This is a murky world. Gwen Torrence, the US sprinter, has released a
statement clarifying remarks she reportedly made after finishing out of the
medals in the 100m final. She had not said Juliet Cuthbert of Jamaica, the
silver medalist, had taken drugs, she insisted.
Torrence said: 'I told Cuthbert I did not think she was taking drugs. I did
tell her there were three people in the final who were competing unfairly,
but I will not say names.'
How could she tell?
Assuming that her rivals were not shooting-up in the dressing room, Torrence
would have to go by the same clues apparent to any TV viewer.
Today, the female sprinters are back in action in the 200m semi-finals, so
here are the things to notice:
Listen for unusually deep voices; keep an ear cocked for women who give
press conferences that sound like Louis Armstrong concerts. One visible
side-effect of growth hormones is growth of the chin and, some say, of the
nose. Steroids cause facial hair, acne and large, bulging muscles whose
definition is increased by an almost complete absence of body fat.
In women's sprinting, then, celulite round the thighs is a thing of beauty.

Britain's John Whitaker on Milton (right) clears a jump in the first round

The Yorkshireman guided his charismatic 14-year-old grey to a clear round

a foot in the water jump.
Nick Skelton, on Dollar Girl, was poised for a clear round approaching the
last fence on the testing Real Club de Polo course. But the 12-year-old mare
refused twice, so Skelton was eliminated from the first round. Then Tim
Grubb, on Denizen, steadied the ship with 8.7 faults. Whitaker's brother
Michael on Monsanta then
recorded just four faults before Milton's clear round. For all their
efforts, however, Britain could still only finish in a disappointing seventh
place. Holland took the gold with 12 faults, Austria collected silver with
16.75 and France the bronze with 24.75.

Kenya's track and field squad may pull out of the Games if the controversial
reinstatement of Moroccan runner Khalid Skah as men's 10,000 metres gold
medallist is not overturned.
Kenyan chef de mission Isaiah Kiplagat protested to International Amateur
Athletic Federation president Primo Nebiolo after Skah was first
disqualified in favour of Kenya's Richard Chelimo, then reinstated on
appeal.
Asked if Kenya would boycott the rest of the athletics events if they did
not get satisfaction, Kiplagat said: 'If we feel that we're not getting a
fair judgment the possibility would be there, but we're not saying that at
the moment.'
A Kenyan official said the team might boycott races from 800m up. However,
the team's assistant general manager, Aish Jeneby, later indicated that
there might not be a boycott. 'We Kenyans are fighters. When we lose in one
event, we regroup ..You watch us tomorrow,' he said.

FT  05 AUG 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Aussie hockey stars in sight of gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S men hockey players laid a ghost when they knocked Britain out of
the Olympic tournament. Both at the Los Angeles and Seoul Games, the Aussies
were gold medal favourites - and went home with nothing. Thumping the Old
Enemy 6-0 to secure a semi-final place against the Netherlands has given the
Australians an enormous boost.
If the Dutch can be seen off tonight, as form suggests, then the most likely
final is between Australia and Germany. At Karachi in February, the German
team convincingly won the Champions' Trophy to add to their current European
title.
Set-piece moves, methodical and well-rehearsed, are at the heart of German
success. Their remarkable forward Carsten Fischer lies third in the
Barcelona scorers' table with six goals, all from penalties or penalty
corners. Fischer's shaven head - a side-effect of drugs taken to combat
diabetes - and industrial build lend him dominance in front of any
goalmouth.
Yet directly below him in the table lie Australia's two most prolific
forwards, Stephen Davies and Jay Stacey, with seven of their aggregate 10
scores from field goals.
German coach Paul Lissek has been working out the containment policy which
would be necessary to end his country's 20 years without Olympic gold.
Australian coach Frank Murray believes that his young team may be finding
the key to turning their undoubted ability into victories. 'It's a
confidence thing,' he said. 'They are just beginning to feel relaxed and,
when you're young and inexperienced, that's the only way to play well. I've
been thrilled at our attack but don't forget that we've only conceded two
goals in the qualifying rounds.'
Lissek faces a special psychological hurdle in taking his German team past
Pakistan, first, and then Australia, to a gold medal. In 1990 the team
passed a vote of no-confidence in Klaus Kleiter, a mentor who had led them
for many years but with the biggest successes always elusive. Lissek played
50 times for his country.
If Germany play and win in their traditional style, that will raise once
more the tempo of hockey's internal debate about the influence of the
penalty corner on a game that relies for its attractiveness on the sheer
speed of play up and down the pitch.
'You have to be efficient at penalty corners but they're not the be-all and
end-all. It bothers people when they dominate a team's results,' said Ian
Taylor, former British international and now a BBC commentator.
Defeat by Australia marked the end of a glowing era for men's hockey in
Britain. Sean Kerly was both its herald and pallbearer. He announced after
the match that his career was effectively over.
'This is the end. I don't see myself playing any more international hockey,'
he said after his third Games. Kerly's seven goals in Los Angeles and eight
in Seoul were the keystones in Britain's silver and gold medal performances.
Perhaps more important, his panache and good looks gave the game a massive
publicity boost and young male players a role model.
In the 12 months after the team's return from Korea, even routine club
hockey matches in the south of England would find hundreds of spectators on
the touchline, rather than dozens.
If Kerly were playing, numbers could be in the thousands, virtually
overwhelming small clubs. The boom couldn't and didn't last, but it threw a
welcome spotlight on a sport that has always felt, with some justification,
that in Britain its skill, speed and integrity were too often overlooked.
'Olympic success has meant a massive amount in terms of sponsorship
visibility and, more importantly, young players being attracted into the
game,' said coach Norman Hughes in valedictory mood.
Britain's hopes of a second successive hockey title were destroyed when the
women's team lost their semi-final yesterday against the favourites Germany.
Britain can still win the bronze

FT  05 AUG 92 / Food label changes proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced plans for tighter rules on food labelling
to require more information to be given to consumers and to curb misleading
claims by manufacturers.
However, Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, said implementation of most
of the planned changes would depend on negotiations in Brussels, where the
European Community is considering legislation on food labelling.
The measures were broadly welcomed by the Food and Drink Federation, the
main industry body, and by the Consumers' Association, which called them 'a
great leap forward'.
The proposed changes were recommended by the Food Advisory Committee,
ap-pointed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Among the
recommendations are:
Labels should carry descriptions of food products, as well as 'customary'
names. Meaningless descriptions should be banned.
More information should be given about perishable foods and about the
temperatures at which they should be stored.
Information about food additives and ingredients should be presented more
clearly, with uniform rules for the display of information required by law.
The government rejected a recommendation that health claims should be banned
unless they were backed by the government's chief medical officer.

FT  05 AUG 92 / View that became a valuer's nightmare: Fears for the future
of a derelict London landmark have resurrected a controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, RICHARD DONKIN and JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running controversy over Battersea Power Station on the south bank
of the River Thames in London - semi-derelict since redevelopment work to
turn it into a leisure complex was halted two years ago due to lack of funds
 -looks set to be refuelled.
English Heritage, the government-funded conservation body, has written to Mr
John Broome, the property developer who owns the listed building,
recommending that urgent repair work be carried out to prevent its
deterioration.
It has also asked Mr Broome what his plans are for putting the future of the
power station, one of London's most famous architectural landmarks, on a
firmer financial footing.
The move by English Heritage follows the publication last month of a report
by the National Audit Office, the watchdog on government spending, warning
that many listed buildings are at risk because of lack of reliable
information and slack financial monitoring.
Mr Broome has shunned personal contacts with the media since his plans to
develop a leisure complex on the Battersea site - which was to have been
opened by the then prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher in May 1990 - came
to nothing.
Mr David Cooper, of solicitors Gouldens, said on behalf of Mr Broome that
the foundations of the power station 'are stronger than ever' and that he
was confident about negotiations to revive plans for the leisure complex. He
said that Battersea Leisure, which owns the site, had talked with Abela
Holdings, a Lebanese-owned in-flight catering group. Abela has denied that
it has been involved in talks about the power station.
A growing list of potential partners has shunned Mr Broome's approaches.
Mr Cooper said last March that Mr Broome was negotiating a Pounds 60m deal
with a Japanese consortium but nothing came of the talks, and bankers
connected with the Battersea project are sceptical that it had any serious
chance of success.
Earlier approaches to property developer Mr John Bloomfield and to Parc
Securities, part of Mr Werner Rey's Swiss-based Omni Holding Empire, also
failed to meet the expectation of success generated by the Broome camp.
The approaches were made after Mr Broome had been ordered by his creditors
to halt work on the project because by 1989 costs had soared by an
unbudgeted Pounds 60m to Pounds 230m.
Bank of America, Mr Broome's main lender since it took over Security Pacific
National Bank last August, has refused to comment on the Battersea project,
insisting that its finances were protected by 'client confidentiality'.
It is understood that the Battersea portfolio is being overseen in a special
department of the London offices of the bank which deals with loans which
are on a critical list, in default, or in a 'special care' category.
Although Mr Broome realised Pounds 60m from the sale of the Alton Towers
leisure complex to Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, his finances are
still stretched.
Mr Broome's company, Battersea Group, formerly Alton Towers, spent Pounds
18m on the acquisition of 85 per cent of the Battersea site in 1987. This
figure includes the cost of foundation work and clearing the site of
asbestos. At the peak of the property boom in 1988, when it bought the
remaining 15 per cent, Battersea Leisure, the subsidiary which owns the
site, was valued at no less than Pounds 110m.
Yet Battersea Leisure had a deficiency of net tangible assets at the time of
more than Pounds 300,000. The difference between minus Pounds 300,000 and
plus Pounds 110m represented hope value - the amount the project might be
worth on the assumption that it would succeed.
When Battersea Leisure last filed accounts - for the year to November 30,
1990 - its tangible assets, chiefly of land and buildings on the old power
station site, had risen to Pounds 90.4m in the balance sheet. But Pounds
28.6m of this figure consisted of capitalised interest owed to the banks. A
further Pounds 7.1m represented project management fees and other
expenditure charged to the company by fellow subsidiaries in Mr Broome's
property and leisure group.
The assets were financed by a bank loan of Pounds 47.1m secured by charges
in favour of Security Pacific National Bank, now owned by Bank of America;
trade credit of Pounds 15.2m, thought to come largely from Sir Robert
McAlpine, much of which is secured on a second charge; and Pounds 20.3m of
borrowings from other companies owned by Mr Broome.
The auditor's report, signed by Touche Ross on April 24, 1991, emphasised
that the figures in the accounts were struck on a going-concern basis. This
assumed that the company was able to find finance to repay bank borrowings
and to complete the Battersea project. Outside estimates have put the
ultimate cost of the scheme at anything up to Pounds 300m.
In the absence of more finance or potential buyers, the site is a valuer's
nightmare. In the depressed London market, where development property has
been particularly badly hit, most of its value could have been wiped out,
leaving the banks and other creditors with very little to cover their
outstanding advances of loans and credit. There are also potentially onerous
liabilities relating to the upkeep of the land and buildings.
An unusual feature of the saga is that Mr Broome originally bought 15 per
cent of Battersea personally for his own account in 1987, at the same time
that his Alton Towers company bought its 85 per cent. He then sold this
minority stake at a vastly increased price of Pounds 16.5m in 1988 to Alton
Towers. Some Pounds 11m of the proceeds were paid to Mr Broome in the form
of shares in Alton Towers, while he was paid the remaining Pounds 5.5m in
cash.
Today the shares are almost certainly worthless. But unless the banks
extracted personal guarantees for their loans to his business empire, Mr
Broome will have extracted an impressive Pounds 5.5m of cash proceeds from a
development that continues to scar the London landscape and which may never
be completed.
Mr Cooper said that any cash left over from the sale went on tax
liabilities.
He said: 'John Broome did the 'right thing' by putting the proceeds of his
Alton Towers sale into the Battersea project. For that he ought to be patted
on the back or else called a complete idiot, because he could have run off
with the money. I think probably the reason he did was because he wanted a
knighthood at the end of the day.'
The knighthood has eluded Mr Broome, in spite of his being declared a man of
'enterprise and vision' in June 1988 by Mrs Thatcher as she fired a laser
gun at the official launch of work on the leisure complex project.
Instead, there appears to be growing embarrassment in the Conservative party
about the way the issue has been handled and the extent to which it could
damage Tory-controlled Wandsworth Council's image as a prudent local
authority.
The council had budgeted on making Pounds 1m in building fees from the
leisure scheme development project in the period 1988-91. Instead it was
forced last month to threaten Mr Broome with legal action to recover just
over Pounds 170,000 owed for building control and inspection work at the
site.
As one Tory councillor put it: 'The most important change for Mr Broome is
the willingness of the council to indulge him has gone.'
The official position of the council is that its role in the whole issue has
simply been that of a planning authority, granting Mr Broome building
permission and charging him fees for it.
In spite of the damaging impact on the landscape of the development, Mr Guy
Senior, chairman of the authority's planning committee, said: 'It has not
been our responsibility to know what the state of Mr Broome's finances are
or were.'
Bankers say they know the state of Mr Broome's finances only too well. Their
problem, however, is twofold: the Battersea site is probably now worth less
than the money they are owed, and even if they became owners of the power
station site it would be difficult to know what to do with it.

If ministers choose a private-sector bid Strangeways will become Britain's
first old-established prison to be run by the private sector.
Strangeways is undergoing extensive refurbishment after damage caused by the
rioting two years ago, and bids for its management will be invited in the
autumn. Securicor, the security services group, said yesterday that it was
likely to be among those interested in bidding.
Ministers stressed yesterday, however, that the decision to involve the
private sector did not mean they had excluded the possibility of the public
prisons department making the winning bid.
Mr Peter Lloyd, minister responsible for prisons, spoke on BBC Radio
yesterday of the public service's 'huge reserves of skill, expertise and
dedication' but said these qualities had not been brought together in the
running of the prison service as effectively as the government would like.
Britain's first privately managed prison, the Wolds remand establishment on
Humberside, opened earlier this year. Blakenhurst in Hereford and Worcester,
another new development, will open under private management later this year
and will be the first to take convicted prisoners.
Ministers are anxious to modernise prison management and challenge the power
of the Prison Officers' Association. They see the introduction of
private-sector man-agement as a means of doing both.
The government believes that, provided the state sets and monitors
standards, there are no ethical objections to private prisons. Penal-reform
groups, however, say that profit considerations should not be involved in
depriving people of their liberty.
Mr Brian Caton, vice-chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said he
feared that the decision to invite private-sector bids to manage Strangeways
would be repeated at other types of prison. 'We will not stand by and watch
an immoral practice continue without some kind of action,' he said.
Publication today of a severely critical report following the death of a
patient at Ashworth high security hospital, Merseyside, is expected to lead
to a government review of high-security hospitals.
Even before publication of the report of an inquiry led by Sir Louis
Blom-Cooper, chairman of the Mental Health Act Commission, mental health
organisations have started calling for the closure of Ashworth and the other
large high-security special hospitals at Broadmoor, Berkshire and Rampton,
Nottinghamshire.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said yesterday that 'all the
indications point to a scandal of staggering proportions' involving
rottenness and cruelty. The government had to respond to the report with
immediate action.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Move on Scottish water criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSULTANTS have been appointed to look at the future of the Scottish water
industry, including the possibility of privatisation, the government
confirmed yesterday.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, said in appointing Edinburgh-based
consultants Quayle Munro: 'I have not yet decided on the future structure of
these services but I want the consumer to get the best possible water at the
lowest possible cost.'
The announcement, which followed weeks of speculation, drew sharp criticism
from opposition MPs, who have targeted it as one of this autumn's political
battlegrounds. Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'This marks
the start in earnest of the war against the tap tax. We are totally opposed
to plans to privatise water.'
Water and sewage in Scotland are currently managed by the regional councils,
whose own future is uncertain pending the government's plans for reform of
local government.
Mr Lang said yesterday 'high and increasing levels of investment' in
Scottish water supply would be necessary to bring it up to European
Community standards, but added that Scottish water bills were likely 'to
rise significantly in future years as investment continues to meet the new
standards'. The average household bill for water and sewerage in Scotland is
about Pounds 108.
Scottish water services will invest about Pounds 221m in 1992-93, about 30
per cent more than last year. They plan to spend a further Pounds 482m in
the following two years.
Water customers in England and Wales have already seen steep increases in
their bills because of their water companies' commitment to spend Pounds
28bn by the end of the decade.
Mr Clarke said: 'The English experience is a stark reminder of what lies
ahead - charges have risen by up to 50 per cent.'
Quayle Munro will report by early autumn to the Scottish Office, which will
then issue a consultation paper calling for public comments. A consultation
paper on the future of local government will also be published about then.
The Scottish Office said last night the consultants had been asked to
consider several structures for the industry 'on the assumption that the
structure of local government will change'.
The Scottish Trade Union Congress yesterday pledged to fight privatisation
proposals, 'tooth and nail'.

Trust Liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, DAVID OWEN and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR WALLACE Duncan Smith
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Duncan to his friends -
is described as a friendly family man and his business acquaintances say he
has firm political views.
Mr Smith, from western Canada, is well known among the Bruges Group of
anti-European federalists who number Lady Thatcher, the former prime
minister, among their supporters.
Lord Harris of High Cross, a former chairman of the Bruges Group, said
yesterday that Mr Smith was in no sense high-living.
'He struck me as an extremely gentle, extremely decent and straightforward
man,' he said.
He added: 'He was extremely interested in the whole idea of the market
economy. He has taken an alert and scholarly interest in economic argument.
He is a student of these things in a quiet way.'
Mr Smith is known to have paid the rent on the Bruges Group's one-room
office in Jermyn Street, central London for nearly two years, and to have
made the same level of contribution to its bigger rent bill after the group
moved to Whitehall.
According to an individual familiar with the Bruges Group Mr Smith
contributed 'a small percentage' of the ongoing cost of the group's
campaigning without taking a public role in its affairs.
Like other contributors, he took no part in the group's internal
decision-making process.
Outside politics, however, Mr Smith was recognised as a dealer in trade
finance. During the 1960s he joined Nesbitt Thompson, a Canadian broking
firm and was sent to London about 20 years ago to set up a money market and
Euro-market trading presence in the UK.
He and two colleagues left the firm to establish what was described as a
money market advisory boutique which became the embryo of Wallace Smith
Trust Company.
Mr Smith is known to have approached at least one large conglomerate seeking
to handle its treasury funds, although the offer was declined.
A banker who knew him said: 'He said he was dealing in fixed-interest
securities to get a return above the rate that could be achieved by putting
the funds into bills.
'I think the process was called riding the square and involved interpreting
the interest curve.'
During the late 1970s Mr Smith worked in east Africa, handling Canadian
export finance in coun-tries such as Kenya and Uganda.
His bank maintained a balance of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m which
enabled it to carry out sophisticated trades in swaps and deals in various
commercial paper such as certificates of deposit.
His interests in the Canadian-registered Wallace Smith Group are held in a
complex structure of family trusts.
Neighbours of Mr Smith in Chelsea, west London, said yesterday that the
property was rented out and no one answering Mr Smith's description had
lived there for some time. His whereabouts last night were not known.

FT  05 AUG 92 / High Court action starts over pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH COURT proceedings have been started by members of two pension funds
controlled by the Nottingham-based Melton Medes, the mini-conglomerate run
by Mr Nathu Ram Puri.
The court action has been launched by the Graphical Paper and Media Union in
an attempt to obtain further information about the investment of scheme
assets and to appoint a judicial or independent trustee. It has been taken
on behalf of a number of beneficiaries of Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and
Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough) Pension Funds against Melton Medes Pension
Trustees and MM Fund Management, the funds' trustees.
The funds relate to two Lancashire factories that were bought by Melton
Medes from the Imperial Group in 1986. A preliminary High Court hearing in
July placed assets, other than property, that had been controlled by the
trustees into the hands of Philips &amp; Drew, the professional fund manager
that was already handling part of the fund investments.
Undertakings were obtained from the trustees that they would not permit the
removal of the fund manager or intervene in the manager's investment
functions. The application for the appointment of an independent trustee is
to be heard in October.
The court action has arisen after a campaign by Mr Victor Edwards, a foreman
at Greenfield Mill, to enlist union financial support for a legal battle.
Last night Mr Puri said in a prepared statement: 'The trustees resolutely
deny any suggestion of financial or other impropriety in the management of
Robert Fletcher (Greenfield) and Robert Fletcher (Stoneclough) pension
funds.
'The interests of the members of the funds have always been, and remain, of
paramount importance to the trustees. We would add that the majority of the
assets of the funds have always been under independent financial fund
management. The remainder, except property, were placed under the management
of the same managers before there was any intimation of these proceedings.
'They were not placed with them because of these proceedings. The trustees
are not doing anything different today than they were doing before the
action.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / TUC plans to change priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR trade unionists are proposing that the Trades Union Congress
concentrate on just six priorities - a third of the current total - in a
move they will present as a radical rethink of the TUC's role.
The proposals, made in a confidential document approved by the TUC's ruling
general council, have been formulated as a growing number of affiliated
unions are questioning the organisation's effectiveness following a fourth
consecutive Conservative general election victory.
The AEEU engineering and electrical union has called for a 'radical
reassessment' of the TUC in a motion submitted for the annual congress in
September. The TGWU general workers is also calling for a refocusing of the
organisation's role. Some union leaders have also questioned the TUC's
leadership.
The TUC document, due to be submitted to the September congress, follows a
20 per cent reduction in staff, implemented to avert financial deficits. It
acknowledges that a 'more sharply focused programme of work' is needed.
The TUC's priority tasks will be a campaign for full employment, promotion
of an employee's charter, lobbying on trade union legislation, Europe,
developing services on education, health and safety and equal rights and
'planning the inter-union future'.
On the last area, the general council is suggesting that a voluntary code be
reached between unions following the expected legislation to undermine
Bridlington rules covering membership poaching.
Although the document does not go into details on such a code, it is likely
that the TUC will propose that unions do not actively recruit each other's
members, even though the legislation would make it virtually impossible for
the congress to forbid poaching.
Current TUC policy is to concentrate on 17 priority areas. Those include the
development of free trade unions in central and eastern Europe, 'quality in
public services', joint action on training and union recruitment. The
document says the reduction cut in priorities provides a basis for
allocating the TUC's more limited resources and for a concentrated public
relations effort around proposed campaigns.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Call for more inner-city land sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Redwood, the inner cities minister, is pressing urban development
corporations to step up sales of land for low-cost housing or for other uses
to supplement their grant incomes.
The government believes that some UDCs have held back on land sales in the
hope of capitalising on an improved market for commercial or industrial uses
when a recovery comes.
But Mr Redwood is urging the 11 English corporations to accelerate their
disposals of land, particularly to private home builders, in order to help
stimulate the construction industry and to increase the supply of affordable
homes.
With land values depressed, he believes that there is now a good opportunity
for developers to produce highly competitive 'starter' flats at retail
prices of between Pounds 35,000 and Pounds 40,000.
'I am very keen to see UDCs sell land in the current market conditions to
developers who can make housing for sale available at low market prices,'
the minister said.
UDCs are currently preparing their annual plans and have registered Mr
Redwood's proposal. However they also point out that in the current
conditions the market for new properties is finite.
Mr Martin Eagland, the chief executive of Leeds' UDC, said that in his area
the recent authorisation of a 300-unit residential development, much of it
low cost, meant that most local-market demand was probably satisfied.
Of the 1,300 acres in the Leeds Development Corporation's area, it directly
held 90 acres of which only 20 per cent would be suitable for preliminary
study as potential residential development.
Mr Eagland added, however, that Mr Redwood's plan would be closely examined,
not least as the corporation's grant has been cut from Pounds 13.6m in
1991-92 to an estimated Pounds 4m in the coming year.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Bank chief defends tax credit scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Christopher Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, yesterday stood by
his controversial proposals for a tax credit scheme to revive the housing
market.
He said that it was an 'open secret' that Whitehall was looking for ways to
solve the housing market recession.
Sir Christopher said that he was a bit taken aback that much of the media
had missed key characteristics of his proposals, including the Pounds 10,000
ceiling on the tax credit.
'It was an embryo idea rather than a fully worked up proposal. We hoped that
other lenders would contribute to that process as well.'
He remained reasonably confident that there would be a housing recovery,
even without a government initiative to revitalise the market.
'We do not believe in the disaster scenario. I don't doubt that the housing
market will revive. We can already see some encouraging features in it. But
there is a big difference between sooner and later as far as the economic
situation is concerned,' he said.
'The later it happens, the more pain there will be and the more jobs and
businesses there will be lost and also the greater the pressure the
government will come under.'
Sir Christopher said he was disappointed that some people had seen his
proposals as self-seeking. 'We at Abbey National do not need a plan of this
sort ourselves. The outlook from Abbey National is probably a bit better
than it is from many other vantage points.'
He also rejected claims that Abbey National had underestimated the cost of
its proposals. He said the bank had been very tentative about potential
costs because there were several complex and uncertain factors involved.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Carla Hills, US trade representative, yesterday put Tokyo on notice the
US will take 'actions' if Japanese companies do not increase their purchases
of foreign semiconductors.
A special US inter-agency review says Japan is failing to improve market
access for foreign chip suppliers. Previous efforts have pushed the foreign
share to about 14.6 per cent, but it has stayed 'flat' since the third
quarter of 1991. The 1991 US-Japanese Semiconductor Arrangement acknowledged
the US industry 'expectation' that foreign share would grow to over 20 per
cent by end-1992.
Japanese government and industry 'have it in their power to correct
insufficient progress and ensure successful implementation of the promising
plan to expand market access announced in June by US and Japanese industry,'
Mrs Hills said. 'If substantial improvement is not achieved, we will take
extra actions, as necessary, to fulfil the terms of the Arrangement.'
The June plan outlined specific steps to raise foreign sales: Japan's 10
biggest electronics companies agreed to give foreign suppliers advance
information on plans for chip purchases in the third and fourth quarters of
1992.
Mrs Hills said it was too early to assess results of that agreement. A
Semiconductor Industry Association official said 'early reviews showed the
effort 'is not succeeding'.
Many Japanese fear the review is an attempt to prepare for sanctions before
the November presidential election so the administration can show its
resolve in trade rows. Mrs Hills may announce retaliation before the
five-year pact expires, but she may now just be sabre-rattling. The accord
is seen by some as a test of the efficacy of 'managed trade' pacts. The SIA
said: 'You can't actually force people to buy chips, but you can indicate it
is in everyone's interest for users to look outside Japan for
semiconductors.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US OFFICIAL index of coincident indicators - a broad measure of the
economy's current health - fell sharply in June to reach its lowest level
since the US recession began in July 1990, the Commerce Department reported
yesterday.
The index - based on movements in non-farm employment, industrial
production, personal incomes, and in manufacturing and trade sales - fell
0.6 per cent, taking it below the previous trough that was reached last
January.
The department also reported the first fall in six months of the index of
leading indicators, which is designed to predict turning-points in the
economy. The leading index fell 0.2 per cent, after increases of 0.3 per
cent and 0.6 per cent in April and May.
The sharp drop in the coincident index highlights the economy's loss of
momentum at the end of the second quarter. 'It shows the recession has not
ended yet,' said Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in
New York.
Most economists believe the economy is still growing slowly, but a spate of
poor statistics, including a sharp drop in consumer confidence in July and
slower than expected growth in the second quarter, have raised fresh doubts
about the durability of the recovery.
The index of leading indicators was pulled down by declines in six of its 11
components. The weakest components were real money supply, the average
working week and unemployment insurance claims. Falls in share prices,
building permits and consumer confidence, however, also signalled economic
contraction.
Four of the 11 rose, the largest positive contribution coming from higher
orders for plant and equipment.
Forecasters are now eagerly awaiting the release on Friday of employment
figures for July. Most expect a modest rebound, after sharp falls in June.
Governor Bill Clinton has widened his lead over President George Bush in the
race for the White House, according to the latest national opinion poll
released here, reports Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington.
The survey, of 1,001 adults, done last weekend for CNN by Gallup, put the
Democratic nominee 57:32 per cent ahead, a larger lead than the 56:34
advantage the same poll found immediately after the Democratic convention
last month.
This suggests, for the moment, that Mr Clinton's big lead is not simply the
product of convention lift.
Mr Bush's approval rating fell to a new nadir, 29 per cent, from 32 per cent
in the previous survey. Only three US presidents had ever fallen so low,
Gallup noted.

PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil, battling to stay in power amid a
worsening corruption scandal, has been dealt a heavy blow by the resignation
of one of his most senior ministers, writes Christina Lamb in Braslia.
Mr Jose Goldemberg, education minister, is the first cabinet member to quit
since the political crisis erupted in May with a series of corruption
allegations against the president. The minister resigned on Monday night,
provoking much speculation that other ministers might follow suit.
Citing 'political and personal reasons' for quitting, Mr Goldemberg, a
former university rector, accused the government of greater concern for its
own survival than for the Brazilian people, and of lack of commitment to
education.
Mr Collor has managed to hold on to his economic team, for now, by agreeing
to maintain his austerity policy. Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy
minister, said he had agreed merely to re-allocate some government resources
to social programmes, such as housing projects.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest effort yet to solve poverty-stricken Mozambique's 16-year civil
war gets under way in Rome today where President Joaquim Chissano is due to
meet his rebel opponent for the first face-to-face peace talks.
Observers say there is a new-found sense of realism on both sides at the
talks, born of a recognition that Mozambique and its 15m people simply
cannot take another year of fighting, famine and destruction.
The success of the talks is critical to averting widespread starvation
caused by the worst drought in Mozambique's history but exacerbated by the
war which has made 70 per cent of the country insecure, and has forced at
least 4m people to flee their homes.
The outcome of the talks is also vital to efforts to resuscitate
Mozambique's aid-dependent economy where average per capita income is less
than Dollars 80 and where Mr Chissano says half the country's people cannot
feed themselves.
Hopes are high that after two years of failed talks, the warring sides,
tired by fighting and the suffering inflicted on their people, may now be
prepared to reach agreement. The optimism is boosted by the involvement in
the talks of President Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the foreign ministers of Italy
and Botswana.
A critical role is also being played behind the scenes by the European
Community, the United Nations and Mr Tiny Rowland, the chief executive of
Lonrho, which has substantial but unfulfilled agro-industrial commercial
interests in Mozambique.
However, the same nagging obstacles which have defeated eleven rounds of
peace talks held over the past two years remain as formidable as ever.
Renamo, the right-wing rebel group led by Mr Afonso Dhlakama, has little in
the way of a political programme to present as a basis of dialogue. It was
originally formed and supported by the Rhodesian secret service in 1974 to
combat the communist black nationalist Frelimo party, which swept to power
in Mozambique a year later.
After Zimbabwean independence in 1980, South Africa continued the military
and logistical support of Renamo as part of its destabilisation and sabotage
campaign in hostile neighbouring states. Throughout this period, Renamo
never tried to build a mass popular base, like other rebel insurgencies, but
adopted tactics of sabotage and terrorism against civilians.
The end of the Cold War, the abandonment of communism by Frelimo and
introduction of liberal political and economic reforms followed by the
changes in South Africa have left Renamo an anachronism. However, now backed
by right-wing extremists in Portugal and South Africa, it has continued its
campaign of terror and destruction.
Fears are also widespread that one of the reasons Mr Dhlakama has been
reluctant to speed the peace process is that he may not exercise control
over his troops, many of whom are no more than marauding bandits.
Efforts to reach a successful ceasefire between the two sides as a prelude
to political dialogue has broken down over Renamo's demand that the Frelimo
government withdraw an estimated 5,000-7,000 Zimbabwean troops stationed in
Mozambique to guard trade routes and an oil pipeline between the two
countries.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Hurd backs UN chief as 'man of stature'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government yesterday publicly expressed its support of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, who has been
the subject of critical articles in the press, particularly in the UK.
Mr Boutros Ghali, a former senior Egyptian diplomat, who has recently been
involved in an open dispute with the UN Security Council and Lord
Carrington, the chairman of the European Community's peace conference on
Yugoslavia, suggested in an interview that racism might be at the root of
the criticism directed at him.
'Maybe it's because I'm a wog,' he told the New York Times.
Ignoring the allegation of racism, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, said on radio yesterday that Mr Boutros Ghali was 'a man of
stature and style.'
'I reckon he's going to be a very effective secretary-general. He's taking
over at a time when the UN is having to face great burdens. The queue of
trouble outside his door grows all the time. I'm not surprised that he feels
occasional exasperation, but we are on his side and we will work with him.'
It is not the first time Mr Hurd has attempted to placate Mr Boutros Ghali.
Last month, he made an unscheduled stop in New York on his way to Manila
after the UN secretary-general had complained about not being properly
consulted on an EC request for UN monitoring of heavy weapons in Bosnia.
Mr Boutros Ghali said the UN did not have the resources to carry out such a
task and accused the international community of showing more concern about
'the rich man's war' in former Yugoslavia, than the humanitarian disaster in
Somalia.
Though the secretary-general appears to feel that Britain and its permanent
UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, are primarily responsible for critical
articles about him in the British press, adverse comment has not been
confined to the UK.
Members of several UN delegations have been taken aback by what some
consider to be the secretary-general's aloof style and his preference for
going over their heads to deal with members of governments directly. Nor is
his penchant for calling a spade a spade appreciated by practitioners of a
profession dedicated to a more circumlocutory mode of expression.
Behind the whole affair lies an obvious conflict of priorities in the UN.
Developing countries consider Mr Boutros Ghali should be devoting more UN
resources to Third World problems instead of Yugoslavia. That causes
stresses in an organisation already grossly over-stretched, which are
reflected in the attitude and manner of its top executive official.

<TEXT>
A TOP United Nations official yesterday accused the Security Council of
failing to respond swiftly and vigorously enough after Iraq last month
barred weapons inspectors from Baghdad's Agriculture Ministry.
The official, Mr Rolf Ekeus, who is head of the UN commission charged with
finding and scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said the Security
Council's attitude exacerbated the recent confrontation with Iraq.
He told reporters that Iraq misread the situation. It understood only in the
final 24 hours before backing down that military action against it had
become 'a very close call'.
Mr Ekeus denied that he compromised future weapons inspections in Iraq by
choosing inspectors from countries that did not take part in the Gulf war in
order to win access to the Agriculture Ministry.
'I did not negotiate any selection; I did it in order to help Iraq out of
the impasse,' he said, adding that the UN had no wish to humiliate Baghdad.
However, he said the US, Britain and France were about the only countries
that had people with the expertise to conduct sensitive inspections. It was
inevitable their citizens must continue to be included in operations.
A new UN team led by a Russian expert would begin a further round of
inspections in Iraq next weekend, concentrating on locations 'where we have
reason to suspect that prohibited material is stored or hidden'.
Mr Ekeus said the Iraqis would get no advance warning. It would also test
their undertakings to him during his mission to Baghdad in the wake of last
month's crisis.
He also hoped the Security Council would react quickly if the inspectors
encountered another confrontation.
US marines in amphibious assault vehicles, escorted by low-flying helicopter
gunships, landed on Kuwaiti shores yesterday in an implicit US warning to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, agencies report from Kuwait.
Exercise Eager Mace, planned last year, is the first of three war games in
Kuwait that will involve more than 5,000 US troops in landing, live fire and
tank manoeuvres during August.

FT  05 AUG 92 / India takes ballot box into political vacuum: The government
is insisting on elections in Kashmir where no structures exist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE state of Jammu and Kashmir, where armed separatists have been
fighting a bloody war with Indian security forces for nearly three years,
virtually no civil administration or political structures exist.
Yet the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao has decided to hold elections
there. The decision is regarded with grave scepticism in Srinagar, the state
capital. Militant groups have warned against participation.
Mr Girish Chandra Saxena, the governor, admits that there was a sharp spurt
of violence after the government's intention to hold elections became clear
last month and recently advised New Delhi that the situation was 'not yet
conducive' to hold them.
'Elections are the only solution to the Kashmir problem,' said Mr Rao at the
weekend. 'In a democratic country, how long can we keep a state away from
the election process?' However, he is reluctant to set a date. 'I cannot say
now when the election will be held. But once it is held, the situation will
greatly improve.'
At a time when Kashmiris are questioning the basis of their accession to
India in 1948, elections within India's constitutional framework are
perceived as an attempt by New Delhi to sidetrack the real issue.
Kashmir has been the main obstacle to peace in the sub-continent for 45
years, with both India and Pakistan claiming a territory which, many
Kashmiris believe, belongs to neither. The people of the mountain state have
been demanding a United Nations-supervised plebiscite promised to them by
the Indian government in 1948.
India, which holds that Kashmir is a domestic problem, has fought three wars
with Pakistan to retain Kashmir and has an estimated 400,000 army and
para-military troops in the state, a considerable drain on its exchequer.
News that elections were imminent led to an escalation of violence through
July, after a lull from April to June. During the week that Mr Rao assured
parliament in mid-July that 'certain conditions of peace' had been achieved
in the valley, the official death toll was 99.
Srinagar, which has turned from a tourist destination to a war-zone in three
years, suffers long hours of curfew and daily killings, as security forces
fight a ruthless battle. Often it is the hapless civilian population which
suffers more than the heavily armed militants.
Cordon-and-search operations, meant to 'flush out terrorists' are often
excuses for the security forces to wreak revenge on innocent people for
militant attacks. Women and children are not spared.
The authorities managed to hold back the security forces to some degree in
the early months of the year. But in the last few weeks, several instances
of men in uniform going berserk have been reported. Eighteen people died on
the day home minister SB Chavan made a whistle-stop visit to the valley,
flying in and out amid top security, and not venturing out of the
high-security zone into the city. The minister's gunmen sprayed civilians
with bullets when a car tyre burst, killing six.
Despite the violence, the government sees political advantages in proceeding
with elections. The ruling Congress party is increasingly perceived to be in
tune with the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party on the Ayodhya temple
issue and on its reformist economic policies. A seemingly liberal policy on
Kashmir would help Mr Rao to dissociate his party from the BJP, which takes
a hard line against separatists.
Elections might also be seen as a way to reassure the insecure Moslem
minority by conveying the impression that democracy was being restored in
India's only Moslem-majority state.
An elected local government would allow the Rao government to share the
responsibility. 'India wants to fire their guns from someone else's
shoulders,' said Mr Javed Mir, commander-in-chief of the pro-independence
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). However, elections could also
provide a much-needed rallying point for militant groups in search of a
common ideological platform.
Logistically, elections in the foreseeable future seem virtually impossible
in a state where militant organisations such as the JKLF and the
pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen can paralyse the entire Kashmir valley by
declaring a 'civil curfew'.
A senior bureaucrat in Srinagar says: 'Nobody here believes that an election
will help, but even if they did, does the government expect people to come
out and vote when they risk being shot in the back?'
He recalls the last general elections in 1989, when a militant group placed
television sets as 'rewards' for voters at the entrance of some polling
booths and coffins at the exit. The militants' message was heeded, even at a
time of relative peace.
Given a lack of willingness to vote or to stand as a candidate, the
credibility of elections would be in doubt. Elections seen as a means to
foist a government on to an unwilling people could only intensify separatist
tendencies.
'The government's being adamant that elections will be held here, is only
further proof for us that India is not interested in Kashmir,' says a bank
manager. 'They are only trying to pull the wool over the world's eyes, and
pretend they are a great democracy.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / Italy passes tough Mafia law: Decree to strengthen hand of
authorities wins cross-party support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S new government last night won approval in the lower house of
parliament for a tough new anti-Mafia decree.
Put forward after the recent murders of Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo
Borsellino, two prominent judges in Sicily leading the fight against the
Mafia, the new ruling will strengthen the hand of police and magistrates
tackling criminal organisations.
The lower house also passed an amendment which means politicians caught
buying votes from gangsters could face up to six years in prison.
The government, led by Mr Giuliano Amato, has been faced with a public
outcry since the two assassinations. Its immediate reactions after last
month's murder of Mr Borsellino included sending 7,000 troops to Sicily to
help local police and carabinieri.
The government decided not to turn the vote on the new decree - which had
already been approved in the Senate, the upper house - into an issue of
confidence, following signs of broad cross-party support.
It did however agree to drop a clause which would have given police greater
powers to detain suspects without charge following criticism from the main
opposition Democratic Party of the Left (PDS).
The decree will also lay to rest the High Commission for the Fight against
the Mafia, which was set up in the early 1980s but which has proved
ineffective in tackling organised crime.
The organisation would have become partly redundant next year, when Italy's
new anti-Mafia DIA, modelled on America's FBI, comes into operation. Italy's
financial markets rebounded for the second day running yesterday after
Monday night's surprise cut in interest rates by the Bank of Italy and last
week's agreement on ending the scala mobile wage indexing system.
The half-point reduction in the official discount rate to 13.25 per cent and
in the rate for fixed-term advances to commercial banks to 14.75 per cent
contributed to a slight decline in the lira. The Italian currency was fixed
at 755.83 against the D-Mark, compared with 754.95 on Monday.
Shares on the Milan stock exchange rose for the second consecutive day, with
prices rising by over 2 per cent and the Comit equity index closing up 7.71
points at 424.35. However, brokers warned that the rise came against a
background of very thin trading.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night demanded that the Red Cross
and other neutral bodies be allowed to inspect detention camps in the former
Yugoslavia, especially in the war-torn republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina,
agencies report from New York.
The UN also announced it was suspending humanitarian aid flights into
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, for three days because of heavy shelling.
The Security Council held closed-door consultations about detention camps,
because of allegations that Serbian forces were running 'death' camps in
Bosnia.
On Monday, the US State Department appeared to confirm media reports of
detention centres in which civilians were tortured and murdered. But the US
said yesterday it could not confirm the reports.
A Security Council statement warned that anyone committing or ordering grave
breaches of international humanitarian law was individually responsible.
Mourners at the funeral of two children killed by snipers while being
evacuated by bus from Sarajevo fled in terror yesterday after two mortar
bombs exploded within 100 metres of the graves.
The grandmother of one of the children was wounded. Sarajevo's central Lion
Cemetery, where the burial took place, has been in the middle of heavy
fighting, but the proximity of the hits seemed to indicate the shelling was
intentional.
'My daughter is dead, and now they've injured my mother,' said Mrs Svetlana
Glavas, mother of one of the children, after her mother Ruza was wounded in
the arm.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S highest court yesterday blocked a liberal abortion law which was
due to have come into force at midnight, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe approved a request for a
preliminary injunction stopping the law from taking effect.
The action was brought by 241 conservative members of parliament, including
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the mainly Catholic state of Bavaria.
The court will give a final ruling in the autumn on whether the law, which
lets women end pregnancies almost without restriction during the first 12
weeks after conception, is compatible with Germany's constitution.
Mr Ernst Gottfried Mahrenholz, chairman of the committee considering the
injunction, announced the court's ruling yesterday.
The decision means that east and west Germany will continue to have separate
abortion laws, at least for the time being.
Communist East Germany allowed abortion on demand while in West Germany
abortion was a crime unless doctors certified that a woman's physical or
mental health would be jeopardised by the continuation of the pregnancy.
The court said that by granting the preliminary injunction it was not
prejudging the new abortion law itself.
The decision made 'no conclusions about the prospective result of the main
hearing (later this year)', Mr Mahrenholz said.

FT  05 AUG 92 / At last, a currency that is weaker than the rouble:
Ukraine's 'coupon' has given Russian money something of a 'hard currency'
status in Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRESHAM'S Law - that bad money drives out good - is alive and well in
Ukraine, with a variation. In the second-largest of the former Soviet
republics of 52m people, what most would consider 'bad money', a
depreciating, inconvertible Russian rouble, is sought after in preference to
something even worse - the Ukrainian 'coupon'.
When introduced last year, the coupon was a single-use token issued to
Ukrainian workers as part of their wages to 'validate' their purchases of
foodstuffs.
Now Ukrainian workers have no choice. They are paid exclusively in coupons.
Even withdrawals from their nominally rouble-denominated savings accounts
are paid out in coupons.
In theory the coupon is on a par with the rouble. In practice months of easy
credit policy by a government under pressure from enterprises to issue
cheap, unsecured credits has devalued the Ukrainian quasi-currency faster
than the rouble. This has left the coupon distrusted and unwanted.
The result is a thriving black market. Kreschatik, the tree-lined main
thoroughfare of the capital, Kiev, is thronged with illegal but tolerated
money-changers. They also congregate outside the the capital's largest food
market, the pre-revolutionary, constructivist-style Bessarabia market,
opposite the city's last remaining statue of Lenin.
Alongside young hustlers in the latest teenage fashions stand portly
housewives and ageing 'babushkas' with headscarves and shopping bags mutely
holding wads of coupons in their outstretched hands.
While the young hustlers are most interested in changing coupons for dollars
or other hard currencies, the 'babushkas' have been allowed to share in the
cheap end of the market - the coupons-for-roubles trade.
Last week, as Russia's rouble-dollar rate declined in response to doubts
over Moscow's ability to restrain a growing budget deficit, the Ukrainian
coupon fell even more sharply. Traders outside the Bessarabia market offered
220 coupons for a dollar while the going market rate for roubles was only
155. Given this 30 per cent discount, shop girls, hotels, enterprises and
anyone else with access to roubles, substitute coupons from their own
pockets and sell the roubles at a profit.
In this way a quasi-money designed to prevent Russian and other rouble
holders from buying scarce goods in Ukraine has had the opposite effect. By
changing their 'hard' roubles for coupons, Russians can effectively buy more
cheaply than in Russia.
The coupon is essentially the product of old communist thinking about money.
Neither the rouble, or any other former communist currency was real money as
understood in the west.
'I am totally opposed to the coupon idea and so are all my senior
colleagues,' said Mr Alexander Sharov, the young vice chairman in charge of
external policy at the Ukrainian National Bank, the central bank. 'But we
only took over in April and nobody in the former team is willing to admit it
was his idea. The coupon is an orphan.'
The Ukrainian government is still committed to introducing its own national
currency, the hryvnia, as a fully-fledged legal tender. But the date is
unclear as experience with the coupon underlines the dangers of introducing
a new currency without creating the sort of monetary, fiscal and
institutional framework needed to ensure its value and acceptability.
But the shortcomings of the coupon reflect the impotence of the central bank
and other institutions such as the finance ministry and the privatisation
ministry which have minimal political or institutional weight in
post-independence Ukraine. Real power is still concentrated in a handful of
former communist apparatchiks and party bosses around President Leonid
Kravchuk and Mr Vitold Fokin the prime minister.
After three centuries of subservience to Moscow, Ukraine is hard pressed to
find the qualified and experienced personnel needed to administer a modern
state.
Parliament, for example, is also still dominated by former communists who
see no apparent contradiction between voting for liberal foreign investment,
privatisation and other market-orientated legislation and then voting large
cash infusions to bankrupt state enterprises still run by their former
communist managers.
Similarly, the country's exiguous hard currency reserves are held by the
recently formed Export-Import bank, which is essentially the successor to
the Ukrainian branch of the Soviet Vneshekonombank. Critics of the bank,
which maintains close working relations with Vneshekonombank in Moscow, say
this arrangement ensures that control over hard currency usage remains with
power brokers around the president and the prime minister.
The handful of relatively inexperienced technocrats in the central bank and
the ministry of finance appears to bear considerable responsibility but
wields little power. They are acutely nervous about Russia's expected
response to the eventual introduction of the hryvnia and the likely
inflationary consequences of Russia's expected decision to charge world
prices for oil and other exports to Ukraine in the autumn.
The money changers on the Kreschatik may not be fully aware of the problems
that lie ahead. But, in the mysterious way of free markets, the downward
course of the coupon on Kiev's streets is probably an accurate barometer of
difficult economic times ahead as Ukraine seeks to break out of its former
colonial-style dependence on Moscow.

FT  05 AUG 92 / 'If the Moslems do not raise the white flag on the minarets,
we raze the villages to the ground. Serb villages will be built here': Judy
Dempsey explains how Serb leaders are  rearranging Bosnia's population,
using detention camps and a ruthless policy of ethnic cleansing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE north-western Bosnian city of Banja Luka, there is an institution
called the 'Centre for Migration'. Since May, it has been sending out
instructions to Serbian officials in towns and cities throughout
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The instructions are always the same: make arrangements
for the exchange of population.
Set up last May, it is run by Mr Vojo Kuprasanin, Mr Radoslav Brdjanin, Mr
Radislav Vukic, and Mr Predrag Radic. The four are leaders of the
self-declared Serbian republic of Bosanska Krajina. They also support
Bosnia's Serbian Democratic Party which is led by Mr Radovan Karadzic.
In June, Mr Kuprasanin, who has since established a martial law regime in
Banja Luka, asked the Serb mayor of the central Bosnian city of Zenice for a
population transfer involving 30,000 Moslems and Croats. They were to be
sent from Banja Luka to Zenice in return for the Zenice authorities sending
30,000 Serbs to Banja Luka.
But such ad hoc rearrangements of Bosnia's ethnic make-up have been
institutionalised, with the forced evacuation of tens of thousands of mostly
Moslem civilians by Serbs and their confinement in detention centres,
according to officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC). It was forced to leave Bosnia at the end of May following
intimidation and the killing of an aid worker.
'There is one aim behind the Serb camps: ethnic cleansing,' explained a
senior US diplomat. 'Through their quest for territory, the Serbs, by
placing the Moslems in camps, want eventually to expel the Moslem population
and make parts of Bosnia ethnically homogeneous,' he explained.
Moslems make up 43 per cent of the 4.5m population of Bosnia, Serbs 33 per
cent and Croats 17 per cent.
Many witnesses among the tens of thousands who have fled to neighbouring
Croatia and Hungary have repeatedly confirmed these views.
Although the ICRC, human rights organisations, and other international aid
agencies have not been permitted to visit any of the camps, except the
'model' Serb-controlled camp at Manaca, near Banja Luka, the Serbian media
have begun openly to describe the methods behind ethnic cleansing.
The most recent issue of Epocha, a weekly magazine close to Serbia's ruling
Socialist party, reported how Bosnia's Serbs now control large swathes of
northern Bosnia through a policy of ethnic cleansing: 'This (region) is now
cleared of Croats and Moslems ..our army surrounds Moslem villages. If the
Moslems do not raise the white flag on the minarets, we raze the villages to
the ground. Serb villages will be built here ..'
If Moslems were prepared to fly the white flag, they must be prepared for an
exchange of population. 'Those people not from mixed marriages can go to the
territory controlled by (Bosnian president Alija) Izetbegovic, or go to
Croatia. Those from mixed marriages who have not fired at Serbs, can choose
to remain ..'
The magazine boasted how in Kotor Varos, a town of 36,000 people east of
Banja Luka, there were no longer ethnic minorities. Until recently, the town
symbolised the ethnic patchwork of Bosnia: 38 per cent Serb; 30 per cent
Moslem; 29 per cent Croat.
Those held in Serb camps, particularly those in Omarska, north-west of Banja
Luka, or Pale, east of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, the headquarters of Mr
Karadzic, are sometimes freed in exchange for Serb snipers held by Bosnia's
territorial forces. Witnesses have described how they have been forcibly
transported out of the republic as refugees.
'These refugees cannot come back. The whole point about ethnic cleansing is
that it prevents the local inhabitants from returning. Not just because they
are afraid, but because they have nothing to return to. Their homes have
been completely destroyed,' a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said.
Few if any international relief agencies can confirm the number of Serb
detention camps in Bosnia-Hercegovina precisely because they are not allowed
to visit them, or because it is too dangerous to travel to these areas.
International aid agencies also say that the Croats, and now the Moslems,
are involved in ethnic cleansing.
For example, western diplomats know of a Croatian camp at Konjic, west of
Sarajevo, in which 3,000 Serbs were imprisoned in a rail tunnel.

FRENCH support for European union is slipping as next month's referendum on
the Maastricht treaty approaches. A poll in Liberation newspaper shows 43
per cent plan to vote 'No', compared with 38 per cent a month ago.
The referendum is seen as critical for the treaty.
European union is still popular among the young, with 70 per cent of
18-to-24 year olds planning to vote 'Yes'.
Robert Taylor adds from Stockholm: Joining the EC will cost Sweden only
SKr3.4bn (Pounds 330m) net a year, according to a Commission report
yesterday. This would be 3.2 per cent of EC's spending.
Although Sweden will have to pay an estimated SKr10.8bn a year into the EC
budget, it can expect to receive SKr7.4bn in return in financial support,
particularly for its vulnerable agricultural industry. Between SKr4.4bn and
SKr5.2bn will be earmarked for supporting cereals, milk and dairy products,
lamb and mutton.
The report says Sweden would have to abandon its state alcohol monopoly
because it conflicts with EC competition laws.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Freeze on European fighter contracts agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A THREE-MONTH freeze in new contracts in the development of the
controversial European Fighter Aircraft was agreed yesterday by defence
ministers from Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain.
The time will be used to undertake studies to find drastic cost reductions
in the Pounds 20bn project and to redefine the aircraft's military role.
The ministers, meeting in Madrid, stopped short of suggesting that the EFA
would not be built. But Spain and Germany - which triggered a crisis in the
consortium earlier this summer by declaring it would not join the production
phase of the aircraft - left little doubt that the original project is on
the verge of being abandoned.
'The EFA is dead,' Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, said
yesterday. His Spanish counterpart, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, said: 'Our
current economic situation will not permit us to go into production of the
EFA as it stands.'
Only Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, tried to sound an
enthusiastic note by insisting that Germany had agreed to continue the
development phase of the EFA. But Mr Ruhe, who has never threatened
otherwise, noted that for the first time 'London has shown a readiness to
discuss a reduction of the military and strategic requirements of the
aircraft'.
In a clear reference to Mr Ruhe's calls for a cheaper and lighter EFA, Mr
Rifkind said: 'We very much hope that the decisions eventually taken will be
informed rather than those based on simple assertions without any supporting
hard evidence . . . It is unlikely that any project which does not take
advantage of the huge expense already undertaken on development will end up
being less expensive than the EFA.'
He said a 30 per cent cut in unit costs being sought by Spain was a broad
target and 'we are happy they should look at that'. The decision to freeze
new development contracts was purely symbolic, he said. There were, as far
as he knew, no new ones pending.
Mr Garca Vargas said the ministers had agreed that no new contracts would be
awarded between now and the end of October.
During this time the air forces of the four countries would study
alternative military requirements.
Mr Garca Vargas said the ministers would meet again in November to decide
whether to proceed with the EFA, to build a lighter, cheaper version or to
begin work - possibly with other partners and investors including Saudi
Arabia - on a new aircraft. He warned that the 'pause' would inevitably mean
a delay in the production of whatever aircraft it was decided to build.
Spain would insist on a twin-engined aircraft, but he said the studies would
look at changes in all aspects of the EFA, including the airframe, which
Britain has been keen to protect.

FT  05 AUG 92 / UK banks face Pounds 490m suit: Liquidators allege payments
to Wallace Smith Trust misdirected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK, ROBERT PESTON, RICHARD DONKIN and RAYMOND HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland is being sued for up to Pounds 418m and National
Westminster for more than Pounds 71m by the liquidators of a small banking
group which was closed down last year by the Bank of England after
involvement in alleged fraud.
Neither bank has made provisions against any losses which may result from
the legal action.
The Pounds 418m claim against Royal Bank of Scotland is roughly equivalent
to its full-year profits before provisions. Its shares fell 21p yesterday to
153p, while those of NatWest dropped 4p to 320p.
The damage claims stem from allegations that substantial payments that
should have been deposited with the Wallace Smith Trust Company were made by
the banks to another company, Wallace Smith Holdings.
Wallace Smith Trust Company's liquidator, Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate
recovery at KPMG Peat Marwick, claims the payments were non-transferable and
should not have been rerouted. The banks say the rerouting was properly
authorised.
Mr Hayward has issued a writ against Royal Bank of Scotland. NatWest has not
yet received a writ though it expects to receive one.
Wallace Smith Trust was a banking and finance group closed down by the Bank
of England in May last year. Wallace Smith Holdings was a general financial
services company.
Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, a director of Wallace Smith Trust, has been charged
with fraud exceeding Dollars 50m. Mr Smith, 58, has a wealthy, though
private lifestyle, with an address in Chelsea and property in the Bahamas.
Born in western Canada, he is described as a family man.
He is well known among the Bruges Group of anti-European federalists and is
known to have paid the rent on the Bruges Group's one-room office in Jermyn
Street for nearly two years.
Mr Smith was arrested in April last year and charged with fraudulent
trading. His case was transferred from City of London magistrates court 12
months later, by which time he faced 15 charges. His trial has been fixed
for February 1 at Knightsbridge Crown Court.
Two charges of fraudulent trading allege that between January 1980 and April
1991 he was knowingly a party to carrying on the business of Wallace Smith
Trust with intent to defraud its creditors.
Royal Bank of Scotland said its writ claimed 'damages in conversion' for 39
payments made between August 1989 and January 1991. Eleven payments
originated from Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank and 28 from Bank of New York.
The bank said yesterday: 'We deny liability and are going to vigorously
contend these allegations.'
National Westminster said in a note to its interim accounts, released
yesterday, that it had been advised of a claim 'arising out of the conduct
of (a former) customer's account'.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Building company shares fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES of hard-pressed construction and building material companies
fell further yesterday as pressure mounted on the government to revive
Britain's flagging housing market.
Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of Woolwich, Britain's fourth largest
building society, appealed to the government to allow mortgage tax relief on
loans of up to Pounds 60,000 for the first 12 months after a house purchase.
He also wants the threshold for stamp duty on house purchases raised to
Pounds 60,000.
He said householders were feeling less wealthy every month as house prices
and consumer confidence dwindled. People were saving more and spending less,
causing higher unemployment.
The call for urgent action to end the recession in the housing market and
pave the way for a general recovery came a day after Abbey National urged
the government to offer tax relief of up to Pounds 10,000 to people selling
their home at a loss. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would
consider the idea but is expected to reject it.
Share prices of construction companies dropped yesterday following
publication of figures showing a further sharp fall in housebuilding in the
three months after the election in April. The FT-Actuaries index of leading
construction shares fell by 2.6 per cent to 609.68. The FT-A building
materials index fell 3.2 per cent to 756.43.
Housebuilders started work on 8 per cent fewer homes in the second quarter
than during the previous three months, according to the Environment
Department. The total number of starts of 38,900 was the lowest quarterly
figure since the final three months of 1990 when the housing market was at a
very low ebb.
Publication of the figures came as Lord Alexander, chairman of National
Westminster Bank, urged a three-point plan to spur recovery. He wants to
boost the housing market by doubling the ceiling on mortgage interest tax
relief to about Pounds 60,000, although he wants all mortgage tax relief
abolished in 10 years.
The bank also favours greater government spending on transport and
infrastructure and is promoting the granting of accelerated tax allowances
on capital investment by companies.
General Accident, the insurance group, revealed that its property services
division is offering insurance against falling house prices for anxious
purchasers of new homes.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Soviet gangs embezzle over DM1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOVIET EMIGRE gangs have been defrauding the German government of hundreds
of millions of D-Marks by faking the delivery of consumer goods to the
former Soviet armed forces in eastern Germany, according to Berlin police.
Mr Uwe Schmidt, a superintendent heading the police investigation, estimated
yesterday that 'more than DM1bn' (Pounds 340m) had been embezzled out of the
DM3bn Germany had agreed to pay for supplies to the former Soviet forces
until their withdrawal in 1994.
The contracts were secured by Soviet emigre gangs, via Soviet officers, and
fictitious deliveries were recorded for cigarettes, food, alcohol, hi-fi
units, televisions and video recorders for the troops.
Police say that in a typical case, the gangs bribed Russian officers to
order tax-free liquor in bulk for the armed forces from a Berlin company. A
bill was provided and payment made but the liquor never reached the troops;
it was resold on the open market at a higher price.
The police became aware of the embezzlement scheme because of a flood on to
the market of such things as cigarettes, alcohol and electronics goods.
Large quantities of tax-free cigarettes were ordered at DM4.50 a carton,
compared with the German retail price of DM40.
'There were enough cigarettes to supply everyone remotely connected with the
army including infants and grandmothers,' said Mr Schmidt. In many cases the
cigarettes were sold to Vietnamese citizens living in east Germany who
resold them on the street for DM25 a carton.
The police also believe that embezzled goods to the value of DM250m were
illegally transported to Poland and Russia for resale in the past year.
The police hope the investigation will lead to prosecutions by the Berlin
justice authorities later this year. However this may be hampered by the
speed with which the companies involved in the fraudulent operations were
set up and liquidated.
Mr Schmidt said: 'We know who the 100 or so perpetrators are. They are
people who were convicted of counterfeiting, illegal weapons sales and
forgery of documents and art objects. There is no place left where they can
escape.' Most are known to be in Berlin, but no arrests have been made so
far because of the complexity of the company operations.
He complained that the finance ministry was not taking an active enough
interest in trying to find the money.
A recent parliamentary investigation in Moscow has claimed that the scandal
extended into the top echelons of the former Soviet armed forces.
Russian state prosecutors conducted a preliminary investigation at the main
army purchasing mission in Leipzig but their findings were not made
available.

FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cut in Italian discount rate
lifts continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unexpected cut in the Italian discount rate late on Monday lifted bourses
yesterday but volume was generally low, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT took heart from better-than-expected half-year results from
Dresdner Bank and turned broadly positive. Although Italy's discount rate
cut encouraged some buying, the market remained nervous ahead of tomorrow's
Bundesbank council meeting. The FAZ index was up 5.77 at 637.61 at
midsession while the DAX index advanced 16.8 to 1,611.51, having seen an
intraday high of 1,617. Turnover rose to DM4.1bn from DM3.8bn.
The 15 per cent rise in Dresdner's first-half earnings provided an early
fillip to the market and lifted other bank stocks. Its shares closed up DM7
at DM332 while Commerzbank improved DM4.20 to DM239.90 and Deutsche Bank,
which reports its figures today, advanced DM4.90 to DM630.
Forecasts of higher full-year earnings helped Schering gain ground although
it came off its intraday high of DM724 to close up DM1 at DM713. Other
chemicals groups were firmer, BASF up DM3.50 at DM225.50 and Bayer up DM2 at
DM267.80.
MILAN rallied for the second consecutive day following the half-point cut in
the discount rate late on Monday. But traders said most of the activity was
professional short-covering with little institutional demand. The Comit
index rose 7.71 or 1.9 per cent to 424.35 in turnover estimated at more than
Monday's L68.4bn.
The session was again hampered by technical problems in the screen trading
system and the 35 shares listed on the telematico had to be traded on the
floor by open outcry.
Banks were boosted by the lower interest rates, with San Paolo rising L50 to
L10,450 and Mediobanca gaining L365 to L12,850.
PARIS came off the day's highs as the CAC-40 index closed just 3.19 higher
at 1,787.63, down from 1,802.63, in low turnover of FFr1.2bn.
Peugeot dropped FFr8 to FFr677 on news that its new car sales fell 8.7 per
cent in July from the same period in 1991.
Euro Disney rebounded FFr2.95 or 3.5 per cent to FFr86.75 but some analysts
feared that it would be difficult for the stock to recover further because
of the adverse sentiment towards it.
Another gainer was Synthelabo, the pharmaceuticals company, which rose FFr33
or 3.3 per cent to FFr1,035 following news of a sales increase of 9.7 per
cent to FFr3.17bn in the first half.
ZURICH was stronger with the SMI index up 10.5 at 1,805.4.
Banks and insurers remained positive with Union Bank bearers adding SFr4 to
SFr705 while Zurich Insurance bearers gained SFr15 to SFr1,945.
Lindt &amp; Spruengli, the chocolate manufacturer, came under pressure after Mr
Rudolph Spruengli, the company chairman, announced that he had secretly
married a woman who is connected to a US religious sect. Its bearers tumbled
SFr1,075 or 8.9 per cent to SFr11,000.
AMSTERDAM was satisfied with the 11 per cent rise in Akzo's first-half
results. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 117.4.
Akzo also forecast improved full-year earnings and its shares gained Fl 3.40
to Fl 149.90. Fellow chemical group DSM put on 10 cents to Fl 103.20.
A number of 'hold' recommendations have recently been issued on DSM in spite
of its pleasing half-year figures released last week as many analysts
believe that Akzo is better placed to benefit from an upturn in the global
economy.
Philips put on 40 cents to Fl 24.90 ahead of tomorrow's results while
Elsevier lost Fl 2 to Fl106.20.
BRUSSELS eased with the Bel-20 index down 1.5 to 1,136.28. Petrofina
recovered BFr25 to BFr10,975 with 20,760 shares traded. Solvay was BFr75
stronger at BFr12,550 while Electrabel put on BFr50 to BFr4,555.
VIENNA rebounded but trading was light as the 18-share ATX index climbed
3.69 to 770.6.
STOCKHOLM advanced in thin trading as the Affarsvarlden General Index rose
4.9 864.3 in turnover of SKr274m after SKr182m.

FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes easier
after another lethargic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average closed marginally lower after another slow session, as
continuing lethargy weighed on investor sentiment, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 16.86 at 15,692.59. The index fell to the day's
low of 15,600.76 in the morning on selling by dealers, but gradually
improved on index-linked buying to reach 15,957.45 in the afternoon. Late
afternoon profit-taking then depressed share prices and pushed the Nikkei
back into negative territory.
Volume totalled a thin 150m shares, but exceeded Monday's 121m, a 10-year
low. Declines led rises by 669 to 254, with 140 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks shed 7.27 to 1,200.17, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 4.19 to 962.38.
Traders are becoming concerned that new public offerings will inflict
further damage on an already sliding market. Initial public offerings
resumed in May after a six-month suspension. Yamazaki Construction, which
made its debut on the over-the-counter market this week, has been trading at
10 per cent below its initial offering price.
In spite of the market weakness, some 200 companies have completed listing
preparations and are waiting for final approval. The Transport Ministry has
also indicated its determination to float shares in JR East, a part of the
former state-run Japan National Railways, by the end of this fiscal year.
Mr Keiwa Okuda, transport minister, said yesterday that JR East will file an
application for listing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the end of this
month. The Transport Ministry will negotiate with the Finance Ministry for a
listing by early October.
Dealers continued to take profits on speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk
Products, the day's most active issue, fell Y31 to Y804 and Okamoto
Industries lost Y25 to Y995.
Nippon Housing Loan, which is facing large problem loans, slipped Y10 to
Y157. Reports of the company's involvement in stock price manipulation, and
alleged tax evasion discouraged investors.
High-technology issues rose on buying by dealers. NEC moved ahead Y15 to
Y765 and Hitachi Y10 to Y730.
Bank shares lost ground. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y40 to Y1,710 and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,260.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 92.97 to 17,533.89 in volume of 6.8m
shares. Small-lot selling by dealers depressed Ono Pharmaceutical, which
receded Y150 to Y5,450, and Omron, down Y60 at Y1,070.
Roundup
PACIFIC Basin markets concentrated on local issues yesterday.
HONG KONG retreated on rumours of a rights issue by Hutchison Whampoa and a
covered warrant issue by HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng index relinquished
50.95 to 5,859.78 in turnover of HKDollars 2.05bn.
HSBC declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53 and Hutchison Whampoa surrendered
50 cents to HKDollars 15.80.
SINGAPORE improved as investors sought blue chip stocks. The Straits Times
Industrial index gained 10.77 to 1,455.75 and rises outpaced falls by 113 to
85. SIA foreign shares advanced 30 cents to SDollars 17.40.
SEOUL fell on unsubstantiated rumours that Mr Kim Woo-choong, chairman of
Daewoo Group, was planning to set up his own political party. The index
closed 7.15 off at 501.48 in Won127.7bn turnover.
TAIWAN advanced in thin trading. The weighted index gained 16.1 to 4,088.18
in turnover of TDollars 16.5bn. Plastics and electronics led the gains, with
Acer rising 20 cents to TDollars 19.
MANILA rose on bargain hunting. The weighted index put on 12.16 to 1,491.98
in turnover of 106m pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index edged up 0.72 to 602.11, but declines led
rises by 137 to 97. Telekom Malaysia firmed 10 cents to MDollars 14.
AUSTRALIA lost ground in dull trading. The All Ordinaries index shed 4.8 to
1,612.5. News that Woolworths was to be floated by its parent, Adsteam,
later this year helped other retailers move ahead. Adsteam gained 3 cents to
28 cents, while David Jones rose 8 cents to 37 cents.
NEW ZEALAND saw a strong rally in the second-line issues. The NZSE-40 index
appreciated 6.15 to 1,561.33 in turnover of NZDollars 21.92m.
BANGKOK lost early gains in the afternoon session, leaving the SET index a
net 2.74 down at 754.48. Turnover came to Bt9.14bn. Declines outscored
advances by 130 to 96.
There was active trading in finance and property shares, with Bangkok Land
down Bt4 to Bt138.
BOMBAY drifted lower in thin trading as heavy rain kept traders away. The
BSE index finished 36.16, or 1.3 per cent, off at 2,686.49.

FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fears Chinese wool boost may
not last - Prices are holding last season's gains but the outlook is unclear

THE NEW Zealand wool season has begun with prices holding on to the gains
achieved last season. But the Wool Board warns that the surge in Chinese
demand that did much to fuel last season's price recovery may not be
maintained this year.
Last season was seen as a turning point. Though farmers' returns were
generally lower than in the previous season because of the loss of the
minimum price support scheme, the season's average price rose 4 per cent
from 422 to 437 NZ cents (Pounds 1.25) a kilogram.
Looking ahead, the board says the demand outlook from developed countries
appears positive in the new season, though growth rates will remain low.
Allowing for the 10 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar since
last December, prices of New Zealand wool have not increased significantly
in overseas currency terms, enabling it to maintain its price
competitiveness with artificial fibres.
The board expects the supply of New Zealand wool to drop slightly with a
fall in production and a continued reduction of stockpiled wool from board
stocks. In its annual review, it says much will depend, as in the past, on
the centrally-planned economies.
'The Chinese economy is in danger of overheating as it did in 1988, which
suggests their high level of purchases last season may not be maintained.'
This would particularly affect prices of medium micron wools.
Sales to Russia are likely to depend on the availability of credit, while
exports to the Indian subcontinent may also decline as demand for
hand-knotted rugs eases in developed countries.
'However, these negative factors are expected to be offset by increased
demand from the developed economies as they emerge from recession' the board
says.
The season began on a weak note in July because of the suspension of the
minimum price scheme in February and worries about high stocks and world
recession. Prices deteriorated rapidly, hitting a 45-year low in October of
369 NZ cents a kilogram. If prices had stayed at that level wool farming
would have become uneconomic.
Devaluation of the currency and better demand saw prices begin to firm,
reaching peaks of 515 cents a kilogram in late February and 530 cents in
late April before dropping back to close the season in June at 468 cents. In
the first sale of the new season on July 31 the index closed at 471 cents.
The high level of prices at the time of the seasonal production peak, which
surprised traders, was caused by short-term hiccups in supply and
unexpectedly strong demand. In part, this appeared to be because European
manufacturers needed to buy to keep their mills going at a time when they
were keeping their stock positions low because of the recession.
The second peak of the season in April and May coincided with the
announcement that the board was negotiating a sale to Russia, formerly one
of New Zealand's most important customers. The board says the prospect of
the sale and its effect on prices then is an indicator of what will happen
when the former Soviet republics eventually return to the market.
The Russian sale, from board stocks, has yet to be finalised. The agreement
in principle followed the signing of western loan agreements with Russia,
and it was expected that the board would be able to sell 16,000 tonnes of
wool, worth NZDollars 100m.
The board says the recovery occurred in spite of negative influences.
Economic growth rates in western economies remained low, while the
Commonwealth of Independent States purchased minimal quantities during the
season. However, the New Zealand industry managed to sell a greatly
increased volume of wool.
As production fell 3 per cent, the board reduced its stockpile from 72,000
to 53,400 clean tonnes. The provisional figure for wool production last
season shows a 3 per cent drop to 221,000 clean tonnes. Total sales at
auction dropped 9 per cent while private sales rose 18 per cent, taking
their share of the market to 27 per cent.
Sheep numbers fell 5 per cent to 54.3m, the lowest since June 1965.
Provisional trade figures show wool exports rose 22 per cent to 230,000
clean tonnes, worth 12 per cent more at NZDollars 1.08bn. Wool product
exports also rose 12 per cent to bring the grant total to NZDollars 1.307bn.
Wool was New Zealand's third largest export after meat and dairy products.
China dominated the market taking 21 per cent of all exports buying 48,000
tonnes, while some of the 10,000 tonnes shipped to Hong Kong also went to
China.
Australia's struggling wool industry was dealt another blow yesterday when
South Australian police said they were investigating allegations of a
substitution racket involving wool destined for export, reports Reuter from
Sydney.
Police said documents were seized from premises in Port Adelaide on Tuesday
but no charges were laid.
The alleged fraud involves the substitution of poorer grades of wool for
fine grades stored in a warehouse after sale. Details were not released.
But a senior official of the Australian Wool Corporation said the
allegations could not have come at a worse time for the industry, which has
been hurt by world recession, fashion changes and weak demand from China and
Eastern Europe.
'Anything that has the potential to cause customers of our product to be
apprehensive about its use is something which stands to cause us damage,'
said Mr Peter Wallace, the AWC's general manager of industry services.
'Markets are clearly sensitive to information which questions the quality of
the product.'

FT  05 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian sugar mills await
further export release
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN SUGAR mills are awaiting cabinet approval for the release of a
further 500,000 tonnes of exports during the current year. The proposal by
the Indian Sugar Mills Association to export this additional quantity has
already been approved by the ministries of commerce and food.
Indian sugar exports so far this year amount to 275,000 tonnes. Last year
the country exported 525,000 tonnes.
In a recent submission to the prime minister's office, ISMA said that in
view of the bumper production of 13.4m tonnes of sugar during the 1991-92
(October-September) season, compared with 12m tonnes last year, India could
easily export up to 1m tonnes, worth about Rs8bn (Pounds 140m).
'Even though export is a losing proposition for the industry, we must sell
1m tonnes abroad to manage the surplus,' said Mr Om Dhanuka, spokesman for
ISMA.
The Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim Corporation, which handles exports
for the industry, has sold to buyers in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Yemen, Kenya, Bulgaria and Russia.
Bumper sugar production for three consecutive years has convinced the
federal government that India must remain a regular exporter of the
commodity. The long-term export strategy that is being formulated will
provide for a minimum export every year, irrespective of the size of sugar
production. According to Mr Dhanuka, the government accepts that foreign
buyers must see India as a regular source of supply.
The government believes that for the strategy to be effective it will have
to provide for the creation of a buffer stock and import of sugar in times
of shortage.
According to ISMA, the government should create a buffer stock of 1m tonnes
out of more than 4m tonnes of sugar to be carried over into 1992-93.
Maintaining the stock would not strain government finances as there is
already a levy of Rs9 a quintal (100 kg) on the industry for the purpose.

London COCOA prices rose on the back of an overnight surge in New York,
which also opened steadier than expected yesterday. The market's continued
strength was even more remarkable given talk of origin sales - perhaps
25,000 tonnes of Ivorian cocoa and some Ghanaian. On the LME three-month
COPPER prices continued to meander around Dollars 2,500 a tonne. A decline
of 4,600 tonnes in warehouse stocks to 15-month lows aided sentiment as
withdrawals were expected to tail off during the summer. TIN clawed back
some lost ground in the afternoon; three-month metal closed above earlier
eight-week lows of Dollars 6,650 a tonne, but prices remained soft, with the
market depressed by speculative selling and a lack of consumer purchases.
GOLD and PLATINUM showed little movement on the London bullion market as the
second day of the strike in South Africa spurred no new buying. Overnight
news that Uruguay's Central Bank had sold 50,000 ounces of gold in July for
about Dollars 17.9m created no impact although the bank said it was part of
a new policy of converting its gold reserves into dollar and mark
denominated fixed-term deposits.

short crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of a big drop in the raw jute crop because of the near absence of
pre-monsoon showers, the Indian government is allowing shippers to export up
to 150,000 bales (180 kg each) to hard currency areas during the 1992-93
(July-June) season.
According to Mr RN De, the jute commissioner, the objective is to make
India, which is the second largest exporter of jute goods after Bangladesh,
a regular exporter of raw jute.
The government has stipulated that medium and inferior grades must comprise
at least 80 per cent of cut jute exports and 75 per cent of uncut exports.
This makes exporting a difficult proposition, says Mr Shankar Ladia,
spokesman for the shippers. And foreign buyers do not like the idea of the
Jute Corporation of India, a government undertaking, being the sole agency
to certify the 'quality, condition and weight of export consignments'.
The only thing in the shippers favour is that international jute prices are
higher than Indian domestic prices.
Last year India could ship only 11,000 the 200,000 bales sanctioned because
there was hardly any demand for medium and inferior grades. While last year,
the entire quantity was sold to the US and European buyers, Mr Ladia thinks
India can find buyers for jute in Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Egypt.
An Indian jute team will soon be visiting Pakistan, according to Mr De.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Milan awaits the Mif's debut
 -Haig Simonian looks at a new market in government futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's new government bond futures market will start trading on September
11, the Italian Treasury announced. This will be two months behind schedule,
but still ahead of some dealers' worst expectations.
The new market, which will use the existing screen-based 'primary dealers'
system for cash trading, comes almost exactly a year after dealings in
futures on 10-year Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali (BTPs) started at the Matif
in Paris and Liffe in London. While trading in Paris has virtually
evaporated, Italian bond futures have become one of Liffe's most successful
products. Average trading volumes for Liffe's BTP future were running at
26,755 a day last month, while the exchange registered a new turnover record
of 67,625 contracts changing hands on June 3.
The arrival of a futures contract in Italy will mirror the competition that
emerged when German government bund futures, devised by Liffe, were
introduced on the new Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) in Frankfurt. Supported by
domestic banks, the DTB last month accounted for around one-quarter of total
bund futures trading, against three-quarters in London.
Dealers in Milan doubt the new Italian exchange, dubbed the Mif, will
quickly win such a big market share. However, the domestic venture could
offer Liffe stiff competition.
Contract specifications on the Mif are very similar to those in London,
apart from the contract's nominal value, which is expected to be L250m
against L200m in London.
Dealers say the new Italian contract could appeal to a different type of
user than that on Liffe. Although two Italian banks are now members of the
London exchange and others trade heavily through brokers, it is expected
that the new domestic market will be dominated by financial institutions.
By contrast, international banks and fund managers are likely to keep their
focus on London, dealers believe. That applies particularly to the handful
of investment banks which have developed sophisticated arbitrage techniques
between cash and futures markets in different currencies. 'With its range of
government bond futures, Liffe offers arbitrage opportunities unavailable on
a domestic market featuring just one government's debt,' said one trader.
The Italian authorities have pushed hard for the creation of a domestic
futures market, one of a string of innovations brought in under last year's
umbrella law introducing the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim),
Italy's stockbroking and fund management body. The Sims law paved the way
for the creation of a new clearing house to operate in both the cash equity
market and for bond futures, as well as initiating the detailed technical
and legal framework for futures trading. Clearing software and technical
assistance has come from ICCH, the London-based clearing organisation, while
trading software has been prepared by STM, the Canadian company which worked
on the cash 'primary dealers' market.
Prestige apart, creating a new domestic futures exchange could have
important structural consequences for the Italian economy and monetary
management. During recent weeks of turbulence in the government bond market
caused by doubts about the government's economic policy and uncertainty over
the lira, trading in bond futures on Liffe acted as a beacon for the
domestic cash market, dictating prices.
With futures markets increasingly setting the pace for cash market trading,
it may be that the Bank of Italy preferred to have a futures exchange
operating more closely under its wary eye than in London.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Boost to Ecu sector from Bank
of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England yesterday gave an important boost to the Ecu securities
markets when it announced its intention to build a same-day Ecu clearing and
settlement system by next summer.
The development of this key piece of market infrastructure, with the backing
of the central bank, was welcomed by market participants yesterday, who said
that it would add to London's appeal as a centre for the Ecu financial
markets.
The Bank said its new European Settlements Office would be based on an
electronic book-entry transfer system, similar to those it already operates
for gilts and sterling money market instruments.
The arrangement would help the development of the Ecu markets by
strengthening collateralised lending of the currency, encouraging the
development of the repo market in Ecu securities.
According to the Bank, banks have already given their commitment in
principle to join the European Settlements Office. A number have also agreed
to provide custodial services.
Half the Ecu bond market makers yesterday tightened the spreads between
their buying and selling prices, repairing some of the damage done to
investors' confidence when market makers suspended dealings between each
other 12 days ago.
After suspending normal market making for one day, banks had agreed to
resume last week at wider spreads to protect themselves in the face of heavy
selling of Ecu securities.
Yesterday, spreads for large liquid issues were halved again from 20c to
10c, with quotes being firm for amounts up to Ecu5m. However, the tighter
spreads were quoted only by 22 of the 44 Ecu market makers, reinforcing
claims by the leading banks that many of their rivals have never been fully
committed to the market.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Bonds: German finance agency in Pounds 100m
Eurobond issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KREDITANSTALT fur Wiederaufbau, the German finance agency, launched a
well-timed Pounds 100m Eurobond, which benefitted from Monday's rally in
gilt prices, but was virtually sold out ahead of yesterday's market
weakness.
The Pounds 100m issue due 2008, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, met
strong demand from UK institutions, who bought the deal up quickly. The
yield spread of 25 basis points more than the comparable gilt was considered
quite attractive, offering a slight pickup over Gefco's recent Pounds 100m
issue at a 22 basis point yield spread.
The spread on the KFW deal had tightened to 23 basis points by the end of
trading, due to the weakness in the gilts market.
Dealers said the continued switching by UK fund managers from equities to
bonds is benefitting sterling bond offerings.
There was also some demand from continental Europe, especially Germany,
despite continued concerns about the weakness of sterling.
The Pounds 100m deal was swapped into floating rate D-Marks (Pounds 75m) and
floating-rate sterling (Pounds 25m). The swaps market is illiquid beyond
10-year maturities, but BZW found a corporate counterparty willing to pay
fixed rate over more than 15 years.
Supply of sterling bonds is likely to remain sluggish, despite demand from
investors, due to generally poor swap opportunities.
Meanwhile, two more deals emerged in the Australian dollar sector, where
demand has been strong since the market rally in the wake of last week's
positive news on inflation.
The State Bank of New South Wales launched an ADollars 150m issue of 9 per
cent Eurobonds due 2002, arranged by Deutsche Bank, and Provence Alpes-Cote
d'Azur, the French regional authority, launched an ADollars 100m seven-year
deal via Hambros Bank. Both deals met firm demand, although the State Bank
deal performed more strongly due to the higher coupon and the more familiar
name. The State Bank deal was bid at less 1 1/2 points, well within fees of
2 1/8 points.
However, the deal by Provence Alpes, which launched its first foreign bond
in the Swiss franc market in January, also performed well, to trade within
fees of 2 points.
United Newspapers, which publishes the Daily and Sunday Express, has
refinanced some of its Pounds 400m of debt in the US private placement
market. The company has completed a Dollars 100m seven-year private
placement, arranged by Chase Manhattan. The deal is believed to have been
priced to yield 120 basis points above the seven-year US Treasury.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: IEL to float leading Australian
retailer
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY, PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL Equity (IEL), the Australian investment group which owns
Woolworths, the country's second-largest retailer, ended months of
speculation yesterday by announcing plans to float the store group by
October.
The flotation is expected to be Australia's largest, probably raising more
than ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.49bn), though no financial details were given
yesterday.
IEL is controlled jointly by David Jones, Tooth &amp; Co and Adelaide Steamship
Company,
all members of the former corporate empire of Mr John Spalvins, the
Sydney-based entrepreneur. They are now operating under arrangements with
their bankers.
The latter three companies are entitled to 52 per cent of the issue, but
said yesterday they would pass that entitlement on to their shareholders.
Once cross-shareholdings are cancelled out, about 48 per cent of the issue
will be offered as entitlements to the three companies' shareholders, with
the remaining 52 per cent available for public subscription.
Woolworths shares will be listed on the Australian and New York stock
exchanges, with the flotation price determined by tenders from institutional
investors.
The flotation proceeds will be used to retire all IEL's debt and some of
that of Adsteam, Tooth and David Jones. It is understood that IEL plans to
make the issue widely available to the Australian public.
The announcement follows Monday's disclosure by Woolworths of a 13 per cent
rise in net profits to ADollars 247m for the year to June, on sales 11 per
cent ahead at ADollars 9.18bn, defying the trend of a depressed Australian
retail sector. State Government Insurance Office (SGIO), the Western
Australia stated-owned general insurance business, is to be privatised
through a public flotation, Reuter reports from Perth.
Mr Carmen Lawrence, state premier, said legislation would be introduced this
year to enable the sale to go ahead. The state government said in February
it would sell all of SGIO and up to 49 per cent of the state-owned R&amp;I Bank
of Western Australia.
A statement gave no financial details or a timetable for the float.
SGIO's parent, the State Government Insurance Commission, will remain
government-owned but will be reconstituted as the Insurance Commission of
Western Australia.

rationalisation

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJI Heavy Industries (FHI), the Japanese carmaker, is to eliminate almost
half its Subaru model variations, in the most sweeping rationalisation of
product lines which Japan's economic downturn has yet forced on its crowded
automotive sector.
The move is part of a 30-month programme announced yesterday by FHI under
which it plans to return to pre-tax profits of Y4bn (Dollars 31.4m) in the
current year to March - double its previous forecast - and Y26bn by 1994-95.
The company incurred parent pre-tax losses of Y4.1bn last year, its second
year in the red. Mr Isamu Kawai, president, expects to resume dividends
during the rationalisation programme. FHI last made a payout, of Y6 per
share, in 1989-90.
In common with larger Japanese carmakers such as Nissan, which holds 4 per
cent of FHI, it offers a large range of model variants, numbering about 400.
These are to be shrunk to nearer 200, while costs will be cut through a
greater standardising of components.
The move may trigger similar announcements elsewhere. All Japan's nine
carmakers are studying using parts common to different models and in some
cases, for simpler items such as bolts, even co-ordinating procurement with
rivals. ranges.
As a result of the measures, domestic sales of Subaru, known for minicars
and four-wheel-drive vehicles, are forecast to rise to 377,000 units by the
year to March 1995 from 360,000 this year. Export sales are expected to
remain flat at just above 200,000.
The economic slowdown, which pulled Japan's domestic car sales lower by 6.5
per cent last year, shows few signs of easing. Figures this week from the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association show a 6.9 per cent drop in new
registrations in July from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
NIPPON Housing Loan, Japan's largest home-loan company, has cut interest
payments to leading banks to try to overcome a sharp rise in its
non-performing loans.
Seven Japanese housing loan companies have sought financial assistance from
their leading banks, and Nippon Housing has sought the help of the nine
banks which founded it in 1971.
However, Nippon Housing is now in dispute with several of the banks, which
oppose its unilateral decision to reduce the interest rate on its loans. The
company had cut the rate to 3.75 per cent, the same as the official discount
rate, and this week decided to reduce it to 3.25 per cent.
Nippon Housing, now a listed company, has an estimated Y1,200bn (Dollars
9.43bn) in non-performing loans, and reported an 87 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits for the year to March. The company also said it had Y23.4bn in
unrealised losses on securities holdings.
The plight of the home-loan industry is indicative of the pressure on
Japanese financial institutions, which have been forced to accept reduced or
even no interest payments from clients bruised by the stock market crash and
the property price slump.
At the end of March, Sakura Bank had about Y226bn in loans outstanding to
Nippon Housing, while Sanwa Bank had Y199bn in loans.

<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, has unveiled
underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with
Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991.
Mr Wilson Taylor, Cigna's chairman, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide
property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses, particularly from
the Los Angeles riots.
The company had already warned its results would fall below analysts'
expectations of about Dollars 1.25 a share, but did not give specific
reasons.
Mr Taylor said the company was reviewing its London property and casualty
reinsurance operations because of recent concerns about the London
reinsurance market.
Cigna's pre-tax catastrophe losses climbed to Dollars 55m, including Dollars
39m from the Los Angeles riots, from Dollars 11m a year earlier. Net income
for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 125m, or Dollars 1.74 a share,
including one-time gains of Dollars 47m. A year earlier, Cigna net income
was Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.38, including one-time after-tax gains of
Dollars 36m.
For the first half, Cigna recorded net income of Dollars 231m, or Dollars
3.22 a share, including after-tax gains of Dollars 70m. For the same period
of 1991, it earned Dollars 218m, or Dollars 3.05 a share, including
extraordinary gains of Dollars 41m.
Premiums and fees for the group overall in the second quarter were Dollars
3.45bn, against Dollars 3.6bn a year ago, while net investment income
totalled Dollars 970m against Dollars 960m. For the first half, premiums and
fees stood at Dollars 6.9bn while net investment income totalled Dollars
1.96bn. A year earlier, premiums and fees were Dollars 7.2bn while net
investment income was Dollars 1.93bn.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Record results at Bear Stearns
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEAR Stearns, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday reported a 57 per
cent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 78.8m in the
wake of strong trading revenues and a buoyant underwriting business.
It was the second-best quarterly performance in the firm's history, and took
Bear Stearns' earnings for the full year, which ended on June 30, to a
record Dollars 294.6m, more than double the Dollars 142.9m earned a year
earlier.
The firm's return on the equity for the year was 28 per cent, also a record.
Bear Stearns said earnings in the fourth quarter were up across all of its
departments, but singled out the 47 per cent increase in revenues from
trading, especially in mortgage-backed securities, convertible bonds and
government securities.
Investment banking revenues were also significantly higher, thanks to
increased stock and bond underwriting during the quarter.
The pattern of earnings for the whole year was much the same, with
investment banking leading the way, aided by big contributions from areas
including asset securitisation and high-yield/bankruptcy business, municipal
trading and public finance, and emerging markets operations.
Bear Stearns was also helped during the year by cost-cutting measures,
including the move of its clearing and operations personnel from Manhattan
to Brooklyn in New York and similar relocations in Chicago, Boston and
London.
The decision to bring all of the firm's data processing activities in-house
was also completed during the year, and should result in a 'several million
dollar' reduction of annual data processing costs beginning in fiscal year
1993.
Mr Alan Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, believes
that the firm can improve on its record annual results.
He said: 'We have momentum and our job is to try to keep it going.'

CHASE Manhattan, the second-biggest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit
cards in the US, yesterday said it would offer lower variable interest rates
to more than half of its credit card holders in a move which reflects the
competitiveness of the plastic card industry, writes Karen Zagor.
The announcement comes just months after Citibank, the biggest US issuer,
offered lower rates to its better customers.
The reduced variable rates will take effect when Classic Card balances
exceed Dollars 2,000, and Gold Card balances exceed Dollars 3,500. Members
in good standing will also have a choice between their current fixed rate or
a variable rate.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the large US foods and tobacco group, yesterday formed a new
international foods division and hired Mr Richard Thoman, a former top
executive at American Express, as its president.
The 48-year-old Mr Thoman, who was previously a co-chief executive of the
travel related services (TRS) division of American Express and the man in
charge of international banking operations, will become president of Nabisco
International.
He will be one of four RJR division heads reporting to Mr Louis Gerstner,
the RJR Nabisco chairman who resigned as president of American Express three
years ago.
Mr Thoman was replaced as co-chief executive of the American Express TRS
division last October, as was Mr Ed Cooperman, who also left American
Express and now works as a senior executive for Mr Sandy Weill, another
former American Express president who is chairman of Primerica, the
financial services group.
The American Express TRS division, the core of the travel and financial
services group, suffered a more-than-halved 1991 net income of Dollars 396m.
The main cause was large losses at the Optioma credit card business in the
US, a business that was not Mr Thoman's direct responsibility.
Mr Thoman and Mr Cooperman were replaced as chief executive of TRS by Mr
Harvey Golub, who was named the new president of American Express a year
ago. Mr Thoman left American Express in February of this year and remained a
consultant until June.
The Nabisco international foods division that Mr Thoman will run is
estimated by analysts to have had 1991 revenues of about Dollars 800m,
against total foods revenues of Dollars 6.5bn. The international foods
business has a workforce of 13,200, out of a total of 36,000 employees in
the Nabisco foods business.
Mr Gerstner said the recruiting of Mr Thoman was aimed at 'underscoring this
company's commitment in the international food arena.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FALCONBRIDGE, the metals producer jointly owned by Noranda of Canada and
Sweden's Trelleborg group, boosted second-quarter earnings by almost 40 per
cent, despite sharply lower nickel prices.
The Toronto-based company said net income rose to CDollars 13.8m (USDollars
11.6m) from CDollars 9.9m a year earlier. The latest figure includes a
CDollars 5.2m charge for an early retirement programme at the Kidd Creek
mine in northern Ontario.
Mr Lars-Eric Johansson, chief financial officer, ascribed the improvement to
lower interest rates, a higher zinc price and lower unit costs.
Operating income tumbled to CDollars 14.4m from CDollars 59.9m, while
revenues fell to CDollars 412.5m from CDollars 463.5m.
Nickel sales fell to 14,400 tonnes in the second quarter at an average price
of Dollars 3.43 per lb, from 14,600 tonnes at an average of Dollars 4.07 per
lb a year earlier.
The company sold 6,600 tonnes of ferro-nickel at an average price of Dollars
3.35 per lb, compared with 8,000 tonnes at Dollars 3.99 per lb last year.
The weak nickel market has led Falconbridge to close both furnaces of its
facility in the Dominican Republic during August.
In addition, the Sudbury division in Ontario will take an extended five-week
summer shutdown.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN PACIFIC, the diversified holding company, yesterday unveiled
disappointing second-quarter and first-half results. However, the group said
heavy grain movements, strong oil and gas output and improved forest
products markets would help in the second half.
CP subsidiaries in trans-portation, energy, and forest products continued to
feel the recession, while real est-ate and hotels improved their
performances.
Second-quarter profits were CDollars 21m (USDollars 17.7m), or 6 cents a
share, against CDollars 30.9m, or 10 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of
CDollars 2.5bn against CDollars 2.6bn. But the first half showed a loss of
CDollars 18.7m compared with profit of CDollars 25.6m on revenues of
CDollars 4.89bn, against CDollars 5.06bn last time.
CP Rail weakened in the second quarter when grain movements declined.
Overall traffic dipped 7 per cent because of labour disputes in some western
industries, but it said that grain movements should recover in the second
half.
The coal unit's performance improved in the first half. A strike has halted
coal shipments from Vancouver but talks are under way to try to resolve the
dispute.
Forest products losses rose in the first half, but pulp and newsprint prices
have recently firmed and markets should strengthen in the second half. The
deterioration in the first half was partly offset by a lower Canadian dollar
and reduced production costs.
Marathon Realty had first-half operating income of CDollars 123m, up
CDollars 50m, from higher sales of land and buildings. Rental income fell
because of the recession while hotels gained from higher efficiency and
improved average room rates. The US Doubletree hotels also did better.
The machinery group improved with a strong performance by the Litwin
petrochemical engineering unit. The recession continued to affect 19 per
cent-owned Laidlaw, the big North American waste management group.
Cascades, a fast-expanding international packaging group, earned first-half
profits of CDollars 12.3m, or 23 cents a share, against CDollars 3.4m, or 7
cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 425m against CDollars 422m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA BANK, Norway's second-biggest commercial bank, said yesterday
that first-half net losses narrowed sharply to NKr162m (Dollars 27.8m) from
NKr1.637bn in the same period last year.
The bank also reduced the amount its wants as emergency state funding from
NKr750m to NKr685m to enable it to meet stricter capital adequacy
requirements to be implemented by the end of the year. Last year,
Christiania received state funds of NKr7.864bn.
Christiania was acquired by the state last year after its share capital was
wiped out by large losses. The bank was de-listed from the bourse and
shareholders were given an option to acquire up to 25 per cent of the
state's shares. Some 2.3 per cent of Christiania's share capital has been
taken up by private investors. A decision to relist the bank in Oslo could
be made by the end of next month.
Christiania lifted first-half net interest income to NKr1.555bn from
NKr1.413bn last year. Profits from foreign exchange and securities' trading
dipped to NKr260m from NKr283m, as non-interest expenses were cut to
NKr1.447bn from NKr1.769bn in last year's comparative period.
Christiania reduced staff by 20 per cent during the last 18 months as part
of a state instruction to reduce costs by 15 per cent. Costs were reduced by
21 per cent by the end of the second quarter.
First-half credit losses fell to NKr1bn from NKr1.9bn, but Mr Borger A.
Lenth, chief executive, said credit losses were still at an unacceptable
level. He pointed out that the value of collateral for loans was still
declining.
He expressed concern over the development of the domestic economy and over a
reduction in the volume of the bank's loans and said that if the bank saw a
further, strong reduction in loan volume, it would be necessary to evaluate
the bank's branch network. Should the bank be forced to consolidate further,
additional redundancies could be necessary, he warned.
He said that it would need NKr685m to meet capital adequacy requirements by
the end of the year, compared with its first-quarter estimate of NKr750m.

<TEXT>
AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a 14.6 per cent rise in
second-quarter net profit, double the 7 per cent rate of growth recorded in
the first quarter.
The company said that economic uncertainties and the weaker dollar would
make it more difficult to post a profit rise in the second half, but it
predicted that full-year profit before extraordinary items would be higher
than in 1991.
An improved performance in chemical products, the biggest of the group's
four divisions, was the main factor behind the rise in second-quarter net
profit to Fl 218.3m (Dollars 130.7m) from Fl 190.5m a year earlier. The
increase brought first-half group net profit to Fl 424.1m, a gain of 10.8
per cent from the first six months of 1991. Turnover in the first half was
up 3.3 per cent at Fl 8.82bn.
The chemical products division saw second-quarter operating profit nearly
double to Fl 94m from Fl 49m in the same quarter of 1991, when results had
been weighed down by maintenance work at some facilities.
Pharmaceuticals, the smallest division by turnover but the biggest in terms
of profits, posted operating results of Fl 140m, up only slightly from Fl
139m a year earlier. Akzo said growth in results had been held back by the
cost of setting up a US marketing force for the company's Marvelon
contraceptive pill, for which it hoped to win US regulatory approval by the
end of the year.
Elsewhere, operating results in coatings rose to Fl 113m from Fl 99m, while
profits in fibres showed a small increase to Fl 40m from Fl 38m.

SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, lifted sales
by 5 per cent to DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.23bn) in the first six months of this
year.
Earnings at DM179m were down 4 per cent compared with the same period last
year. Lower profits from subsidiaries were blamed, but Schering forecast
that earnings for the year would be slightly above the record DM274m earned
in 1991.
The DM660m sale of Schering's industrial and organic chemicals operations to
Witco Corporation in the US was cited as a contributing factor to the
projected higher earnings.
Schering said it wanted to concentrate on pharmaceuticals and plant
protection chemicals as its market share in the other sectors was too low to
permit expansion.
Pharmaceuticals sales in the first half rose 14 per cent to DM1.9bn,
contributing 57 per cent to total turnover. Agro-chemicals, which made up 25
per cent of sales, fell 10 per cent to DM857m. Schering placed
responsibility on drought conditions in Europe and recent EC agricultural
measures.
The company said a decision was expected in the next few days on the sale of
Schering's electroplating division. Negotiations were continuing with a US
company. Electroplating sales fell in the first half by 5 per cent to
DM143m.

J BOUTARI, the largest Greek wine producer, is extending a successful joint
venture agreement in marketing and distribution with United Distillers, the
British spirits company.
Under a new agreement with a 20-year duration, the companies each hold a 50
per cent stake in United Distillers Boutari, the joint venture.
UDB was set up in 1989 under a three-year agreement by which Boutari
distributed the British company's products in Greece.
UDB's sales rose from Dr2.6bn (Dollars 14m) in 1989 to Dr8.9bn in 1991,
reflecting rapid growth in consumption of imported spirits, partly at the
expense of traditional Greek wines and aperitifs. Pre-tax profits rose from
Dr408m to Dr1.6bn over the same period.
Under the new agreement, UDB will market both Boutari wines and United
Distillers products through the Boutari network in mainland Greece and the
Aegean islands.
United Distillers is to provide Boutari with a cash injection, reportedly
amounting to Dr7bn, out of its share of UDB's future earnings.

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDERS ECKOFF, an Oslo lawyer, has been proposed as the new chairman of
the board of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, to replace
Mr Thorleif Borge.
The proposal offers a seat on the board to Mr Rune Brantinger, president of
Sweden's Soedra Skogagarna, while four existing Uni board members have been
asked to stay on. An extraordinary meeting on August 10 of Uni's board of
representatives is widely expected to endorse the proposal for a new board.
Uni's board tendered its resignation at the end of last month when Mr Jan
Erik Langangen announced his surprise resignation.
In recent months, Mr Langangen had been sharply criticised by shareholders
for his decision to invest NKr4.7bn (Dollars 805m) to acquire a 28.3 per
cent stake in Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer, then failing to
succeed in his strategy to create a pan-Nordic insurance alliance with
Skandia at its centre.
Uni's biggest shareholders earlier said a new board must recapture power
over the company from its executive leadership, where it had languished
under Mr Langangen. The proposal of Mr Eckoff comes as a surprise. Several
shareholders had wanted Mr Torvild Aakvaag, a board member and chairman of
Norsk Hydro, to replace Mr Borge. His appointment would have restored
credibility and confidence in Uni, they said.
Mr Eckoff, 49, has broad experience from 'clean-up' jobs within Norway's
industrial sector and is a member of the board of Elkem, the big Norwegian
light metals producer.
Mr Georg Krogh, an executive representing Uni's sixth-biggest shareholder,
said the appointment of Mr Eckoff could restore Uni's credibility.
One priority for the new board will be to decide the fate of Uni's executive
management, loyalists to Mr Langangen.

FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Looking to the future as present
put on hold - Andrew Baxter returns to the FT Six and finds earlier optimism
about the recession has been dampened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We're getting plenty of inquiries, but that's because a lot of our
customers have plenty of time. They've b - - - - - all else to do.'
'The General Election is well and truly forgotten, and there doesn't seem to
be any residual euphoria.'
'The UK market is as dead as dead can be.'
THESE GLOOMY statements come from three of the six engineering companies
taking part in an occasional Financial Times survey tracking the sector out
of the recession.
They confirm the recent evidence from manufacturing industry on the outlook
for the domestic market. It may not be worsening, but there is a long haul
to recovery.
Encouragingly, though, this second instalment in the series, which began on
April 14, finds the six companies have maintained their new pro-duct
development programmes, clearly mindful of the old adage that new products
sell better in a recession than more established lines.
The first article, published a few days after the election, had ended on a
hopeful note. JCB had taken on about 100 new workers at its main Rocester,
Staffordshire, plant in preparation for an expected increase in orders.
There were seasonal factors behind JCB's move, but along with the other five
companies it was also hoped that the Tories' election win would spark their
markets into life. Sadly, said Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman, 'the
hope has not come to fruition'.
Indeed last month's forecast from the Engineering Employers Federation,
postponing any marked upturn in engineering output by as much as six months
to late this year, is echoed by the FT Six. Similarly, their forecasts of
reduced job cuts fit in with the EEF prediction.
'I still think there will be some small improvement in the second half of
this year,' said Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director of 600 Group, 'but six
months ago I would have predicted much stronger growth.'
The past three months have brought a number of important developments:
Rationalisation - Fenner (which halved its interim dividend) is closing some
of its transmission manufacturing operations in Hull with the loss of 200
jobs. Smaller job cuts have been made at 600 Group and Senior, and a
reorganisation in Bloxwich's automotive business has cost 20 jobs.
Investment - Senior announced a projected Pounds 8m investment in a new
company, Flexonics Automotive, within its engineering products business
area.
Supported by the Welsh Development Agency, the company will produce a range
of stainless steel fittings for vehicle exhausts from a site at Crumlin,
Gwent, employing up to 260 people.
New products - 600 Group unveiled a string of new machine tools and
accessories at the Mach '92 show in May. Fenner unveiled an innovative range
of water-powered motors for fire-fighting and other applications. Posiva has
won its first UK orders for sophisticated gearboxes and couplings for
windmills.
The details, naturally, vary, but for six very different companies there is
broad agreement on the outlook and similar emphasis on the crucial
importance of product development to maintain competitiveness.
BEL
Mr Peter Burton, chief executive of Bloxwich, is feeling mildly optimistic,
although he admits he is 'not terribly thrilled' by current market
conditions.
The optimism stems from the encouraging reception for new products including
door checks and hinges. The company is also seeing benefits from its
investment 12 months ago in new dies in its forge.
Irrespective of the election result, Mr Burton said there had, by necessity,
been some restocking by customers. He would be watching closely in case this
petered out in the autumn.
Over the next six months, he foresaw 'some gentle progress', fuelled
particularly by the introduction of car models, for which Bloxwich is
supplying parts.
SENIOR
Conditions in Senior's engineering products division were 'still very much
the same in general terms,' said Mr John Bell, group chief executive,
although there were some sectors where volume was beginning to improve.
Immediate prospects were improving in the automotive industry, an important
market for Senior, and the company had also picked up contracts in the
construction sector because of the specialist nature of its products.
Broadly, however, Mr Bell did not expect a marked improvement in the UK
market for some considerable time. Dozens of jobs had been cut in the past
three months, and the employment trend could still be downwards, but further
wholesale reductions were not expected.
New product development had increased emphasis on extending the range. 'It's
relatively easier to get 5 per cent of a new market than to get another 5
per cent of a business where you've got a 40 per cent share already,' he
said.
POSIVA
Mr Reg Bricknell, chief executive of this German-owned company, said
first-half turnover had fallen by 18 per cent - 'not bad' - but the company
was having to fight harder in a contracting market.
Mr Bricknell said the company was benefiting from recent refocusing, and
from moves to push the refurbishing side of the business which had improved
considerably in recent months. Although he did not expect a marked
improvement in conditions until next year, he hoped the appointment of two
experienced new salesmen would start to bring a pay-back in the remainder of
this year.
Sales of gears to the textile equipment industry have been flat but Posiva
has scored some successes - last month it said its gears had been chosen by
Smith Engineering for two new textile machines because of novel
characteristics giving precise control of speed, tension and pressure.
JCB
Mr Johnston sees no sign of improvement in the UK market, but remarks that
the government does not, in any case, have much room for manoeuvre on
economic policy. JCB continues to be buoyed by European business, and in
particular the strength of the German market, along with new products that
have helped the company gain market share. 'Everything we've offered we've
got right,' said Mr Johnston.
JCB's new hydraulic crawler-excavators, supplied by Sumitomo of Japan, have
already taken market leadership in the UK and the Staffordshire company's
own new products, such as its updated backhoe-loaders and its Fastrac
high-mobility vehicle, had been well received.
'We'd have been bemoaning our fate had it not been for new product
launches,' he said. Product development times had been trimmed by as much as
18 months with some slick 'simultaneous engineering'. JCB hoped for further
reductions of six to 12 months, bringing the cycle down to two years.
The company took on a total of 140 new employees in the spring, and may have
to trim its temporary workforce if there is no upturn in UK market
conditions.
FENNER
Mr Peter Barker, chairman, saw very little change in the UK market, but
noted that the recession was going on longer than anticipated. As at
Bloxwich, the automotive components business was getting stronger, but the
immediate general outlook was for steady improvement rather than recovery.
The job cuts at Hull, he said, were part of the long-term restructuring of
the UK workforce that had already reduced the headcount by 20 per cent since
the start of the recession.
The benefits from restructuring the cost base would come through when the
upturn arrived.
Meanwhile, the company stands at what Mr Barker calls 'a very exciting
threshold' with its new water hydraulics range.
Its water-powered fire rescue equipment, marketed by Godiva, is attracting
the attention of fire brigades and aviation authorities, and, via
co-operation with other industrial partners and Hull University, Fenner has
emerged as a world leader in using water to work mechanical equipment.
THE 600 GROUP
Amid gloom in the UK machine tool industry, Mr Gaskell saw some signs of
upturn in the US and Australia but no change overall at home. 'In April we
saw a bit of an upturn, but in May it all disappeared again.'
He did not forsee any marked improvement in the UK until real interest rates
came down from their present level of about 6 per cent, because, he said,
'nobody can afford to borrow'.
